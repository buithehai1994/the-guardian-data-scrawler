The side that Guardiola said was a machine for eight years is no more, small wonder he admitted he was lying when he gave them a 1% chance of going through: it was not even that high.Trent Alexander-Arnold rescues point for Liverpool in thriller at Aston VillaRead moreAt the start City needed only one goal. By the time they actually got it, Nico González scoring in the last ­minute after Omar Marmoush’s free‑kick came back off the bar, it meant ­nothing. Which is a pretty good word to describe City, a ghost in this game.The goal was greeted with ironic cheers, fans continuing to laugh at opponents who would have worried them once but which Madrid had played with and pitied. They had certainly taken their foot off the pedal, no need for more. By then City were 3-0 down, 6-2 on aggregate, any hope long gone. In part perhaps, because it had never really been there at all.Real Madrid were superb, con­firming their candidacy for the competition they consider their own. Mbappé does everything so smoothly, with an air of total mastery. Federico Valverde is not a right-back but might be the best right-back there is. Rodrygo, the least celebrated of their front four, ripped another team apart. And that’s just three of them, even the youth-teamer Raúl Asencio picking off City with the pass that started their destruction. Their only bad news on a perfect night that ended tooléswas the yellow card that means Jude Bellingham will miss the first leg of their last-16 tie against Bayer Leverkusen or Atlético Madrid.For City, the only good news is that at least it’s over now. An era surely ends here, or already has. Carlo ­Ancelotti had said he did not want to face them but it was all ­reputation, no reality. Too much has gone wrong for too long and winter surgery could not fix them. This was the team that had conceded four against Paris Saint‑Germain and Sporting, three against Feyenoord, how could they not be beaten by Madrid? Still, they might have hoped to hang on for more than four minutes, the goal that broke the illusion that this was ever going to be a game coming as easy as it did early.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé beats Manchester City’s Josko Gvardiol before scoring Real Madrid’s second goal.Photograph: John Walton/PACity had kept the ball for three minutes from kick-off, while Madrid just stood there as if to say:is that all you got?And then, when they got it for the first time, they scored a goal so simple it was almost ridiculous. Asencio speared the ball over the City defence. Rúben Dias, leaning towards it, let it bounce. John Stones didn’t get there. ­Ederson didn’t get anywhere really. Mbappé watched it sit up and then lifted it easily over the goalkeeper and into the net. Four minutes and it was finished, City showing no belief in anything better.When Josko Gvardiol had a shot blocked by Aurelién Tchouaméni soon after, it was the only time City shot in the first half and it hardly regis­tered.Theyhardly registered in fact. They didn’t even have more of the ball than Madrid; there was nothing there, an empty team drifting through the night, slow and aimless and vulnerable. If Madrid didn’t do more, it was because they didn’t need to. Every time they did put their foot down a bit, they escaped.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mbappé had two shots deflected. Vinícius turned Khusanov so easily on the halfway line. When Gündogan was booked for taking out Rodrygo, it was a portrait of a man who just couldn’t keep up. When at last ­Marmoush was able to run, ­Asencio cut him down. And when Mbappé was again free over the top – this time it was Tchouaméni delivering a lovely dinked pass – and struck at Ederson, it was only a temporary letoff, the second goal following shortly after.Again, it seemed so simple, so unobstructed, Madrid just superior. Vinícius found Rodrygo on the face of the area. Unsure, Khusanov started towards him, stopped, and saw (or didn’t see) the pass go through his legs. Mbappé stepped inside, left Gvardiol on the floor, and finished calmly. City were lost. They needed three goals now; one would have been a start. A single shot would have been something, but no. Instead, it was Madrid who got a third. ­Coming inside, Mbappé guided a clean, low shot beyond Ederson like it was no big deal, which is how the whole thing had felt.There was half an hour left, which was half an hour too long for City who were just being played with. There was one late goal, González’s moment of nothingness, but this match, like City’s season, like City’s team too perhaps, was finished.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridManchester CityKylian Mbappématch reportsShareReuse this content"

We then worked out that the tomb had been flooded. It had been built underneath a waterfall, and it had filled with water at some stage within about six years of the burial.”The remains of the king were taken out through a subsidiary corridor and moved somewhere else, he said. “It was only gradually, as we sifted through all the material – tons and tons of broken limestone – that we discovered these small fragments of alabaster, which named Thutmose II.”The fragments were probably broken when the tomb was moved, he said. “And thank goodness they did actually break one or two things, because that’s how we found out whose tomb it was.”The discovery was made by a joint mission formed by the New Kingdom Research Foundation, a British independent academic foundation, and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, a project affiliated with the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge.Thutmose II was the husband as well as the half-brother of Hatshepsut, one of Egypt’s greatest pharaohs and one of the few women to rule in her own right, and the father of Thutmose III.Litherland told PA media: “This discovery solves a great mystery of ancient Egypt: the location of the tombs of the early 18th dynasty kings. The tomb of this ancestor of Tutankhamun had never been found because it was always thought to be at the other end of the mountain near the Valley of the Kings.”Considering the evidence the contents of the tomb were moved to a second tomb, Mohsen Kamel, assistant field director, said: “The possible existence of a second, and most likely intact, tomb of Thutmose II is an astonishing possibility.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptArchaeologyEgyptologyAfricaHistorynewsShareReuse this content"

His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza. The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah.”The decision came after the connection was exposed in a blogpost by an antisemitism researcher, David Collier, on Tuesday and reported on in the Jewish Chronicle.A group of 45 prominent Jewish journalists and members of the media, including present and formerBBCstaff, signed a letter to the BBC director general, Tim Davie, demanding the documentary be “removed” from iPlayer and questioning whether the film violated Ofcom rules.The signatories to letter include former BBC governor Ruth Deech, Friday Night Dinner and EastEnders actor Tracy-Ann Oberman, Strike producer Neil Blair, former BBC One controller Danny Cohen and former ITV controller of entertainment Claudia Rosencrantz.They say: “Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers.“Can the BBC confirm it will take this action?”The letter, which was also sent to the corporation’s chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, and the BBC News chief executive, Deborah Turness, asked whether it was known to the BBC that Abdullah – “the narrator and principal contributor of the documentary” – is the son of “a senior leader of the proscribed terrorist group Hamas”.The letter asks: “If the BBC was aware that Abdullah Alyazouri was the son of a terrorist leader, why was this not disclosed to audiences during the programme? If the BBC was not aware that Abdullah Alyazouri is the son of a terrorist leader, what diligence checks were undertaken and why did they fail?”The signatories also queried whether Abdullah’s parents had signed a release for him to appear, whether any members of Hamas were paid in connection with the film and whether the film required Hamas’ permission to be made. They also raised concerns about due diligence and audience disclosure.The BBC said in a statement: “We’ve promised our audiences the highest standards of transparency, so it is only right that as a result of this new information, we add some more detail to the film before its retransmission. We apologise for the omission of that detail from the original film.”All of the BBC’s usual compliance procedures in the making of the documentary had been followed, the BBC said: “But we had not been informed of this information by the independent producers when we complied and then broadcast the finished film.”The documentary was produced by production company Hoyo Films, which previously made the BBC documentary,Ukraine: Enemy in the Woods, about the war in Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesBBCTelevisionShareReuse this content"

They secured the critical trekker on to a stretcher and began the challenging descent along with his co-trekker.”The rough terrain and repeated crossings of a rivulet made progress down the mountain extremely slow, and the team took nearly two hours to cover just 100 metres, according to the Tribune. Early on Monday morning, an exhausted first team asked for backup.A second and, eventually, third team of rescuers were sent, local media reported. After what is understood to be a near-20-hour descent, the man in critical condition was taken by ambulance to hospital just after 5pm on Monday, where he was declared dead, the Tribune reported.He has yet to be formally identified.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said on Wednesday: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in India and are in contact with the local authorities.”Last October, a British mountaineer, Fay Manners, and her American companion, Michelle Dvorak, wererescued from the Himalayasthree days after their food, tent and climbing equipment were dragged into a ravine by a rockfall. They had managed to send an SOS message and spent two nights in freezing conditions before being airlifted off the mountain.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaWalkingnewsShareReuse this content"

He was also charged in connection with two separate burglary offences that had taken place the following week at another address on Laburnum Avenue in Blyth.At the Laburnum Avenue break-in, the burglar had forced entry into the house, making off with an array of property, including jewellery and pedal cycles – the majority of which were recovered during a search of Howell’s house after his arrest.He pleaded guilty to all charges at Newcastle crown court in December, and he appeared before the same court this week, where he was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison.The court heard he had 108 previous convictions, including 25 burglaries dating back to 1986.Leading the investigation, DC Jon Mullen of Northumbria police, said: “Burglary is an invasive crime which sadly leaves people feeling unsafe in their own homes.“Howell is a prolific offender who is now facing a lengthy spell behind bars following this sentence.“This case is the latest example which demonstrates the importance of reporting anything suspicious in [your] communities.”He added: “We will continue to act upon these reports and do everything in our power to bring those responsible for offences in our areas before court to face justice.”Explore more on these topicsNorthumberlandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu slipped 4-0 behind before battling back to send the first set into a tie-break but eventually fell to a 7-6 (6), 6-4 defeat.The man who had earlier exhibited “fixated behaviour” towards Raducanu, in the words of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), will be banned from all future WTA events, pending a “threat assessment”.“Thank you for the messages of support,” Raducanu said on Instagram. “Difficult experience yesterday but I’ll be OK and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match. Thank you to Karolina for being a great sport and best of luck to her for the rest of the tournament.”The WTA said it was “actively working with Emma and her team” to provide security to the former US Open champion after the incident and said it was “committed … to maintaining a safe environment for all players”.These were sentiments echoed by the LTA, the governing body of British tennis, which expects to host Raducanu at the HSBC Open this summer, when the women’s game will return to Queen’s Club in west London for the first time in over 50 years.The LTA said in a statement that it had been in contact with Raducanu and promised “extensive” security arrangements for upcoming tournaments in the UK.“This incident once again highlights issues around safety that all players, but female players in particular, can face,” the LTA said. “We have support available for British players and have been in contact with Emma and her team following the events in Dubai.“We have extensive security arrangements at our events in Britain and keep these under constant review. The tours have strong processes in place already and we will continue to work together along with police and security providers to deal with situations like this robustly.”View image in fullscreenKarolina Muchova was praised by Emma Raducanu for ‘being a great sport’ as events off-court unfolded during their match.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesThe WTA’s statement on the incident read: “Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour. This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma’s match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.“Player safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events. The WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support. We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players.”In 2022, Amrit Magar wasgiven a five-year restraining orderand a community service order for stalking Raducanu, who was a teenager at the time, in London.

This week, another Californian reported a different unexpected visitor living in his house’s crawlspace in neighboring Pasadena: another 500 to 600lb bear.“I think it found refuge under the house during the fire, and it’s definitely not moving – that’s its home,” the homeowner, Sean Lorenzini, toldthe Los Angeles Times.California fish and wildlife officials lured the first bear into a trap after a 24-hour odyssey involving peanut butter and a rotisserie chicken, and were able to relocate “Barry” to the nearby Angeles national forest.Lorenzini, who has filed a report of the bear living under his house, is hoping the department can do the same for him. A spokesperson for the department of fish and wildlife told theLos AngelesTimes that the agency was aware of the Pasadena bear and working on a response.When a bear is in a crawlspace, fish and wildlife officials “recommend that homeowners contact the department so that a wildlife professional can evaluate the situation and help determine ways that the homeowner can discourage the bear from using the crawlspace and seal the entrance immediately once the animal is out”, the department said in apost about the Altadena bear.In the meantime, Lorenzini says the bear seems at ease, raiding the neighbors’ trash can for food, soaking up the California sun by his pool and terrorizing the neighbor’s pet goat.Although life for Lorenzini is a little less comfortable since his enormous roommate moved in. The Pasadena homeowner is trying to repair his house in the wake of southern California’s most destructive wildfires, and his basement resident has made plumbers reluctant to visit the property.Black bears – the only species of bear living in California – frequently stumble into the Los Angeles communities along the edge of the Angeles national forest, including those such as Altadena and Pasadena that were ravaged by the deadly Eaton fire.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

In 2017, California registered 28 bear sightings in Los Angeles county.

Bears are not only seeking food and water, but the black bear population in California also grew significantly after the extinction of the state’s grizzly bear population in the 1920s.As humans fled the Eaton wildfire, it’s likely that bears and other wildlife did the same – like the bear Lorenzini believes took shelter under his house. After the 2018 Woolsey fire, researchers at the University of California Los Angelesdocumentedhigh rates of Malibu mountain lions killed by drivers as they too tried to escape the burn zone.While California black bears are notably non-confrontational – and have only killed one person in recorded history, ina 2023 incident– fish and wildliferecommendsCalifornia homeowners prepare for increasing bear encounters by closing crawl spaces “with bear-proof material in advance of winter months to discourage bears from denning and damaging property”.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaAnimalsWest CoastLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, one year after he lost power to his leftwing rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,Bolsonaro was banned from seeking officefor eight years for peddling disinformation about Brazil’s electronic voting system. That decision by electoral authorities scuppered Bolsonaro’s plans for a Donald Trump-like revival in the next presidential election, in 2026, and has already sparked a slow-burn war of succession between rightwing pretenders jostling to claim his crown.Potential heirs include the governors of two of Brazil’s richest states, São Paulo and Minas Gerais, Tarcísio de Freitas and Romeu Zema;a country singer with 45 million followers on Instagram called Gusttavo Lima; and Bolsonaro’s wife, the photogenic evangelical Christian Michelle Bolsonaro.Bolsonaro’s politician son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon recently hailed as “the future president of Brazil”, has also thrown his hat into the ring.Calejon believed the accusations against Bolsonaro would accelerate that succession struggle, as conservative voters and leaders accepted that the future of Brazil’s most influential rightwing leader almost certainly lay behind bars. If convicted, the 69-year-old politician could face a jail sentence of more than 40 years.Brazil’s former secretary of justice, the lawyer Augusto de Arruda Botelho, believed the charges against the ex-president were “very robust” and clearly placed Bolsonaro in “a leadership position” of the alleged plot to stop Lula taking power after his election win by staging a coup.The supreme court will now consider whether to accept the charges – something widely seen as a foregone conclusion – and whether to launch criminal proceedings that would see Bolsonaro stand trial. Botelho said the case was likely to be heard by a group of five supreme court judges although it was hard to predict how long the whole process might take. “This isn’t something that’s going to be over and done with in the next few months … In my experience, it’s unlikely this will all be finished in 2025,” Botelho said.However long the process takes, there is a striking contrast between Bolsonaro’s miserable outlook and the triumphant political fightback of his ally Trump, who shrugged off allegations that he conspired to overturn the 2020 US election – and last month reclaimed power.Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian research center Cebrap, believed part of the explanation for their drastically different fates was that Brazil’s judiciary had “truly managed to act in defense of democracy”, through the supreme court’s pursuit of those involved in anti-democratic acts. In the US, Rocha argued, “the institutions failed to prevent a politician who openly supported an insurrection from moving forwards with his [presidential] candidacy”.Botelho believed Brazil’s judiciary had shown itself to be more “solid” and “reliable” than the US system, which was “more susceptible to the political zeitgeist”. “The [Brazilian] supreme court has sought to punish coup plotters and in doing so to defend the democratic rule of law – and it has done a very good job of this,” he said.With Trump back in the White House, some fear the US president may seek to pressure Brazilian authorities over Bolsonaro. “I can’t say exactly how, or exactly when. But it’s safe to say that Trumpism will try to push for Jair Bolsonaro’s situation to be reversed,” said Calejon.On Wednesday morning, just hours after charges against Bolsonaro were announced, there was the first hint of possible retaliation from Trump’s camp. The New York Times reported thatthe US president’s media company was suing the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes– one of the authorities pro-Bolsonaro plotters stand accused of plotting to assassinate – for alleged acts of censorship against rightwing social media networks.Some wonder whether the US might offer Bolsonaro sanctuary at its embassy in the capital, Brasília. Others suspect, given Bolsonaro’s ties to Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, that the ex-president might try to hide in Hungary’s diplomatic compound in the hope that an ally wins the 2026 election and offers him a get-out-of-jail card in the form of amnesty.“Trump is so completely unpredictable and behaves like a lunatic with such frequency that I just don’t know if he’d be capable of offering shelter to someone who has been formally accused of a crime and whose name … should be on Interpol’s wanted list,” said Calejon.For now though one thing was certain: Bolsonaro had taken a major step towards jail. “What has happened is utterly historic,” Calejon said, “and has the potential to be a watershed moment in Brazilian politics.”Additional reporting by Tiago RogeroExplore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Ground forces would be minimal and not deployed near the frontline in the east ofUkraine.Among the aims of the force would be to ensure the safe reopening of Ukraine’s airspace to commercial flights and to maintain the security of seaborne trade over the Black Sea, critical to the country’s food and grain exports.Why Europe’s defence spending may need a bold new approachRead moreUkraine’s electricity and other utilities have been repeatedly bombed by Russia during the near-three-year war, and maintaining their integrity is also deemed critical to the recovery of the country if the conflict is brought to a close.It is unclear whether a force that is relatively small in number would be supported by Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,has called for the creation of a deterrence force 100,000-150,000 strong, which involves the US.However, last week, Pete Hegseth, the new US secretary of defence, said “there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine”.The size of European militaries remains modest, meaning that any postwar security effort would have to be in the low tens of thousands and focused on areas of technological superiority.US ‘backstop’ vital to deter future Russian attacks on Ukraine, says StarmerRead moreA precondition of the European plan, however, would also be a US commitment to a “backstop” which, though not spelled out in detail is likely, one official said, to be “biased towards air power and the extraordinary strength we have in air power”. Such operations could be based in Poland and Romania, they added.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, is due to fly out to Washington next week to lobby the US president, Donald Trump, directly and persuade him to agree to providing a backstop that would ensure the European “reassurance force” would not be challenged by Russia in the future. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is also due to visit Washington next week.Russia, meanwhile, has said publicly it objects to any Nato country deploying in Ukraine in the event of an end to the war. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday that Nato forces under any other flag would be “unacceptable to us”.Western officials emphasised on Wednesday that there was little or no appetite to place European forces in the east of Ukraine, where they could be attacked in Russian provocations, reflecting the policy of the previous three years to ensure there was no escalation of the war into fighting between Nato and Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the US arms tend to be of a higher quality, the experts added.“Kit is still going in,” an official emphasised. They said there were enough arms available to “keep Ukraine in the fight well beyond some of the conversations about what might emerge in terms of ceasefire negotiations”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineFranceEuropeRussiaShareReuse this content"

I was scared to hug him too tight because he’s so skinny and emaciated. I was almost scared that I was going to break him if I hugged him too hard. But I hugged him, kissed him, told him I loved him,” Brisley told the Guardian.“One of the first things he said to me was: ‘I’m so sorry.’ It’s a mark of the man that he’s such a family man that his first thoughts were making sure I’m OK and expressing condolences to me.“Physically, it’s really upsetting to see. Obviously he’s being well looked after in the hospital, trying to get his weight back up and seeing what long-term damage, if any, has been caused. But mentally he’s so strong. He was telling me that he never doubted that he would come out, not for a second. He promised Lianne and the girls that he would be back, that he would come back.

In Jamie Lloyd’s 1990s clubland twist on Shakespeare, the ushers are doing it before the curtain has even gone up. It is a sign of things to come, along with the throwback soundtrack and the giddy swirl of disco lights.Taylor Dayne’s Tell It to My Heart kicks off proceedings and a shower of pink confetti rains down. This is a thoroughly weird and absolutely wonderful re-conceptualisation, turning Shakespeare’s comedy, which narrowly swerves tragedy, into an old school house party cum modern romcom.More musical than play, the interludes of song and dance are sometimes abrupt – from Beastie Boys to Deee-Lite and Backstreet Boys. The dated sound might be a nod to the play’s older couple, Beatrice and Benedick, played by Hayley Atwell andTom Hiddleston, who are veteran singletons before being tricked into admitting their love for each other.Hiddleston and Atwell have a sparring chemistry that is as bright as the modern-day costumes (all pink spangles, gold shimmer and sequins). You can virtually see the sparks coming off them in their “merry war”, which is fuelled by antagonistic duelling but dips suddenly to earnestness and intensity.Every other element works alongside them, with the drink (and drug?) addled hedonism on stage not compromising Shakespeare’s verse.View image in fullscreenNever losing her power … Mara Huf as Hero in Much Ado About Nothing.Photograph: Marc BrennerMost of the cast here worked on Lloyd’s previous West End show,The Tempest, including Mara Huf and James Phoon, who again play a couple in love as Hero and Claudio, along with a fey Tim Steed as Don John, and several others. That show met with mostly negative reviews. This seems like The Tempest’s revenge in its determined infectiousness – genuinely funny, romantic and trimmed of the laboured subplot involving tiresome Dogberry.It has the same creative team too in set designer, Soutra Gilmour (bringing similarly dark depths around the stage), lighting by Jon Clark (disco lights galore) and sound by Ben and Max Ringham. Movement director, Fabian Aloise, creates lovably cheesy dance routines and the overall effect combines into hallucinatory revelry.Mason Alexander Park, who stole the show as a lugubrious Ariel in The Tempest, plays Hero’s attendant, Margaret, but they are key to the soundtrack of the play with their gorgeous intermittent singing.The masquerade ball features plushy headdresses (from Tweety Pie to a mini-octopus); they are silly and humorous but return through the production to look more disturbingly psychedelic – like an acid trip gone wrong.The switch from light to dark, when Hero is falsely accused of unfaithfulness on her wedding day by Claudio, is orchestrated with a masterful precision of tone. It brings dangerous anger, and where the scene ordinarily shows up the play’s dated gender politics – a man questioning the virtue of a woman and condemning her to metaphoric death – Hero never loses her power and the couple’s reunion seems genuine and joyful.View image in fullscreenKey to the soundtrack … Mason Alexander Park.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe visible mechanics of the stage – from lights to bare back wall and a row of chairs for actors to sit when they are not performing – are customary features in Lloyd’s shows, but there is something magical in it here: they come downstage to perform notatus buttous, making eye contact, pointing at us individually as they speak of love and attraction.There is a meta moment too, in Beatrice and Benedick’s romance when they meet cardboard cut-outs of each other’s Marvel superheroes (both have starred in the Hollywood franchise). Benedick worships at the cardboard altar of Atwell’s Captain Carter while Beatrice dances suggestively with Hiddleston’sLoki.The latter is certainly god of mischief here, pulling off difficult physical comedy involving confetti in the eavesdropping scene when he is tricked into his romance, and pulling out some nifty dance moves (Atwell pulls out her own, too). Both wink and flirt with the audience without deviating from Shakespeare’s text “I am loved of all ladies,” says Hiddleston and the auditorium roars in confirmation.Lloyd himself seems like the god of mischief in constructing this party of pink silliness. You would have to be a god of stone to not be seduced by its wacky winter joy. A wonderfully giddy thing indeed, and that is my conclusion.AtTheatre Royal Drury Lane, London, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreMuch Ado About NothingJamie LloydTom HiddlestonHayley AtwellreviewsShareReuse this content"

The new RSCHamlet, unusually, has a tie-in cruise. The programme advertises a collaboration between the theatre company and Cunard: seven days on the Queen Mary 2 “putting the power of Shakespeare to sea”.Which is the course on which director Rupert Goold sets the court of Elsinore. His version takes place entirely on a sort of Royal Yacht Scandinavia during what seems to be a honeymoon cruise for Claudius and Gertrude. A ship of state, this is also, metaphorically, a ship of fools.The budget really pushes the boat out. A roiling wake of waves down-stage (video design: Akhila Krishnan) makes the play seem to be sailing towards us, while a monumental deck (designer: Es Devlin) sometimes violently lurches: in the climactic duels, poisons may not be necessary as sea sickness threatens to do for Hamlet and Laertes.This bold concept, though, is justified by Hamlet being such a coastal play. Four characters are put to sea (in this version, corpses also get a naval burial) and fear is expressed at the number of “shipwrights” working in Norway to prepare its invasion of Denmark.View image in fullscreenStudent-cool … Luke Thallon’s Hamlet.Photograph: Marc BrennerCleverly, the word “bough” in the original is heard, in this context, as “bow.” Elsewhere, Goold and dramaturg Rebecca Latham tinker to render speeches sea-worthy: “chamber” becomes cabin, “earth” is overtaken by “sea”. Ingenuity is required to explain why Yorick’s skull is not in the drink with the rest of him and the biggest loss is Gertrude’s haunting speech about Ophelia’s river death. Here, she just goes over the edge.Where, it must be acknowledged, many Shakespeare purists will follow her. But, with the RSC economically required to stage the major plays in quick rotation, each iteration should surely be significantly different. Apart from the off-shore setting, bold ideas include the novel suggestion – via a red digital onstage clock, “witching hour” signalled as 00:00 – that the whole play takes place during one long night.And, unlike in some opera productions, high-concept never cramps performances that would grace any staging. Luke Thallon’s Hamlet, student-cool and with an alternative-comedian vibe, plays against the speeding clock, notably taking his time. Pauses before and during the great soliloquies make the words about death and revenge sound newly thought-out and forced-out rather than learned by schoolchildren for hundreds of years.Hamlet Hail to the Thief: Thom Yorke revisits Radiohead album for Shakespeare showRead moreJared Harris’s Claudius exudes the sexual and political ruthlessness of a man willing to kill for a crown and to keep it, and Nancy Carroll, with typical poetic intelligence, captures the growing guilt of having betrayed both son and husband. Elliot Levey’s Polonius is strikingly more dapper diplomat than the standard windbag. The unravelling of Nia Towle’s Ophelia has a clinical reality that adds another layer to debate over whether Hamlet’s descent is pretended. And, whereas every Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (or vice versa) are shadowed by the Stoppard spin-off, Chase Brown and Tadeo Martinez find undiscovered country as preppy Americans who must have met Hamlet on a scholarship.There will be questions about whether Goold should have gone to sea or not to sea but – for its vivid atmosphere and intelligence – this is a must-see. Traditionalists are warned that the RSC will also soon launch aShakespeare-Radiohead mashup, Hamlet: Hail to the Thief.At the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHamletRoyal Shakespeare CompanyWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

But a new university film course run in partnership with a donkey sanctuary is hoping to rehabilitate the animal’s reputation.Thefilm studies module at the University of Exeter, which began this term, explores how the portrayal of donkeys in films has affected public attitudes towards them.The course leaders contend that the way in which the donkey’s traits have been hijacked by contemporary media to represent human symbols or meanings – the stubborn, the stupid, the indolent – is unfair.“This is problematic,” said Dr Benedict Morrison, senior lecturer and co-lead of the module in Exeter’s department of communications, drama and film, which also explores how donkeys have been portrayed in fables and fairytales, religious narratives, and documentaries. “What we lose is the donkeyness of the donkeys, and indeed the specific personality of the individual donkey.”In an attempt to redress this, students will create video essays based on their interactions with and observations of the animals atthe Donkey Sanctuaryin Sidmouth, Devon, which has partnered with the university to run the course.Dr Faith Burden, deputy chief executive of the sanctuary, said negative portrayals of donkeys dated back to Aesop’s Fables, in which the animal is usually a figure of mockery, and were further popularised by Shakespeare, such as with the character of Bottom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.“I think they have absolutely set people’s perceptions that donkeys are melancholic, stubborn and not very intelligent, which is anything but the truth,” said Burden.More recent depictions, such as themelancholic Eeyorein the Winnie-the-Pooh books, might be true for some individual animals, but do not “depict the joy and fun and enjoyment and happiness that a donkey can also experience”, she added.Dr Fiona Handyside, fellow co-lead of the module, said it was inspired by recent more realistic depictions of donkeys in films suchEO, which won the jury prize at the 2022 Cannes festivals, andThe Banshees of Inisherin.She had also questioned why Colin Farrell’s tribute to Jenny the donkey, his character Pádraic’s closest companion, during his acceptance speech for the best actor award at the 2023 Gold Globes was largely greeted as a joke.“I thought, why would Farrell not be grateful to his co-star with whom he has delivered the performance of his career? The meaning and the emotional weight of that film is carried partly through [their] relationship.”Handyside said the module was similarly a serious attempt to “embark on some kind of inter-species collaborative project to think differently about the entangled relationships, not just between humans and donkeys, but between humans and the environment”.Thestudents’ visits to the donkey sanctuarybrought them “literally face-to-face with the reality of donkeys as individual, thinking, living, sentient beings”, she added.This helped them to explore the dynamics of companionship with animals, and whether it is possible to make films and undertake research that is not solely centred on the human perspective.“It’s just so incredible when you walk into a barn and Jake, who’s a very confident donkey, trots happily up to you and nudges you because he really wants his bottom scratched,” said Handyside.“We were so privileged with the way the sanctuary framed the visit for us in this incredibly enabling way that really allowed the students to grapple with, actually, what does it mean ethically, sensually, to engage with donkeys?”Benedict added that they were aware the module might attract ridicule and insisted that it was rooted in rigorous engagements with philosophy, theory, and behavioural training at the sanctuary. “The students have not been having an easy ride of it.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hot on the tail of excluding Ukraine from the first round of peace talks with Russia and in effect threatening to withdraw the US from Nato, the Donald has now suggested it was Kyiv who started the war with Moscow.More than that, he declared President Zelenskyy’s popularity ratings had slid to just 4% in his own country and that he had assumed the role of dictator by not holding elections. He ended by claiming that the US had given more than three times as much aid toUkrainethan the rest of Europe combined. You could almost hear Vladimir Putin cheering from the sidelines. He couldn’t have written the script any better. It was perfection.It goes without saying that everything the US president had said was complete doggy-bollox. Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014 and seized Crimea. There was then a pause in hostilities before Putin invaded a second time almost exactly three years ago.Claiming Ukraine started the war was like believing that Poland invaded Germany to trigger the second world war. Or maybe the Poles were just suffering from false consciousness and were yet to understand they wanted to be subjugated by the Germans. Hell, maybe Trump thinks “no means no” is just some politically correct wokery and that when the Ukrainians said they would rather not become Russian what they were really saying was: “Yes, please. Do what you like.” Much like the Americans were gagging for the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor in 1941.That was just the start. Trump’s claim that Zelenskyy’s approval ratings were 4% were just his delusional, senescent fantasies. The real figure is 57%: about 10% higher than the Donald’s own. And no one in their right mind is suggesting Ukraine holds elections while the war is ongoing. There again, Trump is clearly not in his right mind. His aid figures are also way off. Collectively, Europe has given Ukraine £132bn since the start of the war. America has given £114bn.While a shrink would have a field day trying to untangle the workings of the Trump psyche – is he a narcissist or solipsist? Does he actually believe what he says or do his words have an independent existence to his brain? – it’s left to the rest of us to pick up the pieces. Much as they might like not to, other world leaders have to find a way of engaging with him. The Donald is the most powerful man on the planet and whatever he says counts for something.So spare a thought for junior minister Diana Johnson, who found herself scheduled to do the morning media round for the government. She had hoped she would be called on to talk about the latest knife crime initiative but found herself asked about Trump’s latest dangerous ramblings. You could almost hear the panic in her voice. Whatever you do, don’t criticise the president. Just say it’s all very interesting but Ukraine must be involved in its own peace negotiations. She just about got away with it as the presenters took pity on her. They appreciated her dilemma.The strangest response came fromBoris Johnson. With Kemi Badenoch and other senior Tories strangely silent, the disgraced former prime minister popped up on X to offer his analysis. Trump was just doing his best to end the war. No one cared more about peace than the Donald. The US president had never meant for anyone to take him seriously about Ukraine starting the war or Zelenskyy’s popularity ratings. It was just his way of trying to get everyone round the table. His funny little ways. As with Boris, Trump could only be trusted to tell the truth half the time. The trick was trying to work out which half was which.Boris ended his tweet by suggesting that Russia was desperate to have its assets unfrozen so it could hand them over to rebuild Ukraine. To think, Johnson used to consider himself Ukraine’s biggest ally. Right now, he sounded suspiciously as if he had morphed into another Kremlin sycophant. He will certainly be off Zelenskyy’s Christmas card list.You might have half expected Johnson to have pitched up at the third and last day of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship conference at the ExCeL centre in London. He would have fitted right in. A deeply unserious man for deeply serious times. ARC seems to exist in its own ecosphere, cocooned from the real world. So much so, they seem to be a year behind the rest of us. None of them has realised that their man is now calling the shots on wokery from the White House. They prefer to be the victim. On the outside looking in.Any discussion on the most important issues of the day, like the war in Ukraine, appeared to have been kept off the schedule. Just speaker after speaker congratulating themselves on saying the unsayable, apparently unaware that no one was stopping them saying anything. If you want to understand the importance of free speech, ask Alexei Navalny. Except you can’t.But even all the endless complaints about political correctness came with a heavily sanitised air. No one was allowed to raise a voice of disagreement. Just endless self-congratulation. There weren’t many female speakers anyway, but those who were invited seemed happy to accept their role in the new world order was simply to produce more children. A man got a standing ovation for fathering 10 children. And how did Dougie Murray, a gay man, feel about Jordan Peterson describing homosexuality as a deviation?This felt very much a day for the B-list speakers. First up was the deeply unpleasant Konstantin Kisin, who this week had suggested Rishi Sunak was not English on his Triggernometry podcast. Er… he was born in Southampton. Presumably Kisin thinks Kemi is also not English. But KK wasn’t here to repeat that line; he was just there to make a couple of mildly racist jokes and wallow in his own imagined brilliance. Onanism par excellence.Then we had Toby Young. Or, as we should now call him, the anti-establishment Lord Young. I’m surprised some peers haven’t given up their titles in protest. He was there to wang on about free speech and how hard done by he has been. You can say what you like, Toby. Just don’t expect congratulations for it. He rather undermined his whole point by admitting there was a law protecting free speech after all.Others came and went. Eric Weinstein suggested we should defy physics and live on the stars. Nice work if you can get it. The closest we had to a big name was Vivek Ramaswamy. Though we managed to get through the entire interview without him being asked why he had accepted Trump’s invitation to jointly head up “Doge” and his subsequent falling out with Elon Musk. At which point the last remaining particle of credibility ARC may have had left the conference centre. It had been that sort of a day.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchUkraineUS foreign policyBoris JohnsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Who can resist three Maga men shooting the breeze about the size of Elon’s space rockets?The commander-in-chief and oligarch-in-chiefsat side by sidelike a breathless young couple announcing their engagement on live TV. Trump wore a blue suit, white shirt and blue tie; Musk wore a T-shirt saying “tech support” under a black jacket. The orangeness of Trump’s face threw the paleness of Musk’s complexion into sharp relief and vice versa.Trump blames Ukraine over war with Russia, saying it could have made a dealRead moreMusk, the Tesla, SpaceX and X supremo who recently tweeted he loves Trump “as much as a straight man can love another man”, confirmed he is indeed mad about the boy. “Well, I love the president,” he said. “I just want to be clear about that.”Sounding like he empathises, Hannity asked: “You love the president?”Musk said: “I think President Trump is a good man.”Trump was moved, like a man whose wife has not said that in many a long year. He interjected: “That’s the way he said that. You know, there’s something nice about.”Musk went on: “The president has been so unfairly attacked in the media. It’s truly outrageous. And I’ve spent a lot of time with the president and not once have I seen him do something that was mean or cruel or – or wrong. Not once.”Last monthTrump exploited a deadly plane crashto blame his predecessors’s efforts to include people of colour in the federal workforce, but OK. Hannity took his chance to outdo Musk by boasting that he has known the president for 30 years and never known anyone deal with so much adversity, culminating in two assassination attempts.Musk acknowledged that the first shooting, when a bullet grazed Trump’s ear at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, accelerated his decision to endorse Trump’s re-election bid. The president sounded like a fiancee learning a sweet secret about their first date.“Nice”, Trump said: “I didn’t know that.”Musk added: “Yeah, it just – it sped it up, but I was going to do it anyway.”Like Romeo and Juliet, these star-crossed lovers are tragically misunderstood, in this case by vile media. “They want a divorce,” Hannity declared. “They want you two to start hating each other. And they try – ‘Oh, President Elon Musk’, for example. You do know that they’re doing that to you?”Trump concurred. “Actually, Elon called me. He said: ‘You know they’re trying to drive us apart.’ I said: ‘Absolutely’.”Then Hannity sounded like Oprah Winfrey interviewing Meghan and Harry. He said: “I want people to know the relationship and know more about you. What is the relationship, Mr President?”Trump replied: “Well, I respect him. I’ve always respected him. I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I’m usually pretty good at this stuff. He did Starlink. He did things that were so advanced and nobody knew what the hell they were.”He went on: “I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby.

No, we can’t.Musk went on to mock “Trump derangement syndrome”, recalling how, at a friend’s birthday party in Los Angeles, he mentioned the president’s name, “and it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained, like, the methamphetamine and rabies”.Some would say that fate is preferable to the hour of television that Fox News served up in prime time, a desperate attempt to justify Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, currentlylaying waste to the federal government.

It is satirical, polemical, infuriated at the greedy and reactionary mediocrities in charge in his native land and wobbling on an unstable cusp between hope and despair. Likehis previous film Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World(whose lead actor Ilinca Manolache appears briefly in cameo here), Jude takes aim at bad faith and bad taste and takes us on what is almost a kind of architectural tour of Romanian malaise – this time in Cluj – in which he shows us the racism, nationalism, and a pointless obsession in the country’s governing classes with real estate and property development as a kind of universal aspiration. The movie closes with an acid montage of seedy public housing juxtaposed with gated private estates. And like the previous film, there is a repeated visual trope of a woman driving in a car, shown in profile, driving, driving, driving, looking for something – anything.Kontinental ’25 is loosely inspired by Roberto Rossellini’s Europa ’51, in which Ingrid Bergman’s character is radicalised by a tragedy in her own life – a poster for this is shown in one scene in which our heroine is getting drunk in a cinema bar. Eszter Tompa plays Orsolya, a former law professor who has apparently lost her job and now humiliatingly works as a bailiff. She is now tasked with evicting a homeless, depressed man holed up in the squalid basement of an apartment building bought by a German property firm who intend to raze it to the ground and replace it with a luxury boutique hotel called the Kontinental (a building much bigger than the original and clearly conceived with minimal interest in the existing architectural forms).This man, Ion (Gabriel Spahiu) is to be seen at first wandering chaotically through the city in various locations that we will come to recognise when other characters wander through them as well. Overwhelmed with despair at the bailiff’s appearance Ion takes his own life and Orsolya is stricken with guilt of a strangely neurotic kind; tearfully asking friends and colleagues if she was morally at fault, clearly expecting and receiving the answer no. She is further aghast to learn that the homeless man was a Romanian former Olympic athlete fallen on hard times and so, as an ethnic Hungarian, she may well be abused in the right-wing press for having driven this tragic patriot to his death. (She has already been abused online for having evicted some student radicals from a squat.)So Orsolya refuses to go on a booked holiday with her husband and children; they go off without her and she instead goes on a midlife crisis tour of the city, having anguished encounters with everyone she knows, in a series of two-shot dialogue scenes, asking them for … what? Understanding? Absolution? She doesn’t quite have the dignity of Ingrid Bergman but an old friend wryly sympathises – noting that incidentally the Romanians stole Cluj and Transylvania from the Austrian-Hungarian empire. Orsolya’s elderly mother manages to steer the conversation around to how thoroughly admirable she considers Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and when Orsolya indignantly calls Orban a fascist, her mother throws her out, calling her a “whore”. She then gets drunk with one of her old law students who is working as a food delivery cyclist with a sign on his back saying “I’m Romanian” because racist drivers will run over the Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans doing this job. After having alfresco sex with him, Orsolya talks earnestly to a priest who assures her that suicide is a terrible sin for the individual themselves and no one else is responsible.It is a bizarre, clamorous tour of anxiety, disclosing a panorama of indifference, of dyspeptic lack of interest in the idea that other people’s suffering (or wellbeing) is of the smallest significance or interest. It’s not an easy watch, but Jude’s film-making has such energy and punch.Kontinental ’25 screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomaniaEuropeBerlin film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But check the schedules and you’ll notice there are only three episodes of Modern Life Is Goodish. What happened? The answer lies in the sort of low-key calamity that feels veryDave Gorman.“We made four,” the comedian explains. “But one of them is 75% about Gregg Wallace. It’s in the bin.” This lost, cursed Goodish episode was filmed and finished just as news broke that Wallace, a presenter on BBC1’s hit cookery show MasterChef, was the subject of multipleaccusations of inappropriate behaviour– which he has denied – instantly cancelling the cult hero status Goodish was drawing on. “It’s sort of taking the piss out of him but in a very loving way, tongue in cheek,” says Gorman. “There’s a routine that sets up the idea that I’ve invented a product. I need to get a celebrity endorsement for it. The punchline tying all the routines together is that he’s filmed an advert for it.”Frantic meetings were held to try to salvage the episode by removing all mentions of Wallace, but the task was hopeless. “It’s a structured piece with a flow to it. Every routine connects to every other routine.” He can’t resist a joke: “What I’m saying is: I’m the real victim.”I get angry tweets from people who think they have intuited my politics: ‘Another one of you lefty remainers’Gorman pivoted away from regular standup in the early 2000s with the true-life odysseysAre You Dave Gorman?(adapted into the TV series The Dave Gorman Collection) andGooglewhack Adventure, both based on his obsession with pinning down the quirkiest elements of life. In Modern Life Is Goodish, he pours that same curiosity into what amounts to a series of comedy PowerPoint presentations: armed with a clicker and a big screen for showing screengrabs, photos and videos, Gorman hunts for oddities, riffing off them before tying them into ingenious comic bundles that suggest our smallest eccentricities are all gloriously connected.In the episodes that have made it to air, the new season sees Gorman talk about everything from annoying packaging to his online critics, from bad magicians to obscure telly. One lecture mines for gold in the workings of a company that rents out meeting “pods” in unlikely locations, apparently with limited success; another locates wonder in the logical inconsistencies in Brian Conley’s guest introductions in the mid-2010s daytime BBC series The TV That Made Me, a segment that becomes pureTV Burpwhen Conley himself appears and reprises his old routines. “I love TV Burp!” says Gorman. “I’ll take that as a huge compliment.”Airing from 2013, Goodish originally ran for five seasons and was a big hit for Dave – the channel, that is – with audiences hitting 1.5 million. Then, when it seemed the perennially check-shirted Gorman had found the perfect vehicle for his singular brand of optimism and exasperation, it ended. “We stopped because I used to work 100 hours a week for nine months of the year,” Gorman says, talking in a bookshop cafe in London. “Which I did very happily. But at some point you say, ‘I have a kid, I’d like to be at home.’ It isn’t sustainable.”View image in fullscreen‘Have an hour off’ … Dave Gorman in Modern Life Is Goodish.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/UKTV, AvalonHaving paused Modern Life when his son Eric was two, Gorman had some enforced time off due to Covid, before returning to live work: his shows have been PowerPoint-based for a while now, which made it easier to bring Modern Life back. “I did two tours in those seven years. So there was a store of material that hadn’t been on telly. But also, somebody had the smart idea: we don’t need eight episodes. How about a smaller number?”It’s now perhaps a more playful, not so political show, with less railing against exploitative or idiotic corporate practices. Not that Modern Life has ever really sought to right big wrongs. “I never overtly talk politics on stage,” Gorman says. “I said to the producers when we first sat down for series one: if there’s something I really care about and I have a point to make, you’ve got to steer me away from it because the audience sniff sincerity and it stops being funny. But then I get angry tweets from people who have intuited my politics, and they don’t agree with them. ‘Another one of you lefty remainers’ – point me to the bit where I said that! I think what you’ve done is, there’s hopefully a kindness in it, and you’ve extrapolated from kindness and arrived at a worldview that you disagree with. That’s … weird.”But modern life has changed in the seven years for which Modern Life Is Goodish has been away: everything feels political now, and darker with it. Does Gorman worry that people have lost their ability to find joy in trivial things? “I don’t want that to be the case, for obvious, selfish reasons. There’s two things you can do with that: you can do comedy about it, making those difficult points and confronting people with that truth head on … or you can have an hour off. That’s also healthy. Even the person who has the truest moral compass, who is aware of all the inequities in life, gets pissed off when their train is late.”Modern Life Is Goodish, however, approaches the arcane with considerable rigour. Gorman is not like other standups who tell anecdotes on stage that they have fairly obviously invented for the purpose: “I can’t do that. I’m not a very good liar. Which my wife is delighted about.” Instead, he embodies the cliche “it’s funny because it’s true”: if he says something has happened, you know it really has when he brings up the next slide and lets you see for yourself. “Part of what I do is provide the evidence, so there has to be an underlying truth. There’s something great about knowing that that thing you’re finding funny is out there in the real world for anyone to discover. Then, the world’s a bit more magic.”While Gorman was away, he found a new source of magic: as well as being a comedian, he is now a professional compiler of cryptic crosswords. Gorman is Bluth in the Independent (in Gaelic, “Gorm” is “blue” and “An” is “the”) and Django in the Daily Telegraph (David James Gorman = D, J an’ Go).In the Guardian, his setter pseudonym is Fed. “Feds in America are also called G-men. And there are two or three people who would call me ‘G-man’.” Crossword-setting has taken a back seat now that Gorman is back on TV, but before then he was setting a grid a week. “At one point if you’d asked my boy what I do for a living, he’d say, ‘He sets crosswords.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are penny-drop moments when you’re solving that will make you smile. You’re in company with the setter: it’s playful and teasing and when you realise what someone’s doing, it can make you … maybe notlaugh, but there’s an enjoyable emotional response.”As a setter, Gorman is known for being able to create a fluent, pleasing “surface”, which is the term the cryptic community uses to describe the literal meaning of the sentence. Clues are not obliged to make sense, but it’s a bonus if they do. He recalls setting a clue where the answer was “Ernest Hemingway”, and the cryptic part of the clue was “Eagles on the smallest golf course” [ernes/the/min/g/way].“That’s a legitimate sentence you can make out of the elements of the name Ernest Hemingway. That’s just the coincidence of the world and that’s beautiful. It was always there.” Fans of Modern Life will see the parallel: Gorman regularly turns up happenstances that are almost unbelievable, but are real and have been waiting to be found. “That synchronicity makes the world nicer. I think the world’s fucking great.”Even the world we live in now? “Yes. Obviously loads of it is shit. But it’s also the only one we’ve got, so you might as well enjoy the stuff that’s amazing.”Modern Life Is Goodishis on U&Dave from 24 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDave GormanTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The writer-director Osgood Perkins, who scored a hit with last year’sLonglegs, knows more about it than most. His father, the actor Anthony Perkins, died of Aids when Osgood was 18 and then his mother, the actor and model Berry Berenson, died in the September 11 attacks as a passenger on Flight 11. Perkins has found a way to work through something so unimaginably awful with a career as a horror film-maker, and his latest, focused on twins cursed by generational trauma is his most obviously personal film yet.The Gorge review – guarding hellish monsters is aphrodisiac in silly horrorRead moreTo his credit, Perkins has chosen not to wallow in the grim dirge associated with trauma and the horror genre. The original script for The Monkey had apparently delivered its central conceit – a toy monkey that brings death to those around it – with a straight face, something he found to be discordant, insisting a lighter, comedy-over-horror makeover. But the humour here is far too smug and nihilistic, similar to the grating can-you-believe-we’re-doing-this swagger of the Deadpool series, so happy with itself that it doesn’t really care if anyone else is smiling too. The film has a juvenile middle-finger-up attitude that confuses broad fuck-the-world misanthropy for actual edginess, annoying enough for a scene but close to insufferable for an entire movie. It’s also a tone that doesn’t really work for a King adaptation and when a flash of his earnestness does shine through, it’s uncomfortably out of place, providing more of a jolt than any of the ineffective death scenes which rely on brash and empty Looney Tunes violence. If the aim is numbing us to the shock of a violent death then perhaps the film succeeds but surely we shouldn’t be quite so bored by it too.The film begins as the monkey has already been causing havoc, a bloodied, end-of-tether father (a cameo-ingAdam Scott) desperately trying to offload it. After he bolts, leaving his twin sons (Christian Convery on double duty) with their mother (Tatiana Maslany, far better than the writing deserves) and a closet full of knickknacks, the monkey returns. The boys slowly figure out its power: every time the key in its back is turned, the ensuing drums count down to death and a gruesome “accident” happens to someone nearby. Once the monkey is “vanquished”, the brothers go their own ways but 25 years later, it’s back and the estranged siblings (now played byTheo James) must find a way to put an end to its killing spree.Credit must go to backers Neon for another effective yet effectively misleading marketing campaign. While Longlegs was pushed as the year’s most terrifying movie (it wasn’t), The Monkey has been sold as a horror movie with comedic elements (it’s the opposite). With a budget of around $10m, it’s likely to be another high-profit win for them but in a year that has already lumped us withCompanion,Heart EyesandThe Gorge, it’s another loss for horror fans of even the vaguest level of discernment, gimmickry still taking precedence over tight storytelling.While Longlegs had a similarly scrappy script, it was at least made with real style, Perkins capable of imagery that cuts through even when his writing couldn’t. But The Monkey is poorly lit and visually drab, a film set in the 90s and the present that takes more cues from the 70s. James is also a little too stiff for the material, awkwardly playing straight man in a ridiculous world, but the tone would be hard for most actors to figure out. The comedy is so persistently misfiring that it’s often hard to even understand where the joke is supposed to be, the only laughs at my screening in response to the garish gore.Inner demons: grappling with childhood trauma in horror moviesRead moreThere is no sense of dread or fear despite the setup with each death scene staged without a build of suspense or any interest in stakes, just another body exploding into mush. Even the gore itself is too cartoonish to penetrate, a mess of repetitive and boringly uninventive splatter with Perkins failing to match even the laziest of the Final Destination sequels (the fourth one, if you’re interested). Not only did those films employ elaborate effort in the construction but they also found just the right balance of comedy and horror, gleefully ghoulish yet grounded enough for us to wince at the pain being inflicted. The deaths here are neither funny nor scary or even gross enough to linger, we’re all rendered unshockable far too soon. The engine also allows for so much more juice – who dies next, how will they die, how can one safeguard against it – and while these questions are teased at in the first act, Perkins has no real interest in taking his film seriously enough to build any dramatic tension. If death is so meaningless then ultimately so is his movie.The Monkey is out in US and UK cinemas on 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsStephen KingComedy filmsAdam ScottreviewsShareReuse this content"

Trumpism can and must be defeatedWed 19 Feb 2025 07.21 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 13.28 ESTShareIwill be doing town meetings in Omaha, Nebraska, this Friday night and Iowa City, Iowa, on Saturday morning. Further, in the coming weeks and months, I and other progressives will be holding grassroots events from coast to coast.Why, at this moment, are we doing town meetings around the country – especially in conservative areas? The answer is obvious.Trumpismwillnotbe defeated by politicians inside the DC beltway. It will only be defeated by millions of Americans, in every state in this country, coming together in a strong, grassroots movement which saysnoto oligarchy,noto authoritarianism,noto kleptocracy,noto massive cuts in programs that working people desperately need,noto huge tax breaks for the richest people in our country. And that’s what these events are about.Further, there are a number of congressional districts whereRepublicanswon by only a small number of votes. With the Republican party in the House having only a three-vote majority we can defeat draconian, anti-working-class legislation if just two Republican members of Congress voteno. And they will votenoif we rally their constituents to demand that they voteno.What Trump didn’t say in his inauguration speech | Bernie SandersRead moreCan Trumpism be defeated? Absolutely! But, if we’re going to make that happen, we need to know exactly what we’re up against and how we can best go forward. Here’s just some of what we need to know:Trumpism has an unlimited amount of money to throw into its efforts.Elon Musk, the wealthiest man on earth, put more than $270m into Trump’s campaign, a tiny portion of his fortune. Other multibillionaires will join Musk in spending whatever it takes.Trumpism has significant control over large parts of the media from which millions of Americans get their information. Fox and Musk’s platform X, among others, are not normal media outlets. Their basic function is not to cover the “news” but to spread rightwing extremist ideology.Trumpism is utilizing the concept of the “big lie” in a way that has never, in this country, been seen. Day after day, blatantly dishonest statements and conspiracy theories are propagated – and repeated over and over and over again.Trumpism does not believe in democracy or the rule of law.Trump recently posted: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” In other words, Trump believes that he can do anything he wants for any reason. He can ignore Congress or the courts. He is above the law.But, while Trump consolidates power into his own hands, there is another reality going on.Today, 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck; millions are earning starvation wages; 85 million are uninsured or under-insured; young people are unable to afford the cost of college; 25% of seniors live on $15,000 a year or less; we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, and we have a major shortage in low-income and affordable housing.Oh, and by the way, we’re losing the struggle against the climate crisis – an existential threat to the future of the planet.And here’s the kicker. While Trump moves us away from democracy, while the middle class continues to decline, the wealthiest people in the country have never ever had it so good. Today, the three major oligarchs, Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, are worth $905bn – that is more wealth than the bottom half of American society – 170 million people. And, incredibly, since Trump’s election their wealth has grown by $217bn.Our struggle, the American people’s struggle, is to protect democracy and the rule of law. Equally important, we must end oligarchy and create an economy that works for all, not just the few. We are the wealthiest country on earth and AI, robotics and other new technologies will only make our country wealthier. It is absurd, unjust and inhumane that virtually all of that new wealth being created goes to the people who need it the least.While Trump now “floods the zone” and occupies most of the political oxygen, it is imperative that we never lose sight of the progressive vision – a nation and world based on human cooperation and compassion, not greed and a “survival of the fittest” mentality. What we are fighting for is not “utopian”, or unachievable. Much of it already exists in other countries, and poll after poll shows that it is exactly what the American people want.In the richest country in the history of the world we must establish that:Healthcare is a human right and must be available to all regardless of income.Every worker in America is entitled to earn a decent income. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage and make it easier for workers to join unions.We must have the best public educational system in the world, from childcare to vocational training, to graduate school – available to all.We must address the housing crisis and build the millions of units of low-income and affordable housing that we desperately need.We must create millions of good paying jobs as we lead the world in combating the existential threat of climate change.We must abolish all forms of bigotry.Not only must we continue to fight for a nation based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice, we must also lead the effort against Trump‘s reactionary legislative agenda.In the coming weeks the Republicans in Congress will be bringing forward a major piece of legislation, a “reconciliation” bill, that encapsulates the value system of greed and their obedience to oligarchy. It is the economic essence of Trumpism.At a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, this legislation will provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the richest people in our country. It will make the rich even richer. At a time when the working class of this country is struggling to put food on the table and pay for housing, this legislation will make savage cuts to Medicaid, housing, nutrition, education and other basic needs. It will make the poor even poorer.We cannot allow this to happen. This legislation is enormously unpopular. It is exactly what the American people donotwant. It must not be passed by Congress.It must be defeated and wecandefeat it.This is a perilous moment in American history. Let us go forward together.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and chair of the health education labor and pensions committee.

I stared at it for a long time, possibly without drawing breath. Martin and I grew up living next door to each other. He now lives in Australia. It was from there that he sent me a screenshot ofGoogleMaps’ Street View, showing what had been our homes. Side by side, just bricks and mortar obviously, but teeming with meaning for both of us. That wasn’t the thing though. The thing was that in a corner of the photo stood a familiar figure in a red jumper. My dad.He died this time last year. And yet here he was, standing under the tree next to his car. I felt a lot of things very strongly all at the same time: love, surprise, upset, amusement, anger, pleasure and other things. This was a month ago, but it’s on my mind again this week as it would have been his 87th birthday. And I’m still no nearer computing what I feel about the image being there, available to all, on what my dad always referred to as “the net”.My first thought was just, well, wow, I suppose. This was followed by annoyance: who gave Google permission to help itself to close-range images of most of our world, without checking if it was OK with us? Is this a literal manifestation of what’s known as surveillance capitalism? Either way, how dare they? It’s far more intimate an image than it feels appropriate for Google to share but, conversely, worse somehow for the fact that his face is so blurred. Too personal yet, at the same time, too impersonal.It also feels more intrusive for being taken a while back; we got rid of that car five years ago. It’s a small Vauxhall estate – an unremarkable vehicle, which I’d forgotten about until now, when a memory came to me, in a nice way, of how he once described it as: “not a crumpet-catcher, obviously. But gets me about.” Please forgive the unreconstructed language there. He was a) joking and b) well into his 80s. Either way, I’m smiling. So Google’s winning. Surveillance capitalism, 1; me, nil.At the moment Google’s spies happened to crawl by, my mum was nowhere to be seenI also smiled, as I’m sure he would, to see that it’s him pictured busy doing a chore, rather than my mum. As much as she never stops doing jobs, my dad rarely started one if he could help it. “I am,” he once admitted to me, “inclined to laziness.” But here he is, hard at work, while my mum at that moment is almost certainly nearby sweeping, planting, tidying, cooking, cleaning or whatever. But at the moment Google’s spies happened to crawl by, she was nowhere to be seen. For eternity, as far as “the net” is concerned, he is the industrious one. The injustice of it. He’d be tickled pink.Why am I so sad about seeing a robot get beaten up? | Adrian ChilesRead moreI’ve enjoyed thinking these things so, in the end, I can’t say I’m unhappy the image exists. After all, I’ve a thousand photographs I could look at to take me to similar places in my mind, but access to them is limited to me, my family and friends. None of them are out there for all to see unless we decide it should be so. But, even with our own photo collections, there is something we’re losing control of: when and where we choose to view them. MyiPhone, unbidden, treats me every day to a slideshow of people, places and moments of its choosing.Most of these people, places and moments I’m happy to be reminded of; others, not so much. Some memories I don’t want stirred, others are so precious and moving that I can’t deal with them assailing me out of the blue when I’m doing something else. To be fair, there’s probably a way of disabling this feature, but I can’t quite bring myself to do so.

And does it involve jam? Do not fear: the Duchess of Sussex is on hand to explain allWed 19 Feb 2025 10.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 11.18 ESTShareIn these days of darkness we must take delight where we can find it, and one reliable source is the Duchess of Sussex. In her latest venture, Meghan, who occupies the tricky position of having a large platform and not enough to fill it (see also:Brooklyn Beckham), launched a new lifestyle brand that, she promised in a short video, would be “beautifully weaving together everything I cherish – food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday”. The brand American Riviera Orchard is dead. Long live the new brand,As Ever.The duchess and her husband, Prince Harry, have to do something and good luck to them, but it’s hard not to study the rollout of As Ever for signs of the widening gap between Meghan’s self-image and how the rest of the world sees her. “‘As ever’,” writes the duchess onInstagram, “means ‘as it’s always been’ or some even say ‘in the same way as always’,” the “some” in this sentence apparently referring to the dictionary definition of a two-word phrase that no one has ever had trouble understanding.It’s ridiculous, of course, as is the hello-little-people tone adopted by the former royal highness, in keeping with the general attitude of the famous towards the unfamous – namely, one of stating the bleeding obvious as though sharing the key to existence. Still, I find myself sympathising with Meghan, who in her Instagram post and its accompanying video faces the stark challenge of having to pad out thin material. “This is what I do,” she says to camera, “and I haven’t been able to share it with you for the past few years, but now I can.” What is the “it” here, and what has stopped her from sharing it? (It may involve jam, as did her previous brand, which she launched by sending “limited edition” jars of preserve to, among others, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Tracee Ellis Ross, who apparently also got a fresh bag of lemons.) Anyway, whatever the content,she hints darkly at some “whispers” abroad that forced her to jump the gun and share news of As Ever before she was ready – because “I wanted you to hear it from me first”.The fact there is no story here makes Meghan’s insistence that she is getting in front of the story all the more enjoyable, but the more curious aspect of the announcement is the “you” to whom she refers and the idea she clearly has of her audience. The celebrity lifestyle space is crowded, ferocious and notoriously fickle, littered with the carcasses of former brand leaders such as Chrissy Teigen. Target and Bloomingdales distanced themselves from the star around the same time as she was accused of, and later apologised for, cyberbullying a woman called Courtney. The space is also dominated by market leaders such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Rachel Zoe.James Murdoch has spilled the beans, and the reality is more miserable than we – or Succession – ever imagined | Zoe WilliamsRead moreMeghan is a minnow in these waters, but of course has her own secret weapon she isn’t shy about using. In the new video, she deploys good old Harry to hold up the cameraphone and drop a few posh tones – “Is this thing on?” – to remind us that, even if As Ever isn’t royal, exactly, it is at least royal adjacent. The new name is clearly a reach for something classier and more timeless than its predecessor, American Riviera Orchard, which sounded like a range of scented gift baskets you’d find at a discount shopping outlet, or the pair’s charity arm,Archewell, a play on their son’s name. Both brands have an aspirant lower middle-class vibe about them, which it would be rude to point out were it not for the fact that Harry and Meghan trade on class as part of their branding.What they are selling isn’t poshness itself, which strictly speaking should entail low-comfort, hole-in-the-elbows, bad cooking and draughty houses, but – much like Trump and his performance of “billionaire” – a kind of ersatz poshness they imagine might appeal to the peasants. It’s a hard one to get right and, with the new brand name, Meghan seems to have changed course in the direction of, say, a Calvin Klein perfume or something a bit more abstract and upmarket. Although for my money she was on to more of a winner with the obscure and personalised brand nameThe Tig, her first attempt at lifestyle content that had to be shelved when she started dating Harry. As she explained at the time, The Tig was derived from an abbreviation of her favourite wine, tignanello, and had about it the confidence of something genuinely felt rather than a brand name that has been kicked through a comms team.Which brings us to the duchess’s understanding of audience. Discounting the forfeiture of sympathy that comes with money and privilege, there is something akin to pathos in the video that I find painful to watch. Meghan’s aw-shucks, I-know-you-love-me tone assumes not only goodwill but abject fandom on the part of an audience which, I suspect, is at least 50% made up of those who regard her not only critically but with downright derision. It is hard to witness. “Sending lots of love,” she signs off with noblesse oblige and an almost charming dedication to what she imagines we think of her.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In 2021, the world watched theGerman electionsto see who would succeed the EU’s uncrowned “queen”. Angela Merkel had become a symbol of liberal democracy in the era marked by the first Trump administration. In Germany, two colourless figures explicitly vied to replace her. Deep down everyone knew that German leadership in Europe was coming to an end. But no one could have foreseen how steep the fall would be.Today, Germany is a country struggling with itself, increasingly sidelined in Europe and the world. The second Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 largely destroyed Merkel’s rosy legacy, exposing her opportunisticallysoft approachto authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Under Merkel’s Social Democratic party (SPD) successor, Olaf Scholz, the country has become as pale and uninspiring as the chancellor himself.Sunday’s general election will not fundamentally change this. The outcome is predictable, in a way we have seen play out for years across Europe. Just as inSweden in 2022, in theNetherlands in 2023and in theEuropean electionslast year, the key issues of the campaign are immigration and the role of the far right. And just as in those cases, and many before them, this means that a far-right party, this time the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), will do very well.Unlike in Sweden and the Netherlands, however, the election will not usher the far right into power, even if the AfD continues to pull both major parties to the right, particularly on issues such as immigration. The main reason for the continued cordon sanitaire that keeps it out of power in Germany is no longer the country’s specific history, but the specific extremism of its far right. Unlike most other relevant far-right parties in Europe, the AfD isborderline extreme right, ie anti-democratic per se, despite its radical right front and the open support lent it by theUS vice-president, JD Vance.Although the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),Friedrich Merz, is presenting himself as the anti Scholz, he will probably end up as “insecure, weak, hesitant and timid” in government as he once described Scholz. According tocurrent polls, Merz’s rightwing CDU-CSU bloc has been trending downward but will get about 30% of the vote, still well ahead of the far-right AfD at about 20%. However, with the far right excluded, Merz will need the support of not just the SPD but probably also the Greens to govern – although three other parties hover around the 5% threshold, which could affect the seat allocation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are we too frozen with fear to name it? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreLeaving aside the fact that enthusiasm for a “grand coalition” of the CDU and Social Democrats, with or without the Greens, will be low in both major parties, this new government will have to take on a sluggish economy,expected to contractfor the third year in a row, in addition to a slew of other issues on which the parties are divided (such as the climate crisis and immigration). This will ensure that as Europe faces its biggest challenge in decades, Germany, the EU’s biggest power, will continue to be mainly inward focused.Though Merz will not be the new Merkel, he will bring Germany back to the centre of power in the EU, which is held by the rightwing European People’s party (EPP), of which the CDU is a leading member. The chancellor-in-waiting has alreadyendorsed his compatriotManfred Weber for a second term as EPP leader, after the latter rallied his European allies in a show of support for Merz last month. While more a marriage of convenience than love, it will realign Merz (though not necessarily his whole government) with the main power bloc in Brussels, as well as with the EU’s rising power broker in the east, Poland’s Donald Tusk.All of this will do little to help Europe develop the energy and unity it needs to take on Putin’s Russia and Trump’s US, though. Merz might be more supportive of increasing Europe’s military capacity and less skittish about military support for Ukraine, but his pledge to revitalise the German economy by introducing€100bn in spending cutswill make it even harder to find the money (and support) for significant investments in the German (and Ukrainian) military.In short, for all his campaign bluster, Merz is much more likely to govern like Scholz than like Merkel.Europewill continue to look for leadership as it attempts to navigate an increasingly hostile world where authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia are emboldened and its former ally, the US, has become an adversary.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author ofThe Far Right TodayExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionThe far rightEuropeOlaf ScholzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)commentShareReuse this content"

Much of the rough and tumble and backstabbing – Rupert essentially pitting James against the older Lachlan, in a fight that continually vexed him because his favourite (Lachlan) never won – has existed in the public domain for years as rumour. Much of it has been proved or demonstrated within reason, either by biographers – Michael Wolff in particular – or by events, culminating inRupert and Lachlan’s legal caseto secure Lachlan’s hold on the Murdoch family trust, against the other siblings, James, Liz and Prue, at the end of last year, which Rupert lost.Yet none of those machinations, spanning decades, could really encompass the sheer unbridled nastiness of this family. James describes a meeting with Rupert’s lawyer, Rupert himself sitting at the table, feigning a lack of interest. A series of questions directed to James – “Have you ever done anything successful on your own?”; “Why were you too busy to say ‘Happy Birthday’ to your father when he turned 90?” – are so loaded and needling it’s hard to imagine them emitting from any kind of professional. James recounts thinking his father was distracted, playing on his phone, only to realise that he was actually texting these questions to the lawyer.A family counselling retreat in Australia in 2010, which resulted in a “family constitution”, conceived in bad faith, leaked to Vanity Fair, and containing the immortal edict “relentlessly communicate openly, with trust and humility”, is perhaps the most strikingly manipulative act. James came to believe he had been set up, that all his other siblings were pitted against him. History can’t yet determine whether that’s true, but without question, at least one person borrowed the language and conventions of deep psychoanalytical exploration – the vulnerability and openness, the generosity and will to change – for the purposes of absolutely bilking their own flesh and blood, which is a special kind of mendacity. I live to resist the kneejerk characterisation of billionaires as exceptional just because they insist they are, but I have to admit: these billionaires are exceptionally horrible.Another of those codes saw all the Murdochs signed up to be “vigilant of and defend against divisiveness, either between us orthat which could infiltrate from without”(my italics). That’s what makes James’s latest interview so novel – previously he was held back by a sort of therapy-speak NDA. Which he should have clocked, to be honest – nobody telling you the truth says “that which could infiltrate from without” when they mean “outsiders”.View image in fullscreenBrian Cox as the media mogul Logan Roy and Jeremy Strong as his son Kendall in Jesse Armstrong’s Succession.Photograph: HBOIf the Murdochs weren’t rich, we wouldn’t know half of this, as they’d never have ended up fighting one another in court in Reno; or fighting the assorted forces of British law in the hacking scandal; or the US defamation suitsin the Dominion case(payout: three-quarters of a billion dollars) and theSmartmatic case, both of which centre on Fox News spreading conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was rigged.If they weren’t rich, we wouldn’t know the other half, as nobody would be interested enough to give James a platform for his grievances. One other obvious rider: without Succession, the media mogul drama that every Murdoch member swears someone else is briefing, yet whose details the creator Jesse Armstrong swears he just got from press cuttings, some of us still wouldn’t be interested, however rich they were, and however much dirty laundry got done in public.But this isn’t a story about a watching public slavering over the lives, lifestyles, loves and hatreds of the super-rich; everything about it is political.Michael Wolff told me once, after 50 hours of one-to-one interviews with Rupert Murdoch, and a fresh instalment on the family,The Fall: “I’m not particularly interested in politics. I think that the real issues are about people’s personal motivations.” It irritated the hell out of me; would that any of us could afford to be uninterested in the politics that Rupert Murdoch has created.‘Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies’: Murdoch biography stokes succession rumorsRead moreLachlan reportedly came to be thought of as the chosen heir because his politics mirrored those of his father, while James, Liz and Prue were all dismayed by his increasingly hardline conservatism, particularly with regard to the climate crisis. However, this makes it sound like a classic family row, and cannot begin to describe the evolution of Rupert’s politics, how he’s been transformed by cupidity and mindless ratings-chasing from a centre-right, newspaperman sensibility to bankrolling conspiracist, racist drivel. Fox News slid to the right faster, basically, than Rupert’s conscience or intellect could rouse themselves.We may have had a ringside seat over here on Murdoch senior’s droning xenophobia, with the Sun splashing on fear of migrants reflexively in the absence of other news, like an out-of-office auto reply, but I think we would have been astonished, certainly before 2016, to see the openly white supremacist “great replacement theory”, evangelised by Tucker Carlson on Fox, in any British tabloid. Rupert, who always loathed Donald Trump, created in Fox News both ideas-machine and propagandist for Trump’s victory. And for what? More money, more power, to wield over the junior Murdochs, set them against one another, and make everyone miserable.So maybe Wolff was right, maybe the politics of the Murdochs aren’t interesting, being as they are pretty bland, in James, Liz and Prue’s case, and all over the place, in Rupert and Lachlan’s. We do, unfortunately, have to live in the Murdochs’ politics, and the fact that they are also personally miserable – well, if it’s a consolation, it’s very small and vanishingly brief.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hong Kong and Vilnius have much stronger claims to this shameful title ...Wed 19 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 12.13 ESTShareHaving worked in the advertising industry for a while, I can tell you that creating a great ad is a lot more difficult than skewering a bad ad. That’s partly why I left a full-time gig in adland to focus on writing. Although the bigger reason, if I’m honest, is that Iwrote a columnsaying I was going to quit my stupid advertising job before actually quitting, and my boss saw it and reacted as you might expect.But my poor life choices are not the point; the point here is other people’s poor choices, namely those of some marketers inNew Zealand. You see, the people at Tourism New Zealand are facing international ridicule for a new advertising campaign – with the tagline “Everyone must go!” – designed to entice Australians to visit.What is so bad about the ad? According to aGuardian articleon the backlash, a number of opposition politicians and social media users reckon it sounds like a clearance sale. Well, yes, that was sort of the point! Congratulations to all the critics, you figured out the underlying idea. Other naysayers think it sounds like a plea for people to use the toilet – an interpretation that may say more about them than the campaign. Perhaps the most legitimate criticism, however, is that the country is seeing record emigration and so this feels tone-deaf.If any of the people at Tourism New Zealand feel stung by the criticism, they should take heart – they are not even close to being in the Most Unfortunate Tourism Campaign hall of fame. Top prize probably goes to the Hong Kong tourism board for ads with the tagline “Hong Kong will take your breath away” that went out shortly before the Sars epidemic. Vilnius (the capital of Lithuania) gets an honourable mention in the Shamelessly Tasteless category for a 2019 campaign where it called itself the“G-Spot of Europe” because “nobody knows where it is, but when you find it – it’s amazing”.Frankly, I think the New Zealand advert is a success. Everyone is talking about it, after all. And it certainly has me thinking about a trip down under. But then again, it is winter in Trump’s America: the wind chill is high and the fascism factor even higher.

Thanks to migration – which proves xenophobia doesn’t payMaría RamírezWith Spanish GDP growth leading Europe last year, diversity is making us richer – not only financially but culturally, tooWed 19 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 08.30 ESTShareThe world’s fastest growing major advanced economy last year was most likely Spain. According to preliminary official data for 2024, Spain’s GDPgrew by 3.2%,almost five timesthe eurozone average and more than the US, which did pretty well too. In December,the Economistranked Spain first among 37 mostly wealthy countries based on five indicators: GDP, stock market performance, core inflation, unemployment and government deficits. Forecasts for 2025look good.Why is Spain doing so well? One key reason is immigration. Recentpopulation flows, particularly but not only from Colombia, Venezuela and other Latin American countries, as well as Morocco, have boosted domestic demand and rejuvenated the workforce. According to the main labour national survey,nearly 90%of new jobs were filled by workers of foreign origin or dual nationality. Unemployment is at itslowest levelsince 2007.Spain’s growth is driven by a wide range of factors: a booming tourism industry, public investmentsupported bythe EU’s pandemic recovery funds,rising services and industrial exportsto the European single market and beyond (especially since 2021), the growth of financial and technology businesses, and low energy costs thanks to Spain’s expansion of renewables. Some of the labour reforms enacted by the centre-left coalition government have also put more money into low-income consumers’ pockets – notably, the steady increase in the minimum wage, which has risenmore than 50%since the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, took office in 2018.While the weight of each of these factors remains debated, migration is still the most frequently cited reason for Spain’s strong performance and perhaps its most distinctive advantage compared with other countries. Immigration has also visibly changed Spain in recent years, particularly in major cities. Madrid, for instance, now hasmore than 1 million residentsfrom Latin America – up from just 80,000 only 25 years ago.Anecdotal evidence shows this transformation. In my own neighbourhood in central Madrid, the most popular bookstore is run by twoArgentinian journalists; thecool artisan bakerythat keeps expanding was co-founded by a Hungarian woman who moved her business from Budapest. A Latin American evangelical church rents an old adult cinema for its worship and gatherings; a traditional Spanish pastry shop has started selling Venezuelan delicacies next to the long queue that forms every other day outside the consulate. Not far away, a large sign supports the party of the Argentinian president, Javier Milei (with graffiti from his detractors scrawled across it).Not all the economic data tells a rosy story. Spain still struggles withlow productivity, an overreliance on thepublic sectorand low wages (GDP per capita has not grown as much as GDP), even if it hasimproved in these measurestoo. Tourism, while a driving force for the economy, has exacerbated housing shortages and fuelled a backlash against visitors, short-term rental platforms and investment funds pushing locals out of the city centres.Immigration has added to the pressure on affordable housing, with demand outpacing supply as the population grows.Some politiciansblame rich Venezuelan and Colombian buyers for the rising prices in the most expensive neighbourhoods of Madrid. And poorer immigrants, particularly those from north African countries, continue to facediscriminationandexploitationby unscrupulous and criminal employers or landlords. Meanwhile, regional and national politicians are often locked in disputes overhousing migrant minorswho have arrived in Spain alone.Yet despite these challenges, being a richer country, in cash terms and in diversity, is an enviable position inEurope, especially when Spain is compared to struggling economies like those of Germany and Britain.Stormier times may lie ahead. Some European neighbours remain economically weak, and global demand could shrink if Donald Trump launches a transatlantic trade war. If a crisis of the scale of the 2008 crash were to recur, immigrants could return to their countries of origin, leavingSpainwith an ageing population and a dwindling workforce to support pensions and public services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was the former foreign secretary William Hague’sverdicton Donald Trump’s approach to peacemaking, drawing lessons from the Balkans, the second world war and the Middle East. A more insecure world will require Britain to increase defence spending. The UK currently could not sustain major troop deployments in Ukraine, undermining the idea it could provide Kyiv with “security guarantees”.This is a dilemma faced across Europe, leading the EU to seedeficit-financed defence spendingas the answer. In contrast, Britain remains seemingly bound by economic orthodoxy, prioritising fiscal discipline over borrowing. The UK Treasury has apparently asked unprotected public services – excluding health, education and defence – to prepare forreal-terms cuts of up to 11%ahead of June’s spending review, as funds are diverted to the military. This would be a mistake.Britain’s austerity is at odds with the majority of EU states that seem ready to apply pandemic lessons to strengthen defence, counter Russian threats and reduce reliance on the US. At theMunich Security Conference, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled a major fiscal shift, invoking an “escape clause” to excludemilitaryspending from EU deficit rules – mirroring the Covid response, when the EU suspended fiscal constraints to enable stimulus spending.This is apragmaticshift, acknowledging that the menace of a revanchist Moscow outweighs self‑imposed budget limits. Sir Keir Starmer should take note. If the Treasury funds defence by cutting existing budgets, departments like justice, local government and welfare will suffer real-terms reductions to their outlays. This would be politically unsustainable. Neoclassical economists may argue that Britain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is too high, but it remainscomparableto those of France, Italy and Spain. Defence spending arguably also has a high fiscal multiplier, generating more economic activity and job creation than other expenditures.Mr Trump demands Nato members spend5% of GDPon defence. This has forced a historicshiftin EU policy, potentially setting a precedent for future deficit exemptions in green investment and industrial policy. Europe should also heed Mario Draghi’s advice: in crises, fiscal policy must drive growth and recovery. InDecember, the former head of the European Central Bank contrasted Europe’s austerity with US stimulus, noting that after the financial crash, the US injected €7.8tn into its economy through deficit spending, while the eurozone managed €560bn. Europe’s restrictive fiscal policy stifled growth, while the US used it far more effectively.In this volatile world, the EU and Britain must address Covid-era debt. Ongoingnegotiationsover EU pandemic borrowing suggest more austerity ahead – misguided, since this spending wasn’t reckless but a necessary crisis response. The ECB shouldabsorbEU pandemic debt to prevent further austerity and boost recovery. In Britain, the Bank of England should stop selling Covid debt, as it’s raising yields and tightening fiscal conditions unnecessarily.“There are decades when nothing happens; and there are weeks when decades happen,” Lenin is often quoted as saying. The past seven days have underscored just how quickly history moves – and how swiftly governments must adapt. Europe has already begun that shift. Britain should follow.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The supreme court was established in 2009 and a culture of respect for the independence of the courts is not deeply entrenched.Earlier this week, Lady Carr reminded Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch of that duty. The lady chief justicerebukedthe prime minister and the Conservative leader for exchanges in the Commons last week regarding a court decision in the case of a family of refugees from Gaza. Earlier this year an immigration tribunal recognised the validity of their entitlement to settle in the UK under the European convention on human rights, overturning a previous refusal. Mrs Badenoch said this was the wrong decision and challenged Sir Keir to agree.He did, adding that the decision should not stand and that the relevant “legal loophole” would be closed.Lady Carr described both the question and the answer as “unacceptable”. The objection, distinct from the humanitarian merit of the original asylum claim, is that a judge’s decision should not be denounced from the dispatch box. If ministers don’t like a ruling, they can appeal against it. That is how the constitution works.As a former barrister with a background in human rights, Sir Keir knows this well enough. Before entering Downing Street he was committed to preserving and reinforcing the line that Lady Carr has now been forced to bring back to his attention.Mrs Badenoch, by contrast, is continuing a trend of growing Tory contempt for judicial independence. Eurosceptic Conservatives were intensely irritated by a court ruling that upheld parliament’s role in Brexit – a tussle that culminated in the supreme court overturning Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of the legislature in 2019. In subsequent years, Mr Johnson and his successors switched their ire to judicial decisions that obstructed plans to deport asylum claimants to Rwanda. That led to the constitutional absurdity of aparliamentary billdeclaring that the east African state must, by law, be considered safe.To Sir Keir’s credit, that statute is to be repealed. But last week’s Commons exchange is a worrying sign that the current Downing Street regime is experiencing some of the same frustrations as the last one, and vulnerable to the same political impulse – denouncing judges and decrying “loopholes” when courts uphold fundamental human rights regarding immigration.That isn’t the only contested area. Lord Hermer, the attorney general, has beentargeted for attackby Conservative media for cases he defended as a barrister before being appointed by Sir Keir as the government’s most senior law officer. There is no evidence of wrongdoing, only insinuations of liberal bias and a tendentious allegation of conflicts of interest. That hostility is stoked by a whispering campaign fromwithin Labour rankssuggesting that the attorney general’s pernickety attitude to lawfulness gets in the way of dynamic government.The impulse to subordinate law to executive will is debilitating to a democracy, as Donald Trump is demonstrating. The US president rails against constitutional safeguards that deny him untrammelled power. He has many cheerleaders on this side of the Atlantic, including a Conservative party that has already proved itself unsafe as a guarantor of judicial independence. All the more reason for Sir Keir and Labour to hold the line.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The temporary accommodation of these families is a needless drain on local governments’ stretched budgets. Some of these homes are in areas of high demand, such as London, and some are owned by councils, which are either are too cash-strapped or so depleted of in-house skills that they cannot get around to putting them into habitable condition.This obscene contrast between wasted resources and essential human need could be corrected by the adoption of tax systems such as exist in France. The French levy aresidence tax. This must be paid if you own a property and live in it yourself, have it available for your use, or rent it out on short-term lets. Where properties are rented out long-term, this is paid by the tenant.In France there is also ataxe foncière,which is paid by the owner of the property, irrespective of who occupies it. The tax is divided into two parts: tax on buildings and tax on land. The latter is levied nationally. The tax on buildings is paid on any property that is habitable, whether or not it is occupied.Both taxes apply to non-residents as well as residents, and are often higher on second homes than on main residences, due to possible discounts on the main home, and are a great source of local revenue to support public services.Kate MacintoshWinchesterAditya Chakrabortty rightly highlights the social crime of selling off council housing: in my village, where there were 18 council houses, seven have been sold off over the last 25-30 years. Not only that, the former primary school site (closed in 2014) was sold to a developer that obtained planning permission for 12 houses, three of which were to be “affordable”; this was then reduced to two affordable units; thelatest applicationto revise the planning permission has reduced the affordable units to zero. Needless to say, the site has not yet been developed and is unlikely to be developed for some time.Meanwhile, there is a shortage of the sort of workers who are desperately needed for an ageing population, who cannot afford the increasingly expensive owner‑occupied housing in this area. There’s nothing to celebrate about the 50th anniversary of Thatcher’s rise to power; the only consolation is that I did not vote for her (nor any Conservative).Susan GregoryBurton in Lonsdale, North YorkshireI am in complete agreement with Aditya Chakrabortty about the immoral sales of council housing. In the 1950s my father was a farm worker and we lived in a tied cottage. When my father’s “shellshock” (post-traumatic stress disorder) from the second world war meant he was unable to work, we were evicted. On the day of eviction, the local authority rehoused us in a very substantial council house. The best that a family in a similar situation can expect today is a substandard B&B.Perhaps, on this one-off occasion, Keir Starmer should have “done a Trump” and slashed the discount for council flat purchases on day one to stop greedy landlords jumping on the bandwagon.David FeltonCrewe, CheshireDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

In recent years, most large developers have been doing very well in terms of profit margins and shareholder returns without having to increase their output at all. Why should they bother to do more?The only way the government will get close to its target is by stumping up the money for investment in new social homes, exerting stronger control over increasing land values along the way. It was a lesson learned nearly 80 years ago by Aneurin Bevan. In his stint as housing minister, the postwar Labour government built more than 160,000 council homes a year – in the teeth of acute austerity.Four-fifths of all new houses built in the period were council homes, as speculative building was restrained. Bevan expressed his view with characteristic clarity: “If we are to plan, we have to plan with plannable instruments, and the speculative builder, by his very nature, is not a plannable instrument.” It’s a lesson that should be heeded once more.Prof Ian ColeSheffieldThe mid-20th-century new towns set an excellent model for those of the mid-21st (Work on up to 12 new towns in England to begin by next election, says government, 12 February). The state gave overall planning permission for a designated area and master plan. Within that area, detailed planning was controlled by each new town board (which included local councillors), so was decided quickly. The board bought the land at agricultural land prices so that its development value (publicly created by the planning permission) was returned to the community in the form of infrastructure, services, schools, open space etc.But, for the 21st century, it’s essential that sustainability is inbuilt, with master plans based on walking, cycling and public transport (rather than the car-based models of the 1960s), and with the highest standards of structure, insulation and heating for homes, commercial and public buildings.Moira HankinsonLandscape architect, Peterborough and WashingtonnewtownsThere is much that is positive in the refining of proposals for building 1.5m new homes and 12 new towns as highlighted in your article (Work on 12 new towns in England to begin by next election says government, 12 February). However, where the detail remains perilously scant is in delivery. The new town taskforce interim report barely goes there either.There is a risk that the easy option is taken: of location and site selection, compulsory purchase, volume housebuilders – who already build over 70% of new homes annually – competing for the spoils, with poor master-planning and second-rate home design resulting in yet more soulless monoculture, inadequate infrastructure and poor transport links. This has happened countless times over the decades, particularly as our towns and cities expand.We must really work harder in being creative over what we deliver and how – places where people want to live and work and enjoy their leisure time. Places where people come first. That demands thought and investment, and there are some very good examples, like Nansledan, or Woodstock, or Tornagrain, where the landowner commits to retaining a long-term interest rather than offloading land purely for short-term gain. This “legacy approach” requires changes to current tax rules to create a level playing field, new ways to cashflow the upfront infrastructure costs, and more dogmatic requirements for single-interest groups to work together to secure planning more quickly. We must also strengthen and diversify the supply chain by encouraging small and medium-sized developers back into the market.Hugh PetterDirector, ADAM Architecture, WinchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Given how close Donyell Malen came to snatching a 95th‑minute winner, though, perhaps it will be easy enough. Trent Alexander‑Arnold rattled in a second-half equaliser to maintain Liverpool’s unbeaten away record in the league but a point was a frustrating takeaway given Darwin Núñez missed a glaring chance to put his side 3-2 up.How much encouragement will this result give Arsenal, eight points behind the leaders with a game in hand? Diogo Jota also missed a brilliant chance for Liverpool, who seized the lead through Mohamed Salah, before goals by Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins put Villa – for whom Marcus Rashford made his first start since joining on loan from Manchester United – in front at the interval.Real Madrid v Manchester City: Champions League playoff round, second leg – liveRead moreThis evolved into a captivating, seesawing contest once Villa recovered from an early wave of Liverpool attacks. Virgil van Dijk walloped a shot over the bar after collecting Alexander-Arnold’s improvised outside-of-the-boot pass and the next minute Tyrone Mings made a couple of important interventions, first to block Jota’s shot and then Andy Robertson’s cross. Unai Emery gesticulated furiously, demanding his players raise their level.And so they did. Few would have had Rashford and Marco Asensio doubling up on Ryan Gravenberch in Villa shirts in mid-February on their pre-season bingo card. Rashford’s slide tackle on Ibrahima Konaté on the edge of the Liverpool box lifted the crowd.Rashford is at his best flying down the left channel, though, and after a one-two with Asensio, also making his first Villa start, the loanee’s low cross cannoned off a Liverpool defender into the back of Alisson’s net. Then came the check from the video assistant referee, replays showing Rashford had strayed offside. It was a decision in keeping with the rest of the game until that point: a procession of nearly moments. Emiliano Martínez made a fine save to thwart Dominik Szoboszlai after Curtis Jones twirled clear, Lucas Digne superbly stopped Salah in his tracks.Emery warned that Villa would be punished for dropping off for a second and a lapse of concentration gifted Liverpool the lead. Andrés García, the right-back signed from Levante last month, played a blind backward pass straight to the lurking Jota and the Liverpool forward took a pace or two before squaring for Salah to convert. It was surely the easiest of Salah’s 29 goals in all competitions this season. García grimaced, Van Dijk did a double-fist pump.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins’ header gave Aston Villa the lead at the break.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersThe goal seemed to galvanise Villa. John McGinn kept a Rashford free-kick alive at the back post after Konaté headed clear and then Mings bopped the ball on again. Szoboszlai’s clearance dropped straight to Tielemans, who volleyed in.Liverpool should have immediately regained the lead but Jota, played in by Robertson with only Martínez to beat, shanked a shot painfully wide. If Jota was not kicking himself then, he surely was when Villa went ahead. Watkins kickstarted the move himself, spreading play and drifting into the box unmarked to spook Van Dijk and head in Digne’s cross, sparking bedlam in the stands.This was Rashford’s first league start since December and, although he faded, his direct running caused problems. Alisson rushed out of goal early in the second half and inadvertently presented Rashford with a chance to curl the ball towards an empty net, but the defence covered.Jota clipped the top of the bar from the edge of the Villa box but Liverpool levelled a minute later. Alexander‑Arnold advanced into a hole of space on halfway and after collecting the ball from Salah his thrashed shot flew into the bottom corner via Mings. Then Liverpool went for the jugular.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then came a rare moment of respite, a double Liverpool substitution before Emery made a triple change, with Rashford among those withdrawn. Slot sent on Conor Bradley and Núñez and the pair almost made an instant impact.Bradley slipped a through ball into Szoboszlai, who trickled the ball to his left for Núñez, but the Uruguayan skied his effort. Axel Disasi perhaps put him off but Núñez should have scored. Slot hurriedly asked if there had been an offside, presumably to make himself feel better. It was another wasted chance to file away.It was fraught now. Emery tapped his temples by way of warning. Liverpool survived a scare after Jacob Ramsey rippled the net, only for VAR to confirm he was offside. Morgan Rogers wellied over in stoppage time and then Malen went even closer, drilling wide with 11 seconds to go.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He is one of 17 England players who were awarded enhanced contracts in October, which give Steve Borthwick the “final say” on all sports science matters.Scotland’s dangermen Russell and Van der Merwe loom large for EnglandRead moreInitially, Exeter booked Feyi-Waboso for surgery before the Chiefs’ director of rugby, Rob Baxter, revealed thewinger was still deliberatingwhether to forgo the operation and hope rehab could enable him to return for the business end of the Six Nations.When announcing his squad for theSix Nationson 14 January, Borthwick said Feyi-Waboso had decided to have surgery after all, only for it to emerge that he had opted against the operation and could feature in the Six Nations. He was called into England’s camp last week for a day’s rehabilitation but has now finally undergone surgery, ­posting images of himself in hospital on social media with an ­accompanying caption: “Minor setbacks, we go again.”The saga puts the professional game partnership – which gives Borthwick a greater degree of control over players on enhanced contracts – in a questionable light. Back in January, Baxter admitted that the uncertainty over whether Feyi-Waboso would have surgery was slowing his recovery down. In January, Baxter said: “He has barely started his rehab process really, because the to-ing and fro-ing over whether he has an operation or goes for rehab is probably slowing both options down – the operation or the rehab.”Andy Farrell is expected to name his squad for the Lions tour in late April or early May while Exeter’s final Premiership match is at the end of May. With the Chiefs unlikely to make the playoffs, Feyi-Waboso has three and a half months to return to the field during the club campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What he has observed has left him optimistic and he was clear when asked if he thought Ferrari were ready to win the cham­pionship. “Yes, I have worked with two world championship-winning teams before, I know what a winning team looks and feels like,” he said.“The passion here is like nothing you have ever seen, they have absolutely every ingredient you need to win a world championship and it’s just about putting all the pieces together.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton, Frédéric Vasseur and Charles Leclerc at Formula One’s 75th anniversary celebration at London’s O2 Arena on Tuesday.Photograph: Clive Mason/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHe is impressed by Frédéric Vasseur, theScuderiateam principal, and John Elkann and Benedetto Vigna, executives of the parent company. “We have a great leader in Fred and John and Benedetto, so everyone has a really calm and good approach, no believes they are perfect and everyone wants to elevate in every area and we are leaving no stone unturned to try and do that.”Vasseur, who is now entering his third season in charge at Ferrari and worked with Hamilton when the British driver drove for his ART team in GP2 in 2006, had no doubts he would be an invaluable asset. “The pace is there, I have no doubt,” the team principal said. “He isn’t the same, he is 20 years older than when we worked together first. He is changing, he is much more mature and much more experienced and he is the perfect fit with the team. It is exactly what I was looking for, for the team, for me, for Charles.

Headlining is the undisputed championship light-heavyweight rematch between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol, supported chiefly by the IBF heavyweight title contest involving Great Britain’s Daniel Dubois andthe New Zealander Joseph Parker.There are five other bouts – including an all-British light‑heavyweight fight between Joshua Buatsi and Callum Smith – but all of them will be contested by men, raising concern among a number of prominent voices in women’s boxing.Joseph Parker: ‘This will mean something different. I’m doing it for myself now’Read more“We’ve seen such a positive growth of women’s boxing over the past couple of years, it would be a shame for that bubble to burst,” says the Norfolk-born featherweight Raven Chapman in the buildup to Saudi Arabia’s latest boxing bonanza.“It [women’s boxing] has certainly slowed down over the last six months. Whether that is due to more control over the fight schedule from the Saudis, it is hard to comment.”In October, the 31-year-old Briton became one of only four women to contest a professional boxing bout in Saudi Arabia, challenging Australia’s Skye Nicolson for the WBC featherweight world title.“It’s a bit disappointing that there hasn’t been other women on these Saudi cards. Especially on what is supposed to be the ‘biggest card of all time’. There are plenty of big fights across the women’s divisions that could have been made – think of names like Katie Taylor, Amanda Serrano and big fights like Mikaela Mayer v Sandy Ryan.“There will be so much excitement and attention on this card in Riyadh, it’s just a shame that there will be no eyes on a women’s fight. I guess it’s down to us, as women, to keep fighting for these opportunities.”View image in fullscreenRaven Chapman was defeated by Skye Nicolson in Riyadh last October, though Nicolson’s next title defence is due to take place in her native Australia.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesChapman isn’t the only one in the sport raising concern. The American Claressa Shields is considered one of the pound-for-pound stars in the women’s code, and the unbeaten 29-year-old directed her concerns on X towards Turki Alalshikh, the chair of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority which is bankrolling the Riyadh Season events.“Don’t forget about the women, Turki,” she posted in mid-January. “We love this sport too and want to make the biggest and best fights.”Malissa Smith, a boxing historian and author of The Promise of Women’sBoxing, has also been vocal with her concerns. “It feels like a token gesture, previously having women on the card,” she said in reference to the fight last year between Chapman and Nicholson. “Skye Nicolson’s next defence will be next month in Sydney, Australia. My question is, if she is now a Riyadh Season champion, where is her return engagement? Her promoter, Matchroom Boxing, is represented on the card, so why isn’t she?“And yes, one should concede that other fighters from the October card are not represented, but the question still remains. Why isn’t she or any other women’s boxing champion – especially given the smorgasbord of promoters from the UK and USA – included this weekend?”Representatives for the Riyadh Season declined to comment on the lack of female participation this weekend. There have been some green shoots of boxing participation from women in Saudi Arabia – whether this translates into turning professional and boxing as part of these multimillion-pound events is yet to be seen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only complication she encountered was a lack of shared training spaces for male and female fighters – something for which her all-male team had to find a solution in order to prepare for her contest.Since 2018, women have been able to drive in Saudi Arabia and, since 2019, women older than 21 no longer need their guardian’s approval to access healthcare, education and state services, take up a job or make their own medical decisions about pregnancy and birth.View image in fullscreenThe high-profile fights between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano took place in New York and Texas, not Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APAmnesty International, however, continues to scrutinise the legitimacy of the progress on women’s rights. Salma al-Shehab, 36, a Leeds University PhD student and mother of two, was arrested in 2021 and detained for four years on terrorism-related charges for posting tweets in support of women’s rights.She was released this month.Chapman is positive that she will be able to earn more opportunities in the sport. Her next fight at the Royal Albert Hall will in fact be financed by the Riyadh Season.“The money and exposure that fighting in Saudi Arabia [generates] is obviously great, but it isn’t the be‑all and end-all,” she says.“I am certain we will all find venues and platforms to box on, and in some ways – like on 7 March at the Royal Albert Hall – it will provide gaps for us to gain more attention and recognition fighting at home.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ben Duckett (groin), Jofra Archer (hand), Jamie Smith (calf), Brydon Carse (toe) all picked up knocks on the trip, while Jacob Bethell’s winter ended prematurely after a hamstring injury.But three days out from their opener against Australia at the recently refurbished Gaddafi Stadium – and with Bethell already replaced by Tom Banton – only Carse appeared touch-and-go. The Durham quick did bowl in the nets at around three-quarter speed but has only just had stitches removed from a nasty toe blister.Otherwise, a break in Abu Dhabi between tours appears to have helped the remaining injury doubts, with the groin problem Duckett sustained during the final one-day international against India – the most worrying on the list – not deemed as bad as first feared after further scans. The opener’s role in the field may be the only remaining consideration.Archer, who sat out the final two games because of split webbing on his right hand, bowled at full pace in the session, while Smith batted and kept wicket after sitting out the bulk of the India tour with a calf strain. Jamie Overton, the one seam-bowling all-rounder in the squad, is also said to be over some recent hamstring stiffness.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer suffered split webbing on his right hand during the ODI series in India.Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/ReutersAs well as a heavy travel schedule, these injury problems were why McCullum decided to taper off England’s training sessions towards the end of the India trip. It triggeredcriticism from Ravi Shastri and Kevin Pietersenon commentary, as well as tapping into a wider concern that McCullum’s famously laissez-faire approach is ill-suited to an ODI side that have tumbled to seventh in the International Cricket Council’s world rankings.But it may in time prove to have been the sensible course of action, even if England will still need to perform a handbrake turn on their ODI form – eight defeats from their last 11 outings – to challenge for the one piece of men’s silverware they are yet to win. After the reunion with Australia come games against Afghanistan and South Africa next week, with the top two sides in each group progressing to the semi-finals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Regional losses were highly variable; the Antarctic and subantarctic islands lost 2% of their volume but central Europe’s glaciers lost 39%.“These numbers are staggering. They serve as a reminder that things are changing fast in some regions,” said Prof Noel Gourmelen, the co-lead author of the study and personal chair of Earth observation at the University of Edinburgh’s school of geosciences.A stark contrast in the amount of ice lost each decade was also discovered, with 36% more ice having melted between 2012 and 2023 compared with the previous decade.“This is really important as it confirms the pace of glacier melting is accelerating over time,” said Prof Andrew Shepherd, head of the department of geography and environmental science at Northumbria University. “Even small amounts of sea level rise matter because it leads to more frequent coastal flooding. Every centimetre of sea level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet.”Glacier lossalso leads to a depletion in regional freshwater supplies for remote communities and those who already face water scarcity.“Around 2 billion people depend on meltwater from glaciers and so their retreat is a big problem for society,” said Shepherd. “It’s not just that we are losing them from our landscape, they are an important part of our daily lives.”“Glaciers are also important for power generation,” said Gourmelen. “For instance, 70% of electricity in Iceland comes from hydropower. They rely on the water melt from glaciers to function. You have this in the Andes as well as parts of Europe, such as Switzerland.”Published in the journal Nature, the latest research is part of the Glacier Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise – known as Glambie. It combines and analyses data available from field measurements as well as optical, radar and laser satellite missions.After ocean warming, melting glaciers are the second largest contributor to global sea level rises.“This research is concerning because it predicts further glacier loss,” said Martin Siegert, professor of geosciences at the University of Exeter. “Two centimetres might not sound a lot, but this is the contribution from small glaciers – not the whole of the ice on the planet or that from Greenland and Antarctica.”“Glaciers have a real impact,” says Gourmelen. “They are a biometer for climate change, so the findings are a measure of the impact climate change has had over the past 20 years.“As we take action to try to mitigate this, following glacier activity will be a way of measuring our effectiveness in dealing with a changing climate.”Explore more on these topicsGlaciersClimate crisisPolar regionsnewsShareReuse this content"

[Adaptation is essential to our] agriculture, water, the management of natural resources, food security and nutrition.”View image in fullscreenOn his first day in his second term as president, Donald Trump signed a letter giving notice to UN that the US was withdrawing from the Paris agreement.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreementcame after afraught and unsatisfactory ending to the Cop29 summit in Baku in November, at which poor countries werepromised $1.3tn a year in climate finance by 2035, but of that sum only $300bn is to come chiefly from developed countries. The rest would be made up in hoped-for private sector finance and from potential levies, such as taxes on shipping and frequent flyers, which have yet to be agreed.For many in the developing world, this is not good enough. If they are to play a role in curbing carbon – and most of the future growth in emissions is projected to come from the developing world – they are demanding a better financial settlement.“The failure ofCop29to secure sufficient financing for developing countries – those most affected by climate impacts – represents a grave setback,” said Harjeet Singh, a climate activist and the founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “Without this support, their recovery efforts and transitions to renewable energy are severely hindered, jeopardising global emission reduction goals and exacerbating the climate crisis.”View image in fullscreenActivists attend a protest at Cop29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.Photograph: COP29 Azerbaijan/EPAAtCop30 in Belém, Brazil, all countries are supposed to come up with stringent national plans on cutting emissions, callednationally determined contributions (NDCs), that are in line with the goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.Current NDCs, agreed at theCop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, are insufficient to hold temperatures within 1.5C of preindustrial levels. Last year was the first to be consistently above 1.5C, and if that trend continues in the longer term the crucial limit will be judged to have been irretrievably breached. The new NDCs will govern emissions for the next decade, so Cop30 represents one of the last chances to put the world on track to avoid irreparable climate breakdown.Camilla More, a climate diplomacy researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development thinktank, said: “The world can’t afford to delay any further. That’s why this round of climate targets is critical in changing the course of global efforts to combat climate change.”Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, hasboosted the prospects for Cop30 with two widely welcomed appointments. André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, a veteran climate diplomat, will take on the role of Cop president, and Ana Toni, the government’s climate change secretary, will be executive director of the summit.View image in fullscreenThe Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, (centre) poses with workers during a visit the venue that will host Cop30 in Belém, Brazil.Photograph: Tarso Sarraf/AFP/Getty ImagesThe two will face a daunting task: Cop29 ended in fierce criticism of the developed world from poor countries, led by India, whichdenounced the outcome as “abysmally poor”.Yalchin Rafiyev, the chief negotiator for the Azerbaijani hosts, told the Guardian that his experience of Cop29 made him optimistic forCop30, as countries should have more common ground in discussions of how to reduce emissions than they had in settling who should pay for it. “Finance [the subject of Cop29] was the most divisive issue,” he said. “If we could manage to get agreement on finance, I am hopeful that we should be able to agree on NDCs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A large part of the blame was due to the weak Azeri hosts, who mishandled the talks, offended a number of countries and lacked either the diplomatic nous or geopolitical heft to steer talks to a positive outcome,” he said. “The good news is Brazil is much better suited to the job. A progressive leadership, experienced diplomats and one of the great rising forces in geopolitics should result in a much more positive environment.”Brazil will need powerful allies, however, and with Trump and his many admirers around the world ascendant, there is a dearth of strong leadership on the climate among the biggest economies. Influential countries that have championed climate action in the past are facing fraught elections this year, or internal political crises: in Germany, the coalition led by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, broke down in the face of a far-right challenge, with elections to be held this weekend; in France, the president, Emmanuel Macron – who convened several climate finance conferences – remains mired in political turmoil; across the EU, rightwing parties are fomenting a backlash against green policy; and in Canada, the previous fragile cross-party consensus on climate action could crumble in the election looming after premier Justin Trudeau’s resignation.The stance taken byChina, which with more than 30% of global emissions is the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gases by some distance, will be crucial. China has a target of peaking emissions by 2030, and reaching net zero by 2060. This is “highly insufficient” and would lead to a world more than 3C hotter than preindustrial levels, according to Climate Action Tracker. With rapidly increasing power generation from renewable sources, and a burgeoning electric vehicle market, the country could do much better.View image in fullscreenPiles of coal at a storage facility in Chongqing, south-west China, which produces more than 30% of global emissions.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesWhen it does come, China’s NDC needs to be tough if hopes of a 1.5C limit are to be kept alive. “We believe a 30% reduction [in emissions] by 2035, based on an imminent emissions peak of 2025, would be a strong Chinese NDC,” said Li Shuo, the director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “This goal will be very challenging, though, in light of the geopolitical environment, as well as China’s domestic economic struggles.”India, the world’s sixth biggest economy, will also be a key player, with its heavy reliance on coal alongside arapidly growing renewable energy sector. Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based thinktank, said: “India must remain steadfast in its commitment to climate action – to capitalise on the strategic opportunities in technology, investment, industrial development, green livelihoods, and greater resilience for the economy. Climate risks are now macroeconomic risks, and climate policy is now industrial policy.”While many of Europe’s major economies are taking a rightward turn, the exception is the UK, where the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has made shifting to a low-carbon economy one of his key “missions” for government. Starmer is seeking closer relations with China, the US and Europe. He hada 45-minute phone call with Trumpdays after the inauguration, though climate policy was not discussed. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the exchequer, visited China in January, and Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, is expected to make a trip to Beijing this year.Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the American University Center for Environmental Policy, called on the UK to fill the global leadership vacuum left by the “climate nihilism” of the US president. “Given the dearth of EU centre-left leadership, UK leaders like Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband must step forcefully into the void, leveraging relationships with key nations in the global south including Brazil,India, and Kenya,” he said. “This ought to be Britain’s most important Cop since Glasgow.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsCop30BrazilDonald TrumpCop29Least developed countriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Environmental reviews could be circumvented, and public comment periods could be skipped over.“The Trump’s administration’s push for an emergency review of wetland destruction permits is a blatant attempt to sidestep environmental laws and fast-track fossil fuel projects at the expense of our wetland and our communities,” Matt Rota, senior policy director for the Louisiana-based environmental group Healthy Gulf, said on a Wednesday press call. “This emergency proposal will increaseclimate change, destroy wetlands and leave people even more vulnerable in its wake.”Reached for comment, Doug Garman, a spokesperson for the US Army Corps of Engineers, said the agency “is in the process of reviewing active permit applications relative to the executive order”.Despite Trump’s claims that the nation is facing an “energy emergency” – part of a campaign promise to boost planet-heating fossil fuel production – the US is currently extracting more oil and gas than any other country in world history, and levels are still increasing.“TheTrump administrationappears to be gearing up to use false claims of an ‘energy emergency’ to fast-track and rubber-stamp federal approvals for projects across the country that will be destructive to America’s wetlands, waterways and communities,” said David Bookbinder, law and policy director at the green non-profit Environmental Integrity Project.The Army Corps permitting process is meant to examine opportunities to minimize threats infrastructure projects pose to wetlands. Fast-tracking permits through that process could have disastrous impacts for the climate, activists say.Fossil fuelsare responsible for the vast majority of global heating, and the wetlands being threatened also play a critical role as an absorber of greenhouse gases.Because they can slow down waves and absorb rain, wetlands can also protect communities from storms, Rota said.“These wetlands are vital to the survival of coastal Louisiana, as each acre of wetland can absorb a million gallons of water and act as a buffer between communities and the storm surge caused by hurricanes that continue to increase in intensity due to climate change,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others are related to the controversialEnbridge Line 5pipeline which crosses Wisconsin and Michigan, and for which developers want to construct a tunnel to bury the pipeline below two of the Great Lakes.“If approved, this project will risk our fresh water and the millions of people who rely on it for drinking, jobs and tourism in exchange for a foreign oil company’s profits,” said Sean McBrearty, Michigan director of the environmental non-profit CleanWaterAction, about the Line 5 proposal on Wednesday’s call.And though the Army Corps cites Trump’s “energy emergency” order as the impetus for the move, not all of the projects on the “emergency” list relate to energy. One is a gold mine proposed in an Idaho national forest, and another is a plan proposed by the energy giant Chevron to build ahousing subdivisionon a former oil field.“We don’t understand why a housing development qualifies either as an energy project, or certainly why it would qualify as an emergency,” said Bookbinder.The move will likely be subject to court challenges. The Army Corps is permitted to curtail the National Environmental Policy Act – which requires federal agencies to analyze the environmental effects of major projects – in true emergency situations wherein officials have identified an “unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship”.“We will find out the extent to which that is legal at some point, I’m sure in the not too distant future,” said Bookbinder.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsClimate crisisWetlandsWaterFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps the scale and the pace of things has taken people by surprise, but China’s been developing its electric vehicle industry for a long time now.“It’s a deliberate, strategic move for various reasons, including the fact that China is a major oil importer and so they want to improve their energy security and their balance of payments by not having to import oil to run their cars.”Chinese investments in new solar power capacity more than tripled between 2022 and 2024Whether the clean-energy sector continues to boom will depend on the new targets and policies in China’s next five-year plan for economic and social development, which comes into force in 2026.Battery EVs and plug-in hybridsEvans said that, despite world events, China is likely to continue its growth in clean energy: “After the US election result lots of people were wondering what the implications of that would be for the global climate process. China already atCop29[last year’s UN climate conference] made it very clear that it was planning to continue doing what it’s doing.“They’re doing this not out of altruistic reasons but just because they think it makes sense financially and they’ve invested a huge amount in building up these industries. They’re not going to turn back just because Trump says he doesn’t believe in climate change.”Explore more on these topicsChinaCop29Climate crisisEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

That in turn is corrupting cutting-edge police predictive crime systems, billed as part of the future of battling crime.Police say predictive policing helps cut crime, allowing officers and resources to be deployed where they are most needed.Predictive policing involves computer programmes that use data and algorithmic models to estimate where crimes are most likely to happen. It was once the stuff of dystopian fiction, for example in the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report, but is an increasingly popular tool for law enforcement.Amnesty says that of the 45 local forces across the UK, “32 have used geographic crime prediction, profiling or risk-prediction tools, and 11 forces have used individual prediction, profiling or risk-prediction tools”.In its report, Automated Racism, to be released on Thursday, Amnesty says: “These systems are, in effect, a modern method of racial profiling, reinforcing racism and discrimination in policing.“These systems are developed and operated using data from policing and the criminal legal system. That data reflects the structural and institutional racism and discrimination in policing and the criminal legal system, such as in police intelligence reports, suspect data, stop-and-search or arrest data. There is inherent bias in that data.”The report says use of predictive policing led to a spike in stop and search in Basildon, Essex, from September 2020 to March 2021. “The force stopped and searched more people in Basildon than the rest of the entire police force area. They stopped and searched Black people in Basildon almost 3.6 times more than white people … [and] used force against Black people almost four times as much as white people.”In London, after the Metropolitan police introduced predictive policing in Lambeth in 2020-21, the area had “the second highest volume of stop and search of all London boroughs”, the report says.A system used by Avon and Somerset police gives a risk score to individuals. One person referred to in the report as David said he had been targeted by police and left with post-traumatic stress disorder.He claims to have been stopped 50 times, including after putting a sticker on a lamp-post. He said: “I have therapy every week about some of the stuff that I’ve been through because of the police and how they’ve treated me over the past, say, three or four years It’s scandalous, to be honest. They made me feel like I don’t have any rights at all.”One resident of Grahame Park, north London, deemed as high crime, said: “It’s labelled a crime hotspot. So when the police enter the area, they’re in the mindset of ‘we’re in a dangerous community – the people here are dangerous’. It doesn’t matter if they’re young people, they’re still ‘dangerous’ and therefore ‘we can police them violently’ and they do police them violently.”Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK, said predictive policing had minimal or no effect on cutting crime. “The evidence that this technology keeps us safe just isn’t there; the evidence that it violates our fundamental rights is clear as day. We are all much more than computer-generated risk scores,” he said.“These technologies have consequences. The future they are creating is one where technology decides that our neighbours are criminals, purely based on the colour of their skin or their socioeconomic background.”A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Policing uses a wide range of data to help inform its response to tackling and preventing crime, maximising the use of finite resources. As the public would expect, this can include concentrating resources in areas with the most reported crime.“Hotspot policing and visible targeted patrols are the bedrock of community policing, and effective deterrents in detecting and preventing antisocial behaviour and serious violent crime, as well as improving feelings of safety.”They added: “It is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities whilst recognising the detrimental impact that tools such as stop and search can have, particularly on Black people.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceStop and searchRaceAmnesty InternationalnewsShareReuse this content"

It remains “in significantly enhanced attention for cybersecurity and collaborative work is ongoing to achieve the required improvements in this area”, the ONR said.Last year, Sellafield wasordered to pay almost £400,000after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings and made a formal apology to the court.The Guardian reported that the site’s systems had beenhacked by groups linked to Russia and China, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems.Sellafield has consistently maintained that it was not subjected to a “successful” cyber-attack.Paul Goldspring, the chief magistrate who ordered Sellafield to pay the fine, said in October’s sentencing that the prosecution did not offer evidence of a successful cyber-attack, even if it asserted that it was impossible for Sellafield to prove that the nuclear site had not been “effectively attacked”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Managing the nation’s nuclear legacy remains a priority, and we will continue to support Sellafield in delivering this vital mission.”Wilkinson said that an action plan over “many months” had allowed the company to improve the ONR’s confidence in its physical security.Sellafield declined to comment on its cybersecurity.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerNuclear LeaksNuclear wasteEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Since the election we’ve seen year-on-year wages after inflation growing at their fastest rate in three years – worth an extra £1,000 a year on average – but I know that millions of families are still struggling to make ends meet.”The chancellor is understood to be concerned that a rise in inflation through the spring and summer would spur public sector workers to demand more than the2.8% wage increasethe government has agreed can be paid from existing budgets.Graph of inflation riseCustomers with Virgin Media O2 broadband and mobile phone contracts taken out before 9 January are expected to be particularly affected by the latest inflation increase, and will see their bills increase by up to 7.5% from April.In a practice nowbanned by the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, the company increases its prices each year by 3.9% plus the February reading on the retail prices index, which was 3.6%. Ofcom announced the ban in July for all new contracts from January, aftera Guardian investigation last year exposed “greedflation”in the telecoms sector.Telecoms companies say the above-inflation price increases are needed to keep investing in their networks amid rising costs. Virgin Media replaced its inflation-linked policy with a £3.50 monthly increase from April, while O2 customers will face a flat £1.80 a month rise.A slower downward path for interest rates could weigh on the government’s finances by raising the cost of borrowing by more than expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent economic forecaster.The OBR, which will announce its twice-yearly report on the day of the chancellor’s financial statement next month, will on Wednesday give Reeves an update of its assessment of the economy and the outlook for public sector borrowing.It is understood that an earlier version of the report, which takes into account the Treasury’s revised tax and spending plans, judged that slower economic growth and an increase in borrowing costs wiped out the financial headroom the chancellor left for herself in last October’s budget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, pay rises are expected to track down this year while inflation increases, squeezing real disposable incomes.Public sector workers received only a 4.7% increase in December, compared with 6.2% in the private sector.The British Chambers of Commerce said: “Today’s data underlines the inflationary pressures in the economy right now and the real challenges businesses are facing.“Firms are having to deal with significant cost burdens which threaten to fuel inflation further. Within weeks they’ll be facing the hikes in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage.”The National Institute of Economic and Social Research predicted that January’s leap in inflation was likely to be short-lived. “While today’s ONS data shows annual CPI inflation rising to 3% in January 2025, its highest level in 10 months, this elevated figure is only transitory – due to base effects – and is expected to fall again in the coming months.”The ONS reported that the annual inflation rate for education rose to 7.5% in the year to January 2025, from 5% in December 2024. The only item that changed price in the education division was private school fees, where prices rose by 12.7% on the month but did not change a year ago, the ONS said.“A contributing factor to the rise in private school fees may have been education and boarding services provided by private schools becoming subject to VAT at the standard rate of 20%,” the ONS added.Separate data released on Wednesday showed that annual UK house-price inflation rose to 4.6% in December, up from 3.9% in the 12 months to November.Tenants continued to face proportionally larger increases in housing costs, with average UK private rents rising by 8.7% in the 12 months to January 2025, slightly slower than the 9.0% recorded in the 12 months to December 2024.Explore more on these topicsInflationBank of EnglandInterest ratesEconomicsOffice for National StatisticsRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

It is vital that we stand up for reproductive rights and against those who are working to undermine them.”The act, Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) 2024, passed by the Scottish parliament in June last year, prohibits protests against abortion within a 200-metre (650ft) area around a hospital or clinic which provides abortion services.In an attack on these policies at the Munich Security Conference, Vance said the Scottish and UK governments had “placed the basic liberties of religious Britons [in] the crosshairs”.He alleged: “This last October, just a few months ago, the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law.”John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, who regularly attends church, said earlier on Wednesday that Vance’s claims were inaccurate. “JD Vance is just wrong and that issue was extensively discussed during the passage of the bill,” he said.“On the letter issued to households, his claims were wrong about that letter as well, and no such point was put to residents whatsoever on private prayer.”In a statement, Police Scotland said: “We were made aware of a group of protesters having gathered in the Hardgate Road area of Glasgow around 2.05pm on Wednesday 19 February 2025.“Officers attended and a 74-year-old woman was arrested and charged in connection with breach of the exclusion zone.” The force added that she would be reported to prosecutors.The Daily Record newspaperreported that 40 Days for Life activists plan to hold daily demonstrationsbetween 5 March and 13 April outside the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow on Hardgate Road, where there is an abortion clinic.Swinney said abortion care was a central part of existing health and social care provision in Scotland.“I have no plans to change that,” he added. “It’s part and parcel of the offering we make. The buffer zone legislation was designed to essentially recognise that women accessing those services should be able to do so without any additional sense of pressure.”Mackay said: “We know the awful impact that these protests have had. Some of the testimonies from women who have had to endure them have been heartbreaking.“I urge 40 Days For Life and anyone else who is planning to protest in a safe access zone to think again, as they will be stopped and there will be consequences.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Seals already face various pressures, from plastic pollution to a reduction in foraging and habitat areas caused by climate breakdown.Bird flucan kill seals by causing pneumonia and encephalitis.The highly infectious variant of H5N1 is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds since 2021, and hasspread to mammalsand causedmass die-offsin sea lions and elephant seal pups.Dani Clifford, a marine conservation officer at theWildlifeTrusts, said: “Bird flu has had, and will continue to have, devastating impacts on birds, but we’re also concerned about the spread to marine mammals. Monitoring these animals is important to help us to understand the spread of bird flu, but what’s more important is that pressures on wildlife are reduced in the first place. This includes ensuring seals are not disturbed by people and dogs, and ensuring marine protected areas are safe from damaging activities.”The National Trust has asked visitors to Blakeney Point to keep their dogs on a lead as a precaution, and not to touch sick or dying wildlife.Sources at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said they thought the seals had contracted the disease by scavenging the meat from dead or dying infected birds, but they were staying vigilant over the risk of mammal-to-mammal transmission and were conducting further tests. The seal population could be more at risk during the breeding season, which runs from late October until early January, because seal pups have previously been found to have a higher mortality rate from bird flu than their parents.Explore more on these topicsBird fluWildlifeEnglandMammalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Crucially, the team stress, 23 of these exposures can be modified.In a further analysis, the team found age and sex together explained about half of the variation in risk of premature death, while the 25 environmental exposures together explained an additional 17% of the variation. By contrast, genetic predisposition for 22 major diseases explained less than 2% of additional variation.The environmental exposures were also more important than genes in explaining why some people have a higher risk of developing diseases of the lungs, heart and liver in the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson’s visit and the supposed lost chance for peace has relevance, given Trump is hoping to do a deal to end the war.A spokesperson for Johnson said they had nothing to add when approached about the Usher Hall event.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonEdinburghScotlandConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was granted refugee status and after five years was granted indefinite leave to remain. He was due to apply for British citizenship on 1 March.However, he is now unable to do so after governmentplans emerged last weekmaking it almost impossible for any refugee who arrives via “a dangerous journey” to become a British citizen, regardless of the time that has passed since they arrived in the UK. Tens of thousands of people are potentially affected by the new rules.According to the legal challenge submitted – a pre-action protocol – the change in the citizenship rules is “a source of great anxiety” to the man and has made him feel vulnerable in the UK because of the volatility of UK immigration laws. He fears being isolated from the rest of British society, and not being able to vote nor to travel freely.Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is representing the refugee, said: “It is upsetting for so many who had hoped for a new approach to now see this home secretary repeating the same mistakes as her various predecessors. For the sake of political expediency, [Yvette Cooper is] willing to roll out unlawful polices with the sole purpose of punishing migrants and refugees – those who are quite clearly of good character and eligible for citizenship.”The changes are contained in updated government guidance about good character requirements Because of their method of arrival in the UK, many refugees are no longer deemed by government to be of good character even though they rarely have any choice but to arrive via irregular means.The new guidance states: “Any person applying for citizenship from 10 February 2025, who previously entered the UK illegally, will normally be refused, regardless of the time that has passed since the illegal entry took place.”Before the new guidance was published, the Afghan refugee bringing the legal challenge would have met the good character rules. He has no criminal record, has complied with all immigration rules while in the UK, has a good command of English and plans to train as a mechanical engineer to contribute to British society and the economy.Because of laws passed by the previous government, it is now an offence to enter the country without permission despite the UK being signatory to international law treaties, such as the 1951 UN refugee convention, which state that asylum seekers and refugees should not be penalised for illegal entry. The convention says that states should make every effort to expedite naturalisation proceedings.The legal challenge argues that the new policy misrepresents the true legal position on the good character requirement in the 1981 British Nationality Act, and is therefore unlawful. It says it also breaches parts of the European convention on human rights and equality legislation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Days later, Charlotte’s family in the UK contacted the friend, saying they had lost contact with her.Last Monday, the friend, who had also not heard from Peet, reported her disappearance at a police station in Rio. However, as her last known contact was reportedly in São Paulo, the case was transferred to authorities there.São Paulo’s public security department said the case was being examined by missing person investigators and that the Department of Homicide and Protection of the Person would be assisting.In an interview withSky NewsCharlotte’s father, Derek Peet, said his daughter flew from Gatwick in London to São Paulo without informing her family, although it is unclear when exactly she travelled.“It’s very worrying, but I don’t have any more to say. I’m very concerned, but I just don’t know what’s going on. We’re just trying to pick up the pieces, really,” he said.Peet is fluent in Portuguese and had lived in Brazil recently, working as a freelance journalist for outlets such as the Independent, Times, Telegraph and Al Jazeera.In its statement, ACIE made “an appeal to the relevant authorities to intensify efforts to find the British journalist as soon as possible”.The British embassy in Brazil said it was supporting the family of the British citizen and was in contact with local authorities.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The family of one of his victims have blamed Stewart for her suicide.After he was sentenced at Newcastle crown court, Stewart’s former employer Royal Mail apologised to victims, their families and others who were targeted.Stewart, 63, of Amble,Northumberland, was arrested after one of his victims came forward to police in November 2021. He was charged with 10 counts of sexual assault, three counts of exposure and one count of harassment with fear of violence.Stewart denied the charges but after a nine-day trial in November he was found guilty of eight counts of sexual assault and all other charges.The court heard that Stewart had targeted five women, two of whom had died before his conviction.According to the BBC, Judge Robert Spragg agreed with one victim’s family that she had taken her own life as a “direct result” of Stewart’s actions and Royal Mail’s failure to respond to complaints about him.In a statement read to court, the family said: “We blame Stewart’s offending … for her mental state and eventual suicide.”One of his victims told the BBC that Stewart had initially been “really nice and friendly” and “always had a joke”. But one day, when handing her a package, she said he walked into her home and grabbed her breast.The woman said she had complained to Royal Mail but they did not inform police and just “swept it under a rock”.A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “These crimes were abhorrent and had significant, and in cases tragic, consequences for the victims.“Stewart abused his position of trust. This verdict reflects the seriousness of his offences. We would like to publicly apologise to the victims, their families and to others who were targeted.“The protection of our colleagues and customers is our utmost priority. Following this case, we commissioned an independent review. In line with its recommendations, we implemented changes across the organisation, including a multi-year campaign on sexual harassment and culture in the workplace, new internal reporting tools and clearer codes of conduct and expected behaviours.”Det Con Anthony Gourley, who led the Northumbria police investigation, urged victims of sexual abuse to come forward.He said: “Michael Stewart is a calculating and dangerous predator who abused his position to target his victims and subject them to traumatic ordeals.“He has been brought to justice thanks to the extraordinary strength and bravery of those abused to come forward and report the offences. Tragically, two of his victims died before seeing Stewart convicted and sentenced.”“We are committed to supporting all victims of sexual offences – and putting offenders before the courts. I would urge anyone who has been a victim – regardless of when the offences took place – to come forward. Our message is clear – we are here for you.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeNorthumberlandNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The group will release six hostages on Sunday and then transfer four more bodies next Thursday.That will complete the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, due to end on 1 March, leaving a further 58 hostages in the hands ofHamasand allied militant groups in Gaza. Israel believes that 34 of the remaining hostages are dead.The agreed plan for the second phase was for hostages and bodies of the dead to be exchanged for Palestinian detainees and prisoners in staggered groups. But Hamas suggested on Wednesday it was prepared to accelerate the process.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the group was ready to release all remaining hostages in one handover during the second phase.The official, Taher al-Nunu, said: “We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase.”Netanyahu has long resisted any talk about the second phase of the agreement, which would involve a complete military withdrawal fromGaza, as well as the handover of the remaining hostages, in return for hundreds more Palestinians held in Israeli jails.Completion of the second phase would in effect represent the end of the war, but the far-right wing of Netanyahu’s coalition adamantly opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside Gaza.The Israeli prime minister, however, has come under pressure to do so from Donald Trump’s special envoy, the US president’s friend and fellow real-estate developer, Steve Witkoff, whosaid over the weekend: “Phase two is absolutely going to begin.”Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on Tuesday that talks on the second phase would begin this week, but a day later the timing remained unclear.Under the original agreement, talks over how the second phase would be implemented were supposed to begin at the beginning of February. Not much time now remains before phase two is due to begin on 1 March, and there are contentious issues to be resolved.Under the agreement, Israeli troops are due to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, in the first eight days of phase two. That is something the Israeli prime minister has previously refused to do, emphasising the corridor’s strategic importance.At the same time, Netanyahu is demanding that the second phase include the disarming of Hamas and its removal as an organisation, but he has been hazy about who would replace them in running the territory. He embraced Trump’s declaration earlier this week that the US would take control of the Gaza Strip and that the entire Palestinian population of more than 2.2 million would somehow be moved out of their homeland.Few in the region believe Trump’s proposal will be carried out. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) joined Egypt and Jordan in opposing the plan, which would require the cooperation of neighbouring countries to absorb the deported Palestinians.There was no official account of a meeting between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the UAE leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. However, a state-linked newspaper,the National, later reportedthat Mohammed had told Rubio: “The UAE strongly opposes any attempt to displace the Palestinian people from Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

They had also forged certificates to guarantee “authenticity”, police said.View image in fullscreenThe workshop also contained art catalogues that the fraudsters used to sell the works.Photograph: Carabinieri cultural heritage protection squadThe investigation began after police monitored sales sites and came across hundreds of paintings of dubious quality bearing the signatures of painters who were active in the 19th and 20th centuries.Other artists whose work was forged include Mario Puccini, Giacomo Balla and the Belgian painter Anna De Weert.

Trump signed an order withdrawing the protections just hours into his second term.‘The path forward is clear’: how Trump taking office has ‘turbocharged’ climate accountability effortsRead moreAnother related challenge, filed by many of the same groups, calls for a court to reinstate a 2021 decision affirming protections from nearly 130m acres in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.“The Arctic Ocean has been protected from US drilling for nearly a decade, and those protections have been affirmed by the federal courts,” said Sierra Weaver, a senior attorney at the organization Defenders of Wildlife, which is a plaintiff in the case. “Though these coastlines have been protected, the administration is showing no restraint in seeking to hand off some of our most fragile and pristine landscapes for the oil industry’s profit.”The lawsuits will probably be the first of hundreds of environmental lawsuits filed by green groups against the Trump administration. During his first weeks in office, Trump has already rolled back a swath of Biden-era environmental protections while freezing green spending programs – part of his pledge to boost the fossil fuel industry.Trump says the US mustboostfossil fuels– which are responsible for the vast majority of global warming – to meet demand and ensure that the United States remains a global energy leader. The US is currently producing more oil and gas than any other country in history.The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment about the litigation.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisUS politicsFossil fuelsDonald TrumpAlaskaWaternewsShareReuse this content"

They have a lot to do in the United States.”The designation, which came into effect on Thursday, marks a shift in how the threat from certain organised crime groups is perceived by US agencies and augurs a greater role for the CIA and the US military.Trump’s pick for the new US ambassador in the Mexico, Ron Johnson, served as ambassador in El Salvador from 2019 to 2021 and before that spent decades in the CIA and the US army, including as a Green Beret, the elite army unit that conducts covert operations abroad.However, it is still unclear just what effect the designation will have. US agencies already have an array of tools at their disposal to go after transnational organised crime groups by restricting their members’ abilities to travel or do business.The main difference will be the range of people that can be targeted, which will widen to include anyone who provides “material support” to the cartels.Material support could mean anything between logistical support and financial services, training and lodging, guns and false documents. But exactly how that is interpreted will depend on political will.While the designation of cartels as FTOs itself will not authorise US military action in Mexico, some fear it is a first step towards it. Trump has already suggested bombing drug labs, and has reportedly discussedsending special forcesto kill cartel leaders.Since Trump returned to power, the US military has increased its airborne surveillance of the cartels along the US-Mexico border, while the CIA has stepped up drone flights over Mexico to hunt for fentanyl labs – though Sheinbaum said that this was with Mexico’s permission.Earlier this month, Trump delayed his threatened 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico after Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 more soldiers to the border to reduce fentanyl trafficking and migration.It is unclear how those soldiers will reduce the flow of fentanyl, given that it is so potent that only relatively small volumes are moved, and thatthe great majority is trafficked through ports of entry by US citizens.Nonetheless, Sheinbaum said that Trump in return agreed to help reduce arms trafficking. Hundreds of thousands of guns sold in the US each year end up in the hands of Mexican groups now designated as terrorist organisations.Sheinbaum has said that Mexico could expand its ongoing lawsuit against US gunmakers to includealleged complicity with terror groups.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasDrugsDrugs tradeFentanylDonald TrumpClaudia SheinbaumnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s only one thing that counts now, and that is speed.”She said Russian presidentVladimir Putinwas in the process of rearmament. “We don’t know what he is planning, but we know that he and Russia are in the process of rearming.”Responding to the US president’s false claim on Tuesday thatUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “started” the war with Russia, Frederiksen said: “Ukraine has not started any war. Ukraine has not wanted any war.”She added: “There is only one aggressive party.”The 50bn Danish kroner “acceleration fund” will be used to make rapid investments in fighting capability aimed at strengthening short-term defence capabilities and meetingNatorequirements.The Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said: “Within two years,Russiacould pose a credible threat to one or several Nato countries if Nato does not build up its own military power in the same rate as Russia. This calls for swift political action.”The announcement came amid a mood of panic across Europe after a dramatic foreign policy shift in Washington.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Wednesdayheld a meeting on Ukraineto coordinate Europe’s response to what he described as the “existential threat” posed by Russia.Why Europe’s defence spending may need a bold new approachRead moreAlso on Wednesday, Sweden and Poland agreed to “strengthen and deepen cooperation” politically and in civil protection and civil defence, citing the worsened security situation across Europe.In a statement of intent, the Polish interior minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, and Swedish civil defence minister, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, said they would work together to improve national resilience and preparedness strategies, provide Ukraine support on strengthening national resilience, improve security in the Baltic region and cooperate on “identifying and analysing hybrid threats and countering its consequences”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkEuropeNatoRussiaVladimir PutinShareReuse this content"

Ansa reported that the service would be suspended until an internal investigation into the matter had concluded.During a meeting last week with Copasir, the parliamentary committee for the intelligence services, Giovanni Caravelli, Aise’s chief, admitted the agency had used the Paragon spyware but not to monitor journalists or activists.But the union FNSI, which with the Italian Order of Journalists submitted the legal complaint “against unknown individuals”, is sceptical.“Was Francesco Cancellato the only journalist in Italy targeted? We don’t think so,” said Alessandra Costante, FNSI’s secretary general. “We want clarity, we want journalists to be able to do their job without the risk of being intercepted. We’re dealing with facts that not only violate the criminal code but the constitution itself. It is also extremely serious that the government has decided not to report to parliament.”It remains unclear which government body may have ordered the use of the Paragon spyware and whether any such use of spyware was cleared by a judge.Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister, accused the government of “wounding democracy” while Federico Fornaro, an MP for the Democratic party, said the government’s avoidance of questions was “a slap in the face to parliament”.Spyware was used to target Luca Casarini, founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, who has been a vocal critic of Italy’s alleged complicity in abuses suffered by migrants in Libya, according to an alert Casarini received fromWhatsApp.The US-based messaging app said in late January that 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society, had been targeted by entities using Paragon spyware. It has sent alerts to individuals who were targeted.“By refusing to answer the questions in parliament, the government is laying bare its deep difficulties,” said Casarini, who has reported the surveillance against him to prosecutors in Palermo. “Regardless of which agency deployed this spyware against me, these wiretaps are entirely illegal. There is no doubt that the targets are political opponents of the government. This is a tactic of authoritarian governments.”On Wednesday, his NGO released information conveyed to him by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society and has analysed Casarini’s phone. The Toronto researchers told the NGO they hoped to trace the agency responsible for the attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In practice, a prime minister, interior minister or justice minister may authorise intelligence officials to intercept communications and conversations, or to collect metadata from individuals deemed a “threat to national security”.“Legal experts have long criticised this practice, noting that the targeted individuals have no means of defence,” said Inzerillo.Explore more on these topicsItalySurveillanceGiorgia MeloniPress freedomWhatsAppNewspapers & magazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In astatement, Srinagar police said that the raids were “based on credible intelligence regarding the clandestine sale and distribution of literature promoting the ideology of a banned organisation”, and that 668 books were seized in all.The books were mostly published by Markazi Maktaba Islami Publishers, based in New Delhi, which is affiliated with the Indian branch of Jamaat-e-Islami, one of the largest religious and political organisations in the Indian subcontinent.“These books were found to be in violation of legal regulations, and strict action is being taken against those found in possession of such material,” police said.In February 2019, Indian authorities banned Jamaat-e-Islami, declaring it an “unlawful association”, for five years. In August that year, Narendra Modi’s government scrapped the region’s partial autonomy. Therepression of human rightsin the region has since escalated.Jamaat-e-Islamileaders saidthat the seizure of books “is unjust, unconstitutional, and a violation of fundamental rights”, adding that the books are “legally published” in Delhi. “If the government has any security concerns, we are fully prepared to cooperate with any investigation.”“The current approach appears arbitrary and unfair, as it does not even fall within the scope of a legitimate investigation”, they added. “Instead, it reflects an attempt to marginalise us.”The Kashmir conflict began after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, and both India and Pakistan claimed the region. For decades, insurgent groups have fought Indian rule, and tens of thousands have been killed in the conflict.When armed rebellion broke out in 1989, Kashmir’s largest militant group, Hizbul Mujahideen, declared it was Jamaat-e-Islami’s military wing. However, in a petition against the 2019 ban, Jamaat-e-Islam claimed it had “never supported violence” and “never been associated with the Hizbul Mujahideen”. In February last year, the ban on the organisation was extended for a further five years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

According to the companies, this would violate Dos Santos’s freedom of speech in the US.Although Moraes’s orders do not pertain to Trump’s companies, TMTG contends that Truth Social depends on Rumble’s technology for cloud hosting, video streaming and other back-end services; therefore, it risks encountering “operational challenges” in the US due to Moraes’s orders.Moraes has not yet commented on the case.The companies seek a judgment “declaring Justice Moraes’s Gag Orders unenforceable in the United States”.Mendonça, who is also a lawyer, said she could see no legal basis for the case in either Brazilian or US law. “It is truly an attempt to create confusion, apply political pressure, and weaken Moraes’s standing,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He considered the historical Carry Ons, complete with period costume, to be the best in the series.It was downhill from there, with Holloway’s roles including the lecherous coach driver in Carry On Camping (1969), taking girls from Chayste Place finishing school to Devon and, while at a hostel there, tripping over, crashing intoBarbara Windsorand accidentally ripping off her nightdress.View image in fullscreenJulian Holloway as Major Shorthouse with Sid James as Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in Carry On Up the Khyber, 1968, Holloway’s third film in the series and the one he enjoyed the most.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockCast in the role after Jim Dale was unavailable, Holloway was set to have a screen romance with one of the girls, played by Trisha Noble, but most of the scenes – including one of him rescuing her from a goat in a shower – ended up on the cutting-room floor.In a similar vein was Carry On Loving (1970), in which Holloway was a highly strung photographer on a quest to find a well-endowed model. His other Carry On parts were as a railway ticket collector in Follow That Camel (1967); Simmons, in charge of X-rays, in Doctor (1967); Sir Thomas, one of Henry VIII’s riding pals, in Henry (1971); Roger, a friend of Lewis Boggs (Richard O’Callaghan), in At Your Convenience (1971); and Major Butcher, a medical officer, in England (1976).He also appeared in the 1973 TV special Carry On Christmas, but eventually turned down the offer of another movie. “My agent got a message from the casting director to say that if I didn’t do the film I would never work withPeter Rogers[the producer] again!” recalled Holloway. “I said, ‘OK, fine by me.’”In between theCarry On films– which were known for the derisory fees paid to actors, and for which he was never paid more than £300 – Holloway was becoming one of the busiest character actors on television, in both comedies and dramas.View image in fullscreenJulian Holloway, left, in a 1982 episode of the TV series Minder, with George Cole.Photograph: Fremantle Media/Rex/ShutterstockHis stage career was progressing, too. He took over fromMichael Gambonas Tom in Alan Ayckbourn’s trilogy The Norman Conquests in the West End (Globe and Apollo theatres, 1975-76).Later, in a well-received revival of My Fair Lady on Broadway starring Richard Chamberlain as Higgins (Virginia theatre, 1993-94), Holloway played Alfred P Doolittle, recreating the role taken by his father in the original 1950s New York and London productions, as well as the 1964 film version. “The admirably boisterous Julian Holloway, as Eliza’s dustman father, is understandably very like his own illustrious father, Stanley,” wrote Clive Barnes in the Stage.The only son of Stanley Holloway’s second marriage, to Violet Lane, an actor and former chorus dancer, Julian was born in Watlington, Oxfordshire, and brought up in Penn, Buckinghamshire. After leaving Harrow school, he trained at Rada in London. While still studying, he was an extra in 1961 in the film Dentist on the Job and an episode of The Avengers, and went to the US to appear in the sitcom Our Man Higgins (1962-63) as Quentin, nephew of the prim English butler played by his father in the starring role.On graduating from Rada in 1963, he joinedBeryl Reidand others in the revue All Square, which included a West End run at the Vaudeville theatre. Three years later, he starred as Jimmy, alongside Victor Henry as Ian, in Christopher Hampton’s first play, When Did You Last See My Mother?, performed by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court, then the Comedy Theatre.In the following decade, Holloway starred in a revival of Arsenic and Old Lace as Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic dealing with a murderous family and the police (Whitehall and Westminster theatres, 1977).View image in fullscreenJulian Holloway on stage with Britt Ekland in the show Mate! at the Comedy theatre, London, 1978.Photograph: Steve Burton/Getty ImagesHis screen career was given an early boost when the director Richard Lester cast him in small roles in the Beatles film A Hard Day’s Night (1964) and The Knack… and How to Get It (1965), although he struggled for a while to get beyond bit parts on the big screen.Television proved more fruitful. He was Corky, hapless friend of the title character created by PG Wodehouse (played byAnton Rodgers), in Ukridge (1968); Algernon Moncrieff in The Importance of Being Earnest (1972); a mobster in The Sweeney (1975); Jack Favell, the heroine’s cousin and lover, in Rebecca (1979); the English politician Harry Cust in Nancy Astor (1982); and Paterson in the Doctor Who adventure Survival (1989). He voiced the title character in the British cartoon Captain Z and the Zee Zone (1991-92).After providing various voices for the American animated series James Bond Jr (1991), Holloway settled in Los Angeles in 1992. Eventually, he divided his time between California and Britain, left stage acting behind and became a successful voice artist on US television series such as Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future (2002, after a 2001 TV movie), Father of the Pride (2004-05) and Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2010-2020).Back in Britain, Holloway played Uncle George in the TV series My Uncle Silas (2001-03).Both his marriages, to the actors Zena Walker (1971) and Debbie Wheeler (1991), ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughter, the author and former model Sophie Dahl, from a brief relationship in the mid-1970s with the writer and actor Tessa Dahl.Julian Robert Stanley Holloway, actor, born 24 June 1944; died 16 February 2025Explore more on these topicsCarry On filmsobituariesShareReuse this content"

To me, it’s not only an eulogy to cinema, or a meditation on those loves – both friendships and romantic we lose over the course of a life – it’s a visceral reminder of the love I had (and still have) for love.Brad Elliott, NairobiPhone call scene in It’s a Wonderful LifeFrank Capra, 1946After a row, George and Mary’s relationship looks to be on the rocks before it’s even started. Then they are forced to share the phone to talk to a friend long-distance. With their heads almost touching, we watch as their mutual attraction develops and renders them virtually speechless, ending in the most passionate kiss.Liz, WitneyThe final scene ofCity LightsCharlie Chaplin, 1931The top of the best is theCity Lightsending. I defy anybody to look at it without a tear.Andre, MontrealThe new diary in Bridget Jones’s DiarySharon Maguire, 2001Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) buys Renée Zellweger (Bridget Jones) a new diary at end of Bridget Jones’s Diary.Sean, MissouriCampfire declaration of love in MyOwnPrivate IdahoGus Van Sant, 1991View image in fullscreenKeanu Reeves and River Phoenix in My Own Private Idaho.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyMike (River Phoenix) and Scott (Keanu Reeves) are sex workers on a road trip in search of Mike’s long-lost family. Mike asks Scott what he means to him, before Scott says: “Mike, you’re my best friend.” It becomes clear that Mike is in love with Scott (the film has been building to this moment). “I mean, for me, I could love somebody, even if I wasn’t paid for it. I love you and you don’t pay me,” confesses Mike. Scott pulls Mike towards him and holds him, before kissing the top of his head. Although his advances have been rejected, it’s such a tender moment.Jessica, BrightonWhen Lorens tells Martine ‘All things are possible’ in Babette’s FeastGabriel Axel, 1987Two sisters in a Jutland village choose family duty over love. As a young woman, Martine reluctantly rejected her suitor Lorens. After a 49-year separation, during his first return to the village, and after the feast, Lorens quietly says to Martine, “I have been with you every day of my life. Tell me you know that …” His speech ends with “… in this beautiful world of ours, all things are possible”.Julia, New JerseyBattlefield kiss in Gone Withthe WindVictor Fleming, 1939On their flight from General Sherman’s sacking of Atlanta, Rhett leaves Scarlett on the road to join the Confederate army for its final stand at Gettysburg. Rhett, with no illusions about Scarlett, professes his love for her and forces a kiss. The lighting and the script are incredibly romantic.Maxine, New York CityWhen they pass on the street in Your NameMakoto Shinkai, 2016In Your Name, directed by Makoto Shinkai, there is a heart-stopping moment at the end where the main love interests (who have been communicating across time) pass each other in the street – they both aren’t sure if the other is who they think it is. Out of politeness, awkwardness, they both continue to walk away … then at the same time, both turn and shout to check if it can really be them. Such a beautiful ending to a beautifully animated film.Chloe, London‘I’m just a girl …’ in Notting HillRogerMichell, 1999“I’m just a girl standing in front of a boy …” It’s difficult not to fall for Julia Roberts in that scene. Unforgettable.Francisco, Brazil‘You had me at hello’ in Jerry MaguireCameron Crowe, 1996The scene fromJerry Maguirewhen Jerry (Tom Cruise) bares his soul to his wife (Renée Zellweger). She interrupts him, telling him to just shut up, and you can see in his face the crushing realisation that he may have blown his last chance with her. Then she says, “You had me at hello”, and you see him instantly go from heartbreak to joy. It gets me every single time.Larry, Arlington, TexasThe ‘obvious bit’ in The WorstPerson in the WorldJoachim Trier, 2022The obvious bit, where time stands still for all but two people in Oslo, as Julie rushes across the city to meet Eivind. It’s pure cinema, expressing that “we are the only people in the universe” feeling we get during the adrenaline rush of infatuation, especially when running towards emotions we’ve been resisting.When they meet, Julie and Eivind are the only real things in a fantasy world, or the only fantastical things in the real world. And I guess that’s the point: the most romantic moments in life, however brief, separate our perspective from everyone else alive.Ned, LondonSteve and Peggy dance in Avengers: EndgameAnthony and Joe Russo, 2019I cried watchingAvengers: Endgame– the scene where Peggy Carter and Steve Rogers (Captain America)dance to It’s Been a Long, Long Time. It is a happy/sad, moving romantic moment – they’ve been apart for so long and finally – reunited – they dance. The song itself is happy/sad romantic. A reflection of the heartache and heartbreak of its time – when so many never got that promised dance.Cecilia, North CarolinaFinal scene of I KnowWhere I’m Going!Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1945It’s been more than 40 years since I first saw it, but the final scene of I Know Where I’m Going! makes me cry every time. The expression on Roger Livesey’s face when he hears the pipes in the distance and then he and Wendy Hiller run into each other’s arms and all that glorious uncertainty she’s accepted because she’s certain she loves him and it’s reciprocated. There is nothing else like it.Penelope, NebraskaWaterfall scene in The Last of the MohicansMichael Mann, 1992View image in fullscreenMadeleine Stowe and Daniel Day-Lewis in The Last of the Mohicans.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/Allstar“You stay alive. No matter what occurs, I will find you! No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you!” Of course it helps that it is Daniel Day-Lewis saying it.Melanie, LondonEating spaghetti inLady and the TrampWalt Disney productions,1955I was a 10-year-old when I saw the movie in a local theatre. The scene was full of humour, fun, and a wonderful depiction of two shy beings discovering love. I hoped that someday I would experience that and share a plate of spaghetti like Lady and Tramp did. Well, one out of two ain’t bad. I discovered love, but have yet to share a plate of spaghetti with her like Tramp did.Jeff, New HampshireSubtle seduction scene in SwadesAshutosh Gowariker, 2004No yodelling on the Alps or dancing through picturesque mustard fields for our king of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, here. In a slow-burn of a segment, he romances the beauteous Gayatri Joshi with flickering eyelids and the shyest of smiles, as she drapes him in traditional Indian wear. AR Rahman’s soft tabla beats in the background, echoing their wayward hearts, and it’s wand-waving movie magic yet again! Not a touch, not even a graze, not a kiss; pure sensual nirvana.Krishna,BengaluruNew Year’sEve scene in When HarryMet Sally …Rob Reiner, 1989View image in fullscreenBilly Crystal and Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally …Photograph: Ronald GrantHarry’s declaration of love inWhen Harry Met Sally…, because he sees her for who she is and loves every bit of her because of it. To me, there is no modern film that describes exactly what a woman wants from a man: a best friend who not only allows her to be herself unapologetically, but is head over heels for her for it.Lindsay, OhioThe quarrel in Marriage ItalianStyleVittorio De Sica, 1964In Matrimonio all’Italiana (Marriage Italian style), the movie by De Sica based on the adaptation of the play Filumena Marturano by De Filippo, with Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. The scene of the quarrel between the two characters, which ends with a fatal kiss, almost in spite of themselves. Love, passion and chemistry in a nutshell.Susanna, MilanChurch scene inThe GraduateMike Nichols, 1967Hands down the best is the end of the classic 1967 film The Graduate. (If you haven’t seen it, stop reading this to avoid the spoiler alert and go watch it as a high priority!) The tension is off the charts, with the young bride (Katharine Ross) at the church, about to marry the wrong guy.Mid-ceremony, the previously discarded guy (Dustin Hoffman) – who only finds out about the wedding at the last minute – manages to reach the church and get her attention in a dramatic way from the other side of a wall of glass. What will she do? Heart in my mouth! It’s unbearably intense! Oh, the excitement as she makes a split-second decision and suddenly does a runner! And the look on his face as soon as he registers what’s happened? Chaos ensues! In among all the chaos, they reunite (still running!). It is euphoric! It’s the sort of ending where you just want to rewind and watch it again and again.Maia, QueenslandCrossing paths one last time in The Way We WereSydney Pollack, 1973For me, Sydney Pollack’s 1973 masterpiece The Way We Were, starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, is the ultimate romantic film. The most romantic moment comes at the very end when Katie and Hubbell cross paths by chance one last time on a bustling Manhattan street.Their silent understanding, the undeniable love still between them, and the painful realisation that their time has passed – it’s all so devastatingly beautiful. Every time I watch Katie gently brush that stray lock of hair from Hubbell’s forehead in the final scene, I’m screaming in my head: “Come on, you two! Just this once – change your minds, make it work!”Nadja, London‘I love you.’‘I know.’ in The Empire Strikes BackIrvin Kershner, 1980Leia: “I love you.” Han: “I know.” The wonderful and sorely missed Carrie Fisher playing the snooty and very intelligent princess finally admits her true feelings for the “scruffy-looking nerf herder” Han Solo. His response is perfect. I was only 12 and I got it.Kate, BrightonThe dancing scene in The Sound ofMusicRobert Wise, 1965Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer dance in The Sound of Music.The scene inThe Sound of Music, where Maria is dancing with the children in the courtyard while all the sophisticated guests dance in the ballroom, and the captain appears. It’s such an innocent scene but the chemistry between Maria and the captain as they dance absolutely fizzles. Even as a little girl I felt that this was an absolutely crucial moment for these characters. This scene also started my lifelong obsession with brooding main characters, so perfectly (albeit begrudgingly at the time) portrayed by Christopher Plummer in this film.Ellie, South KoreaLara and Yurialone together inDoctor ZhivagoDavid Lean, 1965View image in fullscreenOnar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.Photograph: Cinetext/Mgm/AllstarIn David Lean’s epic Doctor Zhivago, at 2hrs 40min in, Zhivago and his lover are in bed together knowing that both could be arrested any day: Zhivago for desertion; Lara for being married to the leader of the losing army. Lara says: “If our days are really numbered, Yuri …” He interjects: “Yes, we better live them, before we are parted.” It is a fatalistic moment when love outshines the appalling circumstances of their time. They are resigned to be forcibly parted, but choose to spend every last minute together.Tim, YorkshireThe ending in Eternal Sunshine of the SpotlessMindMichel Gondry, 2004When we discover that, despite everything, Joel and Clementine (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) have found each other again – and even knowing how brutally it ended last time, they want to do it all over again.Aileen, ScotlandExplore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsCinema ParadisoIt's a Wonderful LifeCity LightsBridget Jones' DiaryGone With The WindfeaturesShareReuse this content"

None of us were really outstanding musicians in a lot of ways, but I think we were trying to be as inventive as we possibly could, so that we worked well together as a band.”Buckler’s pivotal role in creating the Jam’s sound helped them to become one of the most successful and influential of British bands, first at the forefront of the punk explosion and then as a more reflective outfit under the influence of soul, Motown, the Who, the Kinks and Small Faces.View image in fullscreenRick Buckler on drums for the Jam in 1979.Photograph: Steve Joester/ShutterstockHis drumming featured on six highly popular and critically acclaimed studio albums from 1977 up to the band’s split in 1982, as well as on 18 consecutive top 40 singles in the UK, four of which went to No 1.Buckler was born in Woking inSurrey, to Bill, a postman turned telephone engineer, and Peggy (nee White), a factory worker at the James Walker engineering firm, a big local employer. With his twin, Peter, and two much older brothers, John and Andrew, he grew up in a dilapidated terrace house in a street where nearby homes were soon being demolished in a postwar clearance programme.His parents were members of the Baptist church, and as a boy he enjoyed going to weekly services – mainly for the music – as well as annual seaside holidays with other members of the congregation. At Sheerwater county secondary school in Woking he was in the same year as Foxton and well ahead of Weller, who was almost three years their junior.View image in fullscreenThe Jam, from left Rick Buckler, Bruce Foxton and Paul Weller, in Sheffield in 1979.Photograph: Virginia Turbett/RedfernsWeller formed the Jam as a loose four-piece in 1972, with Buckler joining soon afterwards, appearing in one of the band’s first shows at the Sheerwater youth club. Self-taught by listening to records, he had been messing around on the drums with his brother Peter, who played the bass, when he met Weller and another early Jam member, Steve Brookes, while practising in the school music room.With the departure of Brookes in 1974, the band reconfigured in three parts, with Weller switching from bass to guitar as Foxton moved into his place, establishing the dynamic line-up that would soon take the British music scene by storm.At 16 Buckler had started A-levels, including one in technical drawing, but after a year he abandoned his studies to concentrate on the Jam, while becoming a trainee draughtsman at the same factory as his mother.Over the next four years he held down that job while playing a relentless schedule of gigs in pubs and clubs across the south of England. Initially reliant on cover versions, the Jam gradually began to evolve their own repertoire of songs written by Weller, and when punk burst into the open in London in 1976, they sharpened and toughened up their act under the influence of the Sex Pistols and the Clash, appearing with the latter on their fabled White Riot tour in 1977.View image in fullscreenThe Jam on stage at the Royal College of Art in London, 1977. From left, Bruce Foxton, Paul Weller and Rick Buckler.Photograph: Erica Echenberg/RedfernsStanding out in appearance from their contemporaries with their dark suits and ties, Buckler, Weller and Foxton were nonetheless an integral part of the punk movement, as they proved with their fiery 1977 debut album, In the City.But their next album, This Is the Modern World (also 1977), began to show signs of a more measured approach, crystallised in their monumental next album, All Mod Cons, which followed in 1978 and featured the classic singleDown in the Tube Station at Midnight, the cover of which showed Buckler, fag in hand, standing precariously close to the edge of a London Underground platform as a train hurtled into the station.The Jam’s fifth album, Sound Affects, contained a rare writing credit for the drummer onMusic for the Last Couple, composed jointly with Weller and Foxton. It reached No 2 in the charts in 1980 before its successor, The Gift (1982) made it to No 1 with the inclusion of the chart-topping singleTown Called Malice, on which Buckler was on top form.View image in fullscreenRick Buckler, centre, with fellow Gift members Bruce Foxton, left. and Russell Hastings, in 2008.Photograph: ShutterstockAt that point the world seemed to be the band’s oyster – until Weller called a unilateral and unexpected halt to proceedings by announcing the Jam’s disbandment just a few months later.The end came as a severe shock to Buckler – “everything I’d got out of bed for the previous 10 years had gone,”he said, adding that “Paul was probably the only person on the planet who thought it was a good idea”. The split was rendered even more painful by Weller’s decision to cut Buckler and Foxton dead, refusing to speak to either of them for many years afterwards.Interview with Rick BucklerWith little option but to get on with his life, Buckler went on to set up a five-piece band, Time UK. But after two years and three singles (their first,The Cabaret, sold nearly 60,000 copies), they folded, at which point he forged a new alliance with Foxton to create Sharp, with Time UK’s vocalist Jimmy Edwards – a project that survived barely 12 months.In subsequent years Buckler spent time with the Highliners, a London-based psychobilly band, did studio production work, and even worked as a roadie for a period before setting up as a cabinet maker and carpenter in the Woking area, where he remained all his life.There was a return to live music in 2005 when he set up the Gift to play Jam material on tours around the UK, with Russell Hastings on vocals and guitar and Dave Moore on bass. In 2007 Foxton took over from Moore, but two years later Buckler left, after which the band adopted a new name, From the Jam.Having collaborated in 1993 with Foxton to write The Jam: Our Story, Buckler was later co-author of two other Jam-related books, That’s Entertainment: My Life in the Jam (2015) andThe Jam1982 (2022).Shortly before his death he had embarked on a series of “in conversation” nights in which he reminisced about his Jam days, until the venture was cut short by his sudden ill health.In 1985 he married Lesley Hudson. She survives him along with their two children, Jason and Holly.Rick (Paul Richard) Buckler, musician, born 6 December 1955; died 17 February 2025Explore more on these topicsThe JamPaul WellerPop and rockSurreyobituariesShareReuse this content"

Most of the time, they would call me over and say, “You’ve got to photograph this!”’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 19 Feb 2025 10.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 10.08 ESTShareIhadn’t met Aquilla Flemming before I photographed her giving birth. I was sitting on my couch at home when her midwife Chemin texted to say there was a woman in labour and she had given permission for me to take pictures. It was my day off, so I hesitated at first. But as soon as I got to the birthing centre I was glad I had come.When I arrived, Aquilla and her partner were outside, under a pepper tree. She was sitting on a birthing ball and they were holding hands. It was such a beautiful moment – the birth was special from the outset. Chemin had worked with Aquilla’s mother too, so there was this generational thing. The woman holding Storie, as the baby was called, is a student midwife. It was taken right after Storie was born. She’s still connected to the placenta – you can see the cord in the bottom of the frame.This shot was part of my projectExtreme Pain, Extreme Joy, first published in the New York Times in October 2020. It began when I was thinking about how women were being affected by the pandemic. I had heard a lot of stories about people being forced to give birth alone and I wondered whether it would lead to a rise in home births as people became afraid to go into hospital.An Amish mother pulled out from the project, as she felt she was too recognisableI had a friend who was a doula and I began to talk to midwives in Los Angeles, who introduced me to mothers. A few invited me to photograph their births. I didn’t have any children at the time, and the first birth I witnessed was nothing like I had imagined – it was a long process. The more births I attended, the more I noticed the patterns of slowness and boredom between frenzied moments of activity, as well as how unique each birth was. It’s such a huge thing; such an extreme life change. I hadn’t fully understood that until I had my own daughter a year ago.There were so many amazing takeaways from this project, about how strong women are, as well as the empathy of the midwives, whose role is so intense they’d often do back-to-back births without any sleep. The energy in the room was always insane, with everyone doing their job to bring the baby into the world. The air was crackling.A few women having home births ended up having to be taken to the hospital, and at that point, due to Covid protocol, I couldn’t go along. Otherwise I took cues from the mothers and midwives but I was never asked to leave the room. Most of the time they would call me over and say: “You’ve got to photograph this!”I would never publish anything the mothers weren’t happy with. Having them feel safe when they were in such a vulnerable position was my priority. Only one Amish mother I worked with pulled out, as she felt she was too recognisable. I still get updates from some, and photographs of their children, which is really nice. Aquilla has another child now.My pregnancy was complicated because ofvasa praevia, and the birth was pretty traumatic. I ended up having a C-section and my baby was in intensive care for two months. I never documented anything like that, but I know no birth is the same, and there are many more layers to this project yet to be done, many different stories to tell.Maggie Shannon’s CVView image in fullscreenMaggie Shannon.Photograph: Brittany CarmichaelBorn: Boston, 1987.Trained: Hampshire College (BFA) and the School of Visual Arts (MFA).Influences: “David Lynch,FSA photographers,Tina Barney,Martin Parr.”High point:“When someone says my work makes them feel seen.”Low point: “All the scary unknowns of my 20s.”Top Tip: “Don’t be afraid to ask questions.”Extreme Pain, Extreme Joy by Maggie Shannon, is published byMother Tongue.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotArtChildbirthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery ModeDiscovery Mode gets artists noticed in exchange for a 30% royalty reduction. A new book suggests that the platform is squeezing musicians and misleading listenersLiz PellyWed 19 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 10.38 ESTShareIn November 2020, Spotify published an opaque headline on its company blog: “Amplifying Artist Input in Your Personalised Recommendations.” The post introduceda new program called Discovery Mode, which would ask artists to accept lower royalty rates in exchange for algorithmic promotion. It was pay-to-play, but Spotify introduced the scheme using neutral language: artists would be able to “identify music that’s a priority for them”, which would become one of “thousands” of data inputs influencing how Spotify delivers “the perfect song for the moment, just for you”. Rather than charge an upfront fee, “labels or rights-holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalised listening sessions where Spotify provided this service”.Participating artists and labels take a 30% royalty reduction on tracks enrolled in the program, when they are discovered through its channels. Only tracks more than 30 days old are eligible. Notably, there have been no signs that Spotify plans to publicly label which songs are enrolled: a lack of disclosure that has caused many music advocacy groups to liken Discovery Mode to theradio payolaof the 1950s, which was eventually outlawed by the US Federal Trade Commission. (Though the company points out that it has published a broad guide tounderstanding recommendationson Spotify, including a paragraph on “commercial considerations”.)In the early 1960s, in what became known as “the Payola hearings”, the US government outlawed the practice of radio stations accepting under-the-table cash in exchange for airplay without disclosure. According to several accounts of the day’s payola practices, sometimes DJs were handed stacks of cash, but other times they were offered fake songwriting credits or a percentage of royalties. And while making payola illegal did not automatically make mainstream radio more fair – some say that now there exists just an “institutionalised” form of payola – outlawing it sent a message about the responsibility of regulators to take corporate deception of the public seriously. Payola was outlawed, in part, because regulators said accepting money in exchange for plays could artificially inflate popularity and mislead listeners.View image in fullscreenStatistician Bernard Goldstein gives evidence to the payola hearings in April 1960.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveSpotify, of course, framed Discovery Mode – which wasn’t exactly replicating the terms of radio payola – as democratising. OneSpotifyemployee explained it this way: “We’re not asking for any upfront budget or payment, which means there’s no barrier to entry.” More artists would now have the freedom to devalue their work, the opportunity to participate in an extractive system – and that was somehow democratic.Discovery Mode’s inner workings are, in part, a product of how playlists have evolved more broadly. Many of Spotify’s recommendation systems start with a curator identifying songs eligible to be included in a playlist; a personalisation algorithm then decides which 50 end up on a user’s playlist based on what they are most likely to identify with. Similarly, in the automated mixes impacted by Discovery Mode – user-specific mixes and the Radio and Autoplay features – a sequencing algorithm re-ranks the tracks from a relevant pool before they are delivered, increasing their chance of being served to users, a source explained.It’s a vicious cycle: we’re losing revenue because of streaming, then streaming pushes these weird opportunities on usInternally, Discovery Mode’s success has been measured by the percentage of total artists who were onboarded, and how much cash this was saving Spotify. By 2023, Spotify employees celebrated an “exciting Discovery Mode milestone”, according to a review of company Slack messages. More than 50% of what Spotify calls Tier 2–3 artists – those with annual royalties of $50,000-500,000 – had tried Discovery Mode. “Last year we set out with an ambitious goal of getting to 30%,” an employee wrote. “Surpassing 50% felt beyond our wildest dreams and yet here we are. Congrats all!”Spotify has made a lot of money from Discovery Mode, with profits also exceeding goals. Between May 2022 and May 2023, Discovery Mode had brought in €61.4m (£51m) in gross profit, according to a review of a chart shared internally. In May 2023 alone, it generated €6.6m (£5.5m) in gross profit – with nearly all of it coming from the independent and DIY sectors. It appeared from the breakdown in the chart that there was a direct connection between the musicians who were opting into Discovery Mode and those who already stood to be affected by the introduction of so-called “artist-centric” royalty policies, which as of 2024 have demonetised tracks with less than 1000 annual streams.The music industry is engineering artist popularity – listeners are right to be angryRead moreBut in the long term, Discovery Mode also seemed like an economic arrangement that only the most moneyed labels could afford. “Discovery Mode is very insidious in that it doesn’t matter whether you do it or not, you’re affected by it,” one indie label employee told me. “If all of your competitors are using Discovery Mode and you’re not, your share is going to go down.”Three years after the launch of Discovery Mode’s pilot version, an employee reflected on Slack about what its architects had accomplished: “It’s amazing to look back on our progress.”The disingenuous promotional material emphasised how this program was all aboutwhat the artist wanted to promote. But by the end of 2023, that was in question, as Spotify introduced “Pre-Campaign Insights” or PCI, an algorithm that would tell an artist or label which tracks were most likely to stream well in a Discovery Mode campaign. It was rolled out for “managed service” Discovery Mode customers, as opposed to “self-service” customers – advertising industry terminology referring to whether a customer has a point-of-contact managing their campaign. For those eligible, the company claimed that the PCI algorithm would recommend, with roughly 85% accuracy, tracks “predicted to see a lift in streams” from a Discovery Mode campaign.One independent record label manager said she had tried Discovery Mode campaigns for different artists on her indie rock label, but it was only the “folk-leaning artists” for whom it was most effective. “It serves passive listeners,” she told me. She reflected on how frustrating it was that opting into Discovery Mode actually did lead to increased streams for her artists; the fact that someone would hear a promoted track and not know that it was promoted raised ethical concerns. “This, unfortunately, is the way that the future looks for us. And we have zero control over it.”Another independent label manager noted that despite seeing results from Discovery Mode, he was not sure yet what their royalty statements would look like. “It’s this vicious cycle where we’re losing revenue because of streaming. And then streaming is pushing these weird opportunities on us. And we need to take them in order to make up for that lost revenue. It sadly is so desperate, because the industry changes so consistently and we are constantly thinking of ways to keep up.”Discovery Mode wasn’t Spotify’s first go at paid promo. Since 2019, it had been trying to get artists to pay for pop-up ads called “Marquees”, which cost 50 cents per click, or 55 cents if the artist wanted to target “lapsed, casual, or recently interested listeners”. An artist set a dollar amount for the campaign, which would then run for 10 days, or until the budget was spent. “Our distributor said, don’t use this, you are going to lose money,” one of the independent label managers told me. In 2023, Spotify introduced another, similar ad product called “Showcase”, a sponsored shelf that sat on the home page; those cost 40 cents per click, and lasted 14 days.Later that year, Spotify launched an initiative called Campaign Kit, its attempt to get artists to not just purchase Marquee ads, Showcase shelves, or to trade royalties for algorithmic promotion, but to convince them that all of these tools worked best when purchased together. The last component of the kit was Spotify’s tool for submitting tracks for editorial playlist consideration. It’s as if the company were saying it’s not enough to buy ads, take a reduced royalty to use Discovery Mode, or pray at the altar of playlist pitching: artists must do all of these things.View image in fullscreenSpotify’s tools for ‘creators’, ie musicians.Photograph: SpotifyIn late 2023, a Showcase-related announcement hit the company Slack, detailing a high benchmark hit just two months after launch: over €1m (£833k) worth of ads booked. “We should all be very proud of this moment. As you go through the proverbial halls, don’t forget to pat your local Native Ads Showcase drivers on the back.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSpotify’s pitches to the independent music industry seemed to be working. But these ambitions to monetise musicians were seriously concerning to many. The Artist Rights Alliance, ina Rolling Stone op-edpublished in April 2021, called Discovery Mode “payola” as well as “exploitative”, “unfair”, and a “money grab”, noting the potential for the royalty cut to be “so steep that working artists and independent labels cannot even afford to pay it, clearing the field for major record labels and pop megastars to swallow up even more of the streaming pie”. The group wrote that the biggest losers would be “working artists, independent labels, and above all music fans looking to expand and diversify their listening.”In June 2021, the United States House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek, warning that the feature could establish a “race to the bottom” where artists feel required to accept lower royalties in order to be heard. The letter asserted that “at a time when the global pandemic has devastated incomes for musicians and other performers, without a clear path back to pre-pandemic levels, any plan that could ultimately lead to further cut pay for working artists and ultimately potentially less consumer choice raises significant policy issues”.View image in fullscreenDaniel Ek, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spotify, hosts a “Now Playing” creator day at the company’s Los Angeles campus.Photograph: Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images for SpotifyThe authors of the House Judiciary letter outlined a series of questions directly for Daniel Ek: Would the pilot become permanent? What safeguards would protect artists from Discovery Mode boosts potentially cancelling each other out? How would the “promotional” royalty rate be calculated and would it be the same for everyone? How could artists and labels measure the success of the program on their streams? And how would royalties be returned to artists if participating failed to increase streams?Shortly after the Artist Rights Alliance op-ed was published, a staff member shared it in a Slack channel called “ethics-club”, where a group of Spotify employees would debate ethical issues of the streaming business. Some of these employees quickly agreed with the alliance’s assertion that Discovery Mode was payola-like. One said that the article nicely summed up his “raised eyebrows” from the meeting where he first learned about the program. “Controlling more of the listening experience via programming pretty clearly benefits us more than anybody else,” a different employee wrote. “That’s exactly why we have goals to increase programmed share.”“This isn’t just like selling a banner ad somewhere. The boosted plays come at the cost of other artists,” said another. “And as the article correctly notes, the degenerate case is that artists stop benefitting at all from paying us.”View image in fullscreenThe cover of Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist.Photograph: HodderEven Spotify’s own employees could see that Discovery Mode was a deceptive practice as they debated the general lack of transparency, and the blurred boundaries between pay-for-play and “marketplace”.According to Kevin Erickson, director of the Future of Music Coalition, there are important distinctions between payola on radio and what may appear to be its contemporary online equivalent. Payola has gone underground with radio, but comparable practices online are happening out in the open. Musicians are not paid at all when they’re played on US AM or FM radio, so there isn’t the same sort of commercial incentive to use payola. “There’s this whole other category of harm that happens on the digital side,” said Erickson.In his view, many of the issues artists face in the streaming era, including what has been characterised as digital payola, are antitrust issues that both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the power to take on as unfair methods of competition (because they suppress wages and contribute to an anticompetitive market) and as deceptive practices (because people don’t know whether they’re listening to a song due to a curated recommendation or a business relationship). In addition, Erickson noted, the FTC could also contribute to a more equitable streaming landscape by investigating the major record label contracts that are currently locked up by NDAs – as well as any contracts digital service providers hold with aggregators and stock music providers.As he puts it: “Unaccountable power is the problem wherever it pops up. It’s not about any particular technology. It’s concentrated, unaccountable private power.”In response to points raised in this article, a Spotify spokesperson disputed the characterisation of Discovery Mode as the contemporary equivalent of payola. While users cannot see which individual songs are part of Discovery Mode, the “about recommendations” link in algorithmically generated playlists discloses factors that may have influenced the tracklisting. Spotify disputes the accuracy of views shared by employees in some internal messages featured in this chapter. According to the company, these internal messages “appear to be largely from former employees who were chatting with each other about their views on different company matters, including matters that they may not have been working on or even have direct knowledge of”. The company adds: “We have a culture where employees are free to share their views even when they have concerns or constructive criticism.” They also dispute the claim that Discovery Mode is anticompetitive. The company would not comment on whether the Discovery Mode profits were accurate.This article is an edited extract from Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly, available now in the US from Atria/One Signal, and published in the UK on 13 March (Hodder & Stoughton, £22).

That could be nibbles, nice napkins, candles – anything your host may not have had the time or inclination to cover, on top of catering.

They’re an offering, to be torn open and shared. No matter how bougie the brand is – looking at you, Torres – a bag of crisps implies it should be instantly cracked open. A nice pot of nuts or a can of quality olives, however, could go both ways. They could be nibbles on the night, but they could also be stowed away for the host to enjoy. Opt for those with classy packaging –Perelló,Mevalco,Espinalerfor olives;Brindisa,Daylesford,Honey & Cofor nuts – that can be repurposed once their contents have been gobbled up. If you know the sorts they like, so much the better.Handwritten place notesView image in fullscreenThere are all sorts of reasons one might want a seating plan for a dinner party: mixing friends, setting up prospective couples, separating bickering couples. Yet, on top of cooking, cleaning and everything else, writing out name cards can feel like a chore too far.

Everyone always needs new tea towels – they’re often on show, and they never stay white for long. As for the wine, well, to those crying “loophole”, I’d point out that by wrapping it in something more substantial than tissue from the wine shop, you’re implying it’s a special bottle for the host to enjoy at a later date.

Unless they’re one of those people who fall asleep at the sight of a flickering flame, candles are always a win. Note their candle holders, if they have them, and buy candles that fit – be they tapered, pillared or even just tealights. And while I love my Jo Malone, I generally steer clear of the scented if I’m buying for a dinner party. If you buy tapered candles, make them classier still by presenting them bound in a pretty ribbon.A bag of fresh, seasonal fruitView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iuliia Antonova/Getty ImagesEasily the classiest dinner party gift I’ve heard of, and I say that as the recipient of a Jo Malone candle and aGalantinoolive oil: a brown paper bag filled with fresh, seasonal fruit selected from the farmers market that morning.

In the winter, opt for British apples, tangerines or beautiful blushing blood oranges.Breakfast pastriesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Claudia Totir/Getty ImagesI remember the first time I went to a restaurant so fancy that they sent us home with breakfast for the following morning. It was one of the classiest experiences of my life – and it’s in your hands to give, anytime you’re a guest at someone’s house. Pick up a couple of pastries from your finest local patisserie and be the first person your host thinks of when they wake up the next day. If they sprinkle them with a tiny dash of water and put them in the oven for five minutes, they’ll taste as fresh as if they’d been baked that morning.Quality breadView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Say-Cheese/Getty Images/iStockphotoOne to check with your host before bringing, as too much bread can prove a burden – but if they’re in the market for a loaf, either to serve with your meal or to sustain them over the next few days, it’ll go down like manna from heaven. Ask them what suits: a baguette? Soda bread? Farmhouse loaf? Contrary to popular belief, a crusty sourdough boule isn’t always the best option – and seek out the best from your local independent.Hangover kitView image in fullscreenCucumber eye pads£4 at LushIf a night on the sauce is on the cards, don’t stop at coffee. Compile a hangover kit that will tend to your host’s every need before and after rolling out of bed the next day:Berocca, painkillers, eye pads (I likeLushandSephora, though if I could afford them I’d chooseCharlotte Tilbury), a can of Sanpellegrino, a couple of rashers of bacon (go to your local butcher and you should be able to buy per rasher, rather than a whole pack) or halloumi, and a soft, fluffy white bap.A party gameView image in fullscreenWheels v Doors£23 at Argos£19.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenKaren£16.29 at Zatu Games£17.99 at AmazonGone are the days when suggesting a game meant the party divided between game geeks and those who would rather wash up than waste a single second of their life on Monopoly Deal. The UK game scene has never been so inclusive and varied, and many games are designed to spark and extend conversation, not bring it to an abrupt close. One such game isWheels vs Doors, a delightfully silly game in which players get given two things and have to bet on what they think there are more of in the world; andKaren, the “game of one-star reviews” in which players try to sneak their own fake complaints in among real one-star reviews found online to try to convince their opponents that they’re the real Karen. Obviously, if your host or anyone in the party iscalledKaren, steer clear.For more inspiration, read our guide tothe best family board gamesIngredients for a cocktailView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andrew Twort/AlamyOver the age of 25, bringing gin or vodka to dinner suggests a problem. Throw in the other ingredients for a classic cocktail and present them in a nice tote bag, however, and that bottle of hard liquor has a classy touch. Easy go-to’s are margaritas (mezcal or tequila, limes andCointreau); martinis (vodka or gin, white vermouth, olives and lemons); negronis (gin,Campari, vermouth); and gin sours (gin, lemon andOggs aquafaba, aromatic bitters) and brambles (gin,crème de mûre, lemon and fresh blackberries).

It costs her two-a-penny to make, but to me, my mum’s wild garlic pesto is green gold; ditto my friend’s chilli tomato jam. Stick a suitably rustic label on the jar and dedicate it to your host, along with the date on which it was made.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And this is popular?According toa survey, 34% of gen Z jobseekers have indulged in career catfishing.Gen Z – are there any longstanding cultural norms they can’t subvert?Apparently24% of millennials, 11% of gen X and 7% of boomers have also done it.But why apply for a job, go to all the trouble of getting it and then not show up?Any number of reasons – in the course of a long and dispiriting recruitment process, they may have got a better offer, or simply changed their minds.In that case, couldn’t they have just said, you know, thanks, but no thanks?Evidently they don’t feel they owe prospective employers anything.Why would that be?Because they feel they’ve been treated very badly by them.How so?Recruitment is often labyrinthine, opaque and time-consuming. Research has shown that it takes, on average,between 100 and 200 job applicationsto receive a single job offer these days.That’s ridiculous.In part, it’s because a significant portion of the jobs being advertised don’t exist – they’reghost jobs.Ghost jobs?Fake job openings posted by companies, either to make it look as if they’re recruiting and therefore growing, or to keep their present employees on their toes, or for some other terrible reason.I get it: it’s a jungle out there.There is also the phenomenon known as professional ghosting, when companies put applicants through multiple interviews, and sometimes even make job offers, before abruptly ending all communication.What you’re saying is, employers deserve everything they get and more.Not necessarily – career catfishing can cost companies huge amounts of money.Good. After all, the only real safeguard against catfishing is more catfishing.Ghost employees for ghost jobs – sounds like the future.Do say:“Great offer! Can I think about it and get back to you some time around never?”Don’t say:“So the official job title is abandoned amusement park caretaker, but at night you simply wear a sheet to scare off any meddling kids.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersPass notesJob huntingUnemploymentYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A sudden glimpse into the world of dating apps gave me a new appreciation for what I havePolly HudsonWed 19 Feb 2025 01.55 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 13.01 ESTShareWe weren’t unhappily married. To most people, I suspect we just seemed … normal. My husband and I had been together for 17 years and had recently celebrated our 14th wedding anniversary. We were plodding along just fine: comfortable, slightly complacent, grunting at each other from behind our phones, eating dinner in front of the telly, focusing on childcare, keeping on keeping on – like most of our married friends. When our mortgage payments doubled, paying for a babysitter to go on nights out alone seemed an unnecessary expense.On New Year’s Eve, we went to a party at the home of another couple – parents of a child in our son’s class: a bring-kids-along, more-the-merrier thing. I ended up chatting to three women I had never met. They didn’t have children at the school and, it turned out, they were all single – at least one had been hoping there might be eligible men at the party.Most of us in attendance were fast approaching 50, but this group were about a decade younger, all attractive, successful, funny, intelligent, lively – proper catches. None had been married. They were all on dating apps, while simultaneously despairing of dating apps. I was fascinated. The apps weren’t around when I was last single; I met my husband the old-fashioned way, in real life.I had known him peripherally through work for years before we got together. We hadn’t seen each other in person for about 18 months before being invited to the same Christmas party in 2007. We both nearly didn’t go, only changing our minds at the last minute. When I saw him across the room that night, it was like a mild electric shock; a jolt, but without the pain. We were together from that evening – from that moment, really. We just felt like a done deal.The women at the party may have been unlucky, but they hadn’t met anyone they were interested in on the apps. They regaled me with some of the gambits men had sent once they had matched – which made for great anecdotes, but were presumably disappointing, sometimes even upsetting, to receive at the time.Although I had never used dating apps, I thought I was au fait with what went on – a certain amount of catfishing online followed by an undeniable lack of chemistry in person – but the picture painted here was far bleaker than that. Their stories stayed with me for days. I couldn’t shake the thought that I had quickly forgotten what dating was like.View image in fullscreen‘Together we work’ … Polly and Nick.Photograph: Courtesy of Polly HudsonI was the last of my friendship group to get married. At the time, I felt like the only single person left on Earth, the perpetual gooseberry in a world of happy couples. I longed for a partner – and not just any partner. In fact, the more time it took, the more determined I became not to settle. He had to be kind, funny and smart. Warm, honest, loyal. Someone who would root for me, have my back and be on my team, come what may.If I could have time-travelled ahead to see who I ended up with, how he was everything I had hoped for and more, early‑30s me wouldn’t have believed her luck. If I could have also seen how, on occasion, I shout at him because of the way he stacks the dishwasher and take him largely for granted, I would have thought myself an idiot.Talking to the women at new year, who were single not by choice, just as I had once been, didn’t make me glad I had metsomeone; rather, they renewed my appreciation for my husband specifically. He is far from perfect, as am I, but together we work. We still make each other laugh and our relationship is – always has been – almost effortless. That doesn’t mean we don’t need to put any effort in.My new year resolutions have been many: turning off the television, putting down my phone and instead really listening to my partner. I make time to kiss him goodbye instead of yelling it from the front door in a rush. We have arranged babysitting swaps with friends in similar boats, so we can go for regular date nights (and, because I’m fortunate enough to be with someone who truly gets me, my husband knows better than to call them that).I have learned the value of appreciating what you have and protecting something precious, rather than not really acknowledging it because it’s no longer shiny and new.He is still rubbish at stacking the dishwasher, though.Explore more on these topicsMarriageA moment that changed meDatingRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can I persuade my lover that this is a problem?Pamela Stephenson ConnollyWed 19 Feb 2025 06.48 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 08.53 ESTShareI’ve been dating a manwhose 18-year-old kidlives with him full-time.My partner and I are very intimate and I always thought that I kept my cries of passion down by screaming into a pillow.Recently, his kidbeganslammingdoors and cupboards very loudly to let us know that they hadheard us. Itoldmy partner that I felt bad, buthe said he didn’t think I was being loud and that he had already explained to his kid when theychoseto live with him full-time that this would happen.Idon’t have the best relationship withhis kid because Ivery rarely spend any time with them, and they arequite introverted. What’s more, recently they wereavoiding eye contact with me and seemeduncomfortable.Now, I’m afraid that I’ve madethemunhappy by simply being there. I don’t spend very much time with the man I’m dating, which I think sends asignalto his kid that I’m mostly a sexual partner(I would like more but am afraid of asking for it for fear of being turned down). I want to respect his kid, but I also sense thatthey don’t respect mebecause my relationship with their father is not one of a bona fide girlfriend. What’s the best way to talk to the man I’m dating about my concerns?You deserve to be given time and attention to help clarify this situation, so start by simply asking for that. You could approach him with: “I’d like to talk with you about a few things. I’m wondering when would be a good time and place for us to have a relaxed conversation about things in general?” Make sure the conversation occurs away from his house and the presence of his teenager. When you are in a comfortable situation, start by mentioning positive things that you like about your relationship, even if it’s simply: “I so enjoy having sex with you … but help me to understand how I can best navigate awkwardness between me and them?” But your partner has already addressed it with his kid, so when you see them around the house, just be the confident adult. Smile and greet them and find something warm to say. This behaviour in itself could not only put both of you at ease, but could also go a long way to showing your partner you are worth considering as more than a sexual partner. It may be a good idea to try this first; if it has good results, the conversation may be redundant.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Here’s what happened when I tried themSteve RoseWed 19 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTShare“Chinese medicine.” “That weird Hungarian liqueur.” “Something my grandad would drink.” The taste test is not going well. Dry January is over and we’re hitting the bottle, but this is not alcohol we’re drinking. It’s theoretically the next best thing: Sentia Black, “a unique blend of functional botanicals, designed for focus and conviviality,” reads the blurbWe’ve been trying it neat, but once you mix it with tonic water it becomes much more palatable – “festive and grownup”, as one of my test subjects puts it. Taste aside, though, does it work? The conversation is certainly free-flowing, but whether it is more “focused and convivial” than it would have been without the Sentia is hard to say. None of us end up dancing on the table or spoiling for a fight, at least. Nor does anyone wake up with a hangover the next morning, so there’s that. Mind you, it is £32 a bottle.The active ingredients in the drink have been chosen because they “stimulate the release of Gaba” – a neurotransmitter that slows down the brain – gently mimicking what alcohol can do to extreme levels. Gaba is short for gamma-aminobutyric acid and it’s being talked of in terms of not just alcohol substitution but a whole range of health applications. It is often associated with sleep, relaxation and anxiety, but it also has a role to play in epilepsy, Parkinson’s, blood pressure, seizures, memory and much more. As such, Gaba has become something of a buzzword in health and wellness circles, which inevitably means there is a lot of confusion and misinformation.Gaba itself is a naturally occurring substance. Our bodies can make it, and it’s present in common foods, with higher concentrations in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale, sweet potatoes, fermented foods such as kimchi and tempeh, and certain herbs. The sale of pure Gaba (it can be synthesised by fermenting food) is prohibited in the UK and EU due to concerns over potential for misuse, but it’s legal in the US and Japan, where you can buy myriad Gaba supplements, with dosages ranging from 10mg to 750mg, not to mention Gaba-enhanced chocolate, gummies, drinks – and it doesn’t stop there. But its uses and effects are far from straightforward.View image in fullscreen‘There’s no recommended dose’ … Gaba capsules.Photograph: photo_gonzo/Alamy“Gaba is the off switch of the brain,” says the neuropsychopharmacologist Prof David Nutt, of Imperial College London, who is also one of the creators of Sentia. At the most basic level, brain activity consists of billions of neurons turning on and off, he says. “The turning on is glutamate; the turning off is Gaba.” This is why Gaba has a connection with calming. “When we go into a social situation with strangers, the social parts of our brain are set to ‘slightly anxious’ because it’s better than being overconfident,” says Nutt. “What alcohol does, and what Sentia does, is enhance the Gaba there to take away that anxiety, so you can be as social as you really want to be.”Sentia, which launched in 2021, seeks to mimic the first stage of drunkenness – the relaxed, “convivial” feeling you might get after one or two drinks – but without leading to subsequent phases: euphoria, loss of judgment, pain reduction, memory loss, dependence. You don’t get more faux-drunk the more Sentia you drink; you just remain in that “sweet spot” of sociability, it’s claimed. “We are not replicating alcohol,” says Nutt. “We don’t want people to get drunk and addicted and hungover.”Nutt says he was led down this path by first-hand experience. “I spent most of my first 20 years as a doctor trying to treat people with alcohol withdrawal, alcohol craving, alcohol brain damage.” According to the latest statistics, alcohol-related deaths in the UKhit a record highin 2023, exceeding 10,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, we are increasingly turning off alcohol. A recent UK survey found that 43% of 18- to 34-year-olds and 32% of 35- to 54-year-olds no longer drink it at all. So there is clearly a place for drinks like Sentia.Nutt wasfired as a government adviseron drug policy in 2009, for arguing that some illegal drugs, such as ecstasy, LSD and cannabis, were less harmful than legal ones including alcohol and tobacco. He has been researching alcohol alternatives ever since, and in 2019 he co-foundedGABA Labs, which makes Sentia. “There are small molecules that do mimic the effects of alcohol. We looked at those, and we found they were complex, difficult and expensive. So we started making our own molecules.” It is a challenging and expensive process, he says, but “in the last 10 years, we’ve made 50 molecules that target the Gaba system as we want.”They also studied plants and herbal remedies associated with calmness and relaxation in western, Chinese and Ayurvedic traditions – valerian and ashwagandha, for example. Sentia is a mix of natural ingredients, some for Gaba-enhancement, some for flavour, including blackberry juice, aronia, magnolia, linden, passionflower, liquorice, ashwagandha and more – plus what is described on the label as “GABA Labs proprietary blend” – which includes those synthetic Gaba-targeting molecules Nutt was talking about.View image in fullscreenBuzz word … Sentia.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianI’ve tried Sentia over a few evenings now. There are two other colours, red and gold, which claim to have slightly different effects. The gold one tastes like concentrated orange juice neat, but mixed with ginger beer it’s very tasty. I’ve had perfectly pleasant times, but it is still difficult to know how much the drink was a part of that. There was no “buzz”, as some Sentia drinkers have reported.I relay my uncertainty to Nutt. Do other people respond that way? “Only journalists,” he replies jokingly. Women prefer it to men, he’s found, but he can only speculate as to why – perhaps they are less desensitised by previous alcohol-drinking, or it interacts with the female hormone system differently. He does have scientific proof for Sentia’s claims, though:studies have shownthat compounds in many of the plants they use have an effect on Gaba receptors in the brain; an experiment on mice at the University of Portsmouth indicated that Sentia enhances Gaba in the gut in a mammalian system. He also shows me EEG scans carried out on Sentia drinkers by the University of Exeter, which showed that it produces changes in the brain “compatible with relaxation and sociability”.View image in fullscreen‘Women prefer it to men’ … Prof David Nutt with a bottle of Sentia.Sentia is not the only alcohol alternative going down the Gaba route. There’s alsoKin Euphorics, sold in the US, some of whose drinks are infused with actual Gaba, orThree Spirit, which uses “adaptogens and nootropics” (a similar herbal mix to Sentia but without their proprietary ingredients) to “enhance your mood, rhythm and mind”. Then there’sImpossibrew, the “impossibly relaxing non-alcoholic beer”. Along with ashwagandha, one of its key ingredients is l-theanine – an amino acid found in tea, among other natural sources, that is thought to increase Gaba levels in the brain.Impossibrew was founded by Mark Wong, a 28-year-old former student homebrewer who had to quit drinking for health reasons. He developed a non-alcoholic alternative, working with Dr Paul Chazot, a professor of pharmacology at Durham University. Wong says that a light came on when he visited his family in Hong Kong and explored traditional Chinese herbal remedies. Working these into a beer was a challenge – “these things have a really pungent, planty taste” – but Impossibrew tastes as good as any non-alcoholic beer: fruity and hoppy with a citrus finish. And I must admit, I did feel somewhat looser and more animated after drinking it, though that could have been down to the spectacular pasta dish I’d cooked (including Gaba-rich broccoli).Wongpresented his product on Dragons’ Dena few years ago but failed to attract any investment. He’s doing fine without it: Impossibrew shifted over a million units last year, he says. “We aim to continue doubling every year.”View image in fullscreenMark Wong, the founder of Impossibrew, on Dragons’ Den in 2022.Controlling the brain’s “off switch” has myriad applications beyond just alcohol-like sociability. Gaba’s neurological role wasidentified in the 1950s, and many medications target its system to treat conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety disorders, seizures and drug withdrawal symptoms – hence medical brand names such as pregabalin and gabapentin (which are controlled class C substances in the UK). Likewise, drugs that are often prescribed for sleep problems, such as Zolpidem (Ambien) or benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, temazepam), work by enhancing Gaba in the brain (albeit with side-effects).View image in fullscreenWong’s Impossibrew.Photograph: Milo NicholsonHealth-store Gaba supplements claim to do something similar, but the way Gaba works on humans is complicated. It is not thought to pass through the “blood-brain barrier” in significant quantities, which means you cannot simply swallow a load of Gaba and find it makes its way to your brain. This is why products such as Sentia and Impossibrew claim toenhance the uptakeof Gaba in the brain, rather than adding to it directly.Consuming Gaba orally is not particularly effective, says Renger Witkamp, a professor in nutritional biology at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. “What we see, if you give someone a large amount of Gaba, is that it is quickly taken up in your blood, but that peak very rapidly disappears, in as little as half an hour. Gaba is a natural compound, so our body has all kinds of systems and enzymes that are constantly keeping it in balance.”Does that mean that Gaba pills and supplements are a waste of time? Anecdotally, many people attest to their efficacy, but in 2020 asystematic reviewof 14 studies found “limited evidence for stress and very limited evidence for sleep benefits of oral Gaba intake”. Gaba certainly plays a role in sleep, but the supplements are a bit of a lottery, says Prof John Groeger of Nottingham Trent University, co-author of the review, who has studied sleep for over 20 years: “You really don’t know how much you’re taking. Even when you buy a supplement that says it has 1,000 milligrams in it, there is no recommended dose.”This is not the whole story, though, says Nutt. Gaba can still have an effect by another route: “The gut has a lot of Gaba receptors, and Gaba affects gut function. And if you change gut function, then the nerves from the gut to the brain are changed, and therefore the brain is changed.” In addition, “There is growing evidence that the microbiome uses Gaba to grow and to communicate between the various bugs, so Gaba itself could be active at several levels.” On the subject of Gaba supplements, Nutt says: “They may work.”View image in fullscreen‘Perfectly pleasant, but no buzz’ … Steve Rose.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOne place in particular has been swearing by Gaba for decades: Japan. “Gaba is like vitamin C here,” says Prof Hiroshi Ezura of the plant innovation research centre at the University of Tsukuba. “Many Japanese people know what Gaba is and many Japanese food companies enrich their products with it.” Since 2005, the confectioner Glico has made a range ofGaba “mental balance chocolate”, for example, which claims to aid relaxation for workers. It is credited with having popularised chocolate consumption by men, which was previously considered a “feminine” confectionery in Japan. The brewery Suntory’s Gaba-enhanced, alcohol-free beer All Free, meanwhile, claims to improve memory.Ezura’s field is tomatoes. His team has developed a Gaba-rich variety using genome-editing technology. TheirSicilian Rouge cherry tomatoescontain five times more Gaba than conventional ones, Ezura says, and they claim to not only relieve stress and aid sleep, but also maintain skin elasticity and lower your blood pressure. They could not make these claims without hard evidence, approved by the Japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare, he says. They have also worked for him personally: “Normally my blood pressure is 135 or 140, but by eating the tomatoes every day, it’s down to 120.”Gut feelings: why drugs that nurture your microbes could be the future of mental healthRead moreThe tomatoes came on to the Japanese market (where regulations for Gaba and GM foods are less strict) in 2021 and are available in more than 100 shops, mainly in the Tokyo area. They are now expanding their range of tomato varieties and making processed products, such as tomato puree, says Ezura. There are plans to begin growing them in the Philippines, and they have been approved by the FDA in the US.Gaba undoubtedly has actual and potential benefits, and more research is needed, but not everybody is drinking the Kool-Aid – or Sentia and tonic. Prof Witkamp, for one. Even with some of the “scientifically proven” claims around Gaba, he’s wary of “what we call cherrypicking”, he says: “You get a lot of loose bits and pieces, you connect them and they sound nice, but has it been proven?” To really confirm the relaxation effects of drinks like Sentia, he says, you would need a properly designed, placebo-controlled experiment. Instead, “there are a lot of subjective feelings about ‘becoming relaxed’”, he says.Nutt acknowledges: “We tend to get positive feedback, but then there’s probably not a lot of point in people telling us they didn’t get much of an effect.” Similarly, with Impossibrew’s claim that “71% of our customers felt more relaxed after drinking Impossibrew”, Wong concedes that the data is from self-selecting customers who were willing to fill out the company’s questionnaire. Besides, measuring something qualitative such as “relaxation” is inherently difficult. “I’ve subjected myself to a whole range of different drugs over my 50 years,” says Nutt, “so I know what it’s like to be zonked, but when you’re looking for those subtle changes, it’s trickier.”But a subtle change is the goal: “It’s very unlikely that people are going to sit down by themselves and just drink Sentia to get out of their head; we think it works predominantly in social situations, because that’s what we want – for people to engage socially … but sometimes we’re not that good at being social.” So sharing a Gaba-enhancing cocktail could be just the fun social lubricant we need, without the hangover – even if the conversation is mostly just, “Are you feeling anything yet?”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFoodSpiritsHealth & wellbeingHerbs and spicesAlternative medicinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The only issue is that when I get embarrassed or offended I tend to blush and go bright red. People then exclaim, “You’re going red!” which makes it even worse. I used to cover my skin with foundation, which was a comfort blanket. I feel the only way to hide this is to wear foundation, but I don’t want to go back. Please help!– Flushed OutWe should all be so lucky, Flushed Out! People pay $25bn a year to look like you.At least, that is whatbeautyenthusiasts across the globespenton blush in 2024, making it the fastest-growing category in the face makeup market. Sales of luxury blush are up 60%. Hailey Bieber, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande all recently released cult-favorite cheek products, and Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty sells a tubeevery nine seconds. There are powder, cream and liquid versions. As ofa few days ago, there is even skincare that doubles as blush.Rosy cheeks meet all the current standards of feminine beauty: youthful, doll-like, cherubic, “healthy”. Everyone who’s anyone is going red in the face.Some consumers’ relationship to blush borders on obsessive, to the extent that it is become a trend in and of itself. TikTok users have coined the term“blush blindness”, which describes those so used to seeing themselves covered in blush that they can’t tell when they have applied too much.I am willing to bet your burning cheeks could pass for Sabrina Carpenter’s in full glam.Youare the blueprint.So why don’t you feel like it?My theory is that your body, spontaneously bursting with human emotion, violates today’s most important beauty ideal: woman-as-machine.It might sound a little out there, but since the dawn ofInstagram Face in 2019, female beauty standards have been accelerating toward the cyborgian, with a focus on symmetry, smoothness andagelessness. (Robots do not wrinkle.) We have seen the rise ofglass skin(woman-as-screen),Meta Face(woman-as-avatar) and Stepford-esque hyper-perfection (think: Megan Fox as an AI housekeeper in the 2024 film Subservience, no facial prosthetics necessary). Even the recent move toward“undetectable” cosmetic work– or slightly off cosmetic work, as in the case of“perfectly imperfect” veneers– assumes artificiality as the starting point: Theunreal must be made to lookmorereal.For a girlborg, emotions are not inherent. They are accessories! So as the beauty industry encourages us to aesthetically dehumanize, it also encourages us to aestheticallyre-humanize by purchasing feelings through products.A few months ago, the beauty brand Flufflaunched a blushwith shade names like Nervous and Shy, colors inspired by the physiological effects of feelings. Patrick Ta sells a color calledShe’s Blushing. The phenomenon isn’t particularly new – Nars Orgasm, one of the bestselling blushes of all time, has purported to deliver a flush on par with post-coital oxytocin release since 1999 – but it is particularly ubiquitous right now.Today’s biggest blush trends explicitly promote products as replacements for embodied experiences.“Boyfriend blush”takes the place of post-gym ruddiness.“I’m cold makeup”– yes, it’s a real thing – fakes the effects of being outside in the cold.“Sunburn blush”recreates the scorched look of excessive sun exposure. (Not that I’m advocating for real-life sunburn!)The difference between these trends and your face? Blush offers controlled application on a controlled surface; blushing is the uncontrollable reaction of the uncontrolled body.Women have been shamed for their unruly bodies for centuries – and for you, that shame only makes you blush more, which people are all too happy to point out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Something like: “I’m aware” or “That was an unnecessary comment” or “Are you upset I get it for free and you paid $24 for your tube of Rhode Pocket Blush?” The ruder, the better. Incases like this, I’m a big believer in redirecting shame fromyour bodytothe other person’s behavior(its rightful place).As for how to work through negative thoughts about blushing, I recommend trying to shift your embarrassment to awe. In matters of the skin, this is actually pretty easy to do.Have you heard of the skin-brain axis?In utero, we develop a layer of embryonic tissue that stretches and splits, expands and evolves, and eventually forms two seemingly separate but forever-tethered systems: the brain and the skin. They’re bound for life through a series of cells, and nerves and neural pathways, and communicate through and with each other. The skin feels, and the brain reacts. For example: if you touch a hot stove, your brain jerks your hand away. It goes the other way, too – the brain feels, and the skin reacts. If you’re scared, the color might drain from your face. If you’re overwhelmed, you might be more prone to breakouts. And if you’re embarrassed, your cheeks might burn bright red.More from Jessica DeFino’sAsk Ugly:My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneHow should I be styling my pubic hair?How do I deal with imperfection?I want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayThe skin-brain connection is so ordinary that it’s often overlooked, but once you take the time to reallyseeit, it seems almost … magical? Romantic, even? Like otherworldly evidence of our wholeness or something. Since discovering the skin-brain axis, I’ve stopped freaking out about my stress-induced dermatitis flare-ups so much (which, conveniently, reduces my stress-induced flare-ups). I’m fascinated instead of frustrated. The technologyinside my skin cellsexcites me more than the technology of cyborgian smoothness. I hope it does the same for you.If you do not want to go back to wearing foundation, my advice on that front is simple: do not. Do not outsource becoming comfortable in your skin – the project of a lifetime – to a cosmetic product. Resist robotization!

It’ll require a little forward planning, since you’ll need to have the goods on hand for whenever a puttanesca hankering strikes – but truly, capers and olives should always be in there anyway, because they’re shortcuts to flavourtown. Splashing the tinned tuna in will pump up the protein, too.Fish in springwater will retain more of its nutrient content and hold its shape better than fish in oil, but if you’d prefer to stick to oil, an olive oil base is what you’re after. When choosing the best fish in tins from a sustainability perspective, look for labels and logos such as a Marine Stewardship Council “blue tick”. As far as fishing methods go, “dolphin-friendly” is just the beginning, so scan for words such as “pole-and-line caught” or “FAD-free purse seine”. Skipjack is the tuna type to look for, then albacore; try to avoid endangered species such as yellowfin, bluefin and big-eye.View image in fullscreenCapers … think of them as vegan anchovies.Photograph: Richard Clark/Getty ImagesThe capers are key to the flavour – I like to think of them as vegan anchovies. You can buy them either brined or salted. They’ll vary in size, from lilliput (teeny tiny!) all the way through to caperberries, which are the natural conclusion to their growth. If brined, they just need to be drained, while salted ones need a rinse or two and a good pat dry before use. I do prefer the salted ones though, as they keep better and have a punchier flavour.You can use tinned tomatoes instead of passata, or even tomato paste and water, if that’s all you have. If you have some fresh cherry tomatoes handy, blister these along with the olives and capers for a fresh version, and add some chilli to make it fresh and feisty! Pinching in a little sugar is my tip for dialling up the “ripeness” in anything tomato-related – fresh or tinned!View image in fullscreenIf you don’t have passata or tinned tomatoes in your cupboard, tomato paste and water will do the trick.Photograph: Benjamin DearnleyIf you’re looking to cut down on cooking time, use fresh pasta such as gnocchi. It will cook in half the time of dried pasta, and even frozen fresh pasta can go straight from the freezer into boiling water.I like using raw garlic through this dish because the piquancy and kick really cuts through the richness of the sauce. If you’d prefer to keep yours mellow, chuck the garlic in with the tomato paste and give it a quick saute before you stir the passata into the pan.To make this recipe plant-based, leave the tuna out, use olive oil instead of butter and use a dairy-free hard cheese for grating.Pantry puttanesca – recipeView image in fullscreenAny pasta with ridges or twists will work in this recipe.Photograph: Benjamin DearnleyServes4½ cup (80g) salted capers, rinsed and drained100g butter150g kalamata olives, pittedA pinch of caster (superfine) sugar1 heaped tsp tomato paste(concentrated puree)3 cups (750ml) tomato passata(pureed tomatoes)350g dried casarecce, penne or any pasta that has ridges or twistsOlive oil, for drizzling2-3 garlic cloves, peeled400g tinned tuna in springwater,drainedFinely grated parmigiano reggiano, to serveOn the pulse: Alice Zaslavsky’s spicy pumpkin, sweet potato and coconut dal recipeRead moreBring a large saucepan of well-salted water to the boil.Meanwhile, fry the capers in the butter over medium-high heat for about three to four minutes or until crispy and golden. The butter will foam – a sight to behold. Pour through a metal sieve into a small bowl then pour the butter back into the pan, leaving the capers in the sieve over the bowl for garnishing later.Add the olives to the pan, sprinkle in the sugar, crank the heat up high and toss about for three to four minutes, until the olives start to change colour and blister.(If you’re in a hurry, you could always forget cooking the capers and olives separately and just toss them in together with the butter and leave them both in the pan.)Stir the tomato paste through the olives and cook out the rawness of the tomatoes for a minute or two. Pour in the passata and bring to the boil. Splosh another cup’s worth of water around the passata jar to clean out the dregs, then pour that in, too. Simmer vigorously for about 10 minutes, until reduced slightly; a splatter guard won’t go astray here.Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. Drain, reserving a mugful of the cooking water. (If not using it right away, pop the pasta back in the empty pot and drizzle well with olive oil to stop it sticking.)Crush the garlic into the pan. Flake the tuna in. Pour the pasta and a splosh of the reserved pasta water over the top and stir in with a spatula so the pasta is well coated and the residual heat mellows the garlic out a little. The liquid will be reabsorbed by the pasta before you know it.Serve sprinkled with the crispy capers, parmesan, black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil if desired.This is an edited extract fromThe Joy of Better Cookingby Alice Zaslavsky, photography by Ben Dearnley, published by Murdoch Books in Australia ($55) and the UK (£25), and available as Better Cooking in Canada and the US, published by Appetite by Random House (US$35)Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkYou've got thisItalian food and drinkFoodAustralian lifestylerecipesShareReuse this content"

This week I spoke to the Sudanese-British singer-songwriter Elmiene, a soul and R&B sensation who took the music industry by storm after just one viral video. We talked about his songs, the war inSudan, and how to navigate the loss of home and face the reality of displacement. But first, the weekly roundup.Weekly roundupView image in fullscreenAlterations cast members, from left: Cherrelle Skeete, Arinzé Kene and Gershwyn Eustache Jr.Photograph: National TheatreLondon theatre to stage ‘forgotten’ play |Alterations, by the Guyanese writer Michael Abbensetts, is to beperformed at the National Theatre in Londonnearly five decades after its opening night in 1978.

On this track, he eschews glossy, scripted visuals and simply filmed his cousin’s wedding in Cairo. Seconds into scenes of dancing and familial togetherness, I broke down.War erupted in Sudan almost two years ago, and my family, Elmiene’s and millions of others were fractured and scattered as people fled. Open Light’s images of togetherness are a powerful reminder of everything that has been lost.The song is from Elmiene’s latest EP,For the Deported, which is dedicated to those families and all who have been made refugees or displaced by war. The 23-year-old singer grew up in Oxford, UK, but is still profoundly connected to Sudan and his extended family. Despite our two-decade age gap and the differences in our backgrounds – I was born and raised in Sudan – the similarities in our formative experiences are almost identical. Elmiene grew up in a community of five aunties and 15 cousins, “all in Oxford doing our thing. We never left Oxford because our parents didn’t understand the concept of a holiday that wasn’t in Sudan, so it was either Oxford or Khartoum.” I tell him that it’s uncanny how similar Sudanese people are all over the world: growing up in big communal clusters, part of a constant stream of weddings and meals and social events and, no matter how far away we lived, with Sudan as the centre of our identity and emotional hinterland.Elmiene captures that sense of yearning through the medium of soul music and a voice so powerful yet gentle that it feels like a physical consolation. It is a testament to his raw talent that he blew up three years ago off the back of a cover of D’Angelo’s Untitled, filmed on a phone by a friend in front of his family’s garage. The video ends abruptly, he says, because his friend’s battery died. Elmiene’s rendition of the neo-soul classic went viral and he began to get attention from music industry titans. He cobbled together the train fare to London, crashed on a friend’s couch and within weeks he was on his way to stardom. Elmiene has sincefeatured on NPR’s Tiny Desk, been shortlisted for theBrits’ rising star awardand is now in Los Angeles recording his next album.The singer credits his rapid success to being “just a nerd”. Growing up he was immersed in the back catalogues of veteran soul and R&B singers such as Luther Vandross, Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke and Raphael Saadiq. “I just knew that whatever this was, I loved it,” he says, admitting to being “an absorbent sponge”. To this day, he feels “an endless pull of soul and R&B. When I start melodies, I just have a massive bank, like some weird [musical] AI.”Tribe and kinshipView image in fullscreenElmiene’s Tiny Desk set list includes Marking My Time, Light Work and Crystal Tears.Photograph: NPR MusicThe rest is down to Elmiene’s mum. He is an only child to a single mother, a Sudanese immigrant who was temperamentally independent enough to support her son’s unconventional career path. They made up this “weird little duo,” he says. As parties and events in the broader community swirled around them, they would prefer to “stay home,have our fuuland watch Turkish dramas”. He speaks fondly of his mother, describing her as “a special one”. While his cousins had faced the “classic Sudanese pressure” to become doctors and engineers, Elmiene’s mother simply encouraged him to do what made him happy. “I’m so lucky,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionElmiene’s music and identity is grounded in that sweet spot of being close enough to tribe and kinship that you can appreciate its profound value, but distant enough to be able to imagine a different way of being, especially in exile. In Golden, a track that was played at the late Virgil Abloh’s final Louis Vuitton show, one verse exemplifies the risks of nostalgia for a homeland and not leaning into reinventing oneself:Nowadays it seems that all my blades have been blunted;Cuttin’ through life, my path all rugged.Making mistakes ’cause my sight is clouded,All of my senses have been runnin’,’Cause I always fall in love with last year.It’s hard for me, particularly in the shadow of war, not to be in love with the past and the time before the conflict. A time when I took for granted the comforts of having a home, wedding gatherings, teas in the yard and the effortless sprawling flow of being part of a Sudanese family. As we share stories about our relatives’plight since April 2023, I realise that we also share a constant survivor’s guilt. Elmiene says: “I’m here in LA or New York and at the same time my grandmother’s hearing bullets and grenades.” He asks himself: “Is this where I should have been? What am I doing being a fucking musician? I feel like a clown sometimes.” When the war erupted, I had a similar sense of irrational self-reproach for being safe while others so close and dear were not.‘The pursuit of peace’View image in fullscreenFamily values … a still from Open Light.Photograph: Universal MusicI say to Elmiene that though he may feel as if his career is trivial in times of war, it has profound value. As a journalist, it has beenhard to draw proportional global attention to the conflict, and I think the way that people process Sudan is compromised by the fact that our art, culture, peacetime joy and character have not been foregrounded. There is a human interface in Elmiene’s music that not only helps Sudanese people process a massive trauma, it also allows the world to know the country beyond the headlines. In his words: to show “there exists a world in east Africa where we speak Arabic and we’re black as well”.It strikes me that this is the main difference between us. To Elmiene, For the Deported is an endeavour of finding somewhere to put his love for Sudan. I feel that I am constantly carrying that love, unable to convert it into anything but melancholy. Elmiene takes on a sort of kindly and sage role in our conversation. I ask how his music enables him to process what has happened to Sudan. He says his work centres on “the pursuit of comfort and peace in yourself. It all stems from the fact that our comfort – the place where people looked, spoke and acted like us – doesn’t exist any more. Now that we’re living in someone else’s comfort, we can only find it in ourselves. I’m trying to find comfort in myself, and hopefully through that someone else might do the same.”I sat in silence after we said our goodbyes, trying to absorb that message. Then I attempted to watch Open Light’s wedding scene again. This time, I made it through to the end. Though there were tears, I managed, in glimpses, to see not all that is gone, but all that still exists.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsSudanThe Long WaveR&BCaribbeanAfricaBlack British cultureHeritagePhotographynewslettersShareReuse this content"

There are huge challenges ahead for HTS’s transitional government, and in some places,sectarian violence has already re-emerged.View image in fullscreenA child on a bicycle crosses a street in Homs waving the new Syrian flag. There are huge challenges ahead for HTS’s transitional government.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianYet after 13 years of sacrifice, blood and exile, the appetite for freedom that fuelled Syria’s popular revolution has endured. In dozens of interviews across Idlib province, the HTS stronghold, as well as the newly taken Aleppo, Homs and Damascus, stories tumbled out of people amazed they could talk openly after more than 50 years of dictatorship.“We paid a high price for basic human rights, for our dignity,” said Hussein al-Khaled, 37, who fled Saraqib for the relative safety of Idlib city whenthe city fell to Assad in 2020. “We have been waiting for this moment for decades.”Retaking Saraqib, on the M5, was a key victory for Assad, allowing the regime to relink the capital, Damascus, with the economic centre of Aleppo, and forcing Sunni-led opposition forces to retreat to the north-west. In December, the same route also became the rebel road to victory.9:25A journey through the new Syria: what is the future after Assad? – videoThe unprecedented HTS-led offensive that led Assad to flee to Russia wasa year in the making. It began in Idlib city, where the scars of war are still obvious – some buildings have been hit by missiles, and abandoned military positions litter the surrounding countryside.HTS, which is still listed as a terrorist group by western countries, battled other Islamist groups for years before it managed to cement control here in 2019, bringing some stability to this corner of Syria. Until December, this was the only pocket of the country still outside the regime’s control after Assad’s years-long fight – assisted by Russia, Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah – to claw back Syria’s urban centres from rebels.Idlib province was home to approximately 1 million people before the war, but the population has swelled to about 4 million, as wave after wave of displaced people fled regime offensives elsewhere.“I came here a few years ago from Raqqa. It’s the safest place in Syria,” said Mohammed, a 45-year-old street vendor selling pastries during the morning rush hour at a roundabout in central Idlib.mapHis family fled the rise of Islamic State, which used the chaos of the war to establish a so-called caliphate: the desert city of Raqqa was its capital before a US-led coalition defeated the jihadists in 2019. “I would never go back to Raqqa now. We have built a new life here”Today what sets Idlib apart from the rest of the country is money. Syria has been suffocated by economic sanctions and regime corruption, and more than 90% of the population live below the poverty line. But in Idlib, there is 4G internet, water, electricity services and rubbish collection, and the Salvation Government – HTS’s state-building project – has constructed roads, schools and hospitals.Proximity to Turkey, which backs several Syrian rebel groups, means goods from the outside world are readily available. The streets are filled with SUVs, and several shiny new malls compete for business with hipster coffee shops and military supply stores selling combat gear, fatigues and gun parts.View image in fullscreenMohammed serving early-morning customers in Idlib.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianYet Idlib’s prosperity appears to have come at a price. HTS’s rule is authoritarian:critics and protesters have been arrested or disappeared, and minority groups have reported the confiscation of property and restrictions on religious services. In the past, women have been subject to dress codes. Today, there is still a degree of gender segregation and music is not allowed in public spaces.“Officially you don’t have to wear an abaya or a headscarf, but there is no way you can go outside without your hair covered,” said a female activist originally from Aleppo, who asked not to be named for her safety. “HTS are thugs … This is not the future I wanted for my daughters.”Whether HTS will export its version of Islamist rule to the rest of the country is now at the forefront of many people’s minds. Aleppo, just 37 miles (60km) from Idlib city, was the first target of the surprise offensive that saw Assad’s rule collapse like a house of cards. Widespread devastation caused by the regime’s blistering air campaign and sieges of rebel neighbourhoods during 2012-2016 came to symbolise the war’s brutality.Today, almost nothing has been rebuilt. Like many places in Syria, half of Aleppo was left to rot as a reminder of the price to pay for rising up against the regime, and the city is desperately poor. Pollution from locally refined petrol used for generators clogs the streets and almost no one can afford to heat their homes despite the bitter winter weather.View image in fullscreenOn the highway from Idlib to Homs, a billboard is painted with the new Syrian flag.Photograph: David Lombeida/The Guardian“As a Christian, I was worried, but they did not storm my shop. They came and said: ‘Hello Joseph, how are you.’ I was shocked,” said Joseph Fanoun, 68, the owner of an antiques shop, of the arrival of HTS.Abu Obeida, 25, a commander with the Turkish-backed Northern Storm Brigade, which fought alongside HTS to take Aleppo, said that Syria’s people did not need to be afraid.“We have entered all the cities and the people have not seen anything from us but good words and good treatment,” he said. “We do not have sectarian hatred … It is our duty to protect the minorities because they are under our rule.”Despite repeated reassurances from HTS and its allies, worries remain. “Before the revolution, things were under control to some extent.Emptying the prisonshas created a big problem,” said Mahmoud Farash, a 50-year-old restaurateur.View image in fullscreenCrowds gather in Umayyad Square and set off fireworks in celebration of the fallen Assad regime.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianFurther down the M5, scenes of destruction and poverty repeat. Homs was the scene of the fiercest early battles between the regime and rebel forces as the Arab spring uprising morphed into civil war. Entire neighbourhoods are now empty shells, holes smashed through walls.Syrian government troops went house to house after the inhabitants fled, destroying what remained to ensure no one could return. Some of the buildings bear pro-regime graffiti: “You wanted freedom, you dogs,” and “Assad for ever.”It is now possible for displaced residents to come back, although there is not much to return to. Ali Nadaz, 60, fled Homs in 2013. He came back to find stray dogs living in his apartment building. “It used to be full of people. Where are the families now?” he said. “We have nothing left.”Many parts of Damascus were relatively insulated from the conflict that raged elsewhere in Syria. Its inhabitants were shocked by the arrival of opposition and Islamist fighters on its streets.Those who chose to remain here throughout the war are now afraid of being seen as pro-regime. They are also worried that HTS may not follow through with its promises to hold elections and protect women’s and minority rights.View image in fullscreenAli Nadaz, 60, looks at the building he once called home.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianIn the city’s famous Abbasid Square, pro-democracy protests have been held for the first time since 2011. Looked at one way, the newfound freedom of expression and assembly is astonishing; in another, it is worrying that residents feel it is necessary.Nawara al-Baridi, 29, a radio journalist, was among those protesting. She said her station was shut down by HTS a few days after Assad fled the country.“The youth are gathered here today to ensure Syria is for all Syrians, not just a specific party or ideology … We are not afraid to express our opinions as we were before, but we hope there is no fear of other things in the future,” she said.Ultimately, the Arab spring uprisings in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen all failed. In Syria, the bloodshed of the civil war and the cruel legacy of the Assad regime cast a long shadow – but there is now a chance for the country to forge a different path.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Germany’s electoral system is meticulously proportional, so it’s very unlikely that any party will be able to govern alone.Friedrich Merz is leader of the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, who are polling at nearly 30%, so the chancellorship is very much his to lose.The CDU has said it will maintain theBrandmauer– or firewall – policy of not going into alliance with the far right, which includes the AfD. But the firewall has been seriously compromised during the election campaign, when Merz tried to pass a Bundestag motion with AfD support – the attempt only failed because rebels in the CDU refused to cooperate.The CDU may be able to form a coalition with the Greens, or may have to rely on a “grand coalition” with the Social Democrats. But in all likelihood, a sizeable vote will have been recorded for the AfD and their stances onEuropeand Ukraine. This may make the coalition less stable, particularly if Merz’s CDU continues its attempt to woo AfD voters. And excluding AfD from coalition talks will reinforce the populist narrative of a lockout by the liberal elite.Sources: Population, land area, GDP from Our World in Data, latest available figures.

She caresses its leaves. “It’s been so emotional to have it here,” says Paté, who works for Chile’s National Forest Corporation (CONAF).“It was here before us; it was here before themoai,” she says, referring to the megalithic statues that dot the island. “It has a sentimental value.”She is hugging a sprout ofSophora toromiro,a tree that was declared extinct in the wild in the 1960s and which scientists have been trying to bring back ever since.The species grew only on the remote island of Rapa Nui – also known as Easter Island – in the middle of the Pacific.Oral history suggeststoromiro wood was used for sacred artefacts and themoai kavakava,small wooden figurines that mimic the large stone faces that overlook the island’s slopes.View image in fullscreenEstefany Paté with one of 33 toromiro saplings at the nursery.Photograph: Sofia QuagliaOver time,archaeological records show, it became popular for construction, firewood and feeding cattle.Sonia Haoa Cardinali, a local archaeologist, says: “The toromiro must have been one of the last plants left in the community as they faced botanical impoverishment – they used it for many things.”By the 1960s it faced extinction in the wild due to overuse and changes in the island’s environmental conditions.Invasive speciesnow make up more than 90% of the island’s vegetation.Seeds from the last specimen left on the Chilean island were brought to safety in the national botanical garden in Viña del Mar in the 1950s, where they have since germinated into 98 trees for research and reproduction. But all attempts to bring toromiro back to Rapa Nui have failed so far.“My father took care of the trees, but they all died,” says Maria Tuki, whose father, Manuel Tuki, was involved in attempts to reintroduce the tree to the island in the 1980s.But now scientists think they have found a solution.Toromiro belongs to a family of pea plants that establishes symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria, known as rhizobia, which allow them to “fix nitrogen” from the atmosphere – converting the gas into a form plants can use. Each species has a matching microbial partner that lives in its root nodules.Macarena Gerding, a legume agronomist at Concepción University, says the toromiro’s bacteria are also likely to be extinct on Rapa Nui, which may be why reintroduction efforts have failed.View image in fullscreenMacarena Gerding collecting soil samples on Rapa Nui in 2019.Photograph: Concepción UniversityHer team came up empty-handed when they scoured local soils for toromiro-specific rhizobia. So they looked for them in related species, and found a match in three strands from Chile and New Zealand. They tested them in the lab, inoculating seedlings with the bacteria. “The difference is very clear,” says Gerding.Their work reinforces a growingbody of researchthat shows trees have intimate, interconnected relationships with microbial life – and that reintroductions of tree species can often fail without theright microbiome to support them.It’s been a super-ambitious task to resurrect this species – the climate didn’t used to be like this.Estefany PatéIn 2018, the scientists brought 40 tiny seedlings back to Rapa Nui’s nursery, and about 30 more plants each in 2019 and 2021. Over the past six years, the team has also discovered other fungi and bacteria that help toromiro synthesise nutrients despite soil degradation, as well as promoting root growth and helping the plant tolerate water shortages.A batch of potted plants with these new microbial additions arrived at the nursery late last year.“I’m confident that these organisms can make a difference,” says Gerding. “But I think we still have to look after those plants for a while.”Nurturing the plants until they are ready to return to the wild is Paté’s job at Mataveri Otai, where 33 toromiro trees are at different stages of growth.View image in fullscreenThe first batch of toromiro seedling in 2018.Photograph: Concepción University“It’s been a super-ambitious task to resurrect this species,” says Paté. “It’s been very complicated – the climate didn’t used to be like this.”For the species to be no longer classed as extinct on the island, a tree must produce its own seeds. One plant from the 2021 batch flowered for the first time last year, but did not make any seeds.“I can’t wait for it to give us flowers again, and hopefully seeds,” says Paté. Then plants will be taken from the nursery to the rest of the island.Locations for the reforestation project need to be carefully evaluated, though, says the project’s forest engineer, Jaime Espejo. “Out in the open field, I think it’s impossible,” he says.View image in fullscreenSome islanders believe the soil and climate have changed too much for the toromiro to thrive once again.Photograph: José-Maria Barres Manuel/AlamySince toromiro needs shade and moisture, he plans to put the saplings in plots of land with palm trees or close to the island’s volcanic craters.Not everybody in the local community has faith in the project, as many have been stung by its failures in the past, says Espejo. Some islanders believe the island has changed too radically for the plant to thrive, while others wonder whether the real essence of the ancient toromiro has been lost for ever.But his team aims to rely on local families who believe in the project to take care of toromiro in their back yards.Sara Paté Roe’s family is waiting to take care of the experimental saplings and dreams of planting them in her fields. “I hope to see the toromiro come back to the island,” she says. “It’s one of the most precious woods we’ve had.”“It is important to return to planting things that are ours.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsThe age of extinctionChileAmericasPlantsExtinct wildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The music carries past them to the shrubs that surround the circular majestic building and the neighbours going about their lives, the more than 250,000 refugees who live in the 250 sq km Bidi Bidi refugee settlement, thelargestrefugee camp in Africa.The young men – gathered for a chance to play a musical instrument or record music – welcome visitors with the awkward smile of youth. They are seated under the oldest fig tree, where the dream of building a place for the creative young people of Bidi Bidi to commune and nurture their talents was born.“People always gathered under this tree to sing and dance,” says Edward Byemba, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who moved toUgandaseven years ago and now teaches music at the centre. “This tree represents the place that sheltered us until we grew and built the centre.”His students nod in agreement as they look around the building, construction of which began in 2022, with enduring awe. Ceaser Godfrey, 21, jumps in with a confession.View image in fullscreenEdward Byemba (far left) and Victor Aluonzi (far right) with students under the fig tree where the idea of Bidi Bidi Performing Arts Centre was born.Photograph: Mark Ochieng“I used to be a headache to my community. I used to get into fights, take alcohol, smoke cigarettes and other things,” he says, and the cross hovering over his white Real Madrid jersey gleams in agreement as it catches the light from the glass bottles fixed in the ceiling to filter the sunlight in. “People laughed at me, and I was unhappy.”About 75%of the1.7 millionrefugees in Uganda are women and children and about 25% are aged 15 to 24. An estimated 53% of the entire refugee population is under 18 years old.Uganda has an open-door refugee policy. Most of the refugees are from South Sudan, DRC, Somalia, Burundi and Sudan.Refugeesin the east African country move and work freely and can access social services, such as education and health. Ugandans and refugees live side by side, with some families sheltering new arrivals for weeks as the government resettles them.When I sing, I think about the future. We, the youth will change a lot of things – not with guns but with all the things that we have learned in UgandaMoses Modi, musicianStill, many young refugees struggle with the past, sometimes resorting to harmful behaviour, such as violence, drug and alcohol abuse to cope.“When I was under the influence, I would forget about the blood flow that I had seen. This is what I wanted to do the most – forget,” says Godfrey, who fled South Sudan with his family after his father and mother were killed.His voice is soft and uncertain as he talks about how alcohol was a disappointing and temporary reprieve. However, when he starts singing his story, it booms alongside the elevatingamapianobeat that gets the young men swaying and vibrating their shoulders.“I am no longer a slave to sin. I am no longer a slave to sin. The old has gone, the new has come. I am free. Free as you can see,” they sing.Victor Aluonzi, a music teacher at the arts centre, describes it as a place that embraces transformational music and entertainment while boosting talent in the refugee settlement. Run by the Ugandan NGOSina Loketaand funded by Swiss philanthropist organisationTo: Foundationand thePlaying for Change Foundation, the centre’s website asserts that“creative expression is a fundamental human right”and that music and dance are tools for healing trauma and bolstering social cohesion.View image in fullscreenRefugees can nurture their creative talents at the centre. Many use music and dance to process their past trauma.Photograph: Mutua Matheka/To.org“People flee conflict and find that even within the settlement there is conflict. They experience conflict within themselves. Conflict with other refugees. Conflict with host communities. We had to find a way to handle all this conflict,” says Aluonzi, who comes from a Ugandan community neighbouring the settlement. “In a refugee settlement, it is important that you reinforce messages of peace and positively impact the society.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there is no love, I will sing about love. If there is hatred, I will use bold music to ask why,” he says.Modi’s soulful folk tunes evoke nostalgia and make him think about the day he will return home to South Sudan.“When I sing, I think about the future. We, the youth will change a lot of things – not with guns but with all the things that we have learned in Uganda. We shall return to South Sudan changed because in the settlement we are not fighting. In the settlement we are happy, normal boys. Our parents may fight but we, the youth, are not fighting.”When he is not at the arts centre or on stage performing, Modi, a trained chef, makesrolex, a Ugandan wrap of eggs and tomatoes sold as street food. He says he is working to rewrite his country’s story so that one day another 20-year-old boy will not take his potatoes to sell in the market only to find the people there scattered and a mother, father and their child lying in a pool of blood.View image in fullscreen‘The happy buzz of life’: children play inside the arts centre.Photograph: Mutua Matheka/To.org“The day I saw those three bodies, I knew I would be next. I told my parents that we had to run to Uganda where there is peace,” Modi says. “I joined Bidi Bidi arts centre because music is a universal language. Instead of fighting, we have dance competitions. People show off their culture and they are happy. We can cause change and be happy.”The hope is that in 10 years’ time the people of Bidi Bidi will have moved past theUSAid freezeand the ominous uncertainty hovering over the settlement will have melted – replaced with the return of the happy buzz of life and the markets that spring up on the days when the World Food Programme gives cash assistance to the most vulnerable refugees. During the rainy season, people will be able to watch water slide off the arts centre’s funnel-like roof, slithering in a silver stream into the black stones that provide a natural filter and making its way to the 200,000-litre underground tank that supplies water to refugees and Ugandans.“It is not just about the music,” Aluonzi says. “We talk about playing for change because we work towards all kinds of transformations – economic transformations, united communities, less violence and more healing.”Explore more on these topicsUgandaRefugeesAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was dark-skinned.For Black activists, the artwork’s message left no room for doubt: it implied a robbery and reinforced racist stereotypes, smearing Ecuador’s Afro-descedent minority, which suffers the worst outcomes in rates such asunemploymentandgender-based violence.“It was an offence to the Black people of Guayaquil,” said Guillermo Leones Pacheco, 62, president of the Pueblo Negro organisation, who was one of the leading figures in the campaign against the mural.View image in fullscreenGuillermo Leones Pacheco, 62, president of the Pueblo Negro organisation, during a chigualo in honour of four Black boys who were murdered after being detained by the military in Ecuador.Photograph: Donald Dias/The GuardianThat pressure ultimately led to the work’s removal in 2020 and the creation ofsix new murals depicting Black resistance.One of them, in the city’s south-west,features eight Black historical figures, includingMaría Chiquinquirá Díaz, an enslaved woman who, in the 18th century, sued her owners in Quito’s royal court in search of freedom. Although the case’s outcome is unknown, Díaz became an icon of Afro-Ecuadorian resistance.“Despite our presence here since the city’s founding, there is a loss of identity regarding Black people in Guayaquil,” said Pacheco, one of a group of activists and artists fighting to preserve Black culture in Ecuador’s largest city.Founded in 1535, Guayaquil was the main port during the Spanish colonisation, a status that continued after independence, making it Ecuador’s business and financial capital.Before abolition in 1845, Guayaquil was also the primary centre for the slave trade, supplying cacao and tobacco plantations across the country. The city also had a significant Black population, both enslaved and free, including the hundreds who worked at the port.Now, Afro-Guayaquileños mostly live in the impoverished belts of the city. They make up 6.9% of the city’s 2.746 million inhabitants – a higher rate than the national average of 4.8% – but they remain “invisible” to the authorities, says Carlos Valencia Lastra, 40, an activist for Black rights.“Society makes us invisible because they know they owe us a historical debt and have deprived us of many opportunities,” said Lastra, who coordinates a community centre in Nigeria, one of Guayaquil’s poorest and most predominantly Black neighbourhoods. “They’ve made us believe that our culture, customs, and traditions are the worst.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Valencia Lastra, an activist for Black rights, during a chigualo in honour of four Black boys who were murdered after being detained by the military in Ecuador.Photograph: Donald Dias/The GuardianFor this reason, he started a project to teach marimba to Black youths. The word originates from the Bantu language family and refers not only to the wooden instrument – also found in the Afro-Latin culture of countries like Mexico and Guatemala – but also to the rhythm, the dance and the culture itself.“When you listen to the marimba, you heal your soul and mind. It empowers Black people and helps you decolonise your thinking,” said Lastra.Last month, he and other marimberos played and sang during a chigualo – a funeral ritual of the Afro-descendent populations of coastal Ecuador and Colombia –in honour of four Black boys who were murderedafter being detained by the military.Activists from the Black movements argue that Afro-Ecuadorians are among the main victims of the numerous human rights violations committed during the“war on drugs” imposed a year ago by the country’s president, Daniel Noboa, in response to the surge in crime.“We need to defend ourselves from the oppression and discrimination we face,” said Maria Nazareno, 36, who also attended the chigualo and teaches another Afro-Ecuadorian musical genre to Black children: the bomba, in which performers balance a glass bottle on their head as they dance.“We cannot let this historical memory be lost,” she said.But artists fear that some parts of Afro-Ecuadorean culture are at risk of disappearance.View image in fullscreenMarimba and bomba (two Afro-Ecuadorian musical expressions) musicians and dancers, in Guayaquil.Photograph: Tiago Rogero/The Guardian“This is our greatest concern,” said Orlin Montaño, 48, a professor of traditional Afro-Ecuadorian music at the Universidad de las Artes and one of the few remaining marimba-makers in the country.It takes about 15 days to build the instrument, traditionally made from palm trees. But young people are losing interest in continuing the tradition, he said. “There is a strong interest in music from abroad, particularly from the United States, and not so much in what is ours,” he said, also lamenting the lack of financial support from the government.“If the state were truly interested in combating racism, it would start with education, reminding everyone that we have the same rights and obligations as any other Ecuadorian. A white ormestizochild isn’t born racist; it’s society that makes them racist,” said Montaño.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorRaceAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next moment, the mundane scene descends into the stuff of nightmares. In a video released by South Yorkshire police, which looks as if it has been caught by a doorbell camera, a 47-year-old man has a large black dog, tail wagging, on a lead. Seconds later, the man is being rolled across the road like a carrier bag tumbling in the wind. The muscular dog, perhaps disturbed when the man attempts to untangle the lead from his paws, leaps at him, and then, joined by a second large, loose dog, knocks him to the ground. A 14-year-old girl attempts to intervene, to a soundtrack of piercing screams.The attack, which unfolded in Sheffield last autumn, left the man with deep cuts and puncture wounds, while the teenager suffered minor injuries. A man and a woman were arrested on suspicion of possession of a dangerously out-of-control dog. And the breed of the dogs? These days, when we think “dog attack”, we’re quite likely to picture an XL bully, the American breed whose jowly mugshots have glared under headlines of maulings and fatalities, and whose ban under the DangerousDogsAct came into force a year ago.View image in fullscreenLilly O’Byrne from south Wales, who was attacked by a cane corso in September 2023.Photograph: Supplied imageBut it has now been claimed there is a new “status dog” on the block, gradually filling the space left by the XL: the cane corso, an Italian mastiff few outside the canine world have heard of (and even fewer can pronounce – it’s can-ay corso). It is this breed that is believed to have instigated the attack in Sheffield (the second dog was a mastiff).Last month, a canine behaviour specialist stoked anxiety after suggesting a rising unscrupulous interest in the cane corso, which he described as “an XL bully on steroids”. His remarks haven’t landed without controversy. Many swear the dogs are loving companions. Celebrity owners include the footballer Marcus Rashford, the actor Vin Diesel and the Boyzone star Ronan Keating – who flew his cane corso to Australia with the family last Christmas.But Wendy Cummins, 52, a veterinary nurse, dog trainer and treasurer of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers, agrees the breed seems to be replacing the XL bully, to dangerous effect. Her surgery has euthanised two cane corsos since Christmas because of uncontrollable aggression. “One we managed to get to the surgery but it was untouchable … We sedated him with food so we could get close to him,” she says. “The other one, the vet had to shoot a dart to sedate it.”While many owners are responsible, she says, others are not. “They’re lovely dogs if they’re reared correctly and have the correct training, boundaries, and are in the right social environment,” says Cummins, who adores her own German shepherd. “But the trouble with this type of dog is they can be a status symbol. It started with bulldogs, and then moved on to the XL bully. And now, because we have the ban, these types of people just move on to the next dog.” The cane corso? “That’s the breed they’ve gone for, unfortunately, and it’s an absolute crisis for these dogs,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe Love Island winner Jack Fincham is contesting a six-week jail sentence for being in charge of a dangerously out-of-control dog.Photograph: @jack_charlesf/InstagramBred originally to herd or guard livestock and property, and said to be descended from the molossian war dogs of ancient Rome, the cane corso is reported to have a bite force stronger than a lion’s. They can weigh up to 50kg. “That’s an awful lot of dog,” says Cummins. “We see owners scared of them – they can’t walk down the street; they can’t socialise them. The dogs are in chaotic households with children of different ages, without basic training; their needs are not being met. And then they become aggressive.”At the end of last month there was a shocking trio of dog attacks, all against children, that occurred within just two days in South Yorkshire. On 29 January a cane corso attacked a 16-year-old girl in Doncaster, leaving her in need of reconstructive surgery. The dog was destroyed at the scene with the owner’s permission. Soon afterwards, in nearby Sheffield, a six-year-old girl was bitten by her family’s pet pocket bully. And just five hours later in Thorne, near Doncaster, a seven-year-old boy was attacked by a pit bull and suffered puncture wounds. All three incidents happened within homes.They illustrate Britain’s disturbing rise in dog attacks. Freedom of information requests by the BBC found that attacks recorded by police in England and Wales had gone up 21% from 2022 to 2023. NHS England Digital provisional figures for 2022-2023 show that more than 6,000 people were treated for bites or other injuries caused by dogs. No official figures exist for cane corso cases, but the name keeps surfacing.Because of their sheer power and size, with negligence, in irresponsible hands, cane corsos can cause a significant riskLast autumn, South Yorkshire police said a cane corso caused severe facial injuries to a woman in her 30s after she tried to separate her fighting pets at home. She required plastic surgery. The very next day another cane corso bit its owner as she tried to break up a fight between it and an XL bully. She ended up in hospital. In April 2023, Wayne Stevens, 51, was killed when his brother Gary’s cane corso cross attacked him at a house in Derby. Gary Stevens was given a four-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The 2018 Love Island winner Jack Fincham was given a six-week sentence after his cane corso, Elvis, bit a runner in Swanley, Kent, in September 2022, followed by a later, separate incident. Fincham, 32, admitted two counts of being in charge of a dangerously out-of-control dog, with one of the incidents causing injury. Hewas granted bailwhile he appeals against the sentence.Elisa Allen, the vice-president of programmes and operations for the animal protection charity Peta UK, believes the cane corso’s aggression is intrinsic. “Humans have intentionally bred it to hunt large game and to fiercely protect farmland from predators … to have massive, muscular bodies, a high prey drive and extremely strong jaws,” she says.View image in fullscreenThis sculpture from the 1st or 2nd century AD portrays a molossian hound, used for hunting and thought to be an ancestor of the cane corso.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesMany responsible owners disagree. John Allison, a trainer and owner of two cane corsos, Vito and Diablo, has a smile in his voice as he describes his “intelligent” pets. “They are calm and relaxed. They’ll just lie around,” he says. His kids – aged 15, three and one – stroke them, although they are never alone with them. “Children should never be allowed to be alone with any dog,” he says.“Because of their sheer power and size, with negligence, in irresponsible hands, cane corsos can cause a significant risk, the same as any other breed of dog,” Allison concedes. But he’s clear his dogs were bred well, and he has trained them rigorously, and exercises them for two hours a day.Many argue banning status dogs is futile. “Sadly, any large or powerful dog can also appeal to those who wish to train a dog for illicit purposes, and banning breeds can move these people on to other breeds – or indeed new types of dogs outside of the law,” says Bill Lambert, a spokesperson for the Kennel Club.About 300 cane corsos are currently listed for sale on the Freeads website, including many for rehoming, with owners admitting they can no longer care for them.Controversy surrounding dog attacks grew in the 80s, with the American pit bull terrier then public enemy number one. In the US, a Time magazine feature on the breed was headlined Time Bombs on Legs. In the UK, it was among four breeds banned under the new Dangerous Dogs Act in 1991, alongside Japanese tosas, dogos Argentinos and fila Brasileiros.Under the act, offenders can be imprisoned for up to 14 years, disqualified from ownership or have their dogs euthanised. XL bullies are the only breed to have been banned since. From February last yearit became illegalto breed or own one unless holding a certificate of exemption. Some 55,000 of these have been granted. Registered dogs must be neutered, and muzzled in public.Last year, freedom of information requests by the Independent revealed that in the five months after the XL ban, the number of recorded incidents of out-of-control dogs injuring people or guide dogs rose by 9%. Ninefatal dog attackshave been reported in England and Wales since the ban, all within homes, five involving XL bullies.But police say they have seized more than 4,500 XL bullies, and the campaigning organisation Protect OurPetsbelieves the ban is a success because fatalities involving XLs haven’t been in public spaces. It argues that some other breeds should be restricted. “Of course the cane corso can become a problem in time, as well as plenty of other dogs with fighting heritage, and the government should be taking steps now to deal with this,” says Diana Hunter, a spokesperson.But the dog welfare expert Samantha Gaines says singling out a “type” of dangerous dog leads nowhere. “Dog aggression is a complex issue,” she says. “Sadly, there will always be people who wish to use dogs as weapons or for antisocial behaviour. But whether a dog chooses to show aggression comes down to their breeding, how they were raised and their experiences with people – and not just their type.”She argues the government should focus on irresponsible breeders, promote responsible ownership and enforce legislation. She also believes licensing for dog owners is key, as does Allison.“If you do not have the physical capability to handle a large-breed dog,” he says, “you simply should not be allowed to have one. If you don’t have the finances to support correct training, then you shouldn’t be allowed to have one.”James McNally puts his head in his hands at the “demonising” of the cane corso. As the head of personal injury at Slee Blackwell Solicitors, he has specialised in dog attacks for 10 years, and his civil cases have risen by a third since the pandemic. He puts it down to elevated Covid dog ownership first – there were 11 million dogs in the UK in 2023, up 8% in a year. But a recent analysis of 800 of his cases revealed 73 dog breeds, and even more crossbreeds. Cane corsos were among them. In fact, McNally says: “We’ve dealt with far more cases involving cane corsos than XL bullies.” However, rottweilers and German shepherds feature most highly, and some of the most ferocious attacks were by huskies and akitas.A year into the XL bully ban, one thing is clear: it is not the solution to dog attacks | Elle HuntRead moreHe sounds angry. He sees the worst consequences of poor handling. Children with “the top of their scalp ripped off”. Young victims bedwetting due to trauma. One client, Alex O’Byrne, from Bridgend, south Wales, describes an attack on his 11-year-old daughter, Lilly, in September 2023. A dog mauled her on their street. “I heard her scream,” he recalls. “It took a chunk out of her cheek, just above her eye, and put something like 11 holes through her hand when she fought it off.” She is permanently scarred. A man pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dangerously out-of-control dog, causing injury, and was sentenced. The dog was a staffordshire bull terrier and German shepherd cross.O’Byrne believes all dogs can be dangerous, or not. “I grew up with a German shepherd, a guard dog, but it was well trained. It was a nice dog,” he says. More pressing is the fact that the dog that attacked Lilly wasn’t insured, making it harder to claim compensation. Insurance should be mandatory, McNally argues. The XL ban was “easy”, he believes. “The problem is much bigger.”There were, after all, three breeds in the trio of South Yorkshire attacks. “They can ban the cane corso, which would be an absolute crying shame, and they’ll just move on to another one,” says Cummins.Explore more on these topicsDangerous dogsAnimalsDogsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We then worked out that the tomb had been flooded. It had been built underneath a waterfall, and it had filled with water at some stage within about six years of the burial.”The remains of the king were taken out through a subsidiary corridor and moved somewhere else, he said. “It was only gradually, as we sifted through all the material – tons and tons of broken limestone – that we discovered these small fragments of alabaster, which named Thutmose II.”The fragments were probably broken when the tomb was moved, he said. “And thank goodness they did actually break one or two things, because that’s how we found out whose tomb it was.”The discovery was made by a joint mission formed by the New Kingdom Research Foundation, a British independent academic foundation, and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, a project affiliated with the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge.Thutmose II was the husband as well as the half-brother of Hatshepsut, one of Egypt’s greatest pharaohs and one of the few women to rule in her own right, and the father of Thutmose III.Litherland told PA media: “This discovery solves a great mystery of ancient Egypt: the location of the tombs of the early 18th dynasty kings. The tomb of this ancestor of Tutankhamun had never been found because it was always thought to be at the other end of the mountain near the Valley of the Kings.”Considering the evidence the contents of the tomb were moved to a second tomb, Mohsen Kamel, assistant field director, said: “The possible existence of a second, and most likely intact, tomb of Thutmose II is an astonishing possibility.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptArchaeologyEgyptologyAfricaHistorynewsShareReuse this content"

It has previously said it is working with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to resolve potential historic tax liabilities.The inland revenue service alleges that Binance has a “significant economic presence” in Nigeria and is therefore liable for corporate income tax. It is seeking a court declaration that Binance pay income taxes for 2022 and 2023, plus a 10% annual penalty on unpaid amounts. FIRS is also requesting a 26.75% interest rate on the unpaid taxes, based on the Central Bank of Nigeria’s lending rate.Binance was already facing four counts of tax evasion in Nigeria after a government crackdown on the industry last year. The charges include non-payment of value-added tax, company income tax, failure to file tax returns and complicity in helping customers to evade taxes through its platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The music carries past them to the shrubs that surround the circular majestic building and the neighbours going about their lives, the more than 250,000 refugees who live in the 250 sq km Bidi Bidi refugee settlement, thelargestrefugee camp in Africa.The young men – gathered for a chance to play a musical instrument or record music – welcome visitors with the awkward smile of youth. They are seated under the oldest fig tree, where the dream of building a place for the creative young people of Bidi Bidi to commune and nurture their talents was born.“People always gathered under this tree to sing and dance,” says Edward Byemba, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who moved toUgandaseven years ago and now teaches music at the centre. “This tree represents the place that sheltered us until we grew and built the centre.”His students nod in agreement as they look around the building, construction of which began in 2022, with enduring awe. Ceaser Godfrey, 21, jumps in with a confession.View image in fullscreenEdward Byemba (far left) and Victor Aluonzi (far right) with students under the fig tree where the idea of Bidi Bidi Performing Arts Centre was born.Photograph: Mark Ochieng“I used to be a headache to my community. I used to get into fights, take alcohol, smoke cigarettes and other things,” he says, and the cross hovering over his white Real Madrid jersey gleams in agreement as it catches the light from the glass bottles fixed in the ceiling to filter the sunlight in. “People laughed at me, and I was unhappy.”About 75%of the1.7 millionrefugees in Uganda are women and children and about 25% are aged 15 to 24.

Most of the refugees are from South Sudan, DRC, Somalia, Burundi and Sudan.Refugeesin the east African country move and work freely and can access social services, such as education and health. Ugandans and refugees live side by side, with some families sheltering new arrivals for weeks as the government resettles them.When I sing, I think about the future. We, the youth will change a lot of things – not with guns but with all the things that we have learned in UgandaMoses Modi, musicianStill, many young refugees struggle with the past, sometimes resorting to harmful behaviour, such as violence, drug and alcohol abuse to cope.“When I was under the influence, I would forget about the blood flow that I had seen. This is what I wanted to do the most – forget,” says Godfrey, who fled South Sudan with his family after his father and mother were killed.His voice is soft and uncertain as he talks about how alcohol was a disappointing and temporary reprieve. However, when he starts singing his story, it booms alongside the elevatingamapianobeat that gets the young men swaying and vibrating their shoulders.“I am no longer a slave to sin. I am no longer a slave to sin. The old has gone, the new has come. I am free. Free as you can see,” they sing.Victor Aluonzi, a music teacher at the arts centre, describes it as a place that embraces transformational music and entertainment while boosting talent in the refugee settlement.

If there is hatred, I will use bold music to ask why,” he says.Modi’s soulful folk tunes evoke nostalgia and make him think about the day he will return home to South Sudan.“When I sing, I think about the future. We, the youth will change a lot of things – not with guns but with all the things that we have learned in Uganda. We shall return to South Sudan changed because in the settlement we are not fighting.

Panamanian authorities say they believe that Zheng was aided by locals who had been “prowling” outside the Decapolis hotel in the capital city where the deportees had been held.News of her escape came as 170 of the deported migrants were taken to the Darién region, close to the border with Colombia, according to a Panamanian lawyer representing one of the migrant families. The Panamanian government has said it would expand a camp previously used to house migrants arriving inPanamaafter crossing the Darién Gap, the dangerous jungle separating Central and South America.After his election last July, Panamanian president José Raúl Mulinosigned a deal with the USto control the flow of migrants through the jungle, stringing up barbed wire, upping border patrols and deporting mainly Ecuadoran and Colombian citizens on flights from the runway close to the town of Metetí.Amid Trump’s threats to “take back” the Panama Canal, the Panamanian government has agreed to receive hundreds of migrants who the US cannot easily deport.US-Panama relationship was ‘very strong’. Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardRead moreMulino has said that the runway at Metetí will be expanded, in order for larger planes – presumably those able to make transatlantic flights – to land and take-off.Representatives of the International Organization forMigration, a UN-related body responsible for undertaking the plan, were unable to comment.However, Panama also lacks the flight agreements to deport the migrants to their home countries. They could, therefore, remain incarcerated in the San Vicente facility that will be “like a concentration camp”, according to one person with knowledge of the plan.Many of them fear they will face punishment, or even death, should they return.Artemis Ghasemzadeh, a 27 year old Iranian English teacher who had been held at the Decapolis hotel, told the New York Times that she was a Christian convert and would face possible execution under Shariah law should she return. “Only a miracle can save us,”she told reporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finally, the police arrived to escort the Guardian’s reporter from the premises.Panamanian politicians are aware that, in a state of political duress following Trump’s threats, their country has come to play an ugly role in his aggressive deportation policy.On Wednesday, the government of neighbouring Costa Rica also agreed to receive 200 migrants from Central Asian countries and India. The move was prompted by the potential threat of trade tariffs, president Rodrigo Chaves said, adding: “We’re helping our powerful economic brother in the north, because if [the US] imposes a tax on our export zones, we’re screwed.”Explore more on these topicsPanamaUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsAmericasMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

In the US they get back into the White House,” said Marcelo Freixo, a leading leftwing politician on Wednesday after the attorney general formally accused Bolsonaro of engineering a sprawling conspiracy to cling to power following his defeat in the 2022 election.For his alleged crimes – which include participation in an attempted coup d’état, an armed criminal association and a violent attempt to abolish the rule of law – Bolsonaro could face a prison sentence of over 40 years. Trump meanwhile is beginning his second term as president after managing to shirk responsibility for his alleged offenses, including inciting the January 2021 attacks in Washington DC.“In the US Trump encouraged an attempted coup through the storming of the Capitol and emerged unpunished. InBrazilBolsonaro led an attempted coup and he is going to jail,” said Freixo hailing the South American country as “a more serious democracy than the US”.Bolsonaro indictment leaves Brazil’s tropical Trump staring at prospect of jailRead moreFreixo was far from alone in voicing those sentiments as Brazilians absorbed the shocking details in the attorney general’s 272-page indictment, which laid bare just how close one of the world’s largest democracies came to suffering a violent military rupture after Bolsonaro lost its last presidential election to his leftwing rivalLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvain 2022.Desperate to cling to power, Bolsonaro allegedly presided over an intricate two-year authoritarian conspiracy, which involved using social media to spread disinformation about Brazil’s supreme court and election voting system, sowing chaos on the country’s streets, and using that turmoil as a justification for a military intervention.The most sinister element of the alleged plot involved the “neutralization” of public figures considered foes of Bolsonaro’s political movement, with the use of guns and poison. The targets allegedly included the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes and Brazil’s current president, Lula.Bolsonaro had even allegedly prepared an address he planned to make to the nation after carrying out his power grab. In it, the far-right populist planned to quote the Italian theologian and philosopher St Thomas Aquinas’s ideas about resisting “unjust laws”, seemingly as a way of validating his illegal actions.Bolsonaro has rejected the attorney general’s accusations, with his lawyers voicing “astonishment and anger” over the charges. His politician son, Carlos Bolsonaro, compared the claims in the indictment to a “sack of dung”.In a statement, Bolsonaro alleged Brazil’s justice system had been “weaponized” against him in an effort to criminalize his movement and silence millions of Brazilian supporters. “This is the same failed strategy that was used against President Trump,” he said of his most important international ally.But progressive Brazilians hailed how, unlike in the US, Brazil’s police and judiciary seemed to be successfully holding those who allegedly conspired against Brazil’s young democracy to account.“Here in Brazil the institutions did their job defending democracy,” Freixo said. “We’ve always been told that North American institutions are really strong – but the institutions that showed themselves to be truly strong were the Brazilian ones, which did not allow a coup to take place.”A former Brazilian secretary of justice, the lawyer Augusto de Arruda Botelho, said: “For any person who calls themselves a democrat, this is a historic moment in Brazil. This is a moment where we say: ‘There are limits.’”“Political and ideological and party political divergences are healthy … in any democracy. But there are limits. And Bolsonaro and Bolsonarismo went way beyond this limit,” Botelho added. “The limit is the law. They broke the law when they tried to stage a coup d’état and they are now being prosecuted for this.”Conrado Hübner Mendes, a constitutional law professor at the University of São Paulo, said he believed there was “more than enough evidence” for Bolsonaro to be found guilty at trial. Mendes believed a criminal conviction, combined with the fact that Bolsonaro has already been barred from seeking elected office until 2030, “should put an end to his political career”.However, Mendes doubted it would deal a fatal blow to “the political criminality Bolsonaro helped build and which remains strong” in Brazil, in the form of the ex-president’s hard-right successors.Botelho said it was hard to predict the future of Bolsonaro, who is only likely to be arrested once the legal process has fully played out, something that could take months.“It hurts him politically,” he said. “But in a way it also boosts his supporters,” who would try to paint their leader as the victim of political persecution.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvanewsShareReuse this content"

They have a lot to do in the United States.”The designation, which came into effect on Thursday, marks a shift in how the threat from certain organised crime groups is perceived by US agencies and augurs a greater role for the CIA and the US military.Trump’s pick for the new US ambassador in the Mexico, Ron Johnson, served as ambassador in El Salvador from 2019 to 2021 and before that spent decades in the CIA and the US army, including as a Green Beret, the elite army unit that conducts covert operations abroad.However, it is still unclear just what effect the designation will have. US agencies already have an array of tools at their disposal to go after transnational organised crime groups by restricting their members’ abilities to travel or do business.The main difference will be the range of people that can be targeted, which will widen to include anyone who provides “material support” to the cartels.Material support could mean anything between logistical support and financial services, training and lodging, guns and false documents. But exactly how that is interpreted will depend on political will.While the designation of cartels as FTOs itself will not authorise US military action in Mexico, some fear it is a first step towards it. Trump has already suggested bombing drug labs, and has reportedly discussedsending special forcesto kill cartel leaders.Since Trump returned to power, the US military has increased its airborne surveillance of the cartels along the US-Mexico border, while the CIA has stepped up drone flights over Mexico to hunt for fentanyl labs – though Sheinbaum said that this was with Mexico’s permission.Earlier this month, Trump delayed his threatened 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico after Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 more soldiers to the border to reduce fentanyl trafficking and migration.It is unclear how those soldiers will reduce the flow of fentanyl, given that it is so potent that only relatively small volumes are moved, and thatthe great majority is trafficked through ports of entry by US citizens.Nonetheless, Sheinbaum said that Trump in return agreed to help reduce arms trafficking. Hundreds of thousands of guns sold in the US each year end up in the hands of Mexican groups now designated as terrorist organisations.Sheinbaum has said that Mexico could expand its ongoing lawsuit against US gunmakers to includealleged complicity with terror groups.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasDrugsDrugs tradeFentanylDonald TrumpClaudia SheinbaumnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the companies, this would violate Dos Santos’s freedom of speech in the US.Although Moraes’s orders do not pertain to Trump’s companies, TMTG contends that Truth Social depends on Rumble’s technology for cloud hosting, video streaming and other back-end services; therefore, it risks encountering “operational challenges” in the US due to Moraes’s orders.Moraes has not yet commented on the case.The companies seek a judgment “declaring Justice Moraes’s Gag Orders unenforceable in the United States”.Mendonça, who is also a lawyer, said she could see no legal basis for the case in either Brazilian or US law. “It is truly an attempt to create confusion, apply political pressure, and weaken Moraes’s standing,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, one year after he lost power to his leftwing rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,Bolsonaro was banned from seeking officefor eight years for peddling disinformation about Brazil’s electronic voting system. That decision by electoral authorities scuppered Bolsonaro’s plans for a Donald Trump-like revival in the next presidential election, in 2026, and has already sparked a slow-burn war of succession between rightwing pretenders jostling to claim his crown.Potential heirs include the governors of two of Brazil’s richest states, São Paulo and Minas Gerais, Tarcísio de Freitas and Romeu Zema;a country singer with 45 million followers on Instagram called Gusttavo Lima; and Bolsonaro’s wife, the photogenic evangelical Christian Michelle Bolsonaro.Bolsonaro’s politician son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon recently hailed as “the future president of Brazil”, has also thrown his hat into the ring.Calejon believed the accusations against Bolsonaro would accelerate that succession struggle, as conservative voters and leaders accepted that the future of Brazil’s most influential rightwing leader almost certainly lay behind bars. If convicted, the 69-year-old politician could face a jail sentence of more than 40 years.Brazil’s former secretary of justice, the lawyer Augusto de Arruda Botelho, believed the charges against the ex-president were “very robust” and clearly placed Bolsonaro in “a leadership position” of the alleged plot to stop Lula taking power after his election win by staging a coup.The supreme court will now consider whether to accept the charges – something widely seen as a foregone conclusion – and whether to launch criminal proceedings that would see Bolsonaro stand trial. Botelho said the case was likely to be heard by a group of five supreme court judges although it was hard to predict how long the whole process might take. “This isn’t something that’s going to be over and done with in the next few months … In my experience, it’s unlikely this will all be finished in 2025,” Botelho said.However long the process takes, there is a striking contrast between Bolsonaro’s miserable outlook and the triumphant political fightback of his ally Trump, who shrugged off allegations that he conspired to overturn the 2020 US election – and last month reclaimed power.Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian research center Cebrap, believed part of the explanation for their drastically different fates was that Brazil’s judiciary had “truly managed to act in defense of democracy”, through the supreme court’s pursuit of those involved in anti-democratic acts. In the US, Rocha argued, “the institutions failed to prevent a politician who openly supported an insurrection from moving forwards with his [presidential] candidacy”.Botelho believed Brazil’s judiciary had shown itself to be more “solid” and “reliable” than the US system, which was “more susceptible to the political zeitgeist”. “The [Brazilian] supreme court has sought to punish coup plotters and in doing so to defend the democratic rule of law – and it has done a very good job of this,” he said.With Trump back in the White House, some fear the US president may seek to pressure Brazilian authorities over Bolsonaro. “I can’t say exactly how, or exactly when. But it’s safe to say that Trumpism will try to push for Jair Bolsonaro’s situation to be reversed,” said Calejon.On Wednesday morning, just hours after charges against Bolsonaro were announced, there was the first hint of possible retaliation from Trump’s camp. The New York Times reported thatthe US president’s media company was suing the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes– one of the authorities pro-Bolsonaro plotters stand accused of plotting to assassinate – for alleged acts of censorship against rightwing social media networks.Some wonder whether the US might offer Bolsonaro sanctuary at its embassy in the capital, Brasília. Others suspect, given Bolsonaro’s ties to Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, that the ex-president might try to hide in Hungary’s diplomatic compound in the hope that an ally wins the 2026 election and offers him a get-out-of-jail card in the form of amnesty.“Trump is so completely unpredictable and behaves like a lunatic with such frequency that I just don’t know if he’d be capable of offering shelter to someone who has been formally accused of a crime and whose name … should be on Interpol’s wanted list,” said Calejon.For now though one thing was certain: Bolsonaro had taken a major step towards jail. “What has happened is utterly historic,” Calejon said, “and has the potential to be a watershed moment in Brazilian politics.”Additional reporting by Tiago RogeroExplore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Days later, Charlotte’s family in the UK contacted the friend, saying they had lost contact with her.Last Monday, the friend, who had also not heard from Peet, reported her disappearance at a police station in Rio. However, as her last known contact was reportedly in São Paulo, the case was transferred to authorities there.São Paulo’s public security department said the case was being examined by missing person investigators and that the Department of Homicide and Protection of the Person would be assisting.In an interview withSky NewsCharlotte’s father, Derek Peet, said his daughter flew from Gatwick in London to São Paulo without informing her family, although it is unclear when exactly she travelled.“It’s very worrying, but I don’t have any more to say. I’m very concerned, but I just don’t know what’s going on. We’re just trying to pick up the pieces, really,” he said.Peet is fluent in Portuguese and had lived in Brazil recently, working as a freelance journalist for outlets such as the Independent, Times, Telegraph and Al Jazeera.In its statement, ACIE made “an appeal to the relevant authorities to intensify efforts to find the British journalist as soon as possible”.The British embassy in Brazil said it was supporting the family of the British citizen and was in contact with local authorities.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The Financial Times reported the ships were about 150 nautical miles off the coast of Sydney.The ships’ presence off Australia’s coast closely follows an incident in the SouthChinaSea last week, in which a Chinese fighter jet released flares in front of an Australian military plane.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe ships have not crossed into Australia’s territorial waters – 12 nautical miles from the coastline – but are inside Australia’s exclusive economic zone (200nm). The ships have not breached international law and the defence force has said its monitoring of the fleet is “routine”.Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, said while the ships’ passage off Australia’s coast was “not unprecedented” it was unusual.“We are keeping a close watch on them and we will be making sure that we watch every move,” Marles told Sky News.“And whenever this mission is over on the part of the Chinese task group, we will assess everything we have seen to make a proper assessment of exactly what they were trying to achieve through this mission.”Australia’s air force and navy were monitoring the ships, he said.“This is not unprecedented but an unusual event,” Marles said. “Just as they have a right to be in international waters … we have a right to be prudent and to make sure that we are surveilling them, which is what we are doing.”In a statement on Thursday, the defence department said it “routinely monitors all maritime traffic in Australia’s exclusive economic zone and maritime approaches”.“Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, under international law, particularly the UN convention on the law of the sea.”Kyiv’s White House wooing implodes as Zelenskyy tells the truth about Trump | Julian BorgerRead moreThe ships’ arrival off Australia’s coast comes as the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, met with Marles and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in Australia.Paparo is scheduled to meet Australia’s chief of joint operations in Canberra on Thursday.A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Guo Jiakun, declined to comment on the ships’ presence in Australia’s EEZ when asked on Wednesday, saying he was “not familiar” with the situation.According to earlier Chinese media reports, the PLA-Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel have been conducting “real-combat” exercises in an unspecified part of the Pacific Ocean over the past month.The three Chinese vessels’ voyage down Australia’s east coast is understood to be the farthest down Australia’s east coast Chinese naval ships have sailed outside an official military visit to Australia.Chinese ships sailed into Sydney Harbour in 2019 but that visit was undertaken in coordination with the Australian government.Paparo told the Honolulu Defense Forum earlier this month that China’s escalating military demonstrations of force towards Taiwan were “not exercises; they are rehearsals” for an invasion or blockade of the autonomous island.Despite the Chinese Communist government never having ruled Taiwan, Beijing claims the island as an inviolable part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to annex it.Paparo said China had shown “clear intent and capability” to attack Taiwan. Most recently, China conducted a massive simulated air and sea blockade of Taiwan in October as Taipei marked its national day.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They were discovered in an area of Takayu Onsen (hot spring) where high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide, a toxic byproduct of volcanic hot springs, have been recorded.The gas gives Japan’s onsen resorts their unmistakable sulphurous smell but can be dangerous if inhaled in high enough concentrations. Authorities said there is a possibility the three inhaled the gas, the Asahi Shimbun reported.At safe levels, the gas is said to be good for high blood pressure, joint pain and other ailments – health benefits that have long attracted visitors to thegreen-white watersof the 400-year-old resort. But it can also be hazardous in poorly ventilated spaces and in high concentrations outdoors.The victims–the manager of Kagetsu Highland Hotel, a member of staff and the managing director of the company that runs the hotel – had been conducting routine maintenance checks at the hot spring’s source when they are believed to have got into difficulty, Japanese media reported.Authorities were alerted on Monday evening when the men, who were in their 50s and 60s, failed to return to the hotel.A doctor at the scene confirmed they had died, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said, but authorities have yet to determine the official cause of death.The snow was 110cm deep on Monday, when the men left to conduct their fortnightly maintenance check, and had increased to 146cm the following day, when their bodies were discovered lying in the snow near a mountain trail. The temperature had plummeted to as low as -7.7C, the Kyodo news agency said.Junichi Endo, chairman of the Takayu Onsen Tourism Association, said the presence of heavy snow in the area “may have caused hydrogen sulphide to accumulate”, according to NHK.The public broadcaster quoted Prof Takeshi Oba, an expert on volcanic gases at Tokai University, as saying that it was possible that “extremely high” concentrations of hydrogen sulphide were present in and around the hot spring, which is located near an active volcano.When snow accumulates, geothermal heat can cause it to start melting and create depressions where hydrogen sulphide, which is heavier than air, can accumulate, Oba told NHK.Around 20 firefighters and police officers had to use breathing apparatus during their search for the men due to high levels of hydrogen sulphide.In 2015, three men were found dead at a hot spring resort in the northern prefecture of Akita. Media reports said the victims, like those discovered this week, had been performing maintenance work in a snow-covered area.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They had also forged certificates to guarantee “authenticity”, police said.View image in fullscreenThe workshop also contained art catalogues that the fraudsters used to sell the works.Photograph: Carabinieri cultural heritage protection squadThe investigation began after police monitored sales sites and came across hundreds of paintings of dubious quality bearing the signatures of painters who were active in the 19th and 20th centuries.Other artists whose work was forged include Mario Puccini, Giacomo Balla and the Belgian painter Anna De Weert.

Ansa reported that the service would be suspended until an internal investigation into the matter had concluded.During a meeting last week with Copasir, the parliamentary committee for the intelligence services, Giovanni Caravelli, Aise’s chief, admitted the agency had used the Paragon spyware but not to monitor journalists or activists.But the union FNSI, which with the Italian Order of Journalists submitted the legal complaint “against unknown individuals”, is sceptical.“Was Francesco Cancellato the only journalist in Italy targeted? We don’t think so,” said Alessandra Costante, FNSI’s secretary general. “We want clarity, we want journalists to be able to do their job without the risk of being intercepted. We’re dealing with facts that not only violate the criminal code but the constitution itself. It is also extremely serious that the government has decided not to report to parliament.”It remains unclear which government body may have ordered the use of the Paragon spyware and whether any such use of spyware was cleared by a judge.Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister, accused the government of “wounding democracy” while Federico Fornaro, an MP for the Democratic party, said the government’s avoidance of questions was “a slap in the face to parliament”.Spyware was used to target Luca Casarini, founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, who has been a vocal critic of Italy’s alleged complicity in abuses suffered by migrants in Libya, according to an alert Casarini received fromWhatsApp.The US-based messaging app said in late January that 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society, had been targeted by entities using Paragon spyware. It has sent alerts to individuals who were targeted.“By refusing to answer the questions in parliament, the government is laying bare its deep difficulties,” said Casarini, who has reported the surveillance against him to prosecutors in Palermo. “Regardless of which agency deployed this spyware against me, these wiretaps are entirely illegal. There is no doubt that the targets are political opponents of the government. This is a tactic of authoritarian governments.”On Wednesday, his NGO released information conveyed to him by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society and has analysed Casarini’s phone. The Toronto researchers told the NGO they hoped to trace the agency responsible for the attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In practice, a prime minister, interior minister or justice minister may authorise intelligence officials to intercept communications and conversations, or to collect metadata from individuals deemed a “threat to national security”.“Legal experts have long criticised this practice, noting that the targeted individuals have no means of defence,” said Inzerillo.Explore more on these topicsItalySurveillanceGiorgia MeloniPress freedomWhatsAppNewspapers & magazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It also calls for tighter rules on unfair trading practices, declaring that “practices where farmers are systematically forced to sell below costs will not be tolerated”.But the document stops short of proposing an end to payments based on farm size and makes no mention of a “just transition fund” to help farmers clean up their pollution. The proposals were among keyrecommendations in a reporthammered out by a broad group of food-chain stakeholders at the request of the commission last year.Marco Contiero, Greenpeace EU’s agricultural policy director, said: “When we got farmers’ unions, environmental experts, scientists, traders and food companies around the same table, everyone was clear – Europe’s food and farming system must change. But the commission’s ‘vision’ can’t seem to see that.”Campaigners said the proposed reforms to the subsidy scheme known as the common agricultural policy (CAP) did not go far enough. They also expressed fears that more environmental rules would be cut in the name of simplification, after severalnature-protecting rules were delayed, deleted or watered down last year.Giulia Riedo, from WWF EU, said the new vision was a “vague roadmap” that took “very timid steps” towards fairer and more sustainable food supply chains.“It includes a few positive elements, such as a commitment to a stronger enforcement of green legislation and financial incentives for farmers who go beyond existing environmental requirements. Yet, in trying to please everyone, theEuropean Commissionhas failed to address critical issues, such as the necessary increase in environmental payments,” she said.Copa and Cogeca, Europe’s biggest farming lobby, welcomed the proposal, calling it a “pragmatic reset”, and said the commission’s agriculture policy had regained its bearings. “However, it fails to address the elephant in the room: the future CAP budget and the resources needed to finance this package of measures,” they added.Cleaning up Europe’s farms is seen as a vital step for the long-term health of the sector, as well as to protect wildlife and stop the planet from heating. Most European soil is unhealthy, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA), with 60-75% containing too much nitrogen and 80% containing pesticide residue. The agency has estimated the societal cost of degraded soil at around €50bn a year.“By neglecting to enforce vital environmental laws and continuing to funnel subsidies to the wealthiest landowners, this plan sidelines the very farmers who steward our landscapes,” said Marilda Dhaskali from BirdLife Europe. “Without decisive action to restore nature and adapt to climate realities, Europe’s food security hangs by a thread.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The participants acknowledged that Europeans eat more animal protein than scientists recommend, and agreed that support was needed to rebalance diets toward plant-based proteins.“European diets are fundamentally shaped by an industrial food system that makes it hard for people to choose healthy, sustainable food,” said Julia Christian from the NGO Fern. “The [commission’s] vision has missed a vital chance to address this. Instead of supporting measures to encourage consumers to eat more vegetables, pulses and fruits … the commission has focused almost exclusively on agricultural production, missing the bigger picture of food system reform.”Christophe Hansen, the European Commission’s agriculture commissioner, said the proposals would make the sector more sustainable while keeping it attractive and well paid enough for young people to join. He noted that there had been “a lot of polemic” about farming, food and the environment.“It’s very important that we take this seriously, but that we find solutions together with the farmers, together with the food producers,” said Hansen, who is the son of a farmer. “This will be done with dialogue, rather than by focusing on simple and blunt targets.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingFoodEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionClimate crisisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Obviously he’s being well looked after in the hospital, trying to get his weight back up and seeing what long-term damage, if any, has been caused. But mentally he’s so strong. He was telling me that he never doubted that he would come out, not for a second. He promised Lianne and the girls that he would be back, that he would come back.

The group will release six hostages on Sunday and then transfer four more bodies next Thursday.That will complete the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, due to end on 1 March, leaving a further 58 hostages in the hands ofHamasand allied militant groups in Gaza. Israel believes that 34 of the remaining hostages are dead.The agreed plan for the second phase was for hostages and bodies of the dead to be exchanged for Palestinian detainees and prisoners in staggered groups. But Hamas suggested on Wednesday it was prepared to accelerate the process.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the group was ready to release all remaining hostages in one handover during the second phase.The official, Taher al-Nunu, said: “We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase.”Netanyahu has long resisted any talk about the second phase of the agreement, which would involve a complete military withdrawal fromGaza, as well as the handover of the remaining hostages, in return for hundreds more Palestinians held in Israeli jails.Completion of the second phase would in effect represent the end of the war, but the far-right wing of Netanyahu’s coalition adamantly opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside Gaza.The Israeli prime minister, however, has come under pressure to do so from Donald Trump’s special envoy, the US president’s friend and fellow real-estate developer, Steve Witkoff, whosaid over the weekend: “Phase two is absolutely going to begin.”Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on Tuesday that talks on the second phase would begin this week, but a day later the timing remained unclear.Under the original agreement, talks over how the second phase would be implemented were supposed to begin at the beginning of February. Not much time now remains before phase two is due to begin on 1 March, and there are contentious issues to be resolved.Under the agreement, Israeli troops are due to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, in the first eight days of phase two. That is something the Israeli prime minister has previously refused to do, emphasising the corridor’s strategic importance.At the same time, Netanyahu is demanding that the second phase include the disarming of Hamas and its removal as an organisation, but he has been hazy about who would replace them in running the territory. He embraced Trump’s declaration earlier this week that the US would take control of the Gaza Strip and that the entire Palestinian population of more than 2.2 million would somehow be moved out of their homeland.Few in the region believe Trump’s proposal will be carried out. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) joined Egypt and Jordan in opposing the plan, which would require the cooperation of neighbouring countries to absorb the deported Palestinians.There was no official account of a meeting between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the UAE leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. However, a state-linked newspaper,the National, later reportedthat Mohammed had told Rubio: “The UAE strongly opposes any attempt to displace the Palestinian people from Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

They secured the critical trekker on to a stretcher and began the challenging descent along with his co-trekker.”The rough terrain and repeated crossings of a rivulet made progress down the mountain extremely slow, and the team took nearly two hours to cover just 100 metres, according to the Tribune. Early on Monday morning, an exhausted first team asked for backup.A second and, eventually, third team of rescuers were sent, local media reported. After what is understood to be a near-20-hour descent, the man in critical condition was taken by ambulance to hospital just after 5pm on Monday, where he was declared dead, the Tribune reported.He has yet to be formally identified.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said on Wednesday: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in India and are in contact with the local authorities.”Last October, a British mountaineer, Fay Manners, and her American companion, Michelle Dvorak, wererescued from the Himalayasthree days after their food, tent and climbing equipment were dragged into a ravine by a rockfall. They had managed to send an SOS message and spent two nights in freezing conditions before being airlifted off the mountain.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaWalkingnewsShareReuse this content"

She reported on the withdrawal of foreign troops, the siege of government offices and on the detention of former officials in her province.Above all, Alia reported on the situation for women and their fears and concerns – emotions she was experiencing herself. As the Taliban gradually began imposing restrictions on them, Alia was documenting history repeating itself.“I grew up with the history of the Taliban’s domination of women [during their first stint in power between 1996 and 2001] and a lot of my work focused on the impact such radical ideology has had on women’s progress in Afghanistan,” she says.“I had joined the station straight from university in 2019 and worked for two years before the Taliban takeover. In the following months, I felt the most passionate about my job and choice of career even though there was always the fear of the Taliban.”We showed to the world that the Taliban have not changed and will not change. And it scares themAliaIt did not take long for the Taliban to begin a crackdown on media and journalists in the country, with 336 known cases of arrest, torture and intimidation between August 2021 and September 2024,according to the UN.It has been particularly hard for broadcast reporters who can be recognised and targeted by their face and voices. In several provinces, the Taliban havebanned women from radio broadcasting.In the early days after the takeover, amid the chaos and uncertainty and attacks by Taliban members, some journalists were forced into hiding or fleeing the country. Alia’s employers temporarily took her off air to protect her, but she continued newsgathering, particularly on women’s issues, her stories often riling the new powers.View image in fullscreenAn Afghan journalist working at Women in Kandahar radio station in 2020.Photograph: Muhammad Sadiq/EPAIn 2022, after Alia’s employers began to receive threats from local Taliban leaders for hiring and broadcasting female journalists, they sacked Alia for their mutual safety.“I was asked to leave because of my gender. I wanted to amplify women’s voices. I did not imagine that one day my own voice would be stifled.”Over the subsequent two years, women have continued to be excluded from public and the media. First there was anationwide ban on women’s voices in publicand now, this month, one of the last remaining female-run media outlets has been silenced, with the offices of a Kabul-based women’s radio station, Radio Begum, raided, staff arrested and thestation taken off air.While the Taliban accused Radio Begum of violating broadcast policy, Begum staff members insist they have simply been providing “educational services for girls and women in Afghanistan”. With recentbans on women attending higher education, platforms such as Radio Begum have been attempting to fill the vacuum for girls who wish to continue learning.Under threats, immense pressure and even forced closures, the Afghan media has significantly shrunk in the last three years. Prior to the Taliban takeover, Afghanistanhad approximately 543 media outletsemploying 10,790 workers. By November 2021, 43% of these outlets were closed, with only 4,360 media workers remaining. It has been even worse for women in media.The Taliban made me marry my boss: how one word led to a forced marriageRead moreA recentestimateby the International Federation of Journalists documented only 600 active female journalists in Afghanistan as of March 2024, down from 2,833 women in journalism before August 2021.“I cannot express the sense of hopelessness and misery I feel. You have to be an Afghan woman to truly understand how difficult it has been to give up everything you worked for. We showed to the world that the Taliban have not changed and will not change. And it scares them,” says Alia.Some female voices remain on air in northern provinces, a result ofopposing views within the Taliban about excluding womenfrom society. Alia says radio in particular remains a powerful medium in a country with widespread poverty and poor access to internet or television. Many families rely on the radio for news and information.“The media is the only source that can expose the Taliban’s crimes to the people and the world, to expose how they have been depriving women and other groups. And it also helps Afghans be more aware through programmes such as on Radio Begum,” she says.*Name has been changed to protect their identityExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomWomenTalibanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaWomen's rights and gender equalityPress freedomfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is vital that we stand up for reproductive rights and against those who are working to undermine them.”The act, Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) 2024, passed by the Scottish parliament in June last year, prohibits protests against abortion within a 200-metre (650ft) area around a hospital or clinic which provides abortion services.In an attack on these policies at the Munich Security Conference, Vance said the Scottish and UK governments had “placed the basic liberties of religious Britons [in] the crosshairs”.He alleged: “This last October, just a few months ago, the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law.”John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, who regularly attends church, said earlier on Wednesday that Vance’s claims were inaccurate. “JD Vance is just wrong and that issue was extensively discussed during the passage of the bill,” he said.“On the letter issued to households, his claims were wrong about that letter as well, and no such point was put to residents whatsoever on private prayer.”In a statement, Police Scotland said: “We were made aware of a group of protesters having gathered in the Hardgate Road area of Glasgow around 2.05pm on Wednesday 19 February 2025.“Officers attended and a 74-year-old woman was arrested and charged in connection with breach of the exclusion zone.” The force added that she would be reported to prosecutors.The Daily Record newspaperreported that 40 Days for Life activists plan to hold daily demonstrationsbetween 5 March and 13 April outside the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow on Hardgate Road, where there is an abortion clinic.Swinney said abortion care was a central part of existing health and social care provision in Scotland.“I have no plans to change that,” he added. “It’s part and parcel of the offering we make. The buffer zone legislation was designed to essentially recognise that women accessing those services should be able to do so without any additional sense of pressure.”Mackay said: “We know the awful impact that these protests have had. Some of the testimonies from women who have had to endure them have been heartbreaking.“I urge 40 Days For Life and anyone else who is planning to protest in a safe access zone to think again, as they will be stopped and there will be consequences.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Seals already face various pressures, from plastic pollution to a reduction in foraging and habitat areas caused by climate breakdown.Bird flucan kill seals by causing pneumonia and encephalitis.The highly infectious variant of H5N1 is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds since 2021, and hasspread to mammalsand causedmass die-offsin sea lions and elephant seal pups.Dani Clifford, a marine conservation officer at theWildlifeTrusts, said: “Bird flu has had, and will continue to have, devastating impacts on birds, but we’re also concerned about the spread to marine mammals. Monitoring these animals is important to help us to understand the spread of bird flu, but what’s more important is that pressures on wildlife are reduced in the first place. This includes ensuring seals are not disturbed by people and dogs, and ensuring marine protected areas are safe from damaging activities.”The National Trust has asked visitors to Blakeney Point to keep their dogs on a lead as a precaution, and not to touch sick or dying wildlife.Sources at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said they thought the seals had contracted the disease by scavenging the meat from dead or dying infected birds, but they were staying vigilant over the risk of mammal-to-mammal transmission and were conducting further tests. The seal population could be more at risk during the breeding season, which runs from late October until early January, because seal pups have previously been found to have a higher mortality rate from bird flu than their parents.Explore more on these topicsBird fluWildlifeEnglandMammalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It remains “in significantly enhanced attention for cybersecurity and collaborative work is ongoing to achieve the required improvements in this area”, the ONR said.Last year, Sellafield wasordered to pay almost £400,000after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings and made a formal apology to the court.The Guardian reported that the site’s systems had beenhacked by groups linked to Russia and China, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems.Sellafield has consistently maintained that it was not subjected to a “successful” cyber-attack.Paul Goldspring, the chief magistrate who ordered Sellafield to pay the fine, said in October’s sentencing that the prosecution did not offer evidence of a successful cyber-attack, even if it asserted that it was impossible for Sellafield to prove that the nuclear site had not been “effectively attacked”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Managing the nation’s nuclear legacy remains a priority, and we will continue to support Sellafield in delivering this vital mission.”Wilkinson said that an action plan over “many months” had allowed the company to improve the ONR’s confidence in its physical security.Sellafield declined to comment on its cybersecurity.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerNuclear LeaksNuclear wasteEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

He was also charged in connection with two separate burglary offences that had taken place the following week at another address on Laburnum Avenue in Blyth.At the Laburnum Avenue break-in, the burglar had forced entry into the house, making off with an array of property, including jewellery and pedal cycles – the majority of which were recovered during a search of Howell’s house after his arrest.He pleaded guilty to all charges at Newcastle crown court in December, and he appeared before the same court this week, where he was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison.The court heard he had 108 previous convictions, including 25 burglaries dating back to 1986.Leading the investigation, DC Jon Mullen of Northumbria police, said: “Burglary is an invasive crime which sadly leaves people feeling unsafe in their own homes.“Howell is a prolific offender who is now facing a lengthy spell behind bars following this sentence.“This case is the latest example which demonstrates the importance of reporting anything suspicious in [your] communities.”He added: “We will continue to act upon these reports and do everything in our power to bring those responsible for offences in our areas before court to face justice.”Explore more on these topicsNorthumberlandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

That in turn is corrupting cutting-edge police predictive crime systems, billed as part of the future of battling crime.Police say predictive policing helps cut crime, allowing officers and resources to be deployed where they are most needed.Predictive policing involves computer programmes that use data and algorithmic models to estimate where crimes are most likely to happen. It was once the stuff of dystopian fiction, for example in the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report, but is an increasingly popular tool for law enforcement.Amnesty says that of the 45 local forces across the UK, “32 have used geographic crime prediction, profiling or risk-prediction tools, and 11 forces have used individual prediction, profiling or risk-prediction tools”.In its report, Automated Racism, to be released on Thursday, Amnesty says: “These systems are, in effect, a modern method of racial profiling, reinforcing racism and discrimination in policing.“These systems are developed and operated using data from policing and the criminal legal system. That data reflects the structural and institutional racism and discrimination in policing and the criminal legal system, such as in police intelligence reports, suspect data, stop-and-search or arrest data. There is inherent bias in that data.”The report says use of predictive policing led to a spike in stop and search in Basildon, Essex, from September 2020 to March 2021. “The force stopped and searched more people in Basildon than the rest of the entire police force area. They stopped and searched Black people in Basildon almost 3.6 times more than white people … [and] used force against Black people almost four times as much as white people.”In London, after the Metropolitan police introduced predictive policing in Lambeth in 2020-21, the area had “the second highest volume of stop and search of all London boroughs”, the report says.A system used by Avon and Somerset police gives a risk score to individuals. One person referred to in the report as David said he had been targeted by police and left with post-traumatic stress disorder.He claims to have been stopped 50 times, including after putting a sticker on a lamp-post. He said: “I have therapy every week about some of the stuff that I’ve been through because of the police and how they’ve treated me over the past, say, three or four years It’s scandalous, to be honest. They made me feel like I don’t have any rights at all.”One resident of Grahame Park, north London, deemed as high crime, said: “It’s labelled a crime hotspot. So when the police enter the area, they’re in the mindset of ‘we’re in a dangerous community – the people here are dangerous’. It doesn’t matter if they’re young people, they’re still ‘dangerous’ and therefore ‘we can police them violently’ and they do police them violently.”Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK, said predictive policing had minimal or no effect on cutting crime. “The evidence that this technology keeps us safe just isn’t there; the evidence that it violates our fundamental rights is clear as day. We are all much more than computer-generated risk scores,” he said.“These technologies have consequences. The future they are creating is one where technology decides that our neighbours are criminals, purely based on the colour of their skin or their socioeconomic background.”A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Policing uses a wide range of data to help inform its response to tackling and preventing crime, maximising the use of finite resources. As the public would expect, this can include concentrating resources in areas with the most reported crime.“Hotspot policing and visible targeted patrols are the bedrock of community policing, and effective deterrents in detecting and preventing antisocial behaviour and serious violent crime, as well as improving feelings of safety.”They added: “It is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities whilst recognising the detrimental impact that tools such as stop and search can have, particularly on Black people.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceStop and searchRaceAmnesty InternationalnewsShareReuse this content"

The report raises concerns about visas, creaking infrastructure and poor security technology.The report says that theWorld Cup, Olympics and Paralympics, 2025 Ryder Cup and celebrations for the US’s 250th birthday could draw in an estimated 40 million visitors to the country.Footballers at ‘very high risk of extreme heat stress’ during World Cup 2026Read more“We’re not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travelers. This poses risks to our national security and hampers economic growth,” the report says.While the Trump administrationhas made significant cuts across the government, the US Travel Association said there needs to be investment in visa processing and airport security.“The president has been outspoken about making this the gold standard of World Cups, the best Olympics that has ever been held,” Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association’s CEO,told ESPN. “To do those things, to achieve those goals, you’ve got to make some of these investments.”Freeman said he had met with White House officials in the last week. He highlighted visa wait times as a particular problem area, with approval times for some countries that may reach the World Cup – such as Colombia – currently running at nearly two years.“People want to come, but they’re not coming,” Freeman said. “It gets down to these visa wait times. It gets down to the customs inefficiencies. It gets down to a perception in instances that people aren’t welcome.

This week, another Californian reported a different unexpected visitor living in his house’s crawlspace in neighboring Pasadena: another 500 to 600lb bear.“I think it found refuge under the house during the fire, and it’s definitely not moving – that’s its home,” the homeowner, Sean Lorenzini, toldthe Los Angeles Times.California fish and wildlife officials lured the first bear into a trap after a 24-hour odyssey involving peanut butter and a rotisserie chicken, and were able to relocate “Barry” to the nearby Angeles national forest.Lorenzini, who has filed a report of the bear living under his house, is hoping the department can do the same for him. A spokesperson for the department of fish and wildlife told theLos AngelesTimes that the agency was aware of the Pasadena bear and working on a response.When a bear is in a crawlspace, fish and wildlife officials “recommend that homeowners contact the department so that a wildlife professional can evaluate the situation and help determine ways that the homeowner can discourage the bear from using the crawlspace and seal the entrance immediately once the animal is out”, the department said in apost about the Altadena bear.In the meantime, Lorenzini says the bear seems at ease, raiding the neighbors’ trash can for food, soaking up the California sun by his pool and terrorizing the neighbor’s pet goat.Although life for Lorenzini is a little less comfortable since his enormous roommate moved in. The Pasadena homeowner is trying to repair his house in the wake of southern California’s most destructive wildfires, and his basement resident has made plumbers reluctant to visit the property.Black bears – the only species of bear living in California – frequently stumble into the Los Angeles communities along the edge of the Angeles national forest, including those such as Altadena and Pasadena that were ravaged by the deadly Eaton fire.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

In 2017, California registered 28 bear sightings in Los Angeles county. In 2023, that number rose to 455.The fish and wildlife department alsonotesthat drought and an increasing black bear population are probably related to increased sightings. Bears are not only seeking food and water, but the black bear population in California also grew significantly after the extinction of the state’s grizzly bear population in the 1920s.As humans fled the Eaton wildfire, it’s likely that bears and other wildlife did the same – like the bear Lorenzini believes took shelter under his house. After the 2018 Woolsey fire, researchers at the University of California Los Angelesdocumentedhigh rates of Malibu mountain lions killed by drivers as they too tried to escape the burn zone.While California black bears are notably non-confrontational – and have only killed one person in recorded history, ina 2023 incident– fish and wildliferecommendsCalifornia homeowners prepare for increasing bear encounters by closing crawl spaces “with bear-proof material in advance of winter months to discourage bears from denning and damaging property”.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaAnimalsWest CoastLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2020, Nikola was valued at around $30bn, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Company.The company has had difficulty scaling its business, which mostly focused on EV trucks. In the third quarter, Nikola produced 83 trucks but recorded a net loss of almost $200m. It produced 77 trucks in the second quarter, with a net loss of nearly $134m.Nikola filed for protection in the United States bankruptcy court for the district ofDelawareand said on Wednesday that it has also filed a motion seeking approval to pursue an auction and sale of the business.The company has about $47m in cash on hand.Nikola Corp plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it will need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.“Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” CEO Steve Girsky said in a statement.The executive said the company has made efforts in recent months to raise funds and reduce liabilities and preserve cash, but that it hasn’t been enough.“The Board has determined that Chapter 11 represents the best possible path forward under the circumstances,” Girsky said.In December 2023 Miltonwas sentenced to four yearsin prison after being convicted of exaggerating claims about his company’s production of zero-emission 18-wheel trucks, leading to sizeable losses for investors.Milton was convicted of fraud charges, portrayed by prosecutors as a con man six years after he had founded the company in a basement in Utah.Prosecutors said Milton falsely claimed to have built its own revolutionary truck that was actually a General Motors product with Nikola’s logo stamped onto it.Called as a government witness, Nikola’s CEO testified that Milton “was prone to exaggeration” when pitching his venture to investors.Trump administration suspends $5bn electric vehicle charging programRead moreMilton resigned in 2020 amid reports of fraud that sent Nikola’s stock prices into a tailspin. Investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Milton’s claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks.The company paid $125m in 2021 to settle a civil case against it by the SEC. Nikola didn’t admit any wrongdoing.Aside from its personal troubles, Nikola has also had to contend with a more perilous environment for EV makers as sales slow.Donald Trumphaspromised to eliminatewhat he incorrectly calls Joe Biden’s “electric vehicle mandate”.What that means in practice is that his executive order will revoke a non-binding goal set by the former president to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden’s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.Shares of Nikola, based in Phoenix, Arizona, fell below $2 late last year and tumbled another 40% on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsChapter 11 - corporate bankruptciesElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsArizonaDelawarenewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a lot of fearmongering about what we do. What we do is ensure states are protecting children with disabilities,” one employee at the department, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian. “This used to be a bipartisan issue. I don’t understand why it still isn’t a bipartisan issue.“I’m struggling. I don’t know what to do because there are imminent threats we face every day. We can’t talk anymore during meetings freely, and I was told [Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”] Doge is listening in on our Teams meetings. How do you have a free flow of ideas? It’s a really unsustainable way to work.”Trump advisers weigh actions to dismantle education department – reportRead moreAbout 3,100 employees at the department work in the Washington DC area, with more than 1,100 additional employees working out of 10 regional offices around the US. The department supports and funds 7.5 million students across the US with disabilities with special education services; supports Title I schools, representing 26 million children living in poverty; and oversees federal student loans and grants for higher education.“We have been kept in the dark completely about our co-workers who have been on administrative leave for attending a diversity training, about rumored reduction in forces, the future of our work and their return to work plan assuming we aren’t reduced in force,” said the employee.Staff were invited to a meeting on Wednesday on plans to summon all staff back to the office. A lack of space at regional offices in New York, Boston and San Francisco means staff there will be exempted, it was explained, and remote work for “reasonable accommodations” will still be honored – but arrangements must be re-certified, and approved by the assistant secretary of education.Many attendees were not reassured. “This was an extremely poorly planned meeting that seems to have caused even more confusion,” the employee said. “The process has been so inefficient and time-consuming. The entire department is working on rushing into the office in the middle of several regional offices downsizing real estate.”Another said many employees were not able to hear the audio from the meeting, the Q&A had been disabled for it and no one addressed the audio issues. “Folks are fairly anxious and panicked,” they said. “The meeting technology has been malfunctioning and they didn’t schedule enough time for questions.”Remote participants expressed their frustration in that chat, according to screenshots seen by the Guardian. The meeting was “more confusing than helpful”, one commenter said. “You confused us more,” added another.Musk’s ‘Doge’ guts nearly $1bn in US education department’s research officeRead moreThe department and the White House did not immediately respond to invitations for comment.During Trump’s first term in office, hisproposedcuts to the Department of Education were rejected by Congress.Sources in the current Trump administrationclaim the president plans to issue an executive order abolishing the department.Trump has cited a desire to return education to the states, but funding and decision-making for public education already resides at state and local levels. Elon Musk, whose businesses have receivedover $20bnin federal contracts, has posted on social mediaclaimingthe department “no longer exists”.Another longtime employee at the education department explained that this presidential transition has carried with it an open hostility to civil servants in the form of bullying, harassment and intimidation.“We get regular emails, to the point where it’s excessive, about the‘fork in the road’ resignation offer. We get petty emails aboutsignature blocks,” they said. “I was here for the last Trump administration. I carried [on with] work through that, but I’m not super optimistic about this work continuing under this administration.”Thetargeting of diversity, equity and inclusion-related positions and work is concerning, the source said, given the department of education’s mission and its tie to equity. The department was created by Congress in 1979 “to strengthen the Federal commitment to ensuring access to equal educational opportunity for every individual”.Under Trump’s first term, his appointed secretary of education, Betsy DeVos,encourageddiversity training. Under Trump’s second term, employees who participated in those trainings have beenplacedon administrative leave.“All of our programs are centered on equity and underserved populations, helping to bridge the gap. Federal education funding is a small fraction of education funding overall, but it’s designed to level the field, so it’s primarily targeted toward urban, rural, Title I schools, and special education,” the employee explained. “There’s a lot of fear.“Everybody is abusing melatonin right now to get some sleep. Everybody is distraught, worried about the state of our country. Whenever there is a crisis of some type, our country really relies on civil service for so many functions.”Trump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assaultRead moreThe administration is trying to “create the conditions for people to want to depart”, they claimed. “I believe they intentionally leaked info on the push to abolish the Department of Education to push people toward taking the ‘fork in the road’ deal. It would be catastrophic for our country, especially the impacts to Title I schools and special education.”Another departmental employee said employees working remotely were expected to be back in offices by 24 February.“It’s very obviously being done in order to make people miserable,” they said. “People should know that they have no idea how much what the federal government does actually touches their lives every day, but they’ll notice it when it’s gone.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS educationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The entire department is working on rushing into the office in the middle of several regional offices downsizing real estate.”Another said many employees were not able to hear the audio from the meeting, the Q&A had been disabled for it and no one addressed the audio issues. “Folks are fairly anxious and panicked,” they said. “The meeting technology has been malfunctioning and they didn’t schedule enough time for questions.”Remote participants expressed their frustration in that chat, according to screenshots seen by the Guardian. The meeting was “more confusing than helpful”, one commenter said. “You confused us more,” added another.Musk’s ‘Doge’ guts nearly $1bn in US education department’s research officeRead moreThe department and the White House did not immediately respond to invitations for comment.During Trump’s first term in office, hisproposedcuts to the Department of Education were rejected by Congress.Sources in the current Trump administrationclaim the president plans to issue an executive order abolishing the department.Trump has cited a desire to return education to the states, but funding and decision-making for public education already resides at state and local levels. Elon Musk, whose businesses have receivedover $20bnin federal contracts, has posted on social mediaclaimingthe department “no longer exists”.Another longtime employee at the education department explained that this presidential transition has carried with it an open hostility to civil servants in the form of bullying, harassment and intimidation.“We get regular emails, to the point where it’s excessive, about the‘fork in the road’ resignation offer. We get petty emails aboutsignature blocks,” they said. “I was here for the last Trump administration. I carried [on with] work through that, but I’m not super optimistic about this work continuing under this administration.”Thetargeting of diversity, equity and inclusion-related positions and work is concerning, the source said, given the department of education’s mission and its tie to equity. The department was created by Congress in 1979 “to strengthen the Federal commitment to ensuring access to equal educational opportunity for every individual”.Under Trump’s first term, his appointed secretary of education, Betsy DeVos,encourageddiversity training. Under Trump’s second term, employees who participated in those trainings have beenplacedon administrative leave.“All of our programs are centered on equity and underserved populations, helping to bridge the gap. Federal education funding is a small fraction of education funding overall, but it’s designed to level the field, so it’s primarily targeted toward urban, rural, Title I schools, and special education,” the employee explained. “There’s a lot of fear.“Everybody is abusing melatonin right now to get some sleep. Everybody is distraught, worried about the state of our country. Whenever there is a crisis of some type, our country really relies on civil service for so many functions.”Trump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assaultRead moreThe administration is trying to “create the conditions for people to want to depart”, they claimed. “I believe they intentionally leaked info on the push to abolish the Department of Education to push people toward taking the ‘fork in the road’ deal. It would be catastrophic for our country, especially the impacts to Title I schools and special education.”Another departmental employee said employees working remotely were expected to be back in offices by 24 February.“It’s very obviously being done in order to make people miserable,” they said. “People should know that they have no idea how much what the federal government does actually touches their lives every day, but they’ll notice it when it’s gone.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS educationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2020, Nikola was valued at around $30bn, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Company.The company has had difficulty scaling its business, which mostly focused on EV trucks. In the third quarter, Nikola produced 83 trucks but recorded a net loss of almost $200m. It produced 77 trucks in the second quarter, with a net loss of nearly $134m.Nikola filed for protection in the United States bankruptcy court for the district ofDelawareand said on Wednesday that it has also filed a motion seeking approval to pursue an auction and sale of the business.The company has about $47m in cash on hand.Nikola Corp plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it will need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.“Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” CEO Steve Girsky said in a statement.The executive said the company has made efforts in recent months to raise funds and reduce liabilities and preserve cash, but that it hasn’t been enough.“The Board has determined that Chapter 11 represents the best possible path forward under the circumstances,” Girsky said.In December 2023 Miltonwas sentenced to four yearsin prison after being convicted of exaggerating claims about his company’s production of zero-emission 18-wheel trucks, leading to sizeable losses for investors.Milton was convicted of fraud charges, portrayed by prosecutors as a con man six years after he had founded the company in a basement in Utah.Prosecutors said Milton falsely claimed to have built its own revolutionary truck that was actually a General Motors product with Nikola’s logo stamped onto it.Called as a government witness, Nikola’s CEO testified that Milton “was prone to exaggeration” when pitching his venture to investors.Trump administration suspends $5bn electric vehicle charging programRead moreMilton resigned in 2020 amid reports of fraud that sent Nikola’s stock prices into a tailspin. Investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Milton’s claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks.The company paid $125m in 2021 to settle a civil case against it by the SEC. Nikola didn’t admit any wrongdoing.Aside from its personal troubles, Nikola has also had to contend with a more perilous environment for EV makers as sales slow.Donald Trumphaspromised to eliminatewhat he incorrectly calls Joe Biden’s “electric vehicle mandate”.What that means in practice is that his executive order will revoke a non-binding goal set by the former president to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden’s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.Shares of Nikola, based in Phoenix, Arizona, fell below $2 late last year and tumbled another 40% on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsChapter 11 - corporate bankruptciesElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsArizonaDelawarenewsShareReuse this content"

Brands, told investors it would move about 100 employees from its office in Louisville,Kentucky, more than 800 miles south-west to the city of Plano in Texas, where the group’s Pizza Hut chain is headquartered.The employees are expected to move in the next six months and will receive relocation support. An extra 90 remote workers will be expected to move toTexasor other Yum! Brands’ corporate offices during the coming 18 months.The governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, said in statement: “I am disappointed by this decision and believe the company’s founder would be, too. “This company’s name starts with Kentucky, and it has marketed our state’s heritage and culture in the sale of its product.”The mayor of Louisville, Craig Greenberg, also expressed his disappointment, US media reported, saying the brand “was born here and is synonymous with Kentucky”.Yum! Brands said its “strategic decision”would allow it to “foster greater collaboration among brands and employees”.Once the move from Kentucky is complete, Yum! Brands will have two corporate headquarters, in Texas and in California, where its brands Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill are based.David Gibbs, Yum! Brands’ chief executive officer, said: “These changes position us for sustainable growth and will help us better serve our customers, employees, franchisees and shareholders. Ultimately, bringing more of our people together on a consistent basis will maximise our unrivalled culture and talent as a competitive advantage.”Yum! Brands said it and the KFC Foundation would retain corporate offices in Louisville.Several companies have moved to Texas from other states in recent years, attracted by its low corporate taxes.Elon Muskmoved Tesla’s corporate headquartersfrom Palo Alto in California to the Texas city of Austin in 2021, after criticising California’s regulations and taxes. The billionaire also moved the state of incorporation of the rocket company SpaceX to Texas from Delaware in 2024,after a Delaware judgeruled against his pay package.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rapid rise of generative AI systems, which are based on vast troves of books, newspaper articles, images and songs, has caused alarm among authors, newspapers and musicians,triggering a slew of lawsuitsabout alleged breaches of copyright.Voss said he had been unable to get majorities of EU lawmakers to ensure strong copyright protection when the issue emerged in the late stages of negotiating the AI Act. The absence of strong provisions on copyright was “irresponsible” and it was “unbelievable” that the legal gap remained, he said.He would like legislation to fill that gap, but said it would take years, after the European Commission’s decision last week towithdraw the proposed AI Liability Act. “It might be getting very difficult. And so the infringement of copyright is continuing, but nobody can prove it.”The AI Act states that tech firms must comply with 2019 copyright law, which includes an exemption for text and data mining.Voss said this exemption from copyright law was intended to have a limited private use, rather than allow the world’s largest companies to harvest vast amounts of intellectual property. The introduction of the TDM exemption in the AI Act was“a misunderstanding”, he said.This view was reinforced by a significantacademic studylast year by the legal scholar Tim Dornis and the computer scientist Sebastian Stober, which concluded that the training of generative AI models on published materials could not be considered “a case of text and data mining” but “copyright infringement”.Meanwhile, the TDM exemption has sent shock waves across creative professions. Nina George,a German bestselling authorwhose works has been translated into 37 languages, described the TDM exception as “devastating”. Exclusions from copyright, she said, were originally intended to balance the interest of authors against those of the public, such as allowing schools to photocopy texts. “These AI exceptions for commercial use mean that business interest will be served for the first time,” she said. “This is a shift of paradigms [and] a perverted way to bend copyrights and authors’ rights to serve the interest of a few businesses.”George, who is president of honour at the European Writers Council, said she had no way of finding out if any of her works had been used to feed generative AI systems. “The lack of instruments to enforce any rights, this is the scandal in the construction of the AI Act [in] relation to copyright directive.”Aafke Romeijn, a Dutch-language electropop artist, said there was no practical way for creatives to opt out of having their work used in AI applications.Companies are not obliged to report on the content used to feed generative AI models. From 2 August, tech firms will have to provide a summary of data used in AI models, but details are still being decided. Voss said the latest draft rules on the summary from the EU’s AI office were “not sufficiently detailed” to protect artists.In a letter to the Commission this week, 15 cultural organisations said the draft summary proposals failed to ensure transparency. More generally, the organisations wrote: “The impact of AI on the authors and performers we represent constitutes a systemic risk.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday, nearly 11 weeks later, the commission had not replied, according to three signatories.“So far it does not seem that she [Virkkunen] has an ear or an understanding – I am sorry to say that – of the whole value chain and how it works in the cultural and creative industries,” said George.Brando Benifei, an Italian Social Democrat who jointly represented the European parliament in negotiations on the AI Act, contested the view that creatives were unprotected. He described the AI Act as “a very strong text” that had the potential to create “a very large rebalancing of power between the developers and the rights holders”.From “day one” after the law was voted in, there had been an effort “to dilute and to interpret in a minimalistic way the provisions”, he added. “[This] has been the obsession of the big tech companies because it is probably the part of the AI Act that can be most impactful in terms of costs for the big generative AI companies.”A European Commission spokesperson said it was “closely monitoring the global challenges that AI technology development poses to the creative industry” and was “committed to maintaining a balanced approach that fosters innovation while protecting human creativity”.“We are assessing the need for additional measures, outside the AI framework,”the spokesperson added, declining to say whether this meant new legislation.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)European UnionComputingMusic industryWritten languageEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

What next?That’s it – you apply for a job, get the job, accept the job, and then skip your first day of work, and all days thereafter.How do I explain that to my boss?You don’t. You just disappear.Huh. And this is popular?According toa survey, 34% of gen Z jobseekers have indulged in career catfishing.Gen Z – are there any longstanding cultural norms they can’t subvert?Apparently24% of millennials, 11% of gen X and 7% of boomers have also done it.But why apply for a job, go to all the trouble of getting it and then not show up?Any number of reasons – in the course of a long and dispiriting recruitment process, they may have got a better offer, or simply changed their minds.In that case, couldn’t they have just said, you know, thanks, but no thanks?Evidently they don’t feel they owe prospective employers anything.Why would that be?Because they feel they’ve been treated very badly by them.How so?Recruitment is often labyrinthine, opaque and time-consuming. Research has shown that it takes, on average,between 100 and 200 job applicationsto receive a single job offer these days.That’s ridiculous.In part, it’s because a significant portion of the jobs being advertised don’t exist – they’reghost jobs.Ghost jobs?Fake job openings posted by companies, either to make it look as if they’re recruiting and therefore growing, or to keep their present employees on their toes, or for some other terrible reason.I get it: it’s a jungle out there.There is also the phenomenon known as professional ghosting, when companies put applicants through multiple interviews, and sometimes even make job offers, before abruptly ending all communication.What you’re saying is, employers deserve everything they get and more.Not necessarily – career catfishing can cost companies huge amounts of money.Good. After all, the only real safeguard against catfishing is more catfishing.Ghost employees for ghost jobs – sounds like the future.Do say:“Great offer! Can I think about it and get back to you some time around never?”Don’t say:“So the official job title is abandoned amusement park caretaker, but at night you simply wear a sheet to scare off any meddling kids.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersPass notesJob huntingUnemploymentYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has previously said it is working with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to resolve potential historic tax liabilities.The inland revenue service alleges that Binance has a “significant economic presence” in Nigeria and is therefore liable for corporate income tax. It is seeking a court declaration that Binance pay income taxes for 2022 and 2023, plus a 10% annual penalty on unpaid amounts. FIRS is also requesting a 26.75% interest rate on the unpaid taxes, based on the Central Bank of Nigeria’s lending rate.Binance was already facing four counts of tax evasion in Nigeria after a government crackdown on the industry last year. The charges include non-payment of value-added tax, company income tax, failure to file tax returns and complicity in helping customers to evade taxes through its platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The side that Guardiola said was a machine for eight years is no more, small wonder he admitted he was lying when he gave them a 1% chance of going through: it was not even that high.Trent Alexander-Arnold rescues point for Liverpool in thriller at Aston VillaRead moreAt the start City needed only one goal. By the time they actually got it, Nico González scoring in the last ­minute after Omar Marmoush’s free‑kick came back off the bar, it meant ­nothing. Which is a pretty good word to describe City, a ghost in this game.The goal was greeted with ironic cheers, fans continuing to laugh at opponents who would have worried them once but which Madrid had played with and pitied. They had certainly taken their foot off the pedal, no need for more. By then City were 3-0 down, 6-2 on aggregate, any hope long gone. In part perhaps, because it had never really been there at all.Real Madrid were superb, con­firming their candidacy for the competition they consider their own. Mbappé does everything so smoothly, with an air of total mastery. Federico Valverde is not a right-back but might be the best right-back there is. Rodrygo, the least celebrated of their front four, ripped another team apart. And that’s just three of them, even the youth-teamer Raúl Asencio picking off City with the pass that started their destruction. Their only bad news on a perfect night that ended tooléswas the yellow card that means Jude Bellingham will miss the first leg of their last-16 tie against Bayer Leverkusen or Atlético Madrid.For City, the only good news is that at least it’s over now. An era surely ends here, or already has. Carlo ­Ancelotti had said he did not want to face them but it was all ­reputation, no reality. Too much has gone wrong for too long and winter surgery could not fix them. This was the team that had conceded four against Paris Saint‑Germain and Sporting, three against Feyenoord, how could they not be beaten by Madrid? Still, they might have hoped to hang on for more than four minutes, the goal that broke the illusion that this was ever going to be a game coming as easy as it did early.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé beats Manchester City’s Josko Gvardiol before scoring Real Madrid’s second goal.Photograph: John Walton/PACity had kept the ball for three minutes from kick-off, while Madrid just stood there as if to say:is that all you got?And then, when they got it for the first time, they scored a goal so simple it was almost ridiculous. Asencio speared the ball over the City defence. Rúben Dias, leaning towards it, let it bounce. John Stones didn’t get there. ­Ederson didn’t get anywhere really. Mbappé watched it sit up and then lifted it easily over the goalkeeper and into the net. Four minutes and it was finished, City showing no belief in anything better.When Josko Gvardiol had a shot blocked by Aurelién Tchouaméni soon after, it was the only time City shot in the first half and it hardly regis­tered.Theyhardly registered in fact. They didn’t even have more of the ball than Madrid; there was nothing there, an empty team drifting through the night, slow and aimless and vulnerable. If Madrid didn’t do more, it was because they didn’t need to. Every time they did put their foot down a bit, they escaped.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mbappé had two shots deflected. Vinícius turned Khusanov so easily on the halfway line. When Gündogan was booked for taking out Rodrygo, it was a portrait of a man who just couldn’t keep up. When at last ­Marmoush was able to run, ­Asencio cut him down. And when Mbappé was again free over the top – this time it was Tchouaméni delivering a lovely dinked pass – and struck at Ederson, it was only a temporary letoff, the second goal following shortly after.Again, it seemed so simple, so unobstructed, Madrid just superior. Vinícius found Rodrygo on the face of the area. Unsure, Khusanov started towards him, stopped, and saw (or didn’t see) the pass go through his legs. Mbappé stepped inside, left Gvardiol on the floor, and finished calmly. City were lost. They needed three goals now; one would have been a start. A single shot would have been something, but no. Instead, it was Madrid who got a third. ­Coming inside, Mbappé guided a clean, low shot beyond Ederson like it was no big deal, which is how the whole thing had felt.There was half an hour left, which was half an hour too long for City who were just being played with. There was one late goal, González’s moment of nothingness, but this match, like City’s season, like City’s team too perhaps, was finished.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridManchester CityKylian Mbappématch reportsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu slipped 4-0 behind before battling back to send the first set into a tie-break but eventually fell to a 7-6 (6), 6-4 defeat.The man who had earlier exhibited “fixated behaviour” towards Raducanu, in the words of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), will be banned from all future WTA events, pending a “threat assessment”.“Thank you for the messages of support,” Raducanu said on Instagram. “Difficult experience yesterday but I’ll be OK and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match. Thank you to Karolina for being a great sport and best of luck to her for the rest of the tournament.”The WTA said it was “actively working with Emma and her team” to provide security to the former US Open champion after the incident and said it was “committed … to maintaining a safe environment for all players”.These were sentiments echoed by the LTA, the governing body of British tennis, which expects to host Raducanu at the HSBC Open this summer, when the women’s game will return to Queen’s Club in west London for the first time in over 50 years.The LTA said in a statement that it had been in contact with Raducanu and promised “extensive” security arrangements for upcoming tournaments in the UK.“This incident once again highlights issues around safety that all players, but female players in particular, can face,” the LTA said. “We have support available for British players and have been in contact with Emma and her team following the events in Dubai.“We have extensive security arrangements at our events in Britain and keep these under constant review. The tours have strong processes in place already and we will continue to work together along with police and security providers to deal with situations like this robustly.”View image in fullscreenKarolina Muchova was praised by Emma Raducanu for ‘being a great sport’ as events off-court unfolded during their match.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesThe WTA’s statement on the incident read: “Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour. This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma’s match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.“Player safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events. The WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support. We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players.”In 2022, Amrit Magar wasgiven a five-year restraining orderand a community service order for stalking Raducanu, who was a teenager at the time, in London. The 35-year-old was found to have made multiple visits to her family home and stole items that had been left on the front porch.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Speaking at the time, Raducanu said she felt like “my freedom has been taken away from me” by Magar, adding: “I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again.”She is far from the only female professional to have been stalked in the world of tennis. Last year Katie Boulter, the British No 1,told the Guardianshe had received threats of violence from men attending tournaments she was competing in. The American Danielle Collins has also recounted her own experiences, telling the Telegraph: “I don’t really go many places by myself, I make sure I always have security on site, and it’s been something I think that has affected me very personally.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The report raises concerns about visas, creaking infrastructure and poor security technology.The report says that theWorld Cup, Olympics and Paralympics, 2025 Ryder Cup and celebrations for the US’s 250th birthday could draw in an estimated 40 million visitors to the country.Footballers at ‘very high risk of extreme heat stress’ during World Cup 2026Read more“We’re not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travelers. This poses risks to our national security and hampers economic growth,” the report says.While the Trump administrationhas made significant cuts across the government, the US Travel Association said there needs to be investment in visa processing and airport security.“The president has been outspoken about making this the gold standard of World Cups, the best Olympics that has ever been held,” Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association’s CEO,told ESPN. “To do those things, to achieve those goals, you’ve got to make some of these investments.”Freeman said he had met with White House officials in the last week. He highlighted visa wait times as a particular problem area, with approval times for some countries that may reach the World Cup – such as Colombia – currently running at nearly two years.“People want to come, but they’re not coming,” Freeman said. “It gets down to these visa wait times. It gets down to the customs inefficiencies. It gets down to a perception in instances that people aren’t welcome.

Given how close Donyell Malen came to snatching a 95th‑minute winner, though, perhaps it will be easy enough. Trent Alexander‑Arnold rattled in a second-half equaliser to maintain Liverpool’s unbeaten away record in the league but a point was a frustrating takeaway given Darwin Núñez missed a glaring chance to put his side 3-2 up.How much encouragement will this result give Arsenal, eight points behind the leaders with a game in hand? Diogo Jota also missed a brilliant chance for Liverpool, who seized the lead through Mohamed Salah, before goals by Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins put Villa – for whom Marcus Rashford made his first start since joining on loan from Manchester United – in front at the interval.Real Madrid v Manchester City: Champions League playoff round, second leg – liveRead moreThis evolved into a captivating, seesawing contest once Villa recovered from an early wave of Liverpool attacks. Virgil van Dijk walloped a shot over the bar after collecting Alexander-Arnold’s improvised outside-of-the-boot pass and the next minute Tyrone Mings made a couple of important interventions, first to block Jota’s shot and then Andy Robertson’s cross. Unai Emery gesticulated furiously, demanding his players raise their level.And so they did. Few would have had Rashford and Marco Asensio doubling up on Ryan Gravenberch in Villa shirts in mid-February on their pre-season bingo card. Rashford’s slide tackle on Ibrahima Konaté on the edge of the Liverpool box lifted the crowd.Rashford is at his best flying down the left channel, though, and after a one-two with Asensio, also making his first Villa start, the loanee’s low cross cannoned off a Liverpool defender into the back of Alisson’s net. Then came the check from the video assistant referee, replays showing Rashford had strayed offside. It was a decision in keeping with the rest of the game until that point: a procession of nearly moments. Emiliano Martínez made a fine save to thwart Dominik Szoboszlai after Curtis Jones twirled clear, Lucas Digne superbly stopped Salah in his tracks.Emery warned that Villa would be punished for dropping off for a second and a lapse of concentration gifted Liverpool the lead. Andrés García, the right-back signed from Levante last month, played a blind backward pass straight to the lurking Jota and the Liverpool forward took a pace or two before squaring for Salah to convert. It was surely the easiest of Salah’s 29 goals in all competitions this season. García grimaced, Van Dijk did a double-fist pump.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins’ header gave Aston Villa the lead at the break.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersThe goal seemed to galvanise Villa. John McGinn kept a Rashford free-kick alive at the back post after Konaté headed clear and then Mings bopped the ball on again. Szoboszlai’s clearance dropped straight to Tielemans, who volleyed in.Liverpool should have immediately regained the lead but Jota, played in by Robertson with only Martínez to beat, shanked a shot painfully wide. If Jota was not kicking himself then, he surely was when Villa went ahead. Watkins kickstarted the move himself, spreading play and drifting into the box unmarked to spook Van Dijk and head in Digne’s cross, sparking bedlam in the stands.This was Rashford’s first league start since December and, although he faded, his direct running caused problems. Alisson rushed out of goal early in the second half and inadvertently presented Rashford with a chance to curl the ball towards an empty net, but the defence covered.Jota clipped the top of the bar from the edge of the Villa box but Liverpool levelled a minute later. Alexander‑Arnold advanced into a hole of space on halfway and after collecting the ball from Salah his thrashed shot flew into the bottom corner via Mings. Then Liverpool went for the jugular.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then came a rare moment of respite, a double Liverpool substitution before Emery made a triple change, with Rashford among those withdrawn. Slot sent on Conor Bradley and Núñez and the pair almost made an instant impact.Bradley slipped a through ball into Szoboszlai, who trickled the ball to his left for Núñez, but the Uruguayan skied his effort. Axel Disasi perhaps put him off but Núñez should have scored. Slot hurriedly asked if there had been an offside, presumably to make himself feel better. It was another wasted chance to file away.It was fraught now. Emery tapped his temples by way of warning. Liverpool survived a scare after Jacob Ramsey rippled the net, only for VAR to confirm he was offside. Morgan Rogers wellied over in stoppage time and then Malen went even closer, drilling wide with 11 seconds to go.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

His joy was short-lived, however. No winner’s ceremony took place, the podium in Lagos was left empty and the 192.2km ride from Portimão was all in vain.“On the approach to the finish line in Lagos, the peloton became divided and a large number of the riders took the wrong route, followed the detour of the support cars and missed the finish line,” race organisers said in a statement.The race director, Sergio Sousa, said: “The College of Commissaires interpreted the regulations and, given what happened, decided to cancel the stage because they considered that sporting truth did not prevail in the end.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She says confronting doubt is part of the processAndy CochraneWed 19 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 05.58 ESTShareAfter a pair of first descents near her home in the Canadian Rockies, Christina Lustenberger headed to Pakistan’s Karakoram Range in April 2024 for her second attempt to ski the west face ofthe Great Trango Tower.“I’d seen a photo of the towers from a friend who climbed it,” says Lustenberger, “but no one had skied it.”Humility kept her from stating the reason why. No one had skied the colossal 20,623ft peak, which is home to thesecond-highest vertical wall on Earth, because no one had the imagination, let alone determination, to even think it was even possible. That is, until Lustenberger came along.Known as a training ground for high-altitude alpine climbers, the Trango Towers are laden with seracs, crevasses, and hanging glaciers. Before Lustenberger, no one saw them as potential ski terrain. On 9 May, Lustenberger and her two partners, Jim Morrison and Chantel Astorga,skied the west face, later hailed as the most impressive first descent in the last decade.‘Bloody fingers with pink nails’: how Sasha DiGiulian broke climbing’s glass ceilingRead moreAfter a reset at home, Lustenberger then spent the fall in New Zealand, ticking off five more hair-raising first descents in the Southern Alps. The most notable, Hunter’s Moon, descends the east face of Aoraki Mount Cook, the tallest mountain in the country. Like the Trango line, it parallels an alpine climbing route, which Lustenberger cleverly reprised as a ski descent.“It was the most engaging line I’ve ever skied,” says Lustenberger. “We watched it for a week, studied it with binoculars, skied around it, and felt good when we started the climb up. But the moment we crossed thebergschrund, you just have to accept the consequences. You have to just fully be there.”The monumental year put Lustenberger in rarefied air. However, it wasn’t a surprise to those who know her best. The 40-year-old has spent the last decade quietly redefining the upper limits of ski mountaineering, a sport that combines backcountry skiing with alpinism, climbing the world’s biggest mountains and skiing down them. By combining technical skills from an Olympic racing career with a visionary imagination, she’s become one of the greatest ski mountaineers alive. So you may wonder, why have you never heard of Lustenberger?“I’m not good at self promotion,” she says, “I try to let my skiing do the talking.”In our extremely online world, marketing yourself on social media has become a basic prerequisite for many jobs. This is especially true for athletes searching for big sponsorships, like Lustenberger. But she doesn’t seem to care.“I get a deep sense of joy from these things, which comes from doing it for myself, not for anyone else,” says Lustenberger, who stays off social media for weeks after big descents, taking the time to appreciate the fleeting feeling. Lustenberger posts infrequently, typically with concise and modest details of her achievements, which could define a career for almost anyone else.Her obsession for skiing comes from her parents, who ran a small ski shop at Panorama Village in British Columbia. Learning to ski almost as soon as she could walk, Lustenberger was a natural, winning her first race at the age of five. “Skiing was integrated into everything our family did and that feeling hasn’t wavered for me at all,” she says. “I have my parents to thank for that.”By 21, Lustenberger was ranked in the top 30 in the world in giant salmon and at 24 she raced in the Olympics. “You could call it drive or work ethic, or maybe an addiction. All of my coaches will say that I always wanted to be the best.”But, on the Canadian National Ski Team, Lustenberger struggled with rigid training plans and a strict routine. “You are told when and where to go. What to do. Even how many sets to lift. I wanted to be the driver of my own reality. I wanted to express myself. I was known as a wildcard.”View image in fullscreenChristina Lustenberger: ‘When you’re in the mountains, you should feel confident. Some days I don’t, so I don’t go.’Photograph: Drew Smith/Drew Smith MediaDerailed by six knee surgeries, Lustenberger, at 26, decided to pivot from racing to ski guiding, something that helped her gain the skills and knowledge to chase her dream. “I could have shot film segments or done the Freeride World Tour, but I’ve always been drawn to alpinism,” Lustenberger says. Guiding became her path towards earning a living in the ski world and a stepping stone towards a larger goal.After getting certified by the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides, Lustenberger started working as a heli-ski guide, while spending most of her free time in the backcountry. With her extreme focus, she quickly learned the nuances of snow safety, weather conditions, rescues, ropes, and travel in technical terrain. After a first descent of Mount Adamant in 2011, Lustenberger landed her first sponsorships, launching her pro skiing career. She continued to guide for years, balancing the two.Three years ago Lustenberger stopped guiding to focus solely on bigger objectives and expeditions, realizing they took her entire focus to do well. “There are certain things in your life that become important to you,” says Lustenberger. “After failing our first attempt, Trango was important enough to go back a second time. I appreciate the two-year process. Trango was everything to me.”The bigger the challenge, Lustenberger believes, the larger the spoils. The team battled diarrhea, the potentially life-threateninghigh altitude pulmonary edema, and unstable snow for nearly a month before everything aligned and they were able to summit and ski. “We had a lot of challenges on Trango, but that makes the experience stronger once you complete it. I’m really proud we did it,” she says. “In life we often don’t allow ourselves the feeling of pride for long. Things come and go very fast, so I sat with it for a while. It was a visionary, improbable, and beautiful line.”Despite her track record, Lustenberger still has doubts. “Everything coexists. Without doubt, there is no confidence,” she says. “I live in this wildly dangerous space where there is very little margin for error. Spend enough time in those places and something can happen. It’s just time and exposure – and luck. When you’re in the mountains, you should feel confident. Some days I don’t, so I don’t go.”Doubt isn’t her only hurdle. Even with her sterling reputation and accolades, Lustenberger often wonders about the weight of female voices in the ski mountaineering boys club. When fellow guides, trip partners, and other professional skiers will talk louder than she does, they obscure what she has to say. It’s a common dynamic, often forcing Lustenberger to subtly feed her ideas to men to get her point across.While she hopes gender equity will improve as more women lead expeditions and continue to break barriers, Lustenberger admits there is a long way to go. “We’re proving ourselves over and over again. I would like to say we’re proving ourselves, but we have to do it over and over again to be recognized.”Lustenberger plans to continue chasing first descents, despite the objective risks and overt sexism. “My goal is precise movement in wildly exposed terrain,” she says. “For mastery [of my craft], but it’s elusive. The moment you achieve it, you start to dream of your next piece of art. The forever process keeps me motivated.“If I was turning away from the mountains because of the fear of a bad outcome, that’s just a fear of living to the fullest. That would be the biggest cheat I could give myself.”Explore more on these topicsSkiingMountaineeringUS sportsCanadaRock climbingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Afterwards the British driver gave an unequivocal “yes” when asked if he believed he could secure a record eighth title with theScuderia.Max Verstappen the panto villain as F1 marks 75th anniversary in blaze of colourRead more“This team already has an insane legacy, they are not short in how many world championships they have won,” Hamilton said. “In their DNA they have that winning mentality but the competition is fierce. We have had great results from other teams like McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes. It’s going to be close at the top but I have a great teammate.“The energy I am receiving from the team, there is magic here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work and grafting from absolutely ­everyone and everyone is putting that in already to achieve it but it’s also about belief. Everyone here dreams of ­winning withFerrari, every single person in this team.”Hamilton has been working extensively at Ferrari’s base in Maranello for the past month, acclimatising himself with the team, including meeting and shaking hands with all 1,500 ­employees. What he has observed has left him optimistic and he was clear when asked if he thought Ferrari were ready to win the cham­pionship. “Yes, I have worked with two world championship-winning teams before, I know what a winning team looks and feels like,” he said.“The passion here is like nothing you have ever seen, they have absolutely every ingredient you need to win a world championship and it’s just about putting all the pieces together.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton, Frédéric Vasseur and Charles Leclerc at Formula One’s 75th anniversary celebration at London’s O2 Arena on Tuesday.Photograph: Clive Mason/Formula 1/Getty ImagesHe is impressed by Frédéric Vasseur, theScuderiateam principal, and John Elkann and Benedetto Vigna, executives of the parent company. “We have a great leader in Fred and John and Benedetto, so everyone has a really calm and good approach, no believes they are perfect and everyone wants to elevate in every area and we are leaving no stone unturned to try and do that.”Vasseur, who is now entering his third season in charge at Ferrari and worked with Hamilton when the British driver drove for his ART team in GP2 in 2006, had no doubts he would be an invaluable asset. “The pace is there, I have no doubt,” the team principal said. “He isn’t the same, he is 20 years older than when we worked together first. He is changing, he is much more mature and much more experienced and he is the perfect fit with the team. It is exactly what I was looking for, for the team, for me, for Charles.

Or, alternately, don’t rage at all. The scoreline read 3-1 by the end, but for long periods on a lovely soft February night at the Bernabéu this felt like an act of extended sporting cruelty, an opportunity to sit back and watch the players ofReal Madridpulling the wings very slowly from an aubergine-shirted butterfly.The key executioner was Kylian Mbappé, who barely seemed to sprint, or wrinkle his shirt, let alone dig into the outer reaches of his talent en route to a clean, crisp, almostuncontested hat-trick.Mbappé hat-trick rips apart Manchester City to send Real Madrid racing throughRead moreWas this a great Mbappé performance? It had the metrics of one for 61 minutes: 20 touches, seven shots, three goals. It came against Madrid’s great European rivals of the past few years. It was also frictionless, almost unnervingly easy, first because Mbappé is brilliant, and second because his opponents were so utterly lacking in fight, desperation, or any kind of internal resistance.Before kick-off there was a report that the home fan’s tifo display had been cancelled at the last moment. According to the Spanish press the planned banner read: “You won’t leave the Bernabéu alive,” a message deemed, when it came down to it, to be not very nice and kind of a death threat. In the event it was only half right, because City didn’t enter the Bernabéu alive either, or show any obvious signs of animation until it was too late.Instead they spent the first half moving about like zombified figures, aManchester Cityteam haunted by the ghosts of itself. There was a terrible pathos in the sight of Pep Guardiola at the edge of his technical area, alone in all that air, head gleaming tenderly under the lights, hearing his team laughed and cheered and rondo’d off at the home of his great Iberian rivals. There is at least some certainty now that his greatest City team is formally over. This was its wake, albeit a weirdly joyless one.For three minutes at the start Madrid did nothing at all. Then they scored, the goal made by two touches. Raúl Asencio lofted a straight pass that drifted over the head of Rúben Dias, who seemed spooked by Mbappé pirouetting into space behind him, a man suddenly playing football on the moon.Ederson had ambled into a strange position off to one side, perfectly placed for Mbappé to lift the bouncing ball up into the evening air and then down in a gentle parabola into the City net. Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior did a synchronised leaping, grinning celebration. Lads, it’s three minutes in. They’re doing a leaping grinning celebration. This is a problem.Mainly it was a problem for Abdukodir Khusanov, played out of position at right-back and left to endure a public nightmare by his manager on the same side as Mbappé and Vinícius, the graveyard shift, a role he just isn’t ready for.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola heard his Manchester City team laughed and cheered and rondo’d off at the home of his great Iberian rivals.Photograph: Mateo Villalba/Getty ImagesEach time Vinícius got the ball one-on-one on that side there was a low, sensual hum from the crowd. With 22 minutes gone Khusanov found himself upfield and was left whirling like a man trapped in an invisible revolving door by Vinícius allowing the ball to run across his body, vast open tracts of space appearing in that simple movement. Khusanov sprinted backwards in dream-like slow motion, agonisingly late for the game of his life.Khusanov’s worst moment arrived on 33 minutes as Madrid scored their second. The final pass fell between Mbappé and Vinícius at the edge of the area. Khusanov seemed mesmerised, unable to decide who to stand near while they scored and choosing instead to stand near nobody as Mbappé took the ball and training-gamed it into the corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis already felt like an exhibition, with fond applause as the white shirts ran across to take a corner, Vegas-residency style. Even Madrid’s shots at goal felt a little disdainful, a team teeing itself up, gilding the moment. There was no approving roar at half time, just a ripple of polite applause, like the interval curtain falling in a metropolitan theatre. City’s players will have felt it, and hated it.For Mbappé, this will go down as another night of ascent. “Mbappé came for nights like this!” the Spanish press had fanfared before the game, and this is undeniably true. For Mbappé this a legacy-minting exercise, a ladder towards the Ballon d’Or, the iconography of triumphant memes, knee slides, T-shirt message reveals, appalling million-dollar tuxedos, a necessary bookend to his World Cup genesis seven years ago.It will require more robust tests than this. City are a strange sight when they fall apart like this, but then this has always been an unusual sporting entity, so smoothly engineered, so annihilating in victory. It makes sense that it should collapse in the same easy way. The movements are still there, the outline of footballers ranged in the same patterns.But this was the footballing equivalent of a quiet stroll around the morgue, no mess, no blood, just an absence.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaReal MadridCarlo AncelottiChampions LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

The man was removed by security and had exhibited “fixated behaviour” towards Raducanu, in the words of the Women’sTennisAssociation.‘I’ll be OK,’ says Emma Raducanu after incident with ‘fixated’ man in DubaiRead moreThis month Bright called out fans’ verbal abuse of female footballers, using social media to express disappointment over an incident with a supporter after Chelsea’s defeat of Aston Villa. The England international was abused by the individual over her performance moments after signing autographs and taking photos with them.Asked about the Raducanu incident, Bright said she had “not thought about anything like that” in women’s football, but said: “If there is a message to be sent, it is that we are human. We are somebody’s partner and somebody’s daughter. We are not items. Nobody owns us. We own ourselves and that needs to be reminded and told.”Bright expanded on her decision to go public regarding her experience at Villa.“In the moment I didn’t actually do anything because I was really taken aback and disappointed,” the 31‑year‑old said. “Football is full of opinions and everyone can have one. I wasn’t bothered with the opinion on my performance, it was more the fact I had gone to the fans to give my time, give signatures, inspire the next generation and say ‘hi’ to little ones.“To give that time and to try to have a genuine conversation and to then be disrespected afterwards immediately, I just thought: ‘I’m here off my own back.’”Bright, speaking in the Algarve before England’s Nations League opener against Portugal on Friday evening, said the incident had stayed on her mind all night and that she was glad it had happened to her and not a younger teammate.View image in fullscreenEngland training in Portugal has been thirsty work.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty Images“Comments like that can really affect you,” Bright said. “We go out to play for our fans every single game – whether that’s with our clubs or countries – and we want to make everyone proud. I’ve heard of a couple of situations that players went through where they maybe didn’t feel strong enough to speak out, and ultimately I wanted to protect my team and let them know that if they need to speak out they have a right to.“You don’t deserve to be disrespected, especially not when you have given your time and effort after a game … It’s a two-way street.

Bright said this window has come at a good time. “It’s always good to get that time away and refresh mentally and physically. We’ve started the year with a really positive energy and everyone’s thriving to be back and excited for two massive games.”Bright described the past 12 months for England as a rollercoaster, with results and performances not as consistent as they had been previously. “Football is very challenging on and off the pitch,” she said. “We learned some really good lessons, but we have a lot of good memories as well.

That figure covers the ­compensation paid to Newcastle and the payoff the sporting director received whenhe departed in early Decemberbut not his wages.Ashworth’s exit came after the sacking of Erik ten Hag and his staff in October, whichcost United £10.4m. United made great effort to prise ­Ashworth from Newcastle but a decision was made for him to depart after a summer of ­underwhelming recruitment and amid a difficult ­relationship with the minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.The figure was included in ­United’s latest quarterly financial results. They show revenue was down 12% year-on-year to the end of ­December 2024, caused by a drop in broadcast money after United failed to qualify for the Champions League. The club recorded a £27.7m loss over the three-month period but the balance sheet was helped by an £80m cash injection from Ratcliffe’s company Ineos.United’s financial problems have become increasingly apparent. Ratcliffe is to instigate asecond round of redundancies, 250 employees having left since he invested in December 2023. It is anticipated a further 200 jobs will go, something Ratcliffe believes is necessaryto avoid United going bust.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We recognise the challenges in improving our men’s team’s league position and we are all working hard, collectively, to achieve that,” United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, said.The head coach, Ruben Amorim, has admitted the club need to sell players before they can buy. The wing-back Patrick Dorgu, who joined for £20m from Lecce, and the £1.5m defender Ayden Heaven from ­Arsenal were the only winter window arrivals, as United having to cut their cloth accordingly.Limiting expenditure has become a key tenet under Ratcliffe. The former manager Sir Alex Ferguson willlose his £2m annual ambassadorial salary, and the former players Bryan Robson, Andy Cole and Denis Irwin will be paid less as ambassadors.Ineos is in talks with Tottenham to cut short a five-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2022, to be the club’s official 4x4 vehicle partner.

It was Chelsea’sfifth league win in a rowand they were being talked up as title contenders. No one is talking about the title now. Chelsea have only won four of their 12 matches since they beat Brentford – and two of them were at home to Shamrock Rovers and Morecambe. They have dropped to sixth in the table and will miss out on Europe entirely unless the manager can turn things around.Their away form has fallen off a cliff. A 3-0 defeat at Brighton on Friday night – their second loss at the Amex in less than a week – means they have gone six games on the road without a win. The last time they won away was in the Conference League against Astana before Christmas. Maresca was right to play down Chelsea’s title ambitions given the lack of experience in his squad and the huge player turnover at the club, but the collapse in their form over the last few months has been worrying.Leicester supporters will recognise the pattern. When it was going good under Maresca last season, it was going great, but they nearly derailed their title charge with a run of six defeats in 10 games towards the end of the campaign, eventually recovering to win three of their last four matchesand return to thePremier Leagueas champions.As such, Chelsea’s post-Christmas dip should not come as a surprise. The team were still riding the coat-tails of an impressive second half of the season under Mauricio Pochettino when Maresca arrived in the summer. It looked like they had adjusted to his demands ​quickly and their attacking players were expressing themselves.Wide players are vital in Maresca’s system. Stephy Mavididi and Abdul Fatawu were important at Leicester and the same is true at Chelsea. Noni Madueke has made 25 key passes this season (passes that lead to a shot on goal), with Jadon Sancho chipping in with 23 and Pedro Neto 22. Cole Palmer, meanwhile, ranks top for key passes (66) in the league. Chelsea have taken 400 shots this season – only Liverpool, Manchester City and Bournemouth have more – but the goals just aren’t flowing.They have scored 1.25 goals per game in the league since Christmas, a big drop from their pre-Christmas average of 2.18. This mirrors Leicester’s slump last season; they averaged 2.13 goals per game until mid-February and then dropped to 1.10 goals per game, almost costing them the Championship title.Creating chances was not the issue for Leicester; they just could not score them. Their shot conversion rate fell from 15.2% to 7%, and a similar thing is happening to Chelsea. Palmer’s form over the last few months tells a familiar story: he has made 33 key passes and created eight clear-cut chances in his last 12 games, but none of these opportunities has been converted by teammates.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson has not scored since early December.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesChelsea are still having as many shots as they did before Christmas but, like Leicester, their conversion rate has dropped massively, from 13.8% to 6.8% with Nicolas Jackson the guiltiest party. He had one of the best conversion rates in the league before Christmas, scoring with 20.5% of his shots, but has not scored with any of his 19 shots since Christmas. No one has taken more shots without scoring in that time period. Having scored nine goals in his first 15 appearances this season, Jackson has now gone eight matches without a goal.Therein lies the risk of relying on a young striker. Jackson ia a purple-patch frontman who goes through peaks before enduring goalless runs, but he has not been putting himself in the right places to score – he has generated an xG of just 2.86 in his seven league games since Christmas.With the 23-year-oldcurrently sidelined with a hamstring injury, Maresca has turned to Christopher Nkunku to shoulder the attacking burden, but the Frenchman is also struggling for consistency. He has scored only two goals in 21 league appearances this season, hardly the finishing you would expect fora player who cost €60m.Maresca needs to get his forwards firing. Chelsea have underperformed their xG by 3.90 goals since Christmas; only Brentford (-4.92) are doing so by a greater margin. The strikers must take a large portion of the blame but, like Leicester, there has also been a hint of misfortune about their travails – Leicester struck the woodwork more times (22) than any other team in the Championship last season, and only Bournemouth (16) have done so more often than Chelsea (15) in the Premier League this term. Fine margins can make a big difference.The Chris Whyte experiment: when Arsenal played a centre-back up frontRead moreSo, how can Chelsea get their season back on track and secure a place in Europe​? Maresca was handed a welcome reprieve last season when Leicester beat West Brom 2-1 at home in April. Leicester made it hard work for themselves, with Jamie Vardy missing a penalty, but the narrow victory ultimately gave them the shot in the arm they needed to see out the campaign.This young Chelsea team is short of confidence and needs a similar win to get back on track. They may struggle to correct their fortunes when they visit Aston Villa on Saturday, but forthcoming home games against relegation-threatened Southampton and Leicester could prove just the tonic.Chelsea have spent a lot of money but it’s worth remembering that Maresca is working with one of the youngest squads in the Premier League. Uncertainty at the back has also contributed to Chelsea’s poor results – error-prone goalkeeper Robert Sánchez has only recently been dropped as first choice. The good news is that Maresca corrected the decline last season and took Leicester up as champions, an experience that will work in his favour. Once Chelsea rediscover their shooting boots, they should return to the form that had them flying high earlier in the season.This is an article byWhoScoredFollowWhoScoredandBen McAleeron social mediaExplore more on these topicsChelseaGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what now?Dominic BoothWed 19 Feb 2025 08.02 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 18.01 ESTShareFootball, especially in the cutthroat and crazyChampionship, has a habit of making very little sense very quickly. How can a club change their director of football and head coach days after the January transfer window has shut? How can that same club sell their captain, a midfield stalwart, late in the window and fail to replace him? Swansea fans have been asking themselves these questions.The Swans have been plunged into crisis, with thesacking of the head coach, Luke Williams,on Monday coming after a run containing seven defeats in nine league games. Those results, which included alarmingly heavy defeats by Portsmouth, Norwich and, most painfully, their south Wales rivals Cardiff, meant they slumped from the brink of the playoffs to 17th, with a relegation fight possible.Swansea City sack head coach Luke Williams after dismal run of formRead moreThe nosedive in form prompted the chairman, Andy Coleman – who heads a consortium that acquired majority ownership in November – to act decisively. “This was a difficult decision and one that has not been taken lightly,” said Coleman, who less than a week earlier heralded the arrival of Richard Montague as the director of football.Montague had been a close ally of Williams at Notts County, the pair overseeing promotion to the Football League in 2023, and champions a data-driven approach to recruitment. Williams was in favour of the appointment. Yet one day before Montague officially started at Swansea, Williams was gone. It’s fair to say this was not the plan.Nor was the departure of the captain Matt Grimes on the final day of January to Coventry, a sale that left a bitter taste in the mouth of supporters, especially as the club failed to sign many of their desired targets.“We do have a contingency,” Williams said as Grimes joined Frank Lampard’s playoff hopefuls after a decade of service. However, it proved to be a late and largely desperate scramble for reinforcements, and Lewis O’Brien – not a like-for-like replacement – was ushered in on loan from Nottingham Forest on deadline day. Without Grimes’s ability to drop deep and dictate play, Williams was left fumbling for tactical solutions and results suffered further.That the window was overseen without a director of football, with Coleman taking the lead on negotiations, rankled with fans. Montague’s predecessor, Paul Watson, left in October but finding a replacement became a drawn-out saga. Swansea say Montague’s “deep understanding of data analytics and his first-hand knowledge of the football industry and operations make him the outstanding candidate”. But he was not around to help in January as he served his notice period.It wasn’t just the transfer window that derailed Williams. Other issues were of his own making. The way he handled media links with the West Brom job during the festive period created a schism with fans and Coleman referred to the speculation as “unhelpful”. “I created a lot of the noise without meaning to,” said Williams. “That was handled poorly by myself.”Quick GuideLuton 1-1 PlymouthShowLuton and Plymouth played out a low quality 1-1 draw at Kenilworth Road that did neither side any real good in their efforts to avoid relegation. Jacob Brown gave bottom-placed Luton a 55th-minute lead but Maksym Talovierov equalised as both teams remained in the relegation zone.Matt Bloomfield is still searching for a first victory since replacing Rob Edwards as Luton manager after their miserable winless run extended to 11 matches. Bloomfield’s men sit two points from the last safe spot, one point behind Argyle, with both teams having 13 games to play.The hosts should have led inside three minutes as Alfie Doughty’s inch-perfect cross was met by Lasse Nordas but the Norwegian forward, on his first start, headed over from a few yards out. Nordas had another crack in the 14th minute after Mark McGuinness’s long throw dropped at his feet, only to see it deflect over the bar.Plymouth thought they had scored when Callum Wright reached Tymoteusz Puchacz’s pass ahead of the hesitant Thomas Kaminski to find the net, but the linesman’s flag was quickly raised. Replays suggested he may have been level, giving the hosts a major let-off.The Hatters responded with another effort from Nordas, who attempted an ambitious 20-yard volley from Kal Naismith’s long ball, but he skewed wide.At the start of the second period Luton went close once more when Izzy Jones’s cross was not cleared properly by Nikola Katic. Elijah Adebayo read the flight of the ball but could only power his volley over the top.With the forward then taken off, his replacement Brown broke the deadlock with his first touch. Doughty’s cross was nodded down by Nordas for the substitute to beat Hazard to the ball and angle his header into the net, ending Luton’s run of four and a half games without a home goal.Argyle were level within 15 minutes. With McGuinness off the pitch to receive treatment, the visitors took full advantage by sending in a deep cross and the centre-back Talovierov rose highest and placed his downward header inside the far post.Town should have been back in front as Shandon Baptiste’s shot deflected away and then Brown somehow put a free header straight at Hazard from Doughty’s cross.Although eight minutes of stoppage time were added, Luton could not fashion the winner they were desperate for, with the substitute Millenic Alli putting his backheel over the bar from a last-gasp corner.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The coming months will be illustrative of the club’s next direction. Most pressing is a home clash with the Championship’s other managerless club, Blackburn, on Saturday, when Alan Sheehan will be in the Swansea dugout. Sheehan is well-regarded at the club and steps into his second spell as caretaker after a period in charge after Michael Duff’s sacking in December 2023. Work is under way to find Williams’s long-term successor, with Coleman and Montague leading that search. It’s not an appointment they can afford to get wrong.Supporters will get a chance to air grievances at a fans’ forum on 3 March, with Coleman – who has borne the brunt of supporter discontent – to be present. The forum was initially due to take place this Tuesday with Williams slated to attend, before it was hastily rescheduled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What’s clear is whoever takes the role will have a big task on their hands.

Friday’s 10-year anniversary of afamous 2-1 win over Manchester Unitedwill not be toasted with great nostalgia given the events of recent days.Since relegation in 2018, Swansea have twice come close to promotion, losing playoff clashes with Brentford in successive years. They’ve shown promise and had exciting young managers (Graham Potter, Steve Cooper and Russell Martin) poached by bigger, wealthier clubs. But in the post-Covid years attendances have dropped, money has been tight and stagnation has set in.

He and his teammates would subsequently hoist Big Vase towards the sky over Dublin, rubber stamping a place in Bigger Cup they had already secured anyway by dint of their fourth-placed finish in the Italian league. Having seen his two big dreams come true, all that was left for the 34-year-old Italian international to leave an indelible mark on this season’s competition while representing the club he loves before his contract expires later this season. And how …While Atalantamay have exited Bigger Cup on Tuesday night, running out a distant second-best to a Club Brugge side who had grasped the 24th and final qualification spot in the group stage, it would be fair to say the Belgians’ thunder was rather stolen by Tolói, whosegenerational meltdownupon being prevented from taking an 88th-minute throw-in long after the tie was beyond rescue ensured his name will forever be part of Bigger Cup folklore. Having been given a second yellow for a preposterous swallow dive in the Feyenoord penalty area some hours previously, Milan’s Théo Hernandez might have been forgiven for thinking his would be the most embarrassing red card this week, or at the very least in Bigger Cup matches featuring out-of-sorts Italian sides hosting teams from the Low Countries. But not a bit of it.In an act of recklessness for which the phrase “hold my beer” might well have been coined, Tolói lost the plot when Maxim De Cuyper jostled him in the chest, prompting Atalanta’s captain to try and fling the ball at the Brugge defender in a fit of rage that was only exacerbated when he lost his grip on the ball and slipped to the floor. With his head completely gone and the rest of him enveloped in a mist so red it’s actually prefaced by the adjective “volcanic” on the Dulux colour chart, Tolói went into raging bull mode, pawing the ground for purchase, before charging past the referee to blindside De Cuyper with a shoulder charge that knocked the impertinent Belgian to the ground. As he was pulled away by teammates and members of the opposition, the incensed Tolói formally received his marching orders from referee Felix Zwayer. “He threw the ball and slipped, and he was so annoyed at himself for that,” honked Lucy Ward, who was on co-comms for TNT. “What made it worse was the embarrassment of slipping. That just adds to the anger and he completely lost it.”One player who might have been pleased by Tolói’s tantrum was Ademola Lookman, who probably hoped the sending-off would help his manager forget about the spot-kick he’d missed when the tie was still vaguely salvageable. Again, not a bit of it. “Lookman was not supposed to take that penalty, he is one of the worst penalty takers I’ve ever seen,” fumed Gian Piero Gasperini, studiously avoiding the Uefa-designated word-mincer left at the top table for his post-match press conference. The Atalanta boss’s withering criticism prompted Lookmanto fire off a riposte, bemoaning the manner in which he had been “singled out” for “deeply disrespectful” blame in the form of a statement; one that weighed in at 183 words, not one of which happened to mention, or even allude to, just how poor his penalty was.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Will Unwin from 7.30pm GMT for hot Premier League minute-by-minute coverage of Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool, while Michael Butler will be on deck for Real Madrid 2-2 Manchester City (agg: 5-4) in the second leg of their Bigger Cup playoff.QUOTE OF THE DAY“It’s worrying to see the direction Brazilian [football] is taking. It’s absurd that we have to discuss synthetic turf on our fields. Objectively, with the size and reputation of our [game], this should not even be an option … In the most respected leagues in the world, the players are listened to and investments are made to ensure the quality of the pitch in the stadiums. If Brazil wants to play a leading role in the world market, the first step should be to demand the quality of the pitch on which the players play and train. Professional [football’] is not played on synthetic turf” – Neymar, Thiago Silva and Memphis Depay, among other players, issue a statement lambasting the use of artificial pitches in Brazil. Palmeiras, one of the teams in the group’s cross-hairs, responded by describing the letter as “shallow criticism lacking scientific basis”.View image in fullscreenAction from Palmeiras v São Paulo on their plastic pitch at the weekend.Photograph: Sports Press Photo/Getty ImagesFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSI loved the photo of Roy Pritchard in training; it looks as though Wolves are using a gibbet for heading practice (yesterday’s Memory Lane, full email edition).

He is one of 17 England players who were awarded enhanced contracts in October, which give Steve Borthwick the “final say” on all sports science matters.Scotland’s dangermen Russell and Van der Merwe loom large for EnglandRead moreInitially, Exeter booked Feyi-Waboso for surgery before the Chiefs’ director of rugby, Rob Baxter, revealed thewinger was still deliberatingwhether to forgo the operation and hope rehab could enable him to return for the business end of the Six Nations.When announcing his squad for theSix Nationson 14 January, Borthwick said Feyi-Waboso had decided to have surgery after all, only for it to emerge that he had opted against the operation and could feature in the Six Nations. He was called into England’s camp last week for a day’s rehabilitation but has now finally undergone surgery, ­posting images of himself in hospital on social media with an ­accompanying caption: “Minor setbacks, we go again.”The saga puts the professional game partnership – which gives Borthwick a greater degree of control over players on enhanced contracts – in a questionable light. Back in January, Baxter admitted that the uncertainty over whether Feyi-Waboso would have surgery was slowing his recovery down. In January, Baxter said: “He has barely started his rehab process really, because the to-ing and fro-ing over whether he has an operation or goes for rehab is probably slowing both options down – the operation or the rehab.”Andy Farrell is expected to name his squad for the Lions tour in late April or early May while Exeter’s final Premiership match is at the end of May. With the Chiefs unlikely to make the playoffs, Feyi-Waboso has three and a half months to return to the field during the club campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool had to settle for a point that leaves themeight points clearof second-placed Arsenal, who have a game in hand and host West Ham on Saturday.Trent Alexander-Arnold rescues point for Liverpool in thriller at Aston VillaRead moreLiverpool, who travel to Manchester City on Sunday, have taken one win from their past four games, ­including a shock FA Cup exit against the Championship strugglers ­Plymouth, but remain unbeaten away in the Premier League this season.Asked if his team were in a blip, the Liverpool head coach replied: “I don’t feel like that at all. If you go away to Villa, that’s always a difficult fixture. At the start of the season you know: ‘Villa away, that’s a difficult one, City away, that’s a difficult one.’ So ­performance-wise, not a dip at all today, in my opinion, but you might disagree.“What we must not do and we’ve done a bit too often now, is we don’t get what we deserve. If you look at all the chances and put them in a row, from us and from them, I think it’s clear which team should have won.“We must not make a habit out of that because it’s happened a bit too much now. But still we are eight points clear of Arsenal, who have a game in hand.”Núñez, who came on in place of Diogo Jota with a quarter of the game to go, spurned a golden chance after Dominik Szoboszlai squared the ball to him. Slot said: “I saw an unbelie­vable pass from Conor ­Bradley, a ­powerful run from Dominik ­Szoboszlai, who made in my opinion the perfect choice to square because he made it an open-goal chance and then Darwin, it was not the best, he’s right-footed, of course, but it’s still a big chance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rapid rise of generative AI systems, which are based on vast troves of books, newspaper articles, images and songs, has caused alarm among authors, newspapers and musicians,triggering a slew of lawsuitsabout alleged breaches of copyright.Voss said he had been unable to get majorities of EU lawmakers to ensure strong copyright protection when the issue emerged in the late stages of negotiating the AI Act. The absence of strong provisions on copyright was “irresponsible” and it was “unbelievable” that the legal gap remained, he said.He would like legislation to fill that gap, but said it would take years, after the European Commission’s decision last week towithdraw the proposed AI Liability Act. “It might be getting very difficult. And so the infringement of copyright is continuing, but nobody can prove it.”The AI Act states that tech firms must comply with 2019 copyright law, which includes an exemption for text and data mining.Voss said this exemption from copyright law was intended to have a limited private use, rather than allow the world’s largest companies to harvest vast amounts of intellectual property. The introduction of the TDM exemption in the AI Act was“a misunderstanding”, he said.This view was reinforced by a significantacademic studylast year by the legal scholar Tim Dornis and the computer scientist Sebastian Stober, which concluded that the training of generative AI models on published materials could not be considered “a case of text and data mining” but “copyright infringement”.Meanwhile, the TDM exemption has sent shock waves across creative professions. Nina George,a German bestselling authorwhose works has been translated into 37 languages, described the TDM exception as “devastating”. Exclusions from copyright, she said, were originally intended to balance the interest of authors against those of the public, such as allowing schools to photocopy texts. “These AI exceptions for commercial use mean that business interest will be served for the first time,” she said. “This is a shift of paradigms [and] a perverted way to bend copyrights and authors’ rights to serve the interest of a few businesses.”George, who is president of honour at the European Writers Council, said she had no way of finding out if any of her works had been used to feed generative AI systems. “The lack of instruments to enforce any rights, this is the scandal in the construction of the AI Act [in] relation to copyright directive.”Aafke Romeijn, a Dutch-language electropop artist, said there was no practical way for creatives to opt out of having their work used in AI applications.Companies are not obliged to report on the content used to feed generative AI models. From 2 August, tech firms will have to provide a summary of data used in AI models, but details are still being decided. Voss said the latest draft rules on the summary from the EU’s AI office were “not sufficiently detailed” to protect artists.In a letter to the Commission this week, 15 cultural organisations said the draft summary proposals failed to ensure transparency.

On Monday, nearly 11 weeks later, the commission had not replied, according to three signatories.“So far it does not seem that she [Virkkunen] has an ear or an understanding – I am sorry to say that – of the whole value chain and how it works in the cultural and creative industries,” said George.Brando Benifei, an Italian Social Democrat who jointly represented the European parliament in negotiations on the AI Act, contested the view that creatives were unprotected. He described the AI Act as “a very strong text” that had the potential to create “a very large rebalancing of power between the developers and the rights holders”.From “day one” after the law was voted in, there had been an effort “to dilute and to interpret in a minimalistic way the provisions”, he added. “[This] has been the obsession of the big tech companies because it is probably the part of the AI Act that can be most impactful in terms of costs for the big generative AI companies.”A European Commission spokesperson said it was “closely monitoring the global challenges that AI technology development poses to the creative industry” and was “committed to maintaining a balanced approach that fosters innovation while protecting human creativity”.“We are assessing the need for additional measures, outside the AI framework,”the spokesperson added, declining to say whether this meant new legislation.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)European UnionComputingMusic industryWritten languageEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It has previously said it is working with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to resolve potential historic tax liabilities.The inland revenue service alleges that Binance has a “significant economic presence” in Nigeria and is therefore liable for corporate income tax. It is seeking a court declaration that Binance pay income taxes for 2022 and 2023, plus a 10% annual penalty on unpaid amounts. FIRS is also requesting a 26.75% interest rate on the unpaid taxes, based on the Central Bank of Nigeria’s lending rate.Binance was already facing four counts of tax evasion in Nigeria after a government crackdown on the industry last year. The charges include non-payment of value-added tax, company income tax, failure to file tax returns and complicity in helping customers to evade taxes through its platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On 10 January, leaders at CZI reassured staff that its longstanding support for DEI wasnot changing. Zuckerberg’s company Meta had announced earlier that day it would terminate itsDEI programs, in the days beforeDonald Trump’ssecond inauguration.Mark Zuckerberg’s charity confirms support for DEI despite Meta’s overhaulRead moreMarc Malandro, CZI’s chief operating officer, wrote in the email to all employees: “Given the shifting regulatory and legal landscape, we will no longer have a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility team at CZI.”The organization also rolled back its Diverse Slate Practice, an effort to ensure that qualified candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds be interviewed for all open roles at the charity. Meta nixed asimilar rulelast month. The changes “align with our focus as a science philanthropy”, Malandro wrote.CZI’s billions of dollars in funding for investments and grants flows from Zuckerberg and Chan’s enormous personal fortune created byMeta, the social media company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp that Zuckerberg co-founded more than 20 years ago. The couple operate CZI as co-founders and co-CEOs. When Meta early this year decided it would end its own DEI efforts, CZI employees grew concerned that their organization would follow since the company and the foundation often enact similar corporate policies. As Meta’s CEO, Zuckerberg has made clear in recent months his desire to be in the good graces of Trump’s new administration, which has ended diversity initiatives in federal hiring and pressured businesses to do the same.Despite CZI’s top HR executive telling staff last month: “Meta’s changes to its DEI efforts does not impact ours,” employees had remained wary the organization would stick to its commitments. There have been several past instances of CZI following Meta’s lead in making operational changes, from layoffs to a recent return-to-office mandate. A CZI spokesperson declined to comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The organization will now focus more strictly on grants and work around “biology and AI”, his email added.To that end, CZI also conducted layoffs within its community team, formerly part of the organization where work has focused on affordable housing and “economic inclusion”, and moved other members of the team elsewhere within the organization. The head of the community team is leaving CZI next month, according to another email viewed by the Guardian. The landing page for CZI’s community work has been scrubbed of any mention of work on inclusivity or economic fairness.CZI’s website has changed more drastically in recent days, removing many past references to its years of public support of corporate diversity and promoting underrepresented groups in scientific research.Among the changes: a page previously dedicated to CZI’s DEI work that highlighted its own employees’ diverse backgrounds no longer exists. Another page that previously said the foundation focused all its work through “a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens” removed that phrase. A quote from Chan from CZI’s main page that read: “Luck is not a national strategy. We need to build strategies that take luck out of the equation for every person,” is gone. The organization has given thousands of grants over the years, including to many programs and organizations focused on diversity efforts, as well as to institutions that the Trump administration hasrailed against, such as the National Institutes of Health.Meta terminates its DEI programs days before Trump inaugurationRead moreCZI also on Tuesday informed those who had already applied to its Science Diversity Leadership awards, a grant program awarding $1.15m to selected researchers, that it had “decided not to continue” with the program. The organization did not give an explanation in an email about the end of the program, though the process for selecting a new cohort of researchers was well under way, according to another webpage that has now been deleted from CZI’s website.A person who had applied for the award and was expecting to hear back this month instead received a brief email informing them that it would be discontinued. The person told the Guardian it was “extremely frustrating”, and that it pointed to “an even bigger problem at CZI”.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMark ZuckerbergSilicon ValleyPhilanthropyRaceDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It replaces the previously cheapest available £599iPhone 14and £429 iPhone SE in Apple’s lineup, and thus marks a considerable price increase for the cheapest new iPhone when it ships on 28 February.View image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16e resembles an iPhone 14 but with the latest A18 chip.Photograph: AppleThe new iPhone has an aluminium frame, glass front and back and an 15.4cm (6.1in) OLED screen, relegating the old-school iPhone design, with its chunky forehead and chins, to history. But the 16e is only available in black or white and has the older, notch-style cutout at the top of the screenfrom the iPhone 14, not thenewer pill-shaped dynamic island designused by the rest of the iPhone lineup. The notch contains the face ID sensor that replaces the touch ID system for unlocking the phone and authenticating payment.The phone starts with 128GB of storage and has Apple’s latest A18 chip, which enables the firm’s various AI tools, to bring the cheapest iPhone up to par with the rest of the line. It has 5G powered by a newApplemodem for the first time, emergency satellite messaging, charges via USB-C and has an action button instead of the mute switch in the side.But the phone has only a single 48-megapixel camera on the back instead of the double or triple cameras of other iPhones, and lacks therecently added camera control buttonon the side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, while there are flashes of brilliance throughout, Truth fails as an act of agitprop and is hard going – and faintly dispiriting – as an act of drama.We don’t get a single Assange here but five of them (Emily Havea, Tomáš Kantor, James O’Connell, Eva Rees and Eva Seymour), arranged as in a criminal lineup. While this could have encouraged five different – maybe contrasting or even contradictory? – viewpoints of the character, in practice they form a united chorus of complaint. Grievance seems to be Cornelius’s central motivation, which she grinds like teeth.We start (almost) at the beginning, when Assange was a nerdy kid with a computer and some keen hacking skills. Melbourne may have housed him but Assange was a globalist from the start, connecting with fellow hackers online to infiltrate and “explore” highly sensitive computer systems around the world, including Citibank and (allegedly) the Pentagon. They didn’t disrupt or corrupt these systems; they just “had a look around”. But it gave Assange a taste for subversion, the fulcrum of which wasWikiLeaks.View image in fullscreenEmily Havea, Tomáš Kantor, James O’Connell, Eva Rees and Eva Seymour all play Assange in Truth.Photograph: Pia JohnsonWe know this story but Cornelius drags us through the main events anyway, occasionally elucidating details – the specifics of the sexual assault charges in Sweden are illuminating – but rarely providing any nuance or ambiguity. The playwright has decided Assange is an exterminating angel of the left and goes to great lengths to enforce this reading; any facts that might disrupt the narrative are jettisoned or smoothed over. It’s the dramatic equivalent of a raised fist, fixed and impermeable.When Truth ventures away from Assange and into the case studies of Chelsea Manning andEdward Snowden, it loosens its grip a little on the propaganda and lets in some light. Rees is brilliantly vulnerable as Manning, stripped and locked in a cell, and Kantor is compelling as the impervious young man forced into exile in (of all places) Russia.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningBest of all, and perhaps an indication of the true potential of this material, are two scenes utterly unrelated to Assange but pulsing with thematic power. One involves a young person grappling with their parents’ silence over the sexual abuse of their son by the local priest. The other is about a woman cowered by the surveillance of her ex, who watches her every movement from the cameras inside her house. These moments crystallise the stakes and carry emotional weight, things that are sorely lacking in the Assange story.View image in fullscreenKantor also plays Edward Snowden and ‘is compelling as the impervious young man forced into exile’.Photograph: Pia JohnsonWhile much of Truth is a slog, dour and repetitive, many aspects of the production are sharp and articulate. Dee directs with great poise and precision, innovative in her use of space and attuned to shifts in mood and pacing. Matilda Woodroofe’s set may be cold and confronting, with shades of Guantánamo, but it’s capable of variation and visual impact. Meri Blazevski’s video design is terrific, bold and intrusive as Big Brother.

O’Connell is the rage and Havea the suavity, Seymour the bewildered one and Kantor the thrilled iconoclast. Rees is fascinating to watch, alternately hounded and resolute, a dogged journalist in full Watergate mode. As an ensemble, they crackle and surge.Truth fancies itself a grenade lodged at the heart of the audience, an attempt to reclaim Assange as an unambiguous symbol of resistance. But the man and his legacy are far murkier. One could argue his dumping of secrets and subsequent indifference of the impact on people has been far more helpful to the right than the left – something Cornelius refuses to countenance.Agitprop should be an act of persuasion, but this unashamedly old-fashioned protest piece seems unlikely to shift opinion one iota. The truth continues to slip through our feeble grasp.Truth is at the Malthouse’s Merlyn theatre until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsAustralian theatreJulian AssangeTheatreWikiLeaksHackingEdward SnowdenreviewsShareReuse this content"

The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery ModeDiscovery Mode gets artists noticed in exchange for a 30% royalty reduction. A new book suggests that the platform is squeezing musicians and misleading listenersLiz PellyWed 19 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 10.38 ESTShareIn November 2020, Spotify published an opaque headline on its company blog: “Amplifying Artist Input in Your Personalised Recommendations.” The post introduceda new program called Discovery Mode, which would ask artists to accept lower royalty rates in exchange for algorithmic promotion. It was pay-to-play, but Spotify introduced the scheme using neutral language: artists would be able to “identify music that’s a priority for them”, which would become one of “thousands” of data inputs influencing how Spotify delivers “the perfect song for the moment, just for you”. Rather than charge an upfront fee, “labels or rights-holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalised listening sessions where Spotify provided this service”.Participating artists and labels take a 30% royalty reduction on tracks enrolled in the program, when they are discovered through its channels. Only tracks more than 30 days old are eligible. Notably, there have been no signs that Spotify plans to publicly label which songs are enrolled: a lack of disclosure that has caused many music advocacy groups to liken Discovery Mode to theradio payolaof the 1950s, which was eventually outlawed by the US Federal Trade Commission. (Though the company points out that it has published a broad guide tounderstanding recommendationson Spotify, including a paragraph on “commercial considerations”.)In the early 1960s, in what became known as “the Payola hearings”, the US government outlawed the practice of radio stations accepting under-the-table cash in exchange for airplay without disclosure. According to several accounts of the day’s payola practices, sometimes DJs were handed stacks of cash, but other times they were offered fake songwriting credits or a percentage of royalties. And while making payola illegal did not automatically make mainstream radio more fair – some say that now there exists just an “institutionalised” form of payola – outlawing it sent a message about the responsibility of regulators to take corporate deception of the public seriously. Payola was outlawed, in part, because regulators said accepting money in exchange for plays could artificially inflate popularity and mislead listeners.View image in fullscreenStatistician Bernard Goldstein gives evidence to the payola hearings in April 1960.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveSpotify, of course, framed Discovery Mode – which wasn’t exactly replicating the terms of radio payola – as democratising. OneSpotifyemployee explained it this way: “We’re not asking for any upfront budget or payment, which means there’s no barrier to entry.” More artists would now have the freedom to devalue their work, the opportunity to participate in an extractive system – and that was somehow democratic.Discovery Mode’s inner workings are, in part, a product of how playlists have evolved more broadly. Many of Spotify’s recommendation systems start with a curator identifying songs eligible to be included in a playlist; a personalisation algorithm then decides which 50 end up on a user’s playlist based on what they are most likely to identify with. Similarly, in the automated mixes impacted by Discovery Mode – user-specific mixes and the Radio and Autoplay features – a sequencing algorithm re-ranks the tracks from a relevant pool before they are delivered, increasing their chance of being served to users, a source explained.It’s a vicious cycle: we’re losing revenue because of streaming, then streaming pushes these weird opportunities on usInternally, Discovery Mode’s success has been measured by the percentage of total artists who were onboarded, and how much cash this was saving Spotify. By 2023, Spotify employees celebrated an “exciting Discovery Mode milestone”, according to a review of company Slack messages. More than 50% of what Spotify calls Tier 2–3 artists – those with annual royalties of $50,000-500,000 – had tried Discovery Mode. “Last year we set out with an ambitious goal of getting to 30%,” an employee wrote. “Surpassing 50% felt beyond our wildest dreams and yet here we are. Congrats all!”Spotify has made a lot of money from Discovery Mode, with profits also exceeding goals. Between May 2022 and May 2023, Discovery Mode had brought in €61.4m (£51m) in gross profit, according to a review of a chart shared internally. In May 2023 alone, it generated €6.6m (£5.5m) in gross profit – with nearly all of it coming from the independent and DIY sectors. It appeared from the breakdown in the chart that there was a direct connection between the musicians who were opting into Discovery Mode and those who already stood to be affected by the introduction of so-called “artist-centric” royalty policies, which as of 2024 have demonetised tracks with less than 1000 annual streams.The music industry is engineering artist popularity – listeners are right to be angryRead moreBut in the long term, Discovery Mode also seemed like an economic arrangement that only the most moneyed labels could afford. “Discovery Mode is very insidious in that it doesn’t matter whether you do it or not, you’re affected by it,” one indie label employee told me. “If all of your competitors are using Discovery Mode and you’re not, your share is going to go down.”Three years after the launch of Discovery Mode’s pilot version, an employee reflected on Slack about what its architects had accomplished: “It’s amazing to look back on our progress.”The disingenuous promotional material emphasised how this program was all aboutwhat the artist wanted to promote. But by the end of 2023, that was in question, as Spotify introduced “Pre-Campaign Insights” or PCI, an algorithm that would tell an artist or label which tracks were most likely to stream well in a Discovery Mode campaign. It was rolled out for “managed service” Discovery Mode customers, as opposed to “self-service” customers – advertising industry terminology referring to whether a customer has a point-of-contact managing their campaign. For those eligible, the company claimed that the PCI algorithm would recommend, with roughly 85% accuracy, tracks “predicted to see a lift in streams” from a Discovery Mode campaign.One independent record label manager said she had tried Discovery Mode campaigns for different artists on her indie rock label, but it was only the “folk-leaning artists” for whom it was most effective. “It serves passive listeners,” she told me. She reflected on how frustrating it was that opting into Discovery Mode actually did lead to increased streams for her artists; the fact that someone would hear a promoted track and not know that it was promoted raised ethical concerns. “This, unfortunately, is the way that the future looks for us. And we have zero control over it.”Another independent label manager noted that despite seeing results from Discovery Mode, he was not sure yet what their royalty statements would look like. “It’s this vicious cycle where we’re losing revenue because of streaming. And then streaming is pushing these weird opportunities on us. And we need to take them in order to make up for that lost revenue. It sadly is so desperate, because the industry changes so consistently and we are constantly thinking of ways to keep up.”Discovery Mode wasn’t Spotify’s first go at paid promo. Since 2019, it had been trying to get artists to pay for pop-up ads called “Marquees”, which cost 50 cents per click, or 55 cents if the artist wanted to target “lapsed, casual, or recently interested listeners”. An artist set a dollar amount for the campaign, which would then run for 10 days, or until the budget was spent. “Our distributor said, don’t use this, you are going to lose money,” one of the independent label managers told me. In 2023, Spotify introduced another, similar ad product called “Showcase”, a sponsored shelf that sat on the home page; those cost 40 cents per click, and lasted 14 days.Later that year, Spotify launched an initiative called Campaign Kit, its attempt to get artists to not just purchase Marquee ads, Showcase shelves, or to trade royalties for algorithmic promotion, but to convince them that all of these tools worked best when purchased together. The last component of the kit was Spotify’s tool for submitting tracks for editorial playlist consideration.

But these ambitions to monetise musicians were seriously concerning to many. The Artist Rights Alliance, ina Rolling Stone op-edpublished in April 2021, called Discovery Mode “payola” as well as “exploitative”, “unfair”, and a “money grab”, noting the potential for the royalty cut to be “so steep that working artists and independent labels cannot even afford to pay it, clearing the field for major record labels and pop megastars to swallow up even more of the streaming pie”. The group wrote that the biggest losers would be “working artists, independent labels, and above all music fans looking to expand and diversify their listening.”In June 2021, the United States House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek, warning that the feature could establish a “race to the bottom” where artists feel required to accept lower royalties in order to be heard. The letter asserted that “at a time when the global pandemic has devastated incomes for musicians and other performers, without a clear path back to pre-pandemic levels, any plan that could ultimately lead to further cut pay for working artists and ultimately potentially less consumer choice raises significant policy issues”.View image in fullscreenDaniel Ek, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spotify, hosts a “Now Playing” creator day at the company’s Los Angeles campus.Photograph: Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images for SpotifyThe authors of the House Judiciary letter outlined a series of questions directly for Daniel Ek: Would the pilot become permanent? What safeguards would protect artists from Discovery Mode boosts potentially cancelling each other out? How would the “promotional” royalty rate be calculated and would it be the same for everyone? How could artists and labels measure the success of the program on their streams? And how would royalties be returned to artists if participating failed to increase streams?Shortly after the Artist Rights Alliance op-ed was published, a staff member shared it in a Slack channel called “ethics-club”, where a group of Spotify employees would debate ethical issues of the streaming business. Some of these employees quickly agreed with the alliance’s assertion that Discovery Mode was payola-like. One said that the article nicely summed up his “raised eyebrows” from the meeting where he first learned about the program. “Controlling more of the listening experience via programming pretty clearly benefits us more than anybody else,” a different employee wrote. “That’s exactly why we have goals to increase programmed share.”“This isn’t just like selling a banner ad somewhere. The boosted plays come at the cost of other artists,” said another. “And as the article correctly notes, the degenerate case is that artists stop benefitting at all from paying us.”View image in fullscreenThe cover of Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist.Photograph: HodderEven Spotify’s own employees could see that Discovery Mode was a deceptive practice as they debated the general lack of transparency, and the blurred boundaries between pay-for-play and “marketplace”.According to Kevin Erickson, director of the Future of Music Coalition, there are important distinctions between payola on radio and what may appear to be its contemporary online equivalent. Payola has gone underground with radio, but comparable practices online are happening out in the open. Musicians are not paid at all when they’re played on US AM or FM radio, so there isn’t the same sort of commercial incentive to use payola. “There’s this whole other category of harm that happens on the digital side,” said Erickson.In his view, many of the issues artists face in the streaming era, including what has been characterised as digital payola, are antitrust issues that both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the power to take on as unfair methods of competition (because they suppress wages and contribute to an anticompetitive market) and as deceptive practices (because people don’t know whether they’re listening to a song due to a curated recommendation or a business relationship). In addition, Erickson noted, the FTC could also contribute to a more equitable streaming landscape by investigating the major record label contracts that are currently locked up by NDAs – as well as any contracts digital service providers hold with aggregators and stock music providers.As he puts it: “Unaccountable power is the problem wherever it pops up. It’s not about any particular technology. It’s concentrated, unaccountable private power.”In response to points raised in this article, a Spotify spokesperson disputed the characterisation of Discovery Mode as the contemporary equivalent of payola. While users cannot see which individual songs are part of Discovery Mode, the “about recommendations” link in algorithmically generated playlists discloses factors that may have influenced the tracklisting. Spotify disputes the accuracy of views shared by employees in some internal messages featured in this chapter. According to the company, these internal messages “appear to be largely from former employees who were chatting with each other about their views on different company matters, including matters that they may not have been working on or even have direct knowledge of”. The company adds: “We have a culture where employees are free to share their views even when they have concerns or constructive criticism.” They also dispute the claim that Discovery Mode is anticompetitive. The company would not comment on whether the Discovery Mode profits were accurate.This article is an edited extract from Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly, available now in the US from Atria/One Signal, and published in the UK on 13 March (Hodder & Stoughton, £22).

I stared at it for a long time, possibly without drawing breath. Martin and I grew up living next door to each other. He now lives in Australia. It was from there that he sent me a screenshot ofGoogleMaps’ Street View, showing what had been our homes. Side by side, just bricks and mortar obviously, but teeming with meaning for both of us. That wasn’t the thing though. The thing was that in a corner of the photo stood a familiar figure in a red jumper. My dad.He died this time last year. And yet here he was, standing under the tree next to his car. I felt a lot of things very strongly all at the same time: love, surprise, upset, amusement, anger, pleasure and other things. This was a month ago, but it’s on my mind again this week as it would have been his 87th birthday. And I’m still no nearer computing what I feel about the image being there, available to all, on what my dad always referred to as “the net”.My first thought was just, well, wow, I suppose. This was followed by annoyance: who gave Google permission to help itself to close-range images of most of our world, without checking if it was OK with us? Is this a literal manifestation of what’s known as surveillance capitalism? Either way, how dare they? It’s far more intimate an image than it feels appropriate for Google to share but, conversely, worse somehow for the fact that his face is so blurred. Too personal yet, at the same time, too impersonal.It also feels more intrusive for being taken a while back; we got rid of that car five years ago. It’s a small Vauxhall estate – an unremarkable vehicle, which I’d forgotten about until now, when a memory came to me, in a nice way, of how he once described it as: “not a crumpet-catcher, obviously. But gets me about.” Please forgive the unreconstructed language there. He was a) joking and b) well into his 80s. Either way, I’m smiling. So Google’s winning. Surveillance capitalism, 1; me, nil.At the moment Google’s spies happened to crawl by, my mum was nowhere to be seenI also smiled, as I’m sure he would, to see that it’s him pictured busy doing a chore, rather than my mum. As much as she never stops doing jobs, my dad rarely started one if he could help it. “I am,” he once admitted to me, “inclined to laziness.” But here he is, hard at work, while my mum at that moment is almost certainly nearby sweeping, planting, tidying, cooking, cleaning or whatever. But at the moment Google’s spies happened to crawl by, she was nowhere to be seen. For eternity, as far as “the net” is concerned, he is the industrious one. The injustice of it. He’d be tickled pink.Why am I so sad about seeing a robot get beaten up? | Adrian ChilesRead moreI’ve enjoyed thinking these things so, in the end, I can’t say I’m unhappy the image exists. After all, I’ve a thousand photographs I could look at to take me to similar places in my mind, but access to them is limited to me, my family and friends. None of them are out there for all to see unless we decide it should be so. But, even with our own photo collections, there is something we’re losing control of: when and where we choose to view them. MyiPhone, unbidden, treats me every day to a slideshow of people, places and moments of its choosing.Most of these people, places and moments I’m happy to be reminded of; others, not so much. Some memories I don’t want stirred, others are so precious and moving that I can’t deal with them assailing me out of the blue when I’m doing something else. To be fair, there’s probably a way of disabling this feature, but I can’t quite bring myself to do so. So, thanks for the memories,Apple, even if I don’t recall asking you to choose them for me.Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Further, in the coming weeks and months, I and other progressives will be holding grassroots events from coast to coast.Why, at this moment, are we doing town meetings around the country – especially in conservative areas? The answer is obvious.Trumpismwillnotbe defeated by politicians inside the DC beltway. It will only be defeated by millions of Americans, in every state in this country, coming together in a strong, grassroots movement which saysnoto oligarchy,noto authoritarianism,noto kleptocracy,noto massive cuts in programs that working people desperately need,noto huge tax breaks for the richest people in our country. And that’s what these events are about.Further, there are a number of congressional districts whereRepublicanswon by only a small number of votes. With the Republican party in the House having only a three-vote majority we can defeat draconian, anti-working-class legislation if just two Republican members of Congress voteno. And they will votenoif we rally their constituents to demand that they voteno.What Trump didn’t say in his inauguration speech | Bernie SandersRead moreCan Trumpism be defeated? Absolutely! But, if we’re going to make that happen, we need to know exactly what we’re up against and how we can best go forward. Here’s just some of what we need to know:Trumpism has an unlimited amount of money to throw into its efforts.Elon Musk, the wealthiest man on earth, put more than $270m into Trump’s campaign, a tiny portion of his fortune. Other multibillionaires will join Musk in spending whatever it takes.Trumpism has significant control over large parts of the media from which millions of Americans get their information. Fox and Musk’s platform X, among others, are not normal media outlets. Their basic function is not to cover the “news” but to spread rightwing extremist ideology.Trumpism is utilizing the concept of the “big lie” in a way that has never, in this country, been seen. Day after day, blatantly dishonest statements and conspiracy theories are propagated – and repeated over and over and over again.Trumpism does not believe in democracy or the rule of law.Trump recently posted: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” In other words, Trump believes that he can do anything he wants for any reason. He can ignore Congress or the courts. He is above the law.But, while Trump consolidates power into his own hands, there is another reality going on.Today, 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck; millions are earning starvation wages; 85 million are uninsured or under-insured; young people are unable to afford the cost of college; 25% of seniors live on $15,000 a year or less; we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, and we have a major shortage in low-income and affordable housing.Oh, and by the way, we’re losing the struggle against the climate crisis – an existential threat to the future of the planet.And here’s the kicker. While Trump moves us away from democracy, while the middle class continues to decline, the wealthiest people in the country have never ever had it so good. Today, the three major oligarchs, Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, are worth $905bn – that is more wealth than the bottom half of American society – 170 million people. And, incredibly, since Trump’s election their wealth has grown by $217bn.Our struggle, the American people’s struggle, is to protect democracy and the rule of law. Equally important, we must end oligarchy and create an economy that works for all, not just the few. We are the wealthiest country on earth and AI, robotics and other new technologies will only make our country wealthier. It is absurd, unjust and inhumane that virtually all of that new wealth being created goes to the people who need it the least.While Trump now “floods the zone” and occupies most of the political oxygen, it is imperative that we never lose sight of the progressive vision – a nation and world based on human cooperation and compassion, not greed and a “survival of the fittest” mentality. What we are fighting for is not “utopian”, or unachievable. Much of it already exists in other countries, and poll after poll shows that it is exactly what the American people want.In the richest country in the history of the world we must establish that:Healthcare is a human right and must be available to all regardless of income.Every worker in America is entitled to earn a decent income. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage and make it easier for workers to join unions.We must have the best public educational system in the world, from childcare to vocational training, to graduate school – available to all.We must address the housing crisis and build the millions of units of low-income and affordable housing that we desperately need.We must create millions of good paying jobs as we lead the world in combating the existential threat of climate change.We must abolish all forms of bigotry.Not only must we continue to fight for a nation based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice, we must also lead the effort against Trump‘s reactionary legislative agenda.In the coming weeks the Republicans in Congress will be bringing forward a major piece of legislation, a “reconciliation” bill, that encapsulates the value system of greed and their obedience to oligarchy. It is the economic essence of Trumpism.At a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, this legislation will provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the richest people in our country. It will make the rich even richer. At a time when the working class of this country is struggling to put food on the table and pay for housing, this legislation will make savage cuts to Medicaid, housing, nutrition, education and other basic needs. It will make the poor even poorer.We cannot allow this to happen. This legislation is enormously unpopular. It is exactly what the American people donotwant. It must not be passed by Congress.It must be defeated and wecandefeat it.This is a perilous moment in American history. Let us go forward together.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and chair of the health education labor and pensions committee.

But it has already changed the face of Israeli politicsYair WallachThe US president’s support for forcibly relocating Palestinians has laid the ground for Netanyahu’s ultimate fantasyWed 19 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 05.29 ESTShareWhen President Donald Trumpissued an ultimatumto Hamas last week to release all hostages by noon on 15 February, warning that otherwise “all hell [will] break loose”, the Israeli right was ecstatic. Here was a chance to finally move ahead with the complete occupation and annihilation of the Gaza Strip. The families of Israeli hostages were petrified about the prospect of the ceasefire collapsing, yet members of the ruling coalitioncalled to kill the deal. “We have international support, give the order!”demanded the Israeli finance minister, BezalelSmotrich.But the order never came. Hamas abided by the agreement and freed three hostages; Israel then released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump shrugged and said that it was Israel’s decision. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, who visited Israel on Sunday, signalled that the direction of travel is not towards resuming hostility. Instead, the parties must now move to “substantive” negotiations over the second phase of the ceasefire,he said, leading to peace.In the whirlwind of the last four weeks, it is difficult to make sense of Trump’s approach to the Gaza Strip. On the one hand, the president is widely credited for pushing the parties to a ceasefire agreement, raising hopes among Israelis who want to see a return of the hostages and an end to the war. On the other, Trump embraced the hard-right Israeli vision of ethnically cleansing Gaza, through a forced “relocation” of its 2.2 million Palestinian residents, establishing a US real estate development that would turn the Strip into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.Some suspect this is merely a negotiation ploy that he hopes will pressure Arab states to take responsibility over Gaza, and to force Hamas into relinquishing control and influence. Even if this were the case, Trump’s rhetoric has already damaged international law. For the first time in many decades, the US has publicly proposed the forced displacement of millions of people as a geopolitical solution. As the genocide scholar Dirk Mosesrecently observed, this may mark the end of the postwar order, which defined such “transfers” of populations as war crimes that were banned by the Geneva conventions. While episodes of forced mass displacement have taken place in the second half of the 20th century, such as those in Yugoslavia or in Syria,these were never endorsed or championed by the White House.Trump’s plan for Gaza leaves Arab nations facing an impossible choice | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe legitimisation of ethnic cleansing could have a lasting impact in Palestine,Israeland beyond. Palestine’s history is instructive: in 1937, the Palestine Royal Commission administered by Britain proposed the forced displacement of over 200,000 Palestinians from the Galilee as part of its partition plan. Mainstream Zionist leaders had long ruled out transfers on this scale as unrealistic. But British backing for this idea gave it legitimacy. David Ben-Gurion, then the leader of the Jewish community in British-ruled Palestine, wrote in his diary: “This is a possibility we did not dream of; that we could not dream of in our wildest imagination.”Ben-Gurion understood that the details of the partition plan mattered far less than the principle of forced mass displacement. In the aftermath of the second world war, “population exchanges” were explicitly or tacitly accepted by the great powers as a necessary evil. Eleven years after the royal commission, Ben-Gurion oversaw the permanent expulsion and dispossession of two-thirds of Palestinians, inthe Nakbaof 1948.We can already see the effect of Trump’s rhetoric on Israeli society. Since October 2023, rightwing ministers and political activistshave been calling for a euphemistic “voluntary emigration” of Palestinians from Gaza, and yet Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, had sought to keep a safe distance from such ideas. The idea of forced displacement was broadly considered so beyond the pale that mainstream pollsters did not even pose the question in their Israeli public opinion surveys.Yet shortly after his return from Washington DC, a gleeful Netanyahu lauded Trump’s “revolutionary vision for the day after Hamas”. “We see eye-to-eye with the US administration on … all our war goals”, he told the Knesset. The political commentator and radio host Amit Segal, who has been accused of serving asNetanyahu’s mouthpiece, quoted the Psalms verse: “We were like them that dream.” The verse refers to the return of Jews to Zion; now it was being used to celebrate the looming expulsion of Palestinians from the country.Strikingly, most centrist Israeli parties welcomed the plan. The former defence minister Benny Gantzcommended Trumpfor his “creative, original and interesting thinking”. An opinion poll found that no less than82% of Jewish Israelissupported the plan in principle; 52% thought it was feasible. Only 3% of Israeli Jews rejected the plan as “unacceptable and immoral”.Yet even if many Israelis favourably view the fantasy plan of a depopulated Gaza, there’s no appetite for the total war that would be required to materialise that plan. Opinion polls showed that Israelis areresolutely opposedto an immediate return to hostilities. After 16 months of war, there is widespread fatigue. Themalnourished conditionof the hostages that returned most recently, and the reports of torture they faced, was deeply alarming. Two-thirds of Israelis believe the ceasefire agreement should be upheld, and the safe return of the hostages should take priority.We can expect further ultimatums and confusion for the foreseeable future. Even if an immediate return to war has been averted, the risk of one is greater than ever. Trump has let the genie of mass expulsion out of the bottle. The ethnic cleansing ofGazawould require carnage and atrocities even beyond the horrifying scale of the last 17 months. Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan are unlikely to survive, and the reverberations would be felt throughout the region. This is a scenario that would not only mean the likely death of the hostages, but an increasingly theocratic Jewish republic premised upon destruction and conquest. If Israel heads down this route, it will not only be destroying Palestinians in Gaza, but condemning itself to an ever escalating war.Yair Wallach is a reader in Israeli studies and head of the Centre for Jewish Studies at Soas University of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In 2021, the world watched theGerman electionsto see who would succeed the EU’s uncrowned “queen”. Angela Merkel had become a symbol of liberal democracy in the era marked by the first Trump administration. In Germany, two colourless figures explicitly vied to replace her. Deep down everyone knew that German leadership in Europe was coming to an end. But no one could have foreseen how steep the fall would be.Today, Germany is a country struggling with itself, increasingly sidelined in Europe and the world. The second Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 largely destroyed Merkel’s rosy legacy, exposing her opportunisticallysoft approachto authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Under Merkel’s Social Democratic party (SPD) successor, Olaf Scholz, the country has become as pale and uninspiring as the chancellor himself.Sunday’s general election will not fundamentally change this. The outcome is predictable, in a way we have seen play out for years across Europe. Just as inSweden in 2022, in theNetherlands in 2023and in theEuropean electionslast year, the key issues of the campaign are immigration and the role of the far right. And just as in those cases, and many before them, this means that a far-right party, this time the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), will do very well.Unlike in Sweden and the Netherlands, however, the election will not usher the far right into power, even if the AfD continues to pull both major parties to the right, particularly on issues such as immigration. The main reason for the continued cordon sanitaire that keeps it out of power in Germany is no longer the country’s specific history, but the specific extremism of its far right. Unlike most other relevant far-right parties in Europe, the AfD isborderline extreme right, ie anti-democratic per se, despite its radical right front and the open support lent it by theUS vice-president, JD Vance.Although the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),Friedrich Merz, is presenting himself as the anti Scholz, he will probably end up as “insecure, weak, hesitant and timid” in government as he once described Scholz. According tocurrent polls, Merz’s rightwing CDU-CSU bloc has been trending downward but will get about 30% of the vote, still well ahead of the far-right AfD at about 20%. However, with the far right excluded, Merz will need the support of not just the SPD but probably also the Greens to govern – although three other parties hover around the 5% threshold, which could affect the seat allocation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are we too frozen with fear to name it? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreLeaving aside the fact that enthusiasm for a “grand coalition” of the CDU and Social Democrats, with or without the Greens, will be low in both major parties, this new government will have to take on a sluggish economy,expected to contractfor the third year in a row, in addition to a slew of other issues on which the parties are divided (such as the climate crisis and immigration). This will ensure that as Europe faces its biggest challenge in decades, Germany, the EU’s biggest power, will continue to be mainly inward focused.Though Merz will not be the new Merkel, he will bring Germany back to the centre of power in the EU, which is held by the rightwing European People’s party (EPP), of which the CDU is a leading member. The chancellor-in-waiting has alreadyendorsed his compatriotManfred Weber for a second term as EPP leader, after the latter rallied his European allies in a show of support for Merz last month. While more a marriage of convenience than love, it will realign Merz (though not necessarily his whole government) with the main power bloc in Brussels, as well as with the EU’s rising power broker in the east, Poland’s Donald Tusk.All of this will do little to help Europe develop the energy and unity it needs to take on Putin’s Russia and Trump’s US, though. Merz might be more supportive of increasing Europe’s military capacity and less skittish about military support for Ukraine, but his pledge to revitalise the German economy by introducing€100bn in spending cutswill make it even harder to find the money (and support) for significant investments in the German (and Ukrainian) military.In short, for all his campaign bluster, Merz is much more likely to govern like Scholz than like Merkel.Europewill continue to look for leadership as it attempts to navigate an increasingly hostile world where authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia are emboldened and its former ally, the US, has become an adversary.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author ofThe Far Right TodayExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionThe far rightEuropeOlaf ScholzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)commentShareReuse this content"

Welcome to the weird economy of 2025.In this crazy world where we have an authoritarian in the White House who wants to be friends with Russia – and enemies with Canada – it is good to occasionally realise that what is happening has not always been happening.It is also worth realising that, right now, we are experiencing something good in the economy that no one under 55 years of age has ever known.‘Teaching to an empty hall’: is the changing face of universities eroding standards of learning?Read moreIn December the unemployment rate was 4.0%. It’s easy to forget given unemployment has now been 4.0% or lower for 31 out of the past 39 months that this is unusual. But in the 564 months before February 2022, it had happened just twice.But that is not the really weird thing.In December, inflation was 2.4%, which is in the lower half of the RBA’s target range of 2% to 3%. That in itself is not unusual. But to find the last time unemployment was at 4.0% or lowerandinflation was below 2.5% we have to go all the way back to December 1970:If the graph does not display click hereAnd here’s the even weirder thing. This historically good unemployment and inflation is happening at the same time the Reserve Bank is cutting rates because, among other things, the economy is expected to slow.In November, the RBA thoughtAustralia’s economy in June this year would be growing at a pitiful 2.3%;now it expectsit to be a putrid 2.0%.If the graph does not display click hereTo make things even more weird, despite also expecting household consumption growth to be worse than it expected back in November, the RBA now expects unemployment to rise to just 4.2% not 4.5%.Weird times and, just to make things even more strange, while all this happening wage growth is slowing.This is not supposed to be happening.Very smart economists (including those at the RBA) told us that 4.5% was the lowest unemployment could go before wage growth and then inflation would start to accelerate.Sorry, but it’s time to update your models because unemployment is 4.0% and the latestwage growth figures out yesterdayshow that it has slowed from 3.5% to 3.2%. In the private sector, wage growth went from 3.5% to 3.3%. For public-sector workers the drop is even more stark – from 3.7% to 2.8%. So much for the narrative of greedy public servants …If the graph does not display click hereBut what we are seeing is not totally unprecedented.Rather than go back to the trend that occurred before 2012, where unemployment of 4.0% would normally mean wages were growing at about 4.0% each year, we seem headed back to the pre-pandemic years of 2016-2020 when wages grew more slowly than expected:If the graph does not display click hereAt least we are back to a situation where wages are growing faster than prices. Unfortunately anyone with a mortgage is probably not feeling as if they have more to spend than they did a year ago because,as I noted a couple weeks ago, inflation does not count mortgage repayments.The employee cost-of-living index, which does count mortgages, rose 4.0% in 2024 – faster than wages:If the graph does not display click hereSo while real wages are now growing when using the official CPI figure, when we include mortgage repayments, wages are still worse than they were a year ago:If the graph does not display click hereThe good news is that things have started to improve and with Tuesday’s decision to cut interest rates those with mortgages will soon be able to buy more things with what they earn.But the way back is long.This, of course, is something the opposition has been focusing on. While the current picture is good, they don’t want you to forget what you have experienced over the past two years (and to be honest I doubt you need much reminding).If the graph does not display click hereWhen taking into account mortgage repayments, the average wage is still about 8.5% lower than it was in September 2021. For someone who was on $90,000, that is equivalent to losing about $7,687 in purchasing power.It’s hard to sell the idea that we have turned a corner when that is the reality.Even if we just use the CPI measure, things are not that much better. Yes, real wages are rising but they are still only back to where they were 13 years ago:If the graph does not display click hereImagine being told in 2011 you would get the average wage rise for 13 years and yet you would still only be able to buy the same amount of stuff as you could then.That’s not a happy picture.The good news is that in the past six months wages have grown 1% faster than overall prices. Normally that would be a situation where the Reserve Bank is freaking out and thinking it needs to slam on the brakes. And yet rates have been cut, and really no one was at all shocked, and only the most arch conservative economists disagree.We live in weird times and, while there is long path back to recovering all our lost living standards, at least now we can walk along that path with some hope that the worst is behind us.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsUnemploymentReserve Bank of AustraliaCost of living crisisWages growthEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Much of the rough and tumble and backstabbing – Rupert essentially pitting James against the older Lachlan, in a fight that continually vexed him because his favourite (Lachlan) never won – has existed in the public domain for years as rumour. Much of it has been proved or demonstrated within reason, either by biographers – Michael Wolff in particular – or by events, culminating inRupert and Lachlan’s legal caseto secure Lachlan’s hold on the Murdoch family trust, against the other siblings, James, Liz and Prue, at the end of last year, which Rupert lost.Yet none of those machinations, spanning decades, could really encompass the sheer unbridled nastiness of this family. James describes a meeting with Rupert’s lawyer, Rupert himself sitting at the table, feigning a lack of interest. A series of questions directed to James – “Have you ever done anything successful on your own?”; “Why were you too busy to say ‘Happy Birthday’ to your father when he turned 90?” – are so loaded and needling it’s hard to imagine them emitting from any kind of professional. James recounts thinking his father was distracted, playing on his phone, only to realise that he was actually texting these questions to the lawyer.A family counselling retreat in Australia in 2010, which resulted in a “family constitution”, conceived in bad faith, leaked to Vanity Fair, and containing the immortal edict “relentlessly communicate openly, with trust and humility”, is perhaps the most strikingly manipulative act. James came to believe he had been set up, that all his other siblings were pitted against him. History can’t yet determine whether that’s true, but without question, at least one person borrowed the language and conventions of deep psychoanalytical exploration – the vulnerability and openness, the generosity and will to change – for the purposes of absolutely bilking their own flesh and blood, which is a special kind of mendacity. I live to resist the kneejerk characterisation of billionaires as exceptional just because they insist they are, but I have to admit: these billionaires are exceptionally horrible.Another of those codes saw all the Murdochs signed up to be “vigilant of and defend against divisiveness, either between us orthat which could infiltrate from without”(my italics). That’s what makes James’s latest interview so novel – previously he was held back by a sort of therapy-speak NDA. Which he should have clocked, to be honest – nobody telling you the truth says “that which could infiltrate from without” when they mean “outsiders”.View image in fullscreenBrian Cox as the media mogul Logan Roy and Jeremy Strong as his son Kendall in Jesse Armstrong’s Succession.Photograph: HBOIf the Murdochs weren’t rich, we wouldn’t know half of this, as they’d never have ended up fighting one another in court in Reno; or fighting the assorted forces of British law in the hacking scandal; or the US defamation suitsin the Dominion case(payout: three-quarters of a billion dollars) and theSmartmatic case, both of which centre on Fox News spreading conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was rigged.If they weren’t rich, we wouldn’t know the other half, as nobody would be interested enough to give James a platform for his grievances. One other obvious rider: without Succession, the media mogul drama that every Murdoch member swears someone else is briefing, yet whose details the creator Jesse Armstrong swears he just got from press cuttings, some of us still wouldn’t be interested, however rich they were, and however much dirty laundry got done in public.But this isn’t a story about a watching public slavering over the lives, lifestyles, loves and hatreds of the super-rich; everything about it is political.Michael Wolff told me once, after 50 hours of one-to-one interviews with Rupert Murdoch, and a fresh instalment on the family,The Fall: “I’m not particularly interested in politics. I think that the real issues are about people’s personal motivations.” It irritated the hell out of me; would that any of us could afford to be uninterested in the politics that Rupert Murdoch has created.‘Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies’: Murdoch biography stokes succession rumorsRead moreLachlan reportedly came to be thought of as the chosen heir because his politics mirrored those of his father, while James, Liz and Prue were all dismayed by his increasingly hardline conservatism, particularly with regard to the climate crisis. However, this makes it sound like a classic family row, and cannot begin to describe the evolution of Rupert’s politics, how he’s been transformed by cupidity and mindless ratings-chasing from a centre-right, newspaperman sensibility to bankrolling conspiracist, racist drivel. Fox News slid to the right faster, basically, than Rupert’s conscience or intellect could rouse themselves.We may have had a ringside seat over here on Murdoch senior’s droning xenophobia, with the Sun splashing on fear of migrants reflexively in the absence of other news, like an out-of-office auto reply, but I think we would have been astonished, certainly before 2016, to see the openly white supremacist “great replacement theory”, evangelised by Tucker Carlson on Fox, in any British tabloid. Rupert, who always loathed Donald Trump, created in Fox News both ideas-machine and propagandist for Trump’s victory. And for what? More money, more power, to wield over the junior Murdochs, set them against one another, and make everyone miserable.So maybe Wolff was right, maybe the politics of the Murdochs aren’t interesting, being as they are pretty bland, in James, Liz and Prue’s case, and all over the place, in Rupert and Lachlan’s. We do, unfortunately, have to live in the Murdochs’ politics, and the fact that they are also personally miserable – well, if it’s a consolation, it’s very small and vanishingly brief.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Thanks to migration – which proves xenophobia doesn’t payMaría RamírezWith Spanish GDP growth leading Europe last year, diversity is making us richer – not only financially but culturally, tooWed 19 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 08.30 ESTShareThe world’s fastest growing major advanced economy last year was most likely Spain. According to preliminary official data for 2024, Spain’s GDPgrew by 3.2%,almost five timesthe eurozone average and more than the US, which did pretty well too. In December,the Economistranked Spain first among 37 mostly wealthy countries based on five indicators: GDP, stock market performance, core inflation, unemployment and government deficits. Forecasts for 2025look good.Why is Spain doing so well? One key reason is immigration. Recentpopulation flows, particularly but not only from Colombia, Venezuela and other Latin American countries, as well as Morocco, have boosted domestic demand and rejuvenated the workforce. According to the main labour national survey,nearly 90%of new jobs were filled by workers of foreign origin or dual nationality. Unemployment is at itslowest levelsince 2007.Spain’s growth is driven by a wide range of factors: a booming tourism industry, public investmentsupported bythe EU’s pandemic recovery funds,rising services and industrial exportsto the European single market and beyond (especially since 2021), the growth of financial and technology businesses, and low energy costs thanks to Spain’s expansion of renewables. Some of the labour reforms enacted by the centre-left coalition government have also put more money into low-income consumers’ pockets – notably, the steady increase in the minimum wage, which has risenmore than 50%since the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, took office in 2018.While the weight of each of these factors remains debated, migration is still the most frequently cited reason for Spain’s strong performance and perhaps its most distinctive advantage compared with other countries. Immigration has also visibly changed Spain in recent years, particularly in major cities. Madrid, for instance, now hasmore than 1 million residentsfrom Latin America – up from just 80,000 only 25 years ago.Anecdotal evidence shows this transformation. In my own neighbourhood in central Madrid, the most popular bookstore is run by twoArgentinian journalists; thecool artisan bakerythat keeps expanding was co-founded by a Hungarian woman who moved her business from Budapest. A Latin American evangelical church rents an old adult cinema for its worship and gatherings; a traditional Spanish pastry shop has started selling Venezuelan delicacies next to the long queue that forms every other day outside the consulate. Not far away, a large sign supports the party of the Argentinian president, Javier Milei (with graffiti from his detractors scrawled across it).Not all the economic data tells a rosy story. Spain still struggles withlow productivity, an overreliance on thepublic sectorand low wages (GDP per capita has not grown as much as GDP), even if it hasimproved in these measurestoo. Tourism, while a driving force for the economy, has exacerbated housing shortages and fuelled a backlash against visitors, short-term rental platforms and investment funds pushing locals out of the city centres.Immigration has added to the pressure on affordable housing, with demand outpacing supply as the population grows.Some politiciansblame rich Venezuelan and Colombian buyers for the rising prices in the most expensive neighbourhoods of Madrid. And poorer immigrants, particularly those from north African countries, continue to facediscriminationandexploitationby unscrupulous and criminal employers or landlords. Meanwhile, regional and national politicians are often locked in disputes overhousing migrant minorswho have arrived in Spain alone.Yet despite these challenges, being a richer country, in cash terms and in diversity, is an enviable position inEurope, especially when Spain is compared to struggling economies like those of Germany and Britain.Stormier times may lie ahead. Some European neighbours remain economically weak, and global demand could shrink if Donald Trump launches a transatlantic trade war. If a crisis of the scale of the 2008 crash were to recur, immigrants could return to their countries of origin, leavingSpainwith an ageing population and a dwindling workforce to support pensions and public services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Jamie Lloyd’s 1990s clubland twist on Shakespeare, the ushers are doing it before the curtain has even gone up. It is a sign of things to come, along with the throwback soundtrack and the giddy swirl of disco lights.Taylor Dayne’s Tell It to My Heart kicks off proceedings and a shower of pink confetti rains down. This is a thoroughly weird and absolutely wonderful re-conceptualisation, turning Shakespeare’s comedy, which narrowly swerves tragedy, into an old school house party cum modern romcom.More musical than play, the interludes of song and dance are sometimes abrupt – from Beastie Boys to Deee-Lite and Backstreet Boys. The dated sound might be a nod to the play’s older couple, Beatrice and Benedick, played by Hayley Atwell andTom Hiddleston, who are veteran singletons before being tricked into admitting their love for each other.Hiddleston and Atwell have a sparring chemistry that is as bright as the modern-day costumes (all pink spangles, gold shimmer and sequins). You can virtually see the sparks coming off them in their “merry war”, which is fuelled by antagonistic duelling but dips suddenly to earnestness and intensity.Every other element works alongside them, with the drink (and drug?) addled hedonism on stage not compromising Shakespeare’s verse.View image in fullscreenNever losing her power … Mara Huf as Hero in Much Ado About Nothing.Photograph: Marc BrennerMost of the cast here worked on Lloyd’s previous West End show,The Tempest, including Mara Huf and James Phoon, who again play a couple in love as Hero and Claudio, along with a fey Tim Steed as Don John, and several others. That show met with mostly negative reviews. This seems like The Tempest’s revenge in its determined infectiousness – genuinely funny, romantic and trimmed of the laboured subplot involving tiresome Dogberry.It has the same creative team too in set designer, Soutra Gilmour (bringing similarly dark depths around the stage), lighting by Jon Clark (disco lights galore) and sound by Ben and Max Ringham. Movement director, Fabian Aloise, creates lovably cheesy dance routines and the overall effect combines into hallucinatory revelry.Mason Alexander Park, who stole the show as a lugubrious Ariel in The Tempest, plays Hero’s attendant, Margaret, but they are key to the soundtrack of the play with their gorgeous intermittent singing.The masquerade ball features plushy headdresses (from Tweety Pie to a mini-octopus); they are silly and humorous but return through the production to look more disturbingly psychedelic – like an acid trip gone wrong.The switch from light to dark, when Hero is falsely accused of unfaithfulness on her wedding day by Claudio, is orchestrated with a masterful precision of tone. It brings dangerous anger, and where the scene ordinarily shows up the play’s dated gender politics – a man questioning the virtue of a woman and condemning her to metaphoric death – Hero never loses her power and the couple’s reunion seems genuine and joyful.View image in fullscreenKey to the soundtrack … Mason Alexander Park.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe visible mechanics of the stage – from lights to bare back wall and a row of chairs for actors to sit when they are not performing – are customary features in Lloyd’s shows, but there is something magical in it here: they come downstage to perform notatus buttous, making eye contact, pointing at us individually as they speak of love and attraction.There is a meta moment too, in Beatrice and Benedick’s romance when they meet cardboard cut-outs of each other’s Marvel superheroes (both have starred in the Hollywood franchise). Benedick worships at the cardboard altar of Atwell’s Captain Carter while Beatrice dances suggestively with Hiddleston’sLoki.The latter is certainly god of mischief here, pulling off difficult physical comedy involving confetti in the eavesdropping scene when he is tricked into his romance, and pulling out some nifty dance moves (Atwell pulls out her own, too). Both wink and flirt with the audience without deviating from Shakespeare’s text “I am loved of all ladies,” says Hiddleston and the auditorium roars in confirmation.Lloyd himself seems like the god of mischief in constructing this party of pink silliness. You would have to be a god of stone to not be seduced by its wacky winter joy. A wonderfully giddy thing indeed, and that is my conclusion.AtTheatre Royal Drury Lane, London, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreMuch Ado About NothingJamie LloydTom HiddlestonHayley AtwellreviewsShareReuse this content"

But check the schedules and you’ll notice there are only three episodes of Modern Life Is Goodish. What happened? The answer lies in the sort of low-key calamity that feels veryDave Gorman.“We made four,” the comedian explains. “But one of them is 75% about Gregg Wallace. It’s in the bin.” This lost, cursed Goodish episode was filmed and finished just as news broke that Wallace, a presenter on BBC1’s hit cookery show MasterChef, was the subject of multipleaccusations of inappropriate behaviour– which he has denied – instantly cancelling the cult hero status Goodish was drawing on. “It’s sort of taking the piss out of him but in a very loving way, tongue in cheek,” says Gorman. “There’s a routine that sets up the idea that I’ve invented a product. I need to get a celebrity endorsement for it. The punchline tying all the routines together is that he’s filmed an advert for it.”Frantic meetings were held to try to salvage the episode by removing all mentions of Wallace, but the task was hopeless. “It’s a structured piece with a flow to it. Every routine connects to every other routine.” He can’t resist a joke: “What I’m saying is: I’m the real victim.”I get angry tweets from people who think they have intuited my politics: ‘Another one of you lefty remainers’Gorman pivoted away from regular standup in the early 2000s with the true-life odysseysAre You Dave Gorman?(adapted into the TV series The Dave Gorman Collection) andGooglewhack Adventure, both based on his obsession with pinning down the quirkiest elements of life. In Modern Life Is Goodish, he pours that same curiosity into what amounts to a series of comedy PowerPoint presentations: armed with a clicker and a big screen for showing screengrabs, photos and videos, Gorman hunts for oddities, riffing off them before tying them into ingenious comic bundles that suggest our smallest eccentricities are all gloriously connected.In the episodes that have made it to air, the new season sees Gorman talk about everything from annoying packaging to his online critics, from bad magicians to obscure telly. One lecture mines for gold in the workings of a company that rents out meeting “pods” in unlikely locations, apparently with limited success; another locates wonder in the logical inconsistencies in Brian Conley’s guest introductions in the mid-2010s daytime BBC series The TV That Made Me, a segment that becomes pureTV Burpwhen Conley himself appears and reprises his old routines. “I love TV Burp!” says Gorman. “I’ll take that as a huge compliment.”Airing from 2013, Goodish originally ran for five seasons and was a big hit for Dave – the channel, that is – with audiences hitting 1.5 million. Then, when it seemed the perennially check-shirted Gorman had found the perfect vehicle for his singular brand of optimism and exasperation, it ended. “We stopped because I used to work 100 hours a week for nine months of the year,” Gorman says, talking in a bookshop cafe in London. “Which I did very happily. But at some point you say, ‘I have a kid, I’d like to be at home.’ It isn’t sustainable.”View image in fullscreen‘Have an hour off’ … Dave Gorman in Modern Life Is Goodish.Photograph: Ellis O’Brien/UKTV, AvalonHaving paused Modern Life when his son Eric was two, Gorman had some enforced time off due to Covid, before returning to live work: his shows have been PowerPoint-based for a while now, which made it easier to bring Modern Life back. “I did two tours in those seven years. So there was a store of material that hadn’t been on telly. But also, somebody had the smart idea: we don’t need eight episodes. How about a smaller number?”It’s now perhaps a more playful, not so political show, with less railing against exploitative or idiotic corporate practices. Not that Modern Life has ever really sought to right big wrongs. “I never overtly talk politics on stage,” Gorman says. “I said to the producers when we first sat down for series one: if there’s something I really care about and I have a point to make, you’ve got to steer me away from it because the audience sniff sincerity and it stops being funny. But then I get angry tweets from people who have intuited my politics, and they don’t agree with them. ‘Another one of you lefty remainers’ – point me to the bit where I said that! I think what you’ve done is, there’s hopefully a kindness in it, and you’ve extrapolated from kindness and arrived at a worldview that you disagree with. That’s … weird.”But modern life has changed in the seven years for which Modern Life Is Goodish has been away: everything feels political now, and darker with it. Does Gorman worry that people have lost their ability to find joy in trivial things? “I don’t want that to be the case, for obvious, selfish reasons. There’s two things you can do with that: you can do comedy about it, making those difficult points and confronting people with that truth head on … or you can have an hour off. That’s also healthy. Even the person who has the truest moral compass, who is aware of all the inequities in life, gets pissed off when their train is late.”Modern Life Is Goodish, however, approaches the arcane with considerable rigour. Gorman is not like other standups who tell anecdotes on stage that they have fairly obviously invented for the purpose: “I can’t do that. I’m not a very good liar. Which my wife is delighted about.” Instead, he embodies the cliche “it’s funny because it’s true”: if he says something has happened, you know it really has when he brings up the next slide and lets you see for yourself. “Part of what I do is provide the evidence, so there has to be an underlying truth. There’s something great about knowing that that thing you’re finding funny is out there in the real world for anyone to discover. Then, the world’s a bit more magic.”While Gorman was away, he found a new source of magic: as well as being a comedian, he is now a professional compiler of cryptic crosswords. Gorman is Bluth in the Independent (in Gaelic, “Gorm” is “blue” and “An” is “the”) and Django in the Daily Telegraph (David James Gorman = D, J an’ Go).In the Guardian, his setter pseudonym is Fed. “Feds in America are also called G-men. And there are two or three people who would call me ‘G-man’.” Crossword-setting has taken a back seat now that Gorman is back on TV, but before then he was setting a grid a week. “At one point if you’d asked my boy what I do for a living, he’d say, ‘He sets crosswords.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are penny-drop moments when you’re solving that will make you smile. You’re in company with the setter: it’s playful and teasing and when you realise what someone’s doing, it can make you … maybe notlaugh, but there’s an enjoyable emotional response.”As a setter, Gorman is known for being able to create a fluent, pleasing “surface”, which is the term the cryptic community uses to describe the literal meaning of the sentence. Clues are not obliged to make sense, but it’s a bonus if they do. He recalls setting a clue where the answer was “Ernest Hemingway”, and the cryptic part of the clue was “Eagles on the smallest golf course” [ernes/the/min/g/way].“That’s a legitimate sentence you can make out of the elements of the name Ernest Hemingway. That’s just the coincidence of the world and that’s beautiful. It was always there.” Fans of Modern Life will see the parallel: Gorman regularly turns up happenstances that are almost unbelievable, but are real and have been waiting to be found. “That synchronicity makes the world nicer. I think the world’s fucking great.”Even the world we live in now? “Yes. Obviously loads of it is shit. But it’s also the only one we’ve got, so you might as well enjoy the stuff that’s amazing.”Modern Life Is Goodishis on U&Dave from 24 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDave GormanTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most of the time, they would call me over and say, “You’ve got to photograph this!”’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 19 Feb 2025 10.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 10.08 ESTShareIhadn’t met Aquilla Flemming before I photographed her giving birth. I was sitting on my couch at home when her midwife Chemin texted to say there was a woman in labour and she had given permission for me to take pictures. It was my day off, so I hesitated at first. But as soon as I got to the birthing centre I was glad I had come.When I arrived, Aquilla and her partner were outside, under a pepper tree. She was sitting on a birthing ball and they were holding hands. It was such a beautiful moment – the birth was special from the outset. Chemin had worked with Aquilla’s mother too, so there was this generational thing. The woman holding Storie, as the baby was called, is a student midwife. It was taken right after Storie was born. She’s still connected to the placenta – you can see the cord in the bottom of the frame.This shot was part of my projectExtreme Pain, Extreme Joy, first published in the New York Times in October 2020. It began when I was thinking about how women were being affected by the pandemic. I had heard a lot of stories about people being forced to give birth alone and I wondered whether it would lead to a rise in home births as people became afraid to go into hospital.An Amish mother pulled out from the project, as she felt she was too recognisableI had a friend who was a doula and I began to talk to midwives in Los Angeles, who introduced me to mothers. A few invited me to photograph their births. I didn’t have any children at the time, and the first birth I witnessed was nothing like I had imagined – it was a long process. The more births I attended, the more I noticed the patterns of slowness and boredom between frenzied moments of activity, as well as how unique each birth was. It’s such a huge thing; such an extreme life change. I hadn’t fully understood that until I had my own daughter a year ago.There were so many amazing takeaways from this project, about how strong women are, as well as the empathy of the midwives, whose role is so intense they’d often do back-to-back births without any sleep. The energy in the room was always insane, with everyone doing their job to bring the baby into the world. The air was crackling.A few women having home births ended up having to be taken to the hospital, and at that point, due to Covid protocol, I couldn’t go along. Otherwise I took cues from the mothers and midwives but I was never asked to leave the room. Most of the time they would call me over and say: “You’ve got to photograph this!”I would never publish anything the mothers weren’t happy with. Having them feel safe when they were in such a vulnerable position was my priority. Only one Amish mother I worked with pulled out, as she felt she was too recognisable. I still get updates from some, and photographs of their children, which is really nice. Aquilla has another child now.My pregnancy was complicated because ofvasa praevia, and the birth was pretty traumatic. I ended up having a C-section and my baby was in intensive care for two months. I never documented anything like that, but I know no birth is the same, and there are many more layers to this project yet to be done, many different stories to tell.Maggie Shannon’s CVView image in fullscreenMaggie Shannon.Photograph: Brittany CarmichaelBorn: Boston, 1987.Trained: Hampshire College (BFA) and the School of Visual Arts (MFA).Influences: “David Lynch,FSA photographers,Tina Barney,Martin Parr.”High point:“When someone says my work makes them feel seen.”Low point: “All the scary unknowns of my 20s.”Top Tip: “Don’t be afraid to ask questions.”Extreme Pain, Extreme Joy by Maggie Shannon, is published byMother Tongue.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotArtChildbirthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The accusations against Spotify’s Discovery ModeDiscovery Mode gets artists noticed in exchange for a 30% royalty reduction. A new book suggests that the platform is squeezing musicians and misleading listenersLiz PellyWed 19 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 10.38 ESTShareIn November 2020, Spotify published an opaque headline on its company blog: “Amplifying Artist Input in Your Personalised Recommendations.” The post introduceda new program called Discovery Mode, which would ask artists to accept lower royalty rates in exchange for algorithmic promotion. It was pay-to-play, but Spotify introduced the scheme using neutral language: artists would be able to “identify music that’s a priority for them”, which would become one of “thousands” of data inputs influencing how Spotify delivers “the perfect song for the moment, just for you”. Rather than charge an upfront fee, “labels or rights-holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalised listening sessions where Spotify provided this service”.Participating artists and labels take a 30% royalty reduction on tracks enrolled in the program, when they are discovered through its channels. Only tracks more than 30 days old are eligible. Notably, there have been no signs that Spotify plans to publicly label which songs are enrolled: a lack of disclosure that has caused many music advocacy groups to liken Discovery Mode to theradio payolaof the 1950s, which was eventually outlawed by the US Federal Trade Commission. (Though the company points out that it has published a broad guide tounderstanding recommendationson Spotify, including a paragraph on “commercial considerations”.)In the early 1960s, in what became known as “the Payola hearings”, the US government outlawed the practice of radio stations accepting under-the-table cash in exchange for airplay without disclosure. According to several accounts of the day’s payola practices, sometimes DJs were handed stacks of cash, but other times they were offered fake songwriting credits or a percentage of royalties. And while making payola illegal did not automatically make mainstream radio more fair – some say that now there exists just an “institutionalised” form of payola – outlawing it sent a message about the responsibility of regulators to take corporate deception of the public seriously. Payola was outlawed, in part, because regulators said accepting money in exchange for plays could artificially inflate popularity and mislead listeners.View image in fullscreenStatistician Bernard Goldstein gives evidence to the payola hearings in April 1960.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveSpotify, of course, framed Discovery Mode – which wasn’t exactly replicating the terms of radio payola – as democratising. OneSpotifyemployee explained it this way: “We’re not asking for any upfront budget or payment, which means there’s no barrier to entry.” More artists would now have the freedom to devalue their work, the opportunity to participate in an extractive system – and that was somehow democratic.Discovery Mode’s inner workings are, in part, a product of how playlists have evolved more broadly. Many of Spotify’s recommendation systems start with a curator identifying songs eligible to be included in a playlist; a personalisation algorithm then decides which 50 end up on a user’s playlist based on what they are most likely to identify with. Similarly, in the automated mixes impacted by Discovery Mode – user-specific mixes and the Radio and Autoplay features – a sequencing algorithm re-ranks the tracks from a relevant pool before they are delivered, increasing their chance of being served to users, a source explained.It’s a vicious cycle: we’re losing revenue because of streaming, then streaming pushes these weird opportunities on usInternally, Discovery Mode’s success has been measured by the percentage of total artists who were onboarded, and how much cash this was saving Spotify. By 2023, Spotify employees celebrated an “exciting Discovery Mode milestone”, according to a review of company Slack messages. More than 50% of what Spotify calls Tier 2–3 artists – those with annual royalties of $50,000-500,000 – had tried Discovery Mode. “Last year we set out with an ambitious goal of getting to 30%,” an employee wrote. “Surpassing 50% felt beyond our wildest dreams and yet here we are. Congrats all!”Spotify has made a lot of money from Discovery Mode, with profits also exceeding goals. Between May 2022 and May 2023, Discovery Mode had brought in €61.4m (£51m) in gross profit, according to a review of a chart shared internally. In May 2023 alone, it generated €6.6m (£5.5m) in gross profit – with nearly all of it coming from the independent and DIY sectors. It appeared from the breakdown in the chart that there was a direct connection between the musicians who were opting into Discovery Mode and those who already stood to be affected by the introduction of so-called “artist-centric” royalty policies, which as of 2024 have demonetised tracks with less than 1000 annual streams.The music industry is engineering artist popularity – listeners are right to be angryRead moreBut in the long term, Discovery Mode also seemed like an economic arrangement that only the most moneyed labels could afford. “Discovery Mode is very insidious in that it doesn’t matter whether you do it or not, you’re affected by it,” one indie label employee told me. “If all of your competitors are using Discovery Mode and you’re not, your share is going to go down.”Three years after the launch of Discovery Mode’s pilot version, an employee reflected on Slack about what its architects had accomplished: “It’s amazing to look back on our progress.”The disingenuous promotional material emphasised how this program was all aboutwhat the artist wanted to promote. But by the end of 2023, that was in question, as Spotify introduced “Pre-Campaign Insights” or PCI, an algorithm that would tell an artist or label which tracks were most likely to stream well in a Discovery Mode campaign. It was rolled out for “managed service” Discovery Mode customers, as opposed to “self-service” customers – advertising industry terminology referring to whether a customer has a point-of-contact managing their campaign. For those eligible, the company claimed that the PCI algorithm would recommend, with roughly 85% accuracy, tracks “predicted to see a lift in streams” from a Discovery Mode campaign.One independent record label manager said she had tried Discovery Mode campaigns for different artists on her indie rock label, but it was only the “folk-leaning artists” for whom it was most effective. “It serves passive listeners,” she told me. She reflected on how frustrating it was that opting into Discovery Mode actually did lead to increased streams for her artists; the fact that someone would hear a promoted track and not know that it was promoted raised ethical concerns. “This, unfortunately, is the way that the future looks for us. And we have zero control over it.”Another independent label manager noted that despite seeing results from Discovery Mode, he was not sure yet what their royalty statements would look like. “It’s this vicious cycle where we’re losing revenue because of streaming. And then streaming is pushing these weird opportunities on us. And we need to take them in order to make up for that lost revenue. It sadly is so desperate, because the industry changes so consistently and we are constantly thinking of ways to keep up.”Discovery Mode wasn’t Spotify’s first go at paid promo. Since 2019, it had been trying to get artists to pay for pop-up ads called “Marquees”, which cost 50 cents per click, or 55 cents if the artist wanted to target “lapsed, casual, or recently interested listeners”. An artist set a dollar amount for the campaign, which would then run for 10 days, or until the budget was spent. “Our distributor said, don’t use this, you are going to lose money,” one of the independent label managers told me. In 2023, Spotify introduced another, similar ad product called “Showcase”, a sponsored shelf that sat on the home page; those cost 40 cents per click, and lasted 14 days.Later that year, Spotify launched an initiative called Campaign Kit, its attempt to get artists to not just purchase Marquee ads, Showcase shelves, or to trade royalties for algorithmic promotion, but to convince them that all of these tools worked best when purchased together. The last component of the kit was Spotify’s tool for submitting tracks for editorial playlist consideration. It’s as if the company were saying it’s not enough to buy ads, take a reduced royalty to use Discovery Mode, or pray at the altar of playlist pitching: artists must do all of these things.View image in fullscreenSpotify’s tools for ‘creators’, ie musicians.Photograph: SpotifyIn late 2023, a Showcase-related announcement hit the company Slack, detailing a high benchmark hit just two months after launch: over €1m (£833k) worth of ads booked. “We should all be very proud of this moment.

But these ambitions to monetise musicians were seriously concerning to many. The Artist Rights Alliance, ina Rolling Stone op-edpublished in April 2021, called Discovery Mode “payola” as well as “exploitative”, “unfair”, and a “money grab”, noting the potential for the royalty cut to be “so steep that working artists and independent labels cannot even afford to pay it, clearing the field for major record labels and pop megastars to swallow up even more of the streaming pie”. The group wrote that the biggest losers would be “working artists, independent labels, and above all music fans looking to expand and diversify their listening.”In June 2021, the United States House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek, warning that the feature could establish a “race to the bottom” where artists feel required to accept lower royalties in order to be heard. The letter asserted that “at a time when the global pandemic has devastated incomes for musicians and other performers, without a clear path back to pre-pandemic levels, any plan that could ultimately lead to further cut pay for working artists and ultimately potentially less consumer choice raises significant policy issues”.View image in fullscreenDaniel Ek, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spotify, hosts a “Now Playing” creator day at the company’s Los Angeles campus.Photograph: Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images for SpotifyThe authors of the House Judiciary letter outlined a series of questions directly for Daniel Ek: Would the pilot become permanent? What safeguards would protect artists from Discovery Mode boosts potentially cancelling each other out? How would the “promotional” royalty rate be calculated and would it be the same for everyone? How could artists and labels measure the success of the program on their streams? And how would royalties be returned to artists if participating failed to increase streams?Shortly after the Artist Rights Alliance op-ed was published, a staff member shared it in a Slack channel called “ethics-club”, where a group of Spotify employees would debate ethical issues of the streaming business. Some of these employees quickly agreed with the alliance’s assertion that Discovery Mode was payola-like. One said that the article nicely summed up his “raised eyebrows” from the meeting where he first learned about the program. “Controlling more of the listening experience via programming pretty clearly benefits us more than anybody else,” a different employee wrote. “That’s exactly why we have goals to increase programmed share.”“This isn’t just like selling a banner ad somewhere. The boosted plays come at the cost of other artists,” said another. “And as the article correctly notes, the degenerate case is that artists stop benefitting at all from paying us.”View image in fullscreenThe cover of Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist.Photograph: HodderEven Spotify’s own employees could see that Discovery Mode was a deceptive practice as they debated the general lack of transparency, and the blurred boundaries between pay-for-play and “marketplace”.According to Kevin Erickson, director of the Future of Music Coalition, there are important distinctions between payola on radio and what may appear to be its contemporary online equivalent. Payola has gone underground with radio, but comparable practices online are happening out in the open. Musicians are not paid at all when they’re played on US AM or FM radio, so there isn’t the same sort of commercial incentive to use payola. “There’s this whole other category of harm that happens on the digital side,” said Erickson.In his view, many of the issues artists face in the streaming era, including what has been characterised as digital payola, are antitrust issues that both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have the power to take on as unfair methods of competition (because they suppress wages and contribute to an anticompetitive market) and as deceptive practices (because people don’t know whether they’re listening to a song due to a curated recommendation or a business relationship). In addition, Erickson noted, the FTC could also contribute to a more equitable streaming landscape by investigating the major record label contracts that are currently locked up by NDAs – as well as any contracts digital service providers hold with aggregators and stock music providers.As he puts it: “Unaccountable power is the problem wherever it pops up. It’s not about any particular technology. It’s concentrated, unaccountable private power.”In response to points raised in this article, a Spotify spokesperson disputed the characterisation of Discovery Mode as the contemporary equivalent of payola. While users cannot see which individual songs are part of Discovery Mode, the “about recommendations” link in algorithmically generated playlists discloses factors that may have influenced the tracklisting. Spotify disputes the accuracy of views shared by employees in some internal messages featured in this chapter. According to the company, these internal messages “appear to be largely from former employees who were chatting with each other about their views on different company matters, including matters that they may not have been working on or even have direct knowledge of”. The company adds: “We have a culture where employees are free to share their views even when they have concerns or constructive criticism.” They also dispute the claim that Discovery Mode is anticompetitive. The company would not comment on whether the Discovery Mode profits were accurate.This article is an edited extract from Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly, available now in the US from Atria/One Signal, and published in the UK on 13 March (Hodder & Stoughton, £22).

Bob Dylan’s early years in New York have beenchronicled,dramatised,riffed onand pored over more than the Last Supper. James Mangold’s biopic – told very much with the backing, though not the guiding hand of Dylan Inc – somehow achieved the impossible: keeping the people with working knowledge of the musical rota at the Gaslight Cafe as interested as those with little more than an acquaintance with TikTok covers of Blowin’ in the Wind.And that’s perhaps the key case for A Complete Unknown to win the best picture Oscar. Sure, it’s an excellent movie with a hair-raising performance from its lead, but I think the reason so many younger ornon-Dylan fansenjoyed it is, curiously, its capturing of the notion that one man’s art can give people hope for change. The fact that the film itself isvery specificallyabout Dylan rejecting that position is neither here nor there.A Complete Unknown captures a moment when a 19-year-old weirdo from Minnesota could arrive in Manhattan, somehow find a place to stay and scrape by (not that we see much detail on this) on the money he received after playing and passing around a hat in dingy folk clubs. Sadly, it bears about as close a relation to the realities of 21st-century life as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yes, a nation may have turned its lonely eyes to Dylan – only for him to stick his fingers in them – but at least the rents were cheap (and no one had social media). A Complete Unknown might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it’s already one of the great mainstream films about the visceral power of art – and at a time when the modern political moment is overwhelming any sense of cultural resistance.Why else does it deserve to win? Timothée Chalamet’s performance as Dylan is so good that it’s been written off by some as no more than a feat of imitation. But compare his Bob with the real one of Dont Look Back or No Direction Home and it’s clear that we’re watching a rare player here. A generational talent in the very real sense that he’s the only male actor under 40 good enough to open all kinds of movies (his last three being this,Dune: Part 2andWonka, for goodness sake.)There are also impeccable supporting turns. Ed Norton is utterly taken by the kind, tender utopian spirit of Pete Seeger and Monica Barbaro repositions Joan Baez as a vital artist who exists separately from Dylan, as well as someonepleasingly unwilling to take his shit(“You’re kind of an asshole, Bob”).Watch the trailer.Then there are two scenes that made the hairs on my arms stand on end. They’re both testament to the power of drama (given that they didn’t happen). In the first, Dylan’sfabled first visit to Woody Guthrie’s hospital bedside, Bob serenades his hero withSong to Woody, the foundation stone for the entire film, and Dylan’s career. The other moment comes when Baez spots Dylan’s lyrics to Blowin’ in the Wind and the two start singing, a thrillingly tender moment of two people finding literal harmony.Some of the main criticisms of the film can be comfortably filed under This Is Not a Documentary: principally the historical accuracy of moments such as the “Judas” cry, relocated from a crowd member in Manchester, England, to Newport folk festival, and Seeger’s anger at Dylan’s decision to go electric. (It is also worth adding that the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax, one of the most significant figures in modern musical history, is doneextremelydirty here – but you need an adversary.) A better criticism would be to point out that – given that the production company was approached to make the film byDylan’s manager Jeff Rosen (more on that here), A Complete Unknown is as much a portrait of the artist as a young man as it is a canny Marvel-level bit of intellectual property management.Despite its near two-and-a-half-hours length, I was left wanting more as Dylan rode off on his motorbike in the final scene. A Complete Unknown captures the most culturally significant era of his career but, as everyone watching it knows, there are decades of fascinating Dylaning to come.

The new RSCHamlet, unusually, has a tie-in cruise. The programme advertises a collaboration between the theatre company and Cunard: seven days on the Queen Mary 2 “putting the power of Shakespeare to sea”.Which is the course on which director Rupert Goold sets the court of Elsinore. His version takes place entirely on a sort of Royal Yacht Scandinavia during what seems to be a honeymoon cruise for Claudius and Gertrude. A ship of state, this is also, metaphorically, a ship of fools.The budget really pushes the boat out. A roiling wake of waves down-stage (video design: Akhila Krishnan) makes the play seem to be sailing towards us, while a monumental deck (designer: Es Devlin) sometimes violently lurches: in the climactic duels, poisons may not be necessary as sea sickness threatens to do for Hamlet and Laertes.This bold concept, though, is justified by Hamlet being such a coastal play. Four characters are put to sea (in this version, corpses also get a naval burial) and fear is expressed at the number of “shipwrights” working in Norway to prepare its invasion of Denmark.View image in fullscreenStudent-cool … Luke Thallon’s Hamlet.Photograph: Marc BrennerCleverly, the word “bough” in the original is heard, in this context, as “bow.” Elsewhere, Goold and dramaturg Rebecca Latham tinker to render speeches sea-worthy: “chamber” becomes cabin, “earth” is overtaken by “sea”. Ingenuity is required to explain why Yorick’s skull is not in the drink with the rest of him and the biggest loss is Gertrude’s haunting speech about Ophelia’s river death. Here, she just goes over the edge.Where, it must be acknowledged, many Shakespeare purists will follow her. But, with the RSC economically required to stage the major plays in quick rotation, each iteration should surely be significantly different. Apart from the off-shore setting, bold ideas include the novel suggestion – via a red digital onstage clock, “witching hour” signalled as 00:00 – that the whole play takes place during one long night.And, unlike in some opera productions, high-concept never cramps performances that would grace any staging. Luke Thallon’s Hamlet, student-cool and with an alternative-comedian vibe, plays against the speeding clock, notably taking his time. Pauses before and during the great soliloquies make the words about death and revenge sound newly thought-out and forced-out rather than learned by schoolchildren for hundreds of years.Hamlet Hail to the Thief: Thom Yorke revisits Radiohead album for Shakespeare showRead moreJared Harris’s Claudius exudes the sexual and political ruthlessness of a man willing to kill for a crown and to keep it, and Nancy Carroll, with typical poetic intelligence, captures the growing guilt of having betrayed both son and husband. Elliot Levey’s Polonius is strikingly more dapper diplomat than the standard windbag. The unravelling of Nia Towle’s Ophelia has a clinical reality that adds another layer to debate over whether Hamlet’s descent is pretended. And, whereas every Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (or vice versa) are shadowed by the Stoppard spin-off, Chase Brown and Tadeo Martinez find undiscovered country as preppy Americans who must have met Hamlet on a scholarship.There will be questions about whether Goold should have gone to sea or not to sea but – for its vivid atmosphere and intelligence – this is a must-see.

What’s causing the glut of comics?Ralph JonesWed 19 Feb 2025 06.18 ESTLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2025 06.20 ESTShareGoing from telling jokes about your sex life in a room above a pub to asking someone in a studio what the capital of Malaysia is might notseemlike an obvious career transition. It is, however, increasingly common to turn on your TV and see a comedian fronting a gameshow. In recent times,Romesh Ranganathanhas hosted The Weakest Link; Michael McIntyre has hosted The Wheel; Lee Mack has hosted The 1% Club; and Jason Manford has hosted The Answer Run. When there are so many other people who would be glad of the work – full-time presenters; actors; Nigel Farage – why is the male-standup-hosting-a-quizshow such a mainstay of modern TV?Joel Dommett is likely as familiar to the general public for his hosting as for his comedy. He thinks the snobbery that used to exist in the comedy industry about gameshows and adverts has subsided a little. “Comedians nowadays can do all those things and still be accepted as a decent comic,” he says.For Dommett, there’s a symbiotic relationship between standup and presenting shows such as In With A Shout, Survivor, The Masked Singer and The Love Trap. “Standup’s almost the training for it in a weird way,” he says, “but then also being on the gameshow keeps you on telly, then sells your tours in order for you to be able to keep doing standup.”Although some comics can make a living just from touring, this is a small minority, and the industry is still feeling the impact of a pandemic that ravaged live entertainment. This has caused a shift in attitude, says Richard Ackerman, who executive-produced the panel show Duck Quacks Don’t Echo. He believes thatLee Mack, who makes a good living performing live, writing and starring in a BBC sitcom and appearing as a team captain on Would I Lie to You?, might not have considered The 1% Club under normal circumstances. The Wheel, similarly, was the result of the BBC looking for Covid-friendly shows. Comedians may have realised that, if there was a chance they could have another string to their bow, they might as well play it.View image in fullscreenLorra laughs … Lily Savage hosting Blankety Blank.Photograph: FremantleMedia Ltd/Rex/ShutterstockThis is by no means an exclusively modern phenomenon – with comics such as Lily Savage (Blankety Blank) and Jim Davidson (The Generation Game) hosting gameshows over the years. But TV is in trouble at the moment, says Richard Bacon, who produced I Literally Just Told You, presented by Jimmy Carr. Networks are desperate to get their audience’s attention straight away. Bacon, who was once a TV presenter on shows such as Blue Peter and The Big Breakfast, started creating gameshows because he wanted to front them. He was then informed that he wasn’t well known enough to present primetime shows. Three out of four of his commissions have been shows hosted by comedians. “It’s a better time than ever to be really famous talent,” he says.But if channels need a household name, why not reach for singers? Or actors? Unlike comedy, which is famously tied to culture, established pop acts and Hollywood stars can more readily cross borders, making them easier sells for international audiences.As The Wheel producer Tom Blakeson points out, actors are most well known for becoming other people, which is a problem. “A lot of actors don’t want anybody to know who they are – that’s why they act.” A gameshow audience wants to be entertained but also reassured (which explains why more challenging comics such as Stewart Lee don’t host gameshows). As Ackerman says, the tone is set by the host, so audiences wouldn’t be sure that Ian McKellen was going to be a wickedly naughty host or a dry and sombre one. They know, however, that if McIntyre is hosting it’s going to be light and bubbly and full ofMichael McIntyrejokes. He has that thing on which commissioners love to prey: a brand.View image in fullscreen‘Standup’s almost the training for it’ … Joel Dommett on the set of ITV’s gameshow, In With A Shout.Photograph: Kieron McCarron/ITVSo comedians with well known brands emerge as the most qualified candidates. James Gill, who has warmed up for multiple TV shows, and hosts the award-winning Always BeComedy, says comics make the best hosts because they have the human touch. “The comedians we’re talking about have such compassion because of their years dealing with people, and that is such an asset when it comes to gameshows.”Another advantage a comic has over an actor, Blakeson points out, is that an actor’s audience is usually compliant. A comedian is used to interacting with an audience and winning them over, whereas even a newsreader – who could be superb at the job technically – might not be able to make an anxious contestant laugh.“Yes, a comedian is a shortcut, potentially, but they are bringing with them a huge skillset these other people don’t have,” says Ackerman. “It’s like saying, ‘Why are all these fighter pilots from the RAF getting all the British Airways pilot gigs?’ Beause they know how to fly planes.”When there were only four channels on TV, there was less pressure on hosts to provide entertainment. But, with TV struggling against the might of streaming platforms and the internet, choosing a host who is more likely to produce hilarious viral moments is increasingly tempting. And it is probably no coincidence that, whereas TV’s most popular chatshow used to be hosted by Michael Parkinson, a serious journalist who let his guests do the jokes, it is now hosted by Graham Norton, a man who, immense chatting talents notwithstanding, found fame as a comedian. As Bacon says, the training opportunities for presenting talent are drying up. The same can’t be said for funny people with millions of followers.View image in fullscreenLee Mack on the set of The 1% Club.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockLastly, of course, there’s the money. Ackerman says hosts in the UK can earn more than £15,000 an episode. Bacon says that for an American show he worked on the host earned several hundred thousand dollars per episode. Compared with standup, hosting seems like a doddle. Presenters don’t need to learn lines; they won’t be heckled; they tend not even to be performing in front of an audience; and they can make weeks’ worth of TV in days. A cynic might think they’re only in it for the money. “They’re taking their opportunity when it comes,” says Blakeson. “When you’re an entertainer you really do need to make hay while the sun shines.”This doesn’t mean it’s easy or that comics should get complacent. “There are times when I’ve seen gameshows almost not work because a comedian’s hosted,” says Bacon. “I can see that they’re thinking about the joke and they’re not thinking about either the story or the human experience of this person.”Gill cautions against assuming it’s as easy as it looks: “What you really pick up when you’re watching someone host a gameshow from close quarters is how many things they’re simultaneously juggling. It’s very much the old swan analogy: on TV we see a terrific gameshow where everyone’s having fun but the legs will be paddling mighty quick beneath the surface.”Dommett echoes this, having seen how consummately McIntyre presents The Wheel. “For two and a half hours he doesn’t leave the set, doesn’t leave the circle, he just stands there, in between all these mad celebrities, and entertains us all, constantly, whether he’s filming or not filming.”But, if anything could have prepared these comedians for the difficulty of hosting, it is standup, that most unforgiving and gladiatorial of entertainments. Survive all alone on a stage, and anything else will feel like a walk in the park. As Dommett puts it, “I’m OK by myself, so I’m definitely gonna be fine with an Autocue and a script.”Explore more on these topicsGame showsTelevisionTV comedyComedyMichael McIntyreLee MackRomesh RanganathanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now, at 84, he feels the best way to express himself is by going hardcore country.On his first new album in nearly 20 years, Straight from the Heart, Medley devoted every track to melancholy ballads made famous by country stars such as Kris Kristofferson, Hank Williams and George Jones. “I feel I can sing these songs, because I’ve lived these songs,” Medley said. “When you get older, you’ve seen a lot of ups and downs. And I’ve had some real downs.”The Waterboys’ Mike Scott: ‘I love Prince’s version of The Whole of the Moon. And Graham Norton’s’Read moreIn fact, more than many people have. In the early 70s, Medley was told he would never sing again due to the strain he put on his voice. Several years later, his ex-wife, the mother of his first child, was raped and murdered in a case that went unsolved for decades. Then, in 2003, he discovered the body of his beloved partner in the Righteous Brothers, Bobby Hatfield, who had died in his sleep at 63 from a heart attack. Four years ago, it was his turn to suffer a medical crisis. He was diagnosed with throat cancer, a disease that, once again, threatened to silence one of music’s most distinct voices. “That was an incredibly scary thing to go through,” Medley said of the disease. “If I lost my voice, I would be devastated.”Instead, a round of surgery caught the cancer and left his vocal cords unscathed. On the new album, Medley sounds physically robust and emotionally present. Though inevitable traces of wear and tear show in any voice at 84, they work in his favor, offering hard evidence of everything he has lived through. To flesh out the well-known songs he covered on the album, such as Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down and I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry, some pieces were arranged as duets, letting Medley mix it up with guest singers such as Michael McDonald, Vince Gill and Keb’ Mo’. For Medley, the duet dynamic is mother’s milk, having built his reputation on the interplay between his resounding baritone and Hatfield’s high-wire tenor in the Righteous Brothers. “You can’t play catch with yourself,” Medley said of the interplay. “As a singer, it’s a lot more fun when you throw a line out to someone and then they throw it back.”At the same time, the Righteous Brothers’ unique rapport resulted in something much more meaningful and far-reaching than record sales, including ones as monumental as their 1964 breakthrough song, You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling, which held the record as the most played song on US radio and TV for more than two decades. Beyond their cultural ubiquity, the Brothers helped change the relationship between music and race by featuring white singers who “sounded Black” at a time when Jim Crow laws still segregated many Americans. In the same year the US passed the Civil Rights Act, Medley and Hatfield performed a parallel act of integration with their music. “That was all brand new back then,” Medley said.Though by that time mainstream music had embraced white artists such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis integrating authentic black styles into their sound, much pop music in the early 60s still favored the milky sound of artists such as Frankie Avalon and Pat Boone. The Righteous Brothers recorded perhaps the first major hit to feature white singers channeling the full gospel fervor of soul music, in the process midwifing the genre of blue-eyed soul. At the time, Medley said they had no clue that would be such a winning formula. “For two white singers to sound Black was really going against the grain,” he said. “It was the mostuncommercialthing you could do at the time.”The early songs the duo recorded were for a small label, and just one of them, Little Latin Lupe Lu, made any chart impression at all. Written by Medley and sung with gusto by the duo, the song barely broke the top 50 in 1962. They first recorded it under the name the Paramours, but because, in concert, African American listeners had been yelling out things like, “That was righteous, brothers,” they adopted the new name. The fresh term for their sound has been credited to a Black Philadelphia DJ named Georgie Woods. “It was a way to hip his audience to the fact that we were white,” Medley said. “He would say, ‘Here are my blue-eyed soul brothers.’”The sound caught the ear of Phil Spector, who made them the first white act signed to his Philles Records label, which otherwise favored artists such as the Ronettes and the Crystals. In 1964, he hired songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil to pen You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’, which soared to No 1 and endured as a beacon for all soul singers to come. “We were really blessed that Black audiences took us in, because we knew there were two Black singers on every corner who could do what we were doing,” he said. “But once we did break through, there were hundreds of white artists right behind us.”One draw for the Brothers was the clever way they highlighted the contrasts in their voices. To break up their extended harmony parts, they featured sections that isolated each singer before building to a pitched call and response between the two. The way Medley navigated his low parts really stood out to Michael McDonald, who, on the new album, performs with him on the Buck Owens song Crying Time. “Most baritone singers are confined to a pretty narrow range,” McDonald said. “They don’t move around that much. But Bill is able to improvise a melody in a way that allows him to hint at a higher range. And when he goes for those notes that are less comfortable for him the strain brings a great soulfulness and angst.”View image in fullscreenBobby Hatfield and Bill Medley.Photograph: GAB Archive/RedfernsRemarkably, Medley said he wasn’t born with his deep instrument. “The truth is, when I was 15, I was a first tenor,” he said. “That’s why I have such a sense of what Bobby was doing with his voice. But when I turned 16, I grew seven inches in one year and went from a first tenor to a baritone.”With a laugh, Medley credited the thick texture of his voice to “really bad sinuses”.Spector’s epic production made the most of the pair’s vocal drama. “Everybody wants to hear a horror story about Phil,” Medley said, “but when we recorded with him, he was fairly sane. I think he was more interested in having people think he was nuts and then, later, he talked himself into it.”Given Spector’s reputation for being a control freak, it’s notable that the Brothers had a lot of say in certain recordings. “We were street kids, so Phil knew he couldn’t do a lot of his usual pushing around,” he said.Medley got to write or co-write many songs and was even allowed to produce some, including their classic Unchained Melody, an extreme rarity for an artist at the time. But due to a legal tussle between Spector and the duo’s former label, the relationship with the producer only lasted a year and a half. “I didn’t want to leave Phil,” Medley said.Fortunately, by that time he had absorbed enough knowledge from Spector to imitate his Wall of Sound style when he produced the duo’s next single,Souland Inspiration, a top five smash in 1966. Just two years later, the hits dried up and the duo split. Medley proceeded to make records on his own, though most performed tepidly. By 1974, he was mainly playing Vegas lounges, which is where he blew out his voice. “I had laryngitis but was still doing three shows a night,” he said. “That’s like running on a sprained ankle. It’s just gonna get worse.”View image in fullscreenBill Medley.Photograph: Curb Word EntertainmentUpon examining him, LA’s top throat doctor told him: “Your vocal cords are hamburger meat.” A chance encounter with his high-school choir teacher turned things around. He told him he could bring back his voice with a rigorous series of exercises. Medley described the protocol as “very painful. I’m surprised I stuck it out,” he said. “But thank God I did because my voice came back.”In that same time frame, he reunited with Hatfield and the two enjoyed a comeback hit with Rock and Roll Heaven, a treacly ballad whose lyrics imagined the ultimate jam in the afterlife between famous dead musicians such as Otis Redding, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. The joy of that comeback was cruelly countered a few years later by the murder of his ex-wife. Medley, who says the two remained close despite the divorce, was so crushed by her violent death he quit the music industry for a few years to spend the time raising the couple’s son. (Years later, DNA evidence proved that a drifter had committed the murder in a random act of violence.) “You can take the 70’s as far as I’m concerned,” Medley said. “It was a very tough 10 years for me.”Remarkably, he rebounded resoundingly in the 80s with another No 1 smash, I’ve Had the Time of My Life, a duet with Jennifer Warnes that was prominently featured in the wildly successful film Dirty Dancing. At first, Medley turned down the invitation to take part in the movie because “the title sounded like a bad porno”. His desire to sing with Warnes won him over in the end. Another movie connection gave the Righteous Brothers one more comeback. In 1990, the blockbuster movie Ghost featured a pivotal scene based around Unchained Melody, generating even greater sales for the song than it had enjoyed the first time around.After the death of Hatfield in 2003, Medley didn’t revive the Righteous Brothers name for another 13 years, at which point he hired Bucky Heard to handle the tenor parts. The pair continued to tour successfully under the old brand but, as a solo star, Medley couldn’t secure a new record contract for decades due to trends that disfavored his vintage style, as well as the realities of an industry that’s long been reluctant to back artists of age. He credits his latest resurrection to Mike Curb, who signed him to his Nashville-based Curb label for the new project. His role model for its sound was his idol Ray Charles, who made history by mixing country and soul in 1962.Before Curb came to his aid, Medley was so convinced his career had waned, he announced his retirement just over a year ago. Now, he has new energy and hope. He plans to keep performing with Heard in Vegas as the Righteous Brothers and, should the new album connect, he’d love to make more. “Hell, there are so many great country songs, I could do 50 more albums like this,” Medley said. “As long as there’s a need for my music, I’ll keep making it.”Straight From the Heart is out on 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicCountrySoulinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The new measures bar federal funds from going toward programs focused on “diversity, equity and inclusion” or used to “promote gender ideology”.Stars pull out of shows and positions at Kennedy Center after Trump takeoverRead more“While the arts community stands in solidarity with the NEA, we oppose this betrayal of the Endowment’s mission to ‘foster and sustain an environment in which the arts benefit everyone in the United States’,” the letter reads. “We ask that the NEA reverse those changes to the compliance requirements.”“We recognize that our colleagues at the NEA are in a difficult position,” it continues. “Perhaps the hope is that by making these compromises, the Endowment will be able to continue its important work. But abandoning our values is wrong, and it won’t protect us. Obedience in advance only feeds authoritarianism.”The letter, signed by 463 playwrights, poets, dancers, writers, visual artists and others, was sent on behalf of a campaign organized by the New York-based theater director and writer Annie Dorsen. Signees include the Pulitzer prize-winning playwrights Jackie Sibblies Drury, Lynn Nottage and Paula Vogel, as well as Holly Hughes, a performance artist who in 1990 became one of the “NEA Four” – artists denied funding because of outcry from conservative critics that their art was “obscene” at the height of the culture wars.“In some ways this just feels like déjà vu all over again,” Hughes, a professor of art and design at the University of Michigan, told the Times. “These funding restrictions are a good barometer for who is the easy punching bag in American culture at the moment.”The letter, sent to 26 NEA officials on Tuesday morning, objects to new requirements instituted by Trump in executive orders – a few of the flurry of orders he signed during the opening days of his second term in office. One requires that grant applicants “not operate any programs promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ that violate any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws”. Another prevents federal funds from being used “to promote gender ideology”, referring to another anti-trans executive order that declares that American policy is “to recognize two sexes, male and female”.“Trump and his enablers may use doublespeak to claim that support for artists of color amounts to ‘discrimination’ and that funding the work of trans and women artists promotes ‘gender ideology’ (whatever that is),” the letter reads. “But we know better: the arts are for and represent everybody. We can’t give that up.”By Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the NEA, Elizabeth Auclair, said the organization had not yet received the letter, but assured that “presidential executive orders have the full force and effect of law and within the executive branch must be implemented consistent with applicable law. The National Endowment for the Arts is a federal agency and will fully comply with the law.”What is DEI and why is Trump opposed to it?Read moreThe backlash arrives on the heels of similaroutcry over Trump’s takeoverof the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Last week, Trump purged the arts foundation’s board all appointees by Joe Biden and installed several loyalists, who promptly appointed Trump as chair. Thetakeoverprompted several notable names in the cultural community, including Issa Rae, Shonda Rhimes, Reneé Fleming and Ben Folds, to sever ties or cancel performances with the organization.This is also not the first time Trump hastargeted the NEA, an organization that has provided over $5bn in grants since its founding in 1965, and which has been subject to culture wars and political threatssince the Reagan era. In 2017, at the beginning of his first term, Trump pledged toshut downthe NEA, and proposed a budget slashing funds by 80%. The agency survived the first Trump presidency – and, in fact, saw its budget grow – largely because of bipartisan support in Congress, which repeatedly voted to save it.Explore more on these topicsCultureDonald TrumpArtTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Thankful, humbled by his mercy!”The verdict follows a more than two-week trial during which the alleged victim, whose stage name is A$AP Relli, testified that Rocky fired two shots from a handgun at him, grazing his knuckles.View image in fullscreenA$AP Rocky jumps towards supporters after the verdict was read in his trial.Photograph: Daniel Cole/AFP/Getty ImagesThe trial began on 24 January, after Rocky, born Rakim Athelaston Mayers, turned down a plea offer before the proceedings, insisting he was innocent. If he had been found guilty, Rocky could have faced up to 24 years in prison.Before the jury’s ruling, Rocky’s longtime partner, the superstar singer Rihanna, attended closing arguments with the couple’s toddlers, two-year-old RZA Athelaston Mayers and one-year-old Riot Rose Mayers.Rocky’s defense attorney Joe Tacopina, who also represented Donald Trump in lawsuits with Stormy Daniels and E Jean Carroll, argued that Rocky had fired a prop gun, which he had taken from the set of a music video for security reasons.Tacopina cast Relli as a jealous opportunist, saying that Relli had only reported the incident so he could file a subsequent civil case against Rocky. In text messages and phone calls recorded by a mutual friend, Relli said he was going to take Rocky for millions. Relli testified the calls were faked, but the prosecution played long excerpts during closing arguments.During witness testimony, which concluded on Tuesday without Rocky taking the stand, prosecutors argued that the hip-hop star fired at Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.“Mr Ephron wants to get paid,” the deputy district attorney Paul Przelomiec said, “because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun.”View image in fullscreenA$AP Rocky embraces his attorney Joe Tacopina after the verdict was read.Photograph: Daniel Cole/AFP/Getty ImagesRocky and Relli were both members of a New York hip-hop group called the A$AP Mob, and remained friends after Rocky gained global fame with No 1 albums in 2012 and 2013.But, by the time the two reunited on 6 November 2021, their friendship had soured. Upon meeting outside a Hollywood hotel, the pair scuffled. Moments later, Rocky fired the shots, which Relli said grazed his knuckles.During the trial, Relli testified that he believed the gun was real and described Rocky pointing it at him before walking away. Relli told jurors that he shouted at Rocky as he walked after him, then Rocky pulled the gun again and held it in the air.“He turned around and then it was like, boom!” Relli said. “The whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.” He said he felt a burning on his hand where a bullet grazed it.Another member of the hip-hop group, A$AP Twelvyy, testified that he had been present for the encounter and that Rocky had fired the shots as a warning to stop Relli from attacking another member of the crew.Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from the prop gun, and that everyone involved knew it was a fake.Neither side produced a gun as evidence, and despite more than three years passing, the defense did not say the gun was fake until the beginning of trial, which Przelomiec said “defies all reason”.Jurors were also shown video surveillance of the altercation and heardtestimony from a witnesswho claimed to hear the shooting from the seventh floor of a nearby apartment building.Jurors were not supposed to be aware of the possible 24-year sentence Rocky faced, but Rocky’s tour manager, Lou Levin, mentioned the length of the possible sentence during his testimony. The judge told the jury to disregard the statement, but prosecutors said they believed the slip was intentional.The Associated Press contributedExplore more on these topicsA$AP RockyLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

Spacey, who has been dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct, has conceded he made some “clumsy” approaches to men in the past, but never anything illegal.‘He targeted me’: Guy Pearce says he ‘sobbed’ over Kevin Spacey encountersRead morePearcetold the Hollywood Reporterthat Spacey “targeted me, no question” while they made the 1997 film LA Confidential. He said that he told his then wife that he felt safe on set when his co-star Simon Baker was present, because Spacey focused on Baker instead.“But I did that thing that you do where you brush it off and go, ‘Ah, that’s nothing. Ah, no, that’s nothing.’ And I did that for five months. And, really, I was sort of scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man. He’s extremely charming and brilliant at what he does – really impressive, et cetera. He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question,” Pearce said.Pearce said the#MeToo movement, which saw multiple allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against men in Hollywood in 2017, was “a really incredible wake-up call” for him. Spacey was accused at the time by the actor Anthony Rapp of having made sexual advances towards him at a party in New York in 1986, when Rapp was 14.Spacey was legallycleared of misconductand sexual assault respectively in separate trials in the US and the UK, and successfully defended himself against a lawsuit brought by Rapp.“I was in London working on something, and I heard [the reports] and I broke down and sobbed, and I couldn’t stop,” Pearce said. “I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever.”He said he was reluctant to describe himself as a victim, “even though I probably was a victim to a degree; I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators.”Spacey responded to the allegations on Tuesday on X. “We worked together a long time ago,” he said in a video, addressing Pearce. “If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me. We could have had that conversation, but instead, you’ve decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said. You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.”Spacey claimed that Pearce flew to Georgia a year after LA Confidential was made “just to spend time with me” while Spacey was filming Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.#MeToo men want to be forgiven, but what of the careers of their casualties? | Martha GillRead more“I mean, did you tell the press that too, or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?” Spacey said. “I apologise that I didn’t get the message that you don’t like spending time with me. Maybe there was another reason, I don’t know, but that doesn’t make any sense. That you would have just been leading me on, right? But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I’ve been through hell and back.”Spacey ended his message by saying: “You want to have a conversation? I’m happy to do so, anytime, anyplace. We can even do it here, live on X, if you like. I’ve got nothing to hide. But Guy – you need to grow up. You are not a victim.”Pearce told the Hollywood Reporter that he had raised Spacey’s alleged behaviour with him years later, but he subsequently “had a couple of confrontations with Kevin” that “got ugly”.Speaking last May on NewsNation, Spacey said he believed the#MeToo movementhad “swung very, very far in the direction of unfairness” but that he was “trying to show that I’ve listened. I’ve learned. I’ve got the memo. I feel very strongly that whatever mistakes I’ve made in my life, that I paid a price.”Explore more on these topicsFilmGuy PearceKevin Spacey#MeToo movementnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a bravura performance that more than lived up to its extravagant pre-publication praise. But can his second, The Violet Hour, live up to his first?Cahill himself is more than aware of the reputational tightrope walk that is a creative career. The Violet Hour features a fictional contemporary artist, Thomas Haller, whose own eminence, from the 1990s onwards, is contrasted with the downbeat experience of perhaps equally talented female artists who are hitting their heads against glass ceilings and brick walls. Despite his success as an abstract painter who has defined himself against the YBA aesthetic, Haller has been on the receiving end of one devastatingly negative review, brilliantly and wittily ventriloquised by Cahill. The motives for it turn out to be complicatedly personal.As with Tiepolo Blue, erudite allusions abound, yet there’s a thriller element that keeps you readingAfter the dusty parochialism of Cambridge, the canvas here is broader, more global, more glamorous, cutting between New York, London, Hong Kong, Montreux. But the same theme – art and lies – endures. While Tiepolo Blue featured a Mephistophelean mentor, here we have a svengali in the shape of a European international art dealer, Claude, whose sinister will to power emerges as we turn the pages at increasingly anxious speed.The novel begins with a set-piece scene in London’s Vauxhall in which a young man falls, like Bruegel’s Icarus, from a balcony to his death. Who he is, and what his connection is to Haller, unfolds through complex plotting with calculated dead ends to trip the reader up. Antonioni’s Blow-Up, the classic 1966 film that famously fails to give closure, is name-checked. Another crucial cinematic reference is Douglas Sirk’s Technicolor 1959 melodrama Imitation of Life, stills from which are ultimately revealed as Haller’s inspiration. His seemingly abstract intellectual canvases turn out to be “kitsch”: slavish copies, massively blown up, of minute visual details from the movie. But does that make his art less “real”?As with Tiepolo Blue, erudite allusions abound, yet there’s a thriller element that keeps you reading. This is a novel about art and its moral compromises, and The Violet Hour’s tutelary spirit is that of Henry James, creator of the villainous aesthete Gilbert Osmond and a writer whose work is peculiarly conflicted on the topic of art. James’s comments on his own “fidget of composition” and finding “the next happy twist of my subject” are quoted here by one of the characters, making Cahill as self-consciously implicated a literary artist as the Master himself.Like James, Cahill is brave when it comes to empathising with female characters as a gay man. His portrayal of the unravelling of the lesbian relationship between Haller’s New York gallerist Lorna and her younger lover Justine, through jealousy and professional rivalry, rings true. Prior to meeting Justine, Lorna had been close to the now fabled Thomas Haller at art school in London in the 1990s before later becoming his New York dealer. They had even had a brief, odd sexual encounter, resulting in a pregnancy. Lorna is haunted by the baby boy she gave up for adoption. The plot plays on her desire both to know and not know what has happened to him. Meanwhile she and rival dealer Claude fight it out over the soul of Haller.This is an enthrallingly intricate novel, with a large cast of characters whose stories and psychological hinterlands are successfully interlinked through the mesh of art, money and desire. Lorna and Claude are the dealers, while the buyer on the other side of the equation is Leo Goffman: a billionaire New York real estate mogul and owner of the best collection of modernist art in private hands. He’s a monster. But his cupidity for Picassos, Brâncușis – and Hallers – turns out to be a reaction to trauma, denial and the loss of a child that parallels Lorna’s experience.This novel, which plays so much on ideas of memory and illusion, can perhaps only be fully grasped on rereading. Haller’s career was made by a “retrospective” in New York, and his behaviour in the earlier parts of the story only makes full sense in retrospect.

Here, even the most throwaway descriptive writing – a New York skyline, say, resembling a tray of proffered bottles – is edgily on point. The dialogue at times reads like an accomplished screenplay, to the extent that it seems to be pitching to be simplified for adaptation. Good luck to Cahill if so. But the more subtle Jamesian nuances of this impressive novel, which outstrips its idiosyncratic predecessor in ambition, will be lost in the process.The Violet Hour by James Cahill is published by Sceptre (£18.99).

This one is a sly, garrulous, mischievous piece with something of Lukas Moodysson’s early film Show Me Love; it saunters lightly and entertainingly along, breaking all the screenplay-seminar rules against voiceovers (of which it has lengthy stretches but it never feels oppressive). I can imagine two different sorts of US English-language remake: one which ramps up the wry indie comedy, and another which transfers the emphasis to a dead-serious generational family drama. Neither would have this insouciant flavour.The setting is Oslo and Ella Øverbye plays Johanne, a 17-year-old at high school who is dissatisfied with her life; she lives with single mum Kristin (Ane Dahl Torp) and is also close to her grandmother Karin (Anne Marit Jacobsen). Her world is turned upside–down with the arrival of new teacher Johanna (Selome Emnetu) who is dynamic, charismatic and attractive. Dreamy Johanne nurses a crush on her that escalates to obsession and she becomes deeply in love with this beautiful, inspirational teacher – which plunges her into depression. In desperation, Johanne goes round to see Johanna uninvited, knocks tearfully on her door and Johanna opens it and hugs her, apparently instantly empathetic. Or is there something more? …The key thing is that we are finding out about this (but not all of it) after the event. Johanne has written a sensationally intimate memoir of their relationship that she nervously shows in manuscript to her grandmother Karin, a published poet whose own literary career is in fact fizzling; Karin then shows it to Johanne’s astonished mother. Both hardly know what to think and have tense conversations about whether or not the later, more explicit parts are real or made up: just “dreams”. The director toys with us, not showing these later scenes yet, and letting us wonder if we will ever see them at all.But the older women’s concerns are not merely pastoral. The film shows us that both are astounded at Johanne’s story for different reasons. Karin sees that as a writer and perhaps also as a human being she herself has been timid and tepid compared to her granddaughter; Johanne’s literary work – so daring, so vulnerable – shows her to have more passion and more talent. Kristin, who is at first outraged at evidence of what could be considered abuse but is perhaps nothing of the kind, also comes to respect this extraordinary achievement and thinks publication might be a good idea; she is also clearly uneasy at her own lukewarm emotional life of tentative online dates. She has an amusingly tense conversation with Johanna, who smilingly airs the theory that the pupil could be said to be abusing the teacher.Certainly, that issue might come up if the memoir was published. But would publishing a book like this be a dream come true? A glorious entree into the world of literary celebrity, like Françoise Sagan’s Bonjour Tristesse? Maybe not. This is an amiably talky film, and yet I never for a moment considered that the central relationship was being presented with anything less than seriousness, and there is much dry comedy to be enjoyed.Drømmer (Dreams) screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsDrama filmsNorwayBerlin film festivalFestivalsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Billy has just announcedMuhammad Aliis on his way to South Shields and Sheila, his mother, is aghast: “Why would he want to come here?” Unlikely or not, the world heavyweight champion would indeed spend time in the town in July 1977. “I hope he gets battered,” says the embittered mother.Sheila is more interested in the silver jubilee and the visit of the Queen the day before. For those in the north-east, it was some weekend. Playwright Ishy Din adds more layers still.He takes the radical spirit of the former Cassius Clay, half-pugilist, half-preacher, adds it to the establishment hoo-ha of the royal party’s lap of honour and then mixes in the gobby fury of punk and the racist violence of the National Front. In 1977, he sees a confluence of incendiary forces: reactionary and revolutionary, nihilistic and progressive. In a deprived north-east, you could be pulled in either direction.All this finds voice in Sheila’s South Shields home where her younger son Azeem realises that whether he wants to be a doctor or a dropout, he will still be beaten up for the colour of his skin. Big brother Billy, who has the complexion of his white mother and not of his late Asian father, is torn between being violently outraged by the racism he sees and, with equal violence, joining the opposition.‘Bigger than the Queen’: the day Muhammad Ali blew Tyneside awayRead moreDin cleverly taps into the audience’s emotive memory of this summer weekend while, in Jack McNamara’s production, actors Christina Berriman Dawson, Jack Robertson and Daniel Zareie show the strain of life when the personal becomes political. Outside pressures turn them into a family of love and loathing.Champion is at its best when Amy Watts’s set becomes a boxing ring where these conflicts ignite. The play loses energy when it pulls towards the small and domestic, sustained more by its themes than dramatic momentum. Although rich in ideas, it does not quite find a story to equal the extraordinary symbolism of Ali’s arrival. In the closing moments, we are more persuaded by the joy of Ali’s parade through town than a sense of resolution for the embattled family.Champion is atLive theatre, Newcastle, until 8 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMuhammad AliBoxingNewcastlereviewsShareReuse this content"

The counterintuitives don’t end there. There’s no Wagnerian-scale orchestra of 90-plus players in this Ring either; instead, just 22 heroically committed musicians give their all in a skilfully reduced version rescored by conductor Ben Woodward.Nor is the nearly 15 hours of action mounted on a conventional stage. Instead, this Ring is performed in the round, in an in-your-face way that grips the attention. Everything is acted out on a raised white oblong not much bigger than the York Hall canvas on which Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua began their careers. Call it the Ring in the ring if you choose.Like Alberich, I am irresistibly drawn to to the Ring. But instead of 100 I’ve got 18 musicians…Read moreBut declare it a knockout too. For, although the Regents Ring is a very different experience from Wagner in the opera house, the intensity and involvement is remarkably undiminished and even enhanced. When you consider how much money, planning and labour it takes to stage Wagner’s cycle, and remember how opera houses have faltered in the task recently, this Ring, which has still cost more than half a million pounds, is something of a marvel, andwith not an Arts Councilgrant in sight.Woodward and the Berlin-based director Caroline Staunton (who contributes useful essays in the programme book) have built their Ring up gradually since 2022.Das Rheingoldwas first performed in 2022, Die Walküre a year later, andSiegfriedlast February, all in the Freemasons’ Hall in Covent Garden. This month’s Götterdämmerung now provides the final part of the project.View image in fullscreen‘Singing with a lieder singer’s attention to text’ – Ralf Lukas as Wotan and Catharine Woodward (Brunnhilde) in part of Regents Opera’s Ring cycle.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty ImagesTrue, this is not the Ring of one’s dreams, if such a thing is ever possible. There are manifest faults and rough edges. The staging can be gnomic, and the string tone in Woodward’s band sometimes gets thin towards the end of a long act. Overwhelmingly, though, the ears and eyes adjust, and driven by Woodward’s urgent conducting, you don’t spend the evening wondering where the Wagner tubas or the timpani have got to.What lifts this Ring above the level of an admirable oddity are two things. First, the minimalist proximity of the staging – a few movable white blocks serve multiple purposes – and the almost total absence of sets means the focus is relentlessly on character and psychology. The chief beneficiary of this is Siegfried, who under Staunton’s insightful direction is permanently struggling – even in his death scene – to understand his identity and his relationship with the world.It also helps that the main roles are so reliably sung. More than that, indeed, in the case of Ralf Lukas’s Wotan, who brought the well-schooled vocalism of a long career in German opera houses to the Ring master’s role. In Das Rheingold, Lukas was perhaps less impactful than James Schouten’s sinuous and articulate Loge and Oliver Gibbs’s dark-toned and implacable Alberich. In Die Walküre and as the Wanderer in Siegfried, however, Lukas sang with a consistently elevated authority and a lieder singer’s attention to text.View image in fullscreen‘Fire and intelligence’… Brian Smith Walters as Siegmund and Justine Viani as Sieglinde in Die Walküre, part of Regent’s Opera Ring Cycle.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianNeither Catharine Woodward’s Brünnhilde nor Peter Furlong’s Siegfried, admirable though each was, quite reached that level. Woodward, though, was an immensely sympathetic and committed Brünnhilde throughout, and she saved her best till last in a Götterdämmerung immolation scene of vocal distinction and probing understanding. Furlong’s light-voiced Siegfried was indefatigable in this most punishing of roles, as well as attractively sung.Elsewhere, Justine Viani was notable for the fire and intelligence of her Sieglinde and Gutrune, and Andrew Mayor made as much as one can out of Donner and Gunther. Brian Smith Walters was a gutsy and gritty Siegmund, Simon Wilding a commanding Hagen, and Henry Grant Kerswell an affecting Fasolt. Holden Madagame acted outstandingly as Mime, though the upper voice had little body. Mae Heydorn was a hypnotic Erda (as well as singing a Rhinemaiden and a Norn), and Corinne Hart an unusually interesting Woodbird.Staunton’s direction offers insights, puzzles and some jokes. As the Wanderer, Wotan turns up as an electrician to fix the lights. The production has its own leitmotivs, including a fire extinguisher as a murder weapon, a frock worn by three different characters, and occasional bursts of shadow boxing, presumably a homage to the setting.

That was what he claimed, at any rate. Yet the facts of the matter remain mysterious. The story goes that James – already king of Scotland and future king of England – was out hunting, when one of his entourage, the handsome young Alexander Ruthven, suggested they stop in at his family seat of Gowrie House. After lunch, he invited James to accompany him to another part of the castle. As they made their way, he locked one door after another behind them, the king apparently making no objection.Minutes later, a tower window was flung open and James’s soldiers in the courtyard below caught a glimpse of their master screaming, “Treason! Treason! Treason!” before he was dragged back out of sight by Alexander. Using hammers to smash their way through the series of locked doors, they burst in to find the king holding Alexander at bay with his hunting knife. They instantly slew Alexander, and soon after, his older brother the Earl of Gowrie, who was racing to his aid.The most striking lesson of this propulsive biography is just how brutal life was 450 years agoThe details of the story don’t add up. If it had been a conspiracy between the two brothers, why had Lord Gowrie seemed surprised when the king’s party arrived that day? Why hadn’t James smelled a rat when Alexander started locking doors? And what are we to make of his later claim that the reason he went off alone with Alexander was because he’d said he had “a crock of gold” to show him?According to Gareth Russell’s confident, compelling new biography of James I, the most likely explanation is that the supposed murder attempt was in fact a lovers’ tryst that somehow turned nasty, causing James to panic. It may also have been the moment when his heavily pregnant wife, Anna, first realised the truth about her husband’s sexuality. Not the first English monarch to have same-sex affairs, and not the last, he seems to have gone looking for “a crock of gold” (the phrase became a running joke in Scotland) with a series of beautiful young men throughout his reign. Despite that fact, and the slightly lurid title of this book, the author doesn’t give undue attention to James’s boyfriends. He devotes time, too, to his love for his wife, to whom he once declared, “God is my witness that I ever preferred you to all my bairns, much more than to any subject.”After Anna’s death in 1619, James, by then addled by heavy drinking, became more open in his affairs with men. This was particularly the case with George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, whom he addressed in letters as “my only sweet wife”. For his part, Buckingham addressed him as “husband”, and “Dad and Master”, once declaring that he looked forward to having his “legs soon in my arms”. Make of that what you will: it’s the raciest detail we get in a book that largely avoids prurience, providing a sober, rounded portrait of James Stuart, which rescues him from the caricature, product of later parliamentarian bias, of the slobbering (not true) weakling (also not true) who was forever fiddling with his codpiece (there is no contemporary evidence for this). Instead we meet a complicated man, an obsessive hunter, an intellectual who wrote decent poetry and books, superstitious, impulsive, passionate, and above all, deeply paranoid.This last detail is little wonder. The most striking lesson of this propulsive biography is just how brutal life was 450 years ago. James’s appalling father was strangled before he was one year old. At the age of five, he saw his grandfather slain. He never knew his mother, Mary Queen of Scots, who was later beheaded by her cousin. And so it went on. As well as distrustful, these traumatic experiences left him with a hysterical sense of his own divinity, but also wily and highly practical when it came to power politics and his own survival.The same cannot be said for his son and heir. Although he was a friend of Buckingham, Charles I never, so far as we know, sought a crock of gold. He inherited his father’s conviction he could do no wrong, but without the terrorising childhood that might have persuaded him to tread more carefully. Thus the stage was set for the civil war, and the block prepared for his head.Queen James: The Life and Loves of Britain’s First King by Gareth Russell is published by William Collins (£25).

Now it’s hard not to see its influence everywhere, especially in films with a distinctly feminist, queer or queer-adjacent vibe, such as this one from Austrian directors Milena Czernovsky and Lilith Kraxner. Although it doesn’t conclude with any extreme Akermanian violence, Bluish closely observes the rituals of daily life for its two twentysomething protagonists, favouring long takes and deep-breath editing rhythms to explore the quotidian.Although we never learn the pronouns Errol (Leonie Bramberger) prefers, their name suggests a non-binary disposition and when it comes to romance they seem to mostly prefer other Afab (“assigned female at birth”) people, like a cute young thing seemingly met through a dating app.That encounter is one of the dramatic highlights because a lot of the rest of the movie is just watching Errol sitting around, attending a Zoom university lesson, taking a shower after swimming, and generally mooching about. Russophone Sasha (Natasha Goncharova) is fractionally more active and chatty, and seems to have a boyfriend who is so boring the camera can’t even be bothered to record his face. She works with another possibly non-binary artist, helping to prepare for an art show, and likes to dance, either by herself or at parties.The two main characters’ stories kind of converge, but narrative seems less important here than simple moving-image portraiture. The frames are carefully composed and care has clearly been taken with the colour palette (unsurprising given the title); nearly every textile and surface is mostly shades of blue with the odd pop of pink or white, as if the design were based on the trans flag. The result is decorative and watchable, if a bit too oblique for casual consumption.Bluish is at the ICA, London, from 21 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsLGBTQ+ rightsChantal AkermanreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a kind of mother-courage true story: the case of Eunice Paiva, a Brazilian woman who had to keep her family together and shield her five children from despair when her activist husband Rubens was brutally “disappeared” in 1971 by the military dictatorship. They refused even to admit he had been arrested, or later officially admit his death, in a state-sanctioned act of cruelty which was only finally acknowledged in the mid-90s after decades of campaigning, when the government issued a formal death certificate.I’m Still Here is a drama which intelligently seeks to intuit the courageously maintained calm that Eunice imposes on herself and the children when the thuggish secret police arrive. Torres is effectively the still centre of a heartfelt but also somehow numbed and sometimes even strangely placid story. The film shows Eunice’s instinctive sense that overt outrage would be interpreted as leftist defiance and guilt. But it also shows her in some sense going into denial, rejecting the horror which is too much to process – even more horrifying as she herself is briefly taken into custody along with one of her children and tortured. She appears to be wordlessly telling everyone: just stay level, try to fabricate some normality at home, and soon it will all be over, and Rubens will return.As their certainty that Rubens is alive sadly leaks away, the family move from Rio to São Paulo and a flashforward takes us to the bitter, compromised victory of them receiving the death certificate 25 years later. We also see Eunice’s new prominence as a human-rights campaigner for Indigenous peoples, though without showing us the passion and radicalised personal awakening that lay behind this new vocation.Film-maker Walter Salles: ‘Cinema, as opposed to noise, used to be at the heart of the Oscars’Read moreFor me, the film – in its procedural loyalty to Eunice’s own self-control – overlooks the horror and anger that must surely be somewhere in this story, too. When Eunice’s daughter arrives home from a trip away in London, she is disturbed by her mother’s weirdly dissociated blankness as she strains to keep it together. “Mom, are you OK?” she asks, which is a question that the audience might want to ask of the film. Eunice never cries.We get some sentences over the final credits telling us briefly on what date Rubens was murdered, and also the date on which four security officers were finally charged but not convicted; it is retroactively disconcerting. There is a world of drama and outrage in those brief, bald statements, but it never really arrives in the preceding film. Yet, this might well be precisely the experiences of the families of the “disappeared”, their emotional responses stunted and amputated by the state. It’s a very intelligent performance from Torres.I’m Still Here is in UK and Irish cinemas from 21 February, and in Australian cinemas from 27 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWalter SallesBrazilPeriod and historical filmsAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than put me off, the scent heightened my appetite for the cheese blowout that was to come.Sat at a wooden communal table inside the pine-walled restaurant run by the farm’s owner, Blandine Dunoyer, I waited for the bonanza of mountain comfort food: fondue savoyarde, tartiflette, raclette, thendiots(smoked pork sausages) with polenta. Somehow, I found room forpotée savoyarde, a rib-sticking dish of slow-cooked pork shoulder, cabbage and potatoes, then a round of top-notch alpine cheese,reblochonandtomme desavoie, before a creamy blueberry dessert.Samoëns map, FranceOn the other side of the restaurant wall, a large window revealed the barn where Blandine’s 84 cows are kept. On our side, with wine and an aperitif, the meal came to €33 each. It was a reminder that not everything in Samoëns revolves around skiing, despite being part ofGrand Massif, the fourth largest ski domain in the French Alps. Agriculture and wine production are still very much at the forefront of this pretty, medieval village about 38 miles (60km) east of Geneva, and the only French ski resort to be classified as a “national monument”.View image in fullscreenThe cheese course at Ferme Dunoyer restaurant in Samoëns.Photograph: Mary NovakovichThere certainly is a sense of timelessness about Samoëns when you stand in Place du Gros Tilleul in front of the giant lime tree (the eponymous Gros Tilleul) which has been there since 1438. Its covered market, first established on a Wednesday in 1355, has kept the same weekly date since then. Opposite is the imposing 16th-century Our Lady of Assumption church, whose stonemasons took their craft around Europe and as far as Louisiana, developing a reputation for being among the best. You can see their work among the old stone houses decked with flowers along the narrow lanes in the old heart of the village.For such a tiny wine region – one of the smallest in France – Savoie has an extraordinary variety of grapes and terroirsWith the Grand Massif’s 165 miles of pistes off limits to me, thanks to a ski injury, I was free to explore the food and drink side of Samoëns more thoroughly. I had the excellent fortune to be here during the Vignerons font du ski, a wine festival held every January in which producers from around France join local winemakers to offer tastings to anyone who pays €5 for a wine glass. Under the stone vaulted ceilings of the village’s former stables, I met Adrien Vallier, whose Domaine Vallier is about six miles from Samoëns and produces agreeably dry white wine from the indigenous gringet grape within the Ayse appellation. He took over the winery in 2018 from his grandmother, whose great-grandfather first planted the vines in 1896.View image in fullscreenPastry chef Ana de la Fuente demonstrating piping in her patisserie class.Photograph: Mary NovakovichAlthough Adrien had spent his younger years picking grapes (he’s now 46), he had to learn the wine business quickly. It evidently worked, as he now sells his wine to Michelin-starred restaurants, in addition to his winter job as a ski instructor and co-founder ofZigZag ski school.For such a tiny wine region – one of the smallest in France – Savoie has an extraordinary variety of grapes and terroirs. As it stretches from Lake Geneva down towards Grenoble, perhaps that’s not so surprising. Martin Girat, who ownsLe Nez en l’Airwine shop in the centre of the village, explained: “There’s a big difference in climate, and the sunshine is completely different. In Bordeaux you have six varieties – in Savoie it’s in the 20s.”With wine comes its best pal, cheese, and the Fromagerie Fruitière des Hauts de Savoie, the village’s cheese cooperative and food shop where farmers bring their milk to be transformed into reblochon, is a must-visit. Among the tomme de savoie, abondance, raclette, tomme boudanne and various goat’s cheeses for sale, I spotted the small white discs ofcrioutin, a fresh cow’s milk cheese created by cheese farmer Aurore Delesmillières at Ferme du Criou and which is a local staple.On a slow, contemplative walk while the moon rose, our senses were heightened as we breathed in cold, pine-scented airI had already tasted another speciality from Samoëns at the restaurant of my hotel, the Neige et Roc:soupe châtrée, which turns the simple combination of stale bread, heaps of tomme de savoie and a slow-cooked onion broth, into something quite luscious. It was so thick it had to be cut with a knife.In contrast to all this hearty rusticity, I joined one of the regular patisserie-making classes run by professional pastry chefAna de la Fuentein her airy and immaculate home in the village. We attempted – and more or less succeeded – in making a charlotte russe, a concoction of soft biscuits, whipped vanilla ganache and pear jam. And it tasted quite splendid.View image in fullscreenA timeless scene … Samoëns at 1,600 metres.Photograph: Mary NovakovichAlthough I was missing the slopes, the joys of being in the mountains were in full force – I basked in the sunshine on the slopeside restaurant terrace ofLou Caboënsat 1,600 metres and strolled in the snow, taking in the views of Mont Blanc from the sunny Col de Joux Plane. This is where you’ll see some of the 26 miles of cross-country ski trails, as well as an exhilarating toboggan run. Fans ofcold water swimmingcan immerse themselves under careful supervision (from sports coach Florian Milesi) at Lac aux Dames on the outskirts of the village, followed by a session in amobile sauna. And ice-skaters can take a spin round the huge outdoor rink in the centre.Perhaps the best combination of snow, food and wine came about on a snowshoe hike at dusk in the woods near the hamlet of La Rosière. Our guide, Hervé Martinez, led us on a slow, contemplative walk while the moon rose, our senses heightened as we breathed in cold, pine-scented air. Our reward after 90 minutes was a fondue savoyarde prepared by Hervé in a tepee, with a wine-tasting session with his friend Julien Ettel (who runs online wine business Livino). Sounds of conviviality coming out of that teepee as we glugged and gorged echoed through the otherwise silent forest, bringing a delicious warmth to a cold winter’s night.

Age has made me slightly less generous; we’ve all chewed our way through dusty scatterings of flour and stodgy doughs that, delicious as they may have been, could, honestly, also have been a lot better. Fortunately, perfection here is not difficult.Prep10 minCook40 minServes6-8800g rhubarb40g demerara sugar, or white sugarA pinch of spice(ginger, cinnamon – optional)For the crumble topping150g plain flour75g demerara sugar¼ tsp salt75g ground almonds170g chilled unsalted butter25g skin-on almonds, or other nuts (optional)1 A note on the fruitView image in fullscreenNigella reckonsrhubarb is “the best crumble in the world”, but the recipe can, of course, be adapted to other fruit, according to both taste and season (or, indeed, to frozen fruit at any time of year); for other options see step 8. The fruit will be hidden underneath the topping, so crumble is also a great use for less lovely thicker or greener stems of rhubarb, underripe stone fruit, gluts of apples, etc.2 A note on the flourPut the flour in a large bowl. I’ve used plain for simplicity’s sake, but crumble will work with most flours, with the proviso that some will absorb more moisture than others and as a result give less crisp results – I particularly like rye, spelt or other nutty-flavoured flours. And note that you can substitute gluten-free flour with no other changes.3 Make the toppingView image in fullscreenAdd the sugar, salt and the ground almonds to the flour (again, other ground nuts will work well instead, or feel free to leave them out entirely and simply make up the difference with extra flour).Coarsely grate or finely dice the butter, then rub it into the dry ingredients with your fingertips, until the mix is fairly well combined but still lumpy – you shouldn’t be able to see butter, but nor should the mixture be homogenous.View image in fullscreen4 Chill the crumble mixWet your hands with cold water, then briefly toss the dough until it’s in small clumps. Spread these out on a lined baking tray and put in the freezer for 10 minutes, or chill for at least 20 minutes and up to 48 hours. (Alternatively, you can work well ahead and keep batches in the freezer for later use; you can bake the crumble mix straight from frozen.)5 Prepare the rhubarbView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Wash the rhubarb, then trim away any leaves or discoloured ends and chop the stalks into roughly 3cm lengths.Put these, with the moisture from washing still clinging to them, in a medium baking dish just big enough to hold all the rhubarb (if your dish is too large, you’ll run out of topping).6 Toss the rhubarb in the sugarPour the demerara sugar evenly over the rhubarb and toss well to coat (you can use white or soft brown sugar, if you prefer, with the caveat that the darker the sugar, the darker the result. I sometimes substitute a few spoonfuls of syrup from the jar of stem ginger, or honey). Add a pinch of spice, if you like – ginger or cinnamon work well, as does grated orange zest.7 Top with the crumble and bakeView image in fullscreenTip the chilled crumble mix on top of the fruit, level it out reasonably evenly, then bake for about 30 minutes, until starting to colour. Meanwhile, roughly chop the extra nuts, if using, then, when the half-hour is up, scatter these on top of the crumble and bake for 10 minutes more, until the topping is crisp and golden and the fruit below bubbling. Serve with custard, cream or ice-cream.8 Variations on the themeCrumbles are very forgiving – you can use the same weight of apples (cooking, dessert or a mixture), pears, plums, mangoes, pineapple … in fact, you can use almost anything you have, adjusting the sugar according to the sweetness of the fruit. Juicier fruit such as berries might benefit from being tossed with a tablespoon of cornflour before cooking, to help absorb those juices. You can also use frozen fruit, in which case there is no need to thaw it before baking.9 Optional extrasView image in fullscreenAdjust extras to suit the fruit. Tropical fruits would suggest adding lime zest and nutmeg to the fruit mix, and perhaps some flaked coconut in the crumble topping. Plums, meanwhile, are lovely with orange zest and star anise (remember to fish out the latter when you serve!) and apples cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and walnuts. A dash of booze, such as rum, brandy or amaretto, will rarely go amiss, either.Explore more on these topicsDessertFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodFruitWinter food and drinkBritish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even when the fridge is shockingly bare, an enticing meal still sits at your fingertips, so long as you have the right ingredients to hand in your cupboards. This sriracha mayo twist on the fish finger sandwich is a 10/10 “pantry raider”. The Kewpie mayonnaise brings umami oomph, with the crunch of fish fingers, the tang of cornichons and the warmth of sriracha and chilli against soft, crustless bread.
