All his buildings had a certain postmodernist swagger, but one of his most conspicuous (ironically, in view of its function) was the headquarters of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, on the site of the former Vauxhall pleasure gardens.Completed in 1994, MI6 showed Farrell, who has died aged 87, in his postmodern pomp, energetically juggling historicist motifs to conjure a flamboyant, flesh-coloured fortress, replete with ziggurats and crenellations, dominating its Thames-side locale. Deyan Sudjic described MI6 as “an epitaph for the architecture of the 80s”, and its styling that which “could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple or a piece of clanking art-deco machinery”. Others were less complimentary: “Ceaușescu Towers”, pronounced one critic.Visitors to his penthouse would be greeted by giant model biplanes and ornamental pools containing koi carpFamously, in a case of art imitating life, the MI6 building featured in several James Bond films as home of the fictional 00 section, assailed by assorted villains and eventually reduced to rubble in the2015 epic Spectre.Farrell would have doubtless relished this cinematic conjunction of architecture and popular culture. His buildings were nothing if not scenographic, always ready for their closeup.View image in fullscreen‘An epitaph for the architecture of the 80s’ … Farrell’s MI6 building.Photograph: Moussa81/Getty Images/iStockphotoFurther down the Thames there was more art deco clanking with the equally exuberant Embankment Place (1990), an office block suspended over Charing Cross train station, reminiscent of a colossal Wurlitzer organ emerging from the pit of a 1930s cinema. Augmenting the trio of Londongrands projetswas Alban Gate (1987), which replaced an outmoded 1960s office block on London Wall with a heroically scaled tower connecting the City and the Barbican. Wrapped in horizontal bands of glass and sugar pink granite, it formed a candy-striped counterpoint to the Barbican’s more effacing modernist milieu.Farrell also designed the nerve centre for TV-am (1983), remodelling a former car showroom on the edge of a canal in Camden Town to house the brave new dawn of British breakfast television, topping it off with perky finials in the form of giant yellow and blue egg cups. Long after the demise of TV-am, one even turned up on the Antiques Roadshow.Originally in partnership with Nicholas Grimshaw before setting up his own practice in 1980, Farrell’s rise coincided with the emergence of postmodernism, catalysed by the polemics ofarchitectural theorist Charles Jencks. His three-year collaboration with Jencks on what was to become theCosmic Housewas pivotal. Farrell was first approached by Jencks in 1978 to remodel a Victorian townhouse in London’s Holland Park and over time the project became a built manifesto and poster child for postmodernism, festooned in layers of metaphor and symbolism, both arcane and whimsical. Now Grade I listed, it was the first house from the postwar era to achieve this distinction.View image in fullscreenPerky finials … Farrell’s TV-am studios in London.Photograph: Richard BryantSome detractors saw Farrell’s conspicuously decorative buildings as mere fripperies but, beneath his genial exterior, he was always intensely serious, striving to make architecture more communicative and uplifting, at a time when modernism seemed to have finally run its course. It proved a successful formula and by the early 90s, his practice had rapidly expanded from modest atelier to international operation, with offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai to capitalise on the architectural and economic liberalisation precipitated by China’s building boom.Farrell first visited Hong Kong in 1964 on a travelling scholarship and China was always close to his heart. The practice’s initial foray into east Asia came as a result of winning an international competition for Hong Kong’s Peak Tower in 1997. Variously likened to a wok, boat and cupped hands, the tower’s crescent-shaped profile quickly became a local landmark, even featuring for a time on Hong Kong’s $20 banknote. Subsequent projects in the region included the 442m-high KK100 skyscraper in Shenzhen (2012), at the time the tallest building to be designed by a British architect.He was also perhaps the only architect to have a train named after him – the “Sir Terry Farrell”, a Class 222 locomotive unit, operating on the east coast mainline between King’s Cross and Hull, in recognition of Farrell designing The Deep, Hull’s giant aquarium, which opened in 2002.View image in fullscreenFarrell in his flat above his former aircraft factory office.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverFarrell’s London office occupied a former aircraft factory just off Edgware Road, which had turned out Spitfires during the war. Its art deco styling was a curiously apt synthesis of ornament and industry, and for more than 20 years, Farrell lived above the shop in an airy and richly decorated penthouse, where visitors would be greeted by ornamental pools containing koi carp and giant model biplanes suspended from steel roof trusses.Towards the end of his career, Farrell was drawn back to Newcastle, where he grew up and studied architecture. Familiar with the city’s layers of history and topographic drama, he added to it with the Centre for Life and masterplans for the University and Quayside (he was also a talented urban designer). Latterly, he helped to fund theFarrell Centre, set in Newcastle’s Victorian Claremont Buildings, which were remodelled by two local practices.Spies, eggcups and penthouses: Sir Terry Farrell’s best buildings – in picturesRead moreHis idea was that every city should have an “urban room”, where people could learn more about the forces shaping architecture and urban design. The project typified Farrell’s belief in the importance of connecting directly with the public. For him, architecture was not simply about the creation of monuments – though over time, he had his fair share of those – but how it was part of wider popular and social culture.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureTerry FarrellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Schrödinger’s very own guest feline at theLabourparty conference in Liverpool. The man who is both there and not there.Not invited on to the main stage, but the star attraction at countless fringe events. The man no cabinet minister dares mention by name, yet who is seemingly buried deep in everyone’s subconscious. Living rent-free in the heads of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. The man who is making a leadership bid and not making a leadership bid.Andy Burnhamis the man who likes to have it every which way.You also have to ask yourself why these things keep happening to Andy. It just doesn’t seem fair somehow. There he was just giving a front page interview to the Daily Telegraph on the eve of the conference about how the government was lacking leadership and needed a change of direction, and somehow people just jumped to the conclusion that he was putting himself in the frame to be the next prime minister.There he was giving a 5,000-word interview to the editor of the New Statesman just before the party conference in which he spelled out his vision for Britain, and yet again people put two and two together and make five, assuming he is positioning himself to replace Keir.And there he was talking to various broadcast outlets about how various Labour MPs had been begging him to quit as mayor of Greater Manchester and return to Westminster as the leader-in-waiting. From king of the north to top of the world, ma. And still people were talking behind his back, saying the guy has designs on Keir’s job. Just how much more unlucky can Andy get?You might conclude that Burnham is a shit conspirator. A good plot requires organisation and timing. His has had nothing but ambition going for it. His immediate leadership bid was all but dead on arrival. There was no momentum. If he had friends in high places, they thought better of making themselves known. For now.Maybe the Andy drum will beat louder next May if Labour suffers a wipeout in the Welsh, Scottish and regional elections. For now he stays in Manchester.But what you can’t deny is that Andy has a charm that many other leaders just don’t have. He is a good storyteller – essential for any politician – and is at ease with himself. Where Starmer and Kemi Badenoch appear awkward in public, Andy comes across as a regular kind of guy. Even when you know he’s not. He’s a politician through and through. A man who has always had one eye on the big prize. Yet somehow you forgive him for it. Even when you suspect he’s telling you what you want to hear.Those qualities were all on show on Monday at a fringe event organised by the Guardian. He was just having a low-key conference, he insisted. Hadn’t been out at any bars. Was looking forward to going to the football that night.Leadership campaign? That was all just a big misunderstanding. He had merely been trying to be helpful, but somehow things had all got a bit out of hand. The Telegraph interview had been overwritten and inaccurate. Who would ever have imagined that a rightwing paper might do that to a Labour politician? The very idea.Andy leaned in. Daring the audience to fall into his eyes. There wasn’t a disloyal bone in his body. In the past week he had been working tirelessly behind the scenes with survivors so the government could announce its Hillsborough law at the conference. You couldn’t say fairer than that. All he wanted was for Labour to put its best foot forward at next year’s elections. To give councillors a decent story to tell on the doorstep. To offer a hopeful alternative to the division and discrimination of Reform. As I said, Burnham is good at stories.And no, he had never suggested that Labour break its fiscal rules and stop worrying about the bond markets. He would never borrow to spend. Merely to invest in more social housing. The thing you needed to know about the fiscal rules was that they were elastic. Here was the thing. The stronger the fiscal rules, the more you could bend them to your will. He made it sound all very plausible. His sentences washed over you.

Back in the Blair-Brown years, dissent among Labour MPs was tolerated. That was healthy. Now not so much. But look, Andy had some sympathy for Keir. Labour had inherited an economy that was on its knees and it was always going to be hard to turn things round. Especially within a year. It was just that time was not on Labour’s side. People needed change they could feel and recognise. Andy’s change.Now Burnham was on a roll. Out came some old favourites. Cheaper rail and bus fares. More social housing. The end of the two-child benefit cap. Electoral reform. All crowd pleasers. All easy to offer. Not so easy to deliver. But that wasn’t the point. With Nigel Farage you have to fight fire with fire. Promise the world. Work out how to make it happen later. It’s all about the plausibility.We ended back where we started. With Andy insisting a leadership challenge – why did people keep bringing this up? – had never been on the cards. “I’m Manchester through and through,” he said. “I’m not a Westminster person.”That’s odd. He certainly sounds like one. Maybe it’s just that he’s one of those guys who these things happen too. Some people are born great. Some achieve greatness. Others have greatness thrust upon them.“I’m just trying to be helpful,” he said again as the packed audience began to disperse. Hmm. If this is him being helpful, I dare say Starmer wouldn’t want to encounter him when he’s being difficult.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamThe politics sketchLabour conferenceLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Many words have already been written about the good in Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film – some say “masterpiece” – includinga five-star review in the Guardian. The electrifying pace of the action; that instant-classic car chase sequence and Benicio del Toro’s heroically chill Sensei Sergio, have all been justly praised. So let’s take this as read.But if a film is worth seeing, then it’s worth taking seriously, and in this case that involves asking: dear, revered PTA, what is up with you and Black women? We know Anderson is careful and deliberate in his introduction of a racial dimension to this story. We know this because in the original 1990 novel, Vineland by Thomas Pynchon, the character corresponding to Perfidia Beverly Hills (played by Teyana Taylor), is white, with “fluorescent” blue eyes. Her daughter (played by mixed-race Chase Infiniti) is also therefore white, and while the race of the character corresponding to the other prominent Black woman in the film – Deandra, played by Regina Hall – is not specified, she is usually presumed to be white.Sometimes film-makers go the other way with books about American history, and that’s tricky too. When Sofia Coppola adapted The Beguiled into a 2017 film starring Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst, she meticulouslyexcised all the Black and mixed-race female characters from Thomas P Cullinan’s civil war-set novel, so that this southern belle soft-life fantasia needn’t be troubled by the brutal realities of the 19th-century slave economy.In this context, there’s lots to celebrate about Anderson’s approach. The actors themselves all deliver commanding, compelling performances and, though she’s underused, it’s always a treat to see Regina Hall demonstrate her phenomenal range (For more of this,see her in 2018’s Support the Girls). There is also something undeniably timely (probably too late, actually) about the at-once farcical and terrifying spectacle of a paramilitary border force harassing teenagers at a high-school dance and raiding the “little Latino Harriet Tubman situation” going on at Sensei Sergio’s place.It would be fair to say that Anderson has boldly stepped up to a moment in American history which requires artists to be bold. Sadly, it seems – with regard to the intersection of race and gender, at least – he’s bitten off more than he can chew. This begins with the character of Perfidia, who is hyper-sexualised way beyond the normal horniness that firework-lighting in the company of late-eraLeonardo DiCapriomight arouse. This is a woman who prioritises getting off over getting away from an imminently exploding bomb. When she abandons her family, the given reason is that she resents having to compete for her man’s attention with a newborn baby. Her own baby.View image in fullscreenCompelling … Regina Hall (Deandra) in One Battle After Another.Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/AlamySurely a more plausible explanation would have been that her commitment to the cause made it necessary to put the revolution first? Ie, the same reasoning male ideologues have been using to justify neglecting their families for time immemorial? But no, Anderson went for extreme horniness instead. This is a choice. Just like it was a choice to name another of his Black female revolutionary characters “Junglepussy” – inspired by the performer’s real stage name, a sexualised spin on the old racist slur “jungle bunny”. Or to have Perfidia express her principled defiance of the fascistic state with the phrase “this pussy don’t pop for you”. (Note to white male screenwriters: not every Black woman talks like Cardi B. And even Cardi B doesn’t sound like a Cardi B record all the time.)These are choices which indicate that Anderson is unaware of theracist Jezebel trope, which originated during the endemic sexual exploitation of chattel slavery and has been perpetuated by American pop culture in various guises ever since. Either that, or he’s expressing a Tarantino-esque overconfidence in his ability to radically repurpose derogatory language and imagery which is not – and has never been – directed at him.‘I’m a hustler, a grinder’: Teyana Taylor on music, motherhood and One Battle After AnotherRead moreAlso Tarantino-esque, and not in a good way, is the film’s fetishised depiction of interracial relationships. The most overtly icky of these is the one between Perfidia and Colonel Lockjaw, a white supremacist grotesque played by Sean Penn as a collection of lascivious tics in military gear. There’s a scene in which Lockjaw sidles up to Bob (DiCaprio) and whispers: “Do you like Black girls? I love them.” This is intended to demonstrate the character’s repellence, but would be much more effective as such, if we hadn’t just seen lovable Bob describe his attraction to Perfidia in pretty much the same terms, moments earlier. Or Avon Barksdale from The Wire (aka actor Wood Harris) fondly describing his girlfriend Alana Haim as “an ordinary, working white girl”. In the OBAA worldview, all interracial relationships are apparently founded on a race kink, with the possibility of genuine connection only ever a happy after-thought. (Yes, PTA is in a relationship with a Black or mixed-race woman, Maya Rudolph, and no, such personal circumstances do not absolve a film-maker from the need to consider the points I’m raising.)Sorry to complicate your enjoyment of your new favourite film. I know pointing this out risks upsetting those Letterboxd loyalists who can brook no challenge whatsoever to their favourite film-maker. To them I say: please don’t worry yourselves unduly about Anderson’s feelings. He’s a big boy. I promise you; he can take it. And also, I’d refer you again to the film’s title, which is really another way of expressing that old revolutionary’s credo about being in it for the long haul, accepting that the necessary change likely won’t happen in our lifetimes, but we’ve got to keep at it, all the same: The revolution continues, one battle after another. Maybe we’ll get it right next time.This article was amended on 29 September 2025 to clarify that name of the One Battle After Another character Junglepussy is the same as the performer’s own stage name.Explore more on these topicsFilmPaul Thomas AndersonRaceLeonardo DiCaprioAction and adventure filmsThrillersWomencommentShareReuse this content"

You want to be in their company for everStuart HeritageMon 29 Sep 2025 05.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 05.33 EDTShareWhen the time comes to look back on this part of Seth Rogen’s career,The Studiois destined to dominate everything else. This makes perfect sense. He co-created it, co-wrote it, stars as its lead, convinced the great and good of Hollywood to be in it with him and directed it with such a vaulting sense of ambition that, when itwon more Emmysthan any other comedy in history a few weeks ago, nobody even flinched. The Studio is the show that has cemented Rogen’s status as a comic visionary.However, if I might offer a small footnote here: Platonic is pretty great, too.True, Platonic will almost certainly go down as Rogen’s other show. It’s far less striving than The Studio. It’s not full of dazzling one-take scenes, nor is it jam-packed with A-list guest stars. It has far less to say about the state of anything at all. But Platonic’s second season is wrapping up, so now is the time to state that, pound for pound, it may actually qualify as his most enjoyable show.If you’ve yet to see it, Platonic is a sitcom about two people (Rogen as Will andRose Byrneas Sylvia), who have to navigate the difficulties that come with being old friends with someone of the opposite sex. There’s a bracing lack of sexual or romantic undercurrent to their friendship, but that doesn’t stop their romantic partners from occasionally becoming suspicious of their motives. The bigger problem is the co-dependency that has formed between them over the years, which intermittently rears up and forces them to act like petulant teenagers when they’re together.View image in fullscreenA bracing lack of sexual undercurrent … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Paul Sarkis/Apple TV+If that sounds low stakes, that’s really the intention. Once the premise has been established (which takes an episode and a half), Platonic simply becomes an opportunity for Rogen and Byrne to hang out and be as charismatic as possible. And it turns out that is spectacularly charismatic. Rogen, to some degree, plays a version ofSeth Rogenwe have seen onscreen before. He’s juvenile, unambitious and trapped in a state of arrested development. This is something he has always been good at. Rose Byrne, on the other hand, is an absolute revelation.When Byrne is onscreen, it’s difficult to look at anything else. As the more mature of the partnership – she is married with children, while Rogen is not – you’d expect her to be the straight woman, but in reality she is an explosion of heightened reaction shots. In every scene, her face spirals through a spectrum of microexpressions, landing on the least-expected choice. Her timing is pin sharp. She has the broad physicality of a silent movie star. I recently found myself watching28 Weeks Later, and found myself bored to tears by her staid performance, but to see her so effortlessly outshine comic performers of the highest calibre in Platonic is to wish that she had always done this sort of thing.This goes double for the current season. Overall, it’s a little more fractured than the first – a plot about Rogen’s new fiancee runs out of steam after a handful of episodes, and gets replaced by more generic sitcommy fare – but Rogen and (especially) Byrne sell the hell out of it. You want to be in their company for ever.In a perfect world, Platonic would run for years and be as popular as Friends. That’s not likely to be the case, though. By all accounts, The Studio is not just the bigger show, but the project that requires the most of Rogen. As that grows, there will be less room for this in his life. And, knowing how television works, the longer Platonic stays on the air, the harder it will be to resist throwing an element of Ross and Rachel-style will they, won’t they into the mix.View image in fullscreenSells the hell out of it … Rose Byrne in Platonic.Photograph: Paul Sarkis/Apple TV+This would be terrible. The tension from Platonic comes from those around Rogen and Byrne, and their conspiracies about a romance. The first season revolved around Byrne’s husband’s insecurities about the pair, and the best parts of the second mirror that from the perspective of Rogen’s fiancee. But Rogen and Byrne remain an impenetrably oblivious bubble. The instant there is so much as a lingering glance between the pair, the show will be dead. Platonic is not a “will they, won’t they”. It is a “please don’t”.If Platonic were to end now, there are ostensibly plenty of other shows with which to soak up the loss. It falls neatly among Apple’s stable of low-effort comedies about nice people being nice to each other. Ted Lasso is a little like that.Shrinkingis a little like that.Stickis a little like that. But Platonic is too twitchy and restless to be categorised like that. For all their chemistry, the two leads are spiky and prone to self-sabotage – one episode is purely about Byrne having to parent after ingesting ketamine – which puts it a peg above the competitors.Still, right now the conversation is all about The Studio. And, again, this makes sense. As a piece of television, The Studio is more impressive than Platonic. But Platonic is so much easier to love. Let’s hope there continues to be room for both of them.Platonic is on Apple TV+. The finale airs on 1 October.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSeth RogenRose ByrneTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 3,568MW plant, built to provide power for 45 million people, released a muddy torrent that flooded his neighbourhood, forcing 120 families to evacuate.“The river has gone out of control. We used to know when it would flood and when it would dry up. Now nobody knows any more,” says Nascimento, a rancher. “What men call progress has killed our history.”His is a sad tale, but not uncommon in the Amazon, where public works driven by political ambition and economic upswing have replaced the wilderness with boom towns, highways, dams and farms. While these projects have brought paved roads, electricity and jobs, they have also caused upheaval throughdisorderly urbanisation,organised crime,rapid deforestationandclimate disruption.View image in fullscreenA 2012 photograph of part of the Triângulo neighbourhood in Porto Velho, which was flooded by water redirected from the Santo Antônio hydroelectric station.Photograph: Avener Prado/The GuardianFuelled by undaunted farmers and pioneering crop science, the soya bean industry has spread deep into the Amazon, blanketing the land, filling silos, helping convert Brazil intothe world’s leading exporterand propelling the country’sagribusiness-boosted GDP.Studies show that transport of soya beans and maize in the so-called Amazon arc – the infrastructure for hauling crops – grew 4.8% in the past year and by288% in the past 10 years. As the agricultural belt expands, it is reshaping the map of the Amazonian environment, infrastructure, commerce, politics and livelihoods.Brazil is now one of the world’s most bounteous agricultural producers, driven by harvests in the Cerrado, or central scrublands, and more recently in the Amazon biome. Soya beans are nowcultivated in 25 of Brazil’s 27 statesand cover more than half the nation’s arable land, from the pampas to the equator.In the first five months of 2025, Brazil became the top soya bean exporter with 51.53m tonnes, a4.93% increasefrom the same period of 2024.Nearly 80% of soya beans are used for livestock and aquaculture, as China, the main buyer, uses85% for animal feed, linking rising global meat demand to Brazil’s expanding exports.Three decades ago, only four of the nine Amazonian states planted soya beans. Today, all nine do, helping to make the legume Brazil’s fastest-growing commodity. Mato Grosso, a huge state that straddles the Cerrado and the Amazon, is the nation’s top producer. In Rondônia, soya bean cultivationhas more than doubledsince 2019, as has the economy.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of the Paulo Leal Community in Porto Velho, which is hemmed in by vast soya bean plantations encroaching on the village.Photograph: Avener Prado/The GuardianUnder increasing public pressure, traders and big producers of the beanssigned a “soya moratorium”in 2006, committing to forgo buying and selling soya beans grown on Amazonian plots deforested after 2008.In 2023, theEuropean Commission went further, not only banning the sale of soya beans – and six other commodity crops – harvested from recently cleared Amazonian lands, but also requiring buyers to prove their imports were deforestation-free.The good news for agribusiness is that the tighter restrictions have not curtailed productivity. According tothe latest reporton the Amazon soya bean moratorium, although 95.6% of the expansion occurred in areas that were already affected by human activity before 2008,16% of the area used to grow soya beansin the Amazon was cleared after the ban, and cultivation in untouched forest nearly tripled from 2018 to 2023, reaching 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres).View image in fullscreenA huge field ready for harvest. Agricultural production from this region is primarily for export.Photograph: Avener Prado/The GuardianThese figures used to be controversial in Brazil – a cause for celebration for large producers and denounced by environmentalists, who are preparing forCop30, the critical UN climate conference in November.They invaded our land. But because we hadn’t built on our lot, they moved in, planted soya beans and stayedJosé Pereira do NascimentoAmazonian growers, however, continued to grumble that the soya moratorium was too prohibitive and violated free enterprise. They claimed that the rule barred land clearingeven when another law permitted it– under Brazil’s2012 forestry code, Amazonian farms may deforest up to 20% of their property.Last year, three Amazonian governors, led by Rondônia’s Marcos Rocha, passed lawscancelling tax breaksto signatories of the moratorium, alleging the pact amounted to a soya cartel. They drew praise from local farmers, many of whom had been caught out clearing forest for planting.Brazil’santi-monopoly authority, Cade, agreed and, on 18 August,suspended the moratoriumon the grounds that it unfairly advantaged a few big traders and farmers over medium and small-scale soya bean producers. A federal judgepromptly overruled the antitrust board, and reinstated the moratorium.But with the agricultural lobby flexing its muscles in Brasília, the quarrel is far from over. Even if the moratorium holds, risks to the rainforest and its inhabitants remain.Nascimento –Zé Pereirato friends and family – has a front-row seat watching the soya bean boom. After shuttling between cheap hotels for nearly a year, he resettled in a small villa 16 miles (25km) from Porto Velho. Though he is not at risk of losing another home, the retired 70-year-old has watched uneasily as the land around him is surrendered to soya beans.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Nascimento in the hotel he was rehoused in. He is holding one of the meals provided by the hydropower company to those displaced.Photograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian“They invaded our land,” says Nascimento. “But because we hadn’t built on our lot, they moved in, planted soya beans right up to the fence, and stayed.”The cash crop has encircled his neighbourhood, overrun a local cemetery and now stretches to the horizon. Some days, the air is so thick with clouds of herbicides and pesticides that he can taste it. First, there’s “the tingling sensation” in his face. Then comes “the dizziness” and “difficulty breathing”, he says. “It’s not just me. Everyone over here feels it.”To planters, this is the scent of progress.Although most soya bean farmers areopportunists rather than villainsin Amazon predation, the European Commission has traced strong indirect links between clearcutting and soya sowing. This is the case in Mato Grosso, where mechanised farms typically take over spent pasture, displacing ranchers such as Nascimento into pristine areas of neighbouring Pará, in the eastern Amazon basin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The storage silos in the background show the scale of region’s agricultural production of soya beans, corn and more.Photograph: Avener PradoCritically, however, even if no more trees fall to farmers, expanding soya bean plantations fuel the lobby’s demands for bigger and better infrastructure to store and ship their harvest to international markets. Hence the clamour to lay more asphalt, dredge rivers, build bridges and ports, and put down rails to haul ever bigger loads over already strained Amazonian transport networks.Take theBR-364, the main highway connecting western Amazonia to ports on the Atlantic coast, where every harvest brings traffic to a standstill.“We see 3,000 to 4,000 soya [articulated truck] rigs a day pass through Porto Velho,” says Adélio Barofaldi, chief executive of Rovema, a logistics company in Rondônia. “We are talking about 200km of gridlock every day.”View image in fullscreenTrucks loaded with grain and soya beans wait at Posto Miriam to unload at the ports of Porto Velho. In the background, the Candeias River forms part of the logistics corridor linking farm production to the Madeira waterway.Photograph: Avener Prado/The GuardianTo ease bottlenecks, the federal government recently privatised part of the highway, with plans to duplicate a critical 60-mile stretch, tellingly nicknamed the “Agro North route”.All to the detriment of the wilderness. A study found that nearly 95% of Amazon deforestation in Brazil fallswithin 3 miles of highways. In the Colombian Amazon, 80% of forest clearance occurs within less than 5 miles of roads.The risk is that this technological triumph might hypnotise people into destroying the Cerrado and AmazoniaSandro Dutra e Silva, environmental historianBut roads lead to more roads. A recent study comparing theknock-on effects of highwaysin tropical regions found that every mile of official “first-cut road” in the Amazon basin generated another 30 miles of secondary roads. And much more clearcutting and degradation happened around secondary tracks than official routes.Soya’s success in the Americas is a cautionary tale, says Sandro Dutra e Silva, an environmental historian at Goiás State Universitystudying the Cerrado. “Tropical agriculture has been hailed as a miracle, transforming Brazil into a farming power,” he says.View image in fullscreenSenator Confúcio Moura at an auction for a road concession, awarded to private sector bidders as part of a multi-billion real plan for upgrades and maintenance of the so-called ‘Agro North route’.Photograph: Avener Prado/The GuardianHowever, because the savanna sits on South America’s key aquifers, overproduction could disrupt watersheds and weather. “The risk is that this technological triumph might hypnotise people into destroying the Cerrado and Amazonia,” Dutra says.The year the rainforest dried up: how the climate crisis beached Brazil’s floating communitiesRead moreAlexandre Nepomuceno, head of soya bean research atEmbrapa, Brazil’s national agricultural institute – which developed soya strains that thrived in the tropics, boosting the seed’s use in the Amazon – cautions against vilifying scientific achievement for policy shortcomings.He says the same enterprising scientific tradition that brought harvests to the equator can also help Amazonian growers tread more lightly on the land.Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian soil microbiology expert, won the 2025World Food prizefor her research into strains of bacteria that suck nitrogen from the air and attach itto the roots of soya beans, all but eliminating the need to import costly petroleum-based fertilisers.Last year, such biological nitrogen fixation delivered Brazil a bumper crop, saved $25m (£18.5m) in imported fertiliser, and avoided emitting230m tons of climate-warming carboninto the atmosphere.View image in fullscreenA high-voltage transmission line carries power from the Jirau hydropower plant into Brazil’s national grid.Photograph: Avener Prado/The GuardianNepomuceno says that cutting-edge research can show the way. Still, science alone cannot save the Amazon. According to him, that is a job for policymakers, lawmakers and the public authorities that make the rules and enforce the red lines.“Given thatBrazilalready has plenty of deforested areas,” Nepomuceno says, “we have no need of clearing more land to grow soya beans.”Explore more on these topicsAmazon rainforestSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanDeforestationTrees and forestsConservationAgricultureBrazilAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mahmoud Mardawi, a Hamas official, said the group had not even received the plan at the time of the announcement, the Reuters news agency reported. It was later briefed that Qatari and Egyptian mediators met with Hamas on Monday evening to provide the group with the peace plan.Both Trump and Netanyahu made clear that they were not offering Hamas a choice in the matter. If the group refused, Trump told reporters, “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.“But I hope that we’re going to have a deal for peace, and if Hamas rejects the deal … Bibi, you’d have our full backing to do what you would have to do.”The Israeli prime minister said ominously: “If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.”Netanyahu added: “We’d prefer the easy way but it has to be done. All these goals must be achieved because we didn’t fight this horrible fight, sacrifice the finest of our young men to have Hamas stay inGazaand threaten us again and again and again with these horrific massacres.”Neither man took questions from reporters. Earlier the White House released the 20-point plan aimed at ending the war in the Palestinian territory that erupted after the deadly attack on 7 October 2023.It calls for a ceasefire, a swap of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, Hamas disarmament and a transitional government led by an international body.Trump said: “If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case more than 72 hours … The hostages are coming back.”The plan also demands that Hamas lay down its arms and renounce governance in the strip. Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence would be given amnesty to remain in Gaza or they would be granted safe passage to receiving countries.Trump’s plan would also establish a temporary governing board that would be headed by Trump himself and include Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Postwar Gaza authority potentially led by Tony Blair ‘would sideline Palestinians’Read moreTrump said: “To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for a new international oversight body – the Board of Peace – which will be headed, not at my request … by a gentleman known as President Donald J Trump of the United States.”Earlier, a leaked 21-page draft document, seen by the Guardian and Haaretz inIsrael, showed that a postwar Gaza governing authority would sideline key Palestinian political figures while giving significant authority to its chair on most key issues.The president caused uproar earlier this year whenhe spoke of turning Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”that involved massive financial investment and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.Monday’s 20-point plan does state that “a Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East”.But it also notes: “No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return.”At the joint press briefing in the state dining room, against a backdrop of US and Israel flags, Trump said they were “beyond very close” to forging the elusive peace deal and that he hoped Hamas militants would also accept it.“We’re not quite finished. We have to get Hamas, but I think they’re going to be able to do that. So now it’s time for Hamas to accept the terms of the plan that we’ve put forward today.”Trump added: “I also want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction that we’ve seen for so many years, decades, even centuries and begin a new chapter of security, peace and prosperity for the entire region.”In Netanyahu’s fourth visit to the White House since Trump returned to office in January, the rightwing Israeli leader was looking to shore up his country’s most important relationship aftera slew of western leaders formally embraced Palestinian statehoodlast week in defiance of the US and Israel.Trump, who sharply criticised the recognition moves as a prize for Hamas, was seeking Netanyahu’s agreement despite Israel’s misgivings on parts of the plan.Washington presented its peace plan to Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the UN general assembly last week, and Trump’s main objective on Monday was to try to close the remaining gaps with Netanyahu. He appeared to have succeeded.Netanyahu, who has an international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant against him for alleged crimes including starvation as a method of warfare, used the White House platform to lavish praise on Trump and list his demands.“I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” he said. “It will bring back to Israel all our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities, end its political rule, and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”He added: “Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarized. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter, for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful, civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas nor by the Palestinian Authority.”But Hamas’s apparent absence from the negotiations has raised questions about the prospects for the latest initiative.In a statement late on Monday, Blair said: “President Trump has put down a bold and intelligent plan which, if agreed, can end the war, bring immediate relief to Gaza, the chance of a brighter and better future for its people, while ensuring Israel’s absolute and enduring security and the release of all hostages.“It offers us the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering, and I thank President Trump for his leadership, determination and commitment.”Netanyahu earlier extended a formal apology to his Qatari counterpart fora recent military strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emiratethat infuriated Arab leaders and triggered rare criticism by the US of Israel.Netanyahu made the call to Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, as he met with Trump, according to the White House.Trump described the exchange between the Israeli and Qatari leader as a “heart-to-heart” call.“As a first step, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret that Israel’s missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,” the White House said in a statement. “He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future.”Netanyahu added to reporters: “Israel was targeting terrorists, it wasn’t targeting Qatar, and of course we regretted the loss of the Qatari citizen who wasn’t our target.”Late on Monday the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt welcomed Trump’s announcement in a joint statement.The proposal was also welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which said it supported Trump’s “determined efforts” to end the war.But the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group chief, Ziad al-Nakhala, said he considered the plan a “recipe to blow up the region”. The group, which also has taken hostages, is an Iran-backed ally of Hamas.Previous US-backed ceasefire efforts have fallen apart due to a failure to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas is completely dismantled.The White House talks came as Israeli tanks on Monday thrust deeper into the heart of Gaza City. Israel has launched one of its biggest offensives of the war this month, with Netanyahu saying he aims to wipe out Hamas in its final redoubts. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000 since 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Because growth is the pound in your pocket. It is more money for trips, meals out, the little things that bring joy to all our lives, the peace of mind that comes from economic security.“But it is also the antidote to division. That’s the most important aspect of national renewal. The way you grow an economy, not just how much, but who and where benefits that can either build a nation or it can pull it apart.“And in the world we must face the threats we must defeat, Britain needs an economy that unites, every person, every community, every great nation on these islands. Standing together, as so often in our past, facing down the threats of a volatile world.”His speech was released after Rachel Reeves on Monday said the country would face “further tests” in the months ahead, adding that her choices atnext month’s budgetwould be made “all the harder” by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage done to the economy by the Conservatives.The chancellor faces the prospect of having to find up to £30bn in tax rises or spending cuts next month if,as expected, the Office for Budget Responsibility cuts its forecast for future productivity growth to match the consensus of other experts.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves warned that the country would face ‘further tests’Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Monday evening Reeves signalled she would raise gambling taxes at the budget. “I do think there’s a case for gambling firms to pay more,” she told ITV.Darren Jones, the prime minister’s chief secretary, refused to rule out the possibility the government would break Labour’s manifesto pledge to not increase income tax, VAT or national insurance rates. “The manifesto stands today because decisions haven’t been taken yet,” he told Sky News. “I’m not ruling anything out, and I’m not ruling anything in.”However, Reeves also urged Labour conference in Liverpool to “have faith” that things would get better, despite the difficult economic landscape. Taking on Farage’s Reform UK directly, she said she wanted to “silence the nagging voices of decline”.The chancellor also warned Labour figures“peddling the idea”that the government could abandon fiscal responsibility to free up more money for public spending were “dangerously wrong” and risked serious damage to the economy.In a veiled criticism of Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor who has urged the government to take a bolder approach to the economy, she said the party should be “honest” about what calls to borrow more would mean.However, Burnham, a former chief secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, rejected suggestions that he was “hopeless” on the economy or had “no idea about how to make it add up” as he defended his recent interventions in national politics.He told the Guardian’sPolitics Weeklypodcast: “You need strong fiscal rules, but it doesn’t mean in exactly their current form … If there was an investment that could be shown in a short order to reduce current spending, then I think that is an investment that can prudently be made.”Burnham also sought to address the “sense I’m completely out for myself, disloyal”, citing behind-the-scenes work he had been doing over the summer to help to progress the government’s Hillsborough legislation.“It sticks in my throat somewhat for people who have just arrived on the scene to be throwing some of the comments at me that they have done,” he said. “I did everything that I possibly could have to make this conference a success.”Burnham, whose leadership ambitions have dominated the conference, insisted that he had been seeking to provoke a wider debate within Labour about the party’s direction ahead of local elections next May, as the government faces a sustained lag behind Reform UK in the polls.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, arrives at a fringe meeting in Liverpool.Photograph: Jon Super/AP“While the government’s done good things, I don’t think it’s come together yet as that powerful story of the future of Britain,” the Labour mayor said.In his speech, Starmer is expected to warn that Britain faces a “defining choice” between “decency and division”. He will say: “We can all see our country faces a choice, a defining choice. Britain stands at a fork in the road.“We can choose decency. Or we can choose division. Renewal or decline. A country, proud of its values, in control of its future, or one that succumbs, against the grain of our history, to the politics of grievance.”The prime minister is expected to draw on the memories of the 1945 Labour government to inspire his party, while warning supporters there will be more tough choices to come. “It is a test. A fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge,” he will say.“And yet we need to be clear that our path, the path of renewal, it’s long, it’s difficult, it requires decisions that are not cost-free or easy. Decisions that will not always be comfortable for our party.”Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, warned delegates that they would not like some of the measures she expects to implement to deal with small boats, implying they would involve some significant curtailment of human rights.“In solving this crisis, you may not always like what I do. We will have to question some of the assumptions and legal constraints that have lasted for a generation and more,” she said.“But unless we have control of our borders, and until we can decide who comes in and who must leave, we will never be the open, tolerant and generous country that I know we all believe in.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourLabour conference 2025Economic policyEconomic growth (GDP)Budget deficitTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Some children died from Covid, while others continue to live with the “severe, and, for many, long-lasting” consequences of the pandemic.Dobbin described the curtailment of play and the loss of all the normal rites of passage – birthdays, proms, exams – as well as the damage done to young people’s mental health and their ability to make and sustain friendships.She also spoke about children who suffered “grievous” harm at the hands of the people who were meant to care for them, when they were told to stay at home and lost the protection that schools usually offer.Some young people were exposed to violent pornography and other harms as their lives rapidly moved online, while many struggled to access online lessons and ended up spending most of the day gaming instead of learning.One described “sitting there with no school, playing [the video game] Animal Crossing for, like, six months”. Another said they played Roblox online for up to 19 hours a day.Dobbin quoted one child as saying: “People would answer the remote lesson call in bed, people would be in science third lesson, and would literally have the camera off and would be posting on their Instagram stories or their Snapchat stories, literally them watching The Only Way is Essex.”View image in fullscreenGavin Williamson, the then education secretary, said there had been a ‘24-hour sea change’ in the attitude to school closures.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesShe said said: “[Covid] deprived children of much of the fun that makes a childhood: birthday parties, playing sport, proms, school trips, holidays; all everyday aspects of what it means to be a child but which comprisethe very fabric of childhood.”The inquiry heard the decision to close schools “had ramifications which are difficult to overstate”. The Department for Education (DfE) had undertaken zero contingency planning for school closures before lockdown was declared in March 2020.“In England, evidence that the [DfE] did not start planning for the closure of schools until after 16 March 2020 is a cause for alarm,” Dobbin told the inquiry.She said Jonathan Slater, then permanent secretary to the DfE, had provided evidence that between January and 16 March 2020, the department’s contingency plans were “premised on the assumption that schools and other educational settings would remain open. And according to him that was in keeping with the government’s overall approach to pandemic preparedness at the time.”Evidence from Gavin Williamson, the education secretary at the time, agreed, but on 17 March there seems to have been a sudden change of direction. Dobbin said: “[Williamson] explains in his words that there’s a discombobulating 24-hour sea change from keeping schools open on 16 March, to discussions about closing schools on 17 March.”On 18 March, schools were ordered to close. Dobbin added: “[Williamson] did not ask DfE officials to prepare an assessment of the impact of school closures because school closures had not been recommended and No 10 officials had not commissioned this advice from the DfE either.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She added: “It’s my respectful submission that it’s significant that there should be a dispute about whether planning for so seismic an event existed … and perhaps alarming is the suggestion that it was not for the DfE to instigate its own planning for school closures but to wait for it to be commissioned.”In her opening comments to the reconvened inquiry the chair, Heather Hallett, said the pandemic’s impact on children and young people was “severe and, for many, long-lasting”, as they missed educational opportunities, social interaction and for the most at-risk they lost protection from abuse.An impact film shown at the start of proceedings detailed some of the children’s stories, voiced by adults to protect their identities. One contributor said her friend had died, another lost 12 kilos while suffering from Covid, while a third had to be put on a ventilator.A single parent described the challenge of trying to home educate and care for three children all at different stages of their education. “In the end I just said we’re not doing it,” she said, adding: “Being confined, just us in that house, was hell.”Another mother said her son had been out of school since February 2022. “Our family life completely stopped. It’s a huge worry to us how his life will go. How he will manage to look after himself. We should not sacrifice children. Children are the future.”The inquiry continues on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryCoronavirusSchoolsYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

An unknown number did so last year and early this year over changes to their contract that they were opposed to.“Online systems currently cannot distinguish between non-urgent and urgent patient queries, and with practices already understaffed and overworked, GPs fear this could lead to potentially serious and life-threatening problems being delayed or missed entirely,” the BMA said.“Doctors will need to be reallocated away from booked appointments to manage the potential online triage tsunami, leading to fewer GP appointments with patients.“GPs are worried that without any increase in practice capacity, considerable amounts of practice time will be diverted to reviewing the barrage of online requests and queries, thus reducing time for routine appointments and planned patient care.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, dismissed the BMA’s concerns and insisted the changes would go ahead as planned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Patients can now contact their GP digitally whenever suits them during core hours, not just in that frantic morning rush.“It’s about choice and convenience. Patients can still phone or walk in, but now they’ve also got the online option available all day.“More people requesting bookings online means quieter phone lines for those who need to call.”Some of England’s 6,400 GP surgeries already operate the system the BMA is concerned about. They have found it brings “a smoother workflow and better service”, the DHSC said.The Patients Association said what patients wanted most from GPs was fast access to advice and care, irrespective of how they sought an appointment.Its chief executive, Rachel Power, said: “Patients should feel confident that when they book or request an appointment, whether online, on the phone, or in person, their needs will be assessed swiftly and safely by someone with the right training and skills to judge urgency.”Explore more on these topicsGPsDoctorsNHSEnglandHealthTrade unionsIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

Annual food price inflation, which has been steadily accelerating all year, levelled out at 4.2% in September – the same rate as in August.Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said:“Households are finding shopping increasingly expensive. The impact on retailers and their supply chain of both global factors and higher national insurance and wage costs is playing out in prices for consumers.”She said high energy and labour costs, including the government’srise in employers’ national insurance payments (NICs), continued to push up input prices for many producers, including farmers, with dairy and beef prices remaining high.However, Mike Watkins, the head of retailer and business insight at NIQ, said low consumer confidence meant retailers were likely to have to continue offering promotions and deals to ring up sales.“With inflationary pressures persisting, many shoppers remain concerned about their personal finances and are becoming increasingly price-sensitive,” he said.The BRC figures are the latest indication thatfood inflation has peaked, with retailers expecting it to ease late this year or from early 2026.However, earlier this month the Bank of England held off from implementing a cut in interest rates on fears that rising food prices were putting upwards pressure on headline inflation.Rachel Reeves has hinted thattax rises or spending cutscould be on the way as the chancellor faces having to find up to £30bn to plug a spending gap amid slower than hoped for growth and expected changes to official calculations on UK productivity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, unions have warned that the future pay increases will need “substantially more” investment.The move was promised as part of a slew of measures in Labour’s workers’ rights package, intended to create better pay and working conditions in the struggling care sector, where low pay and insecure work have led to a recruitment crisis.The final increase will be negotiated by the body – the first of its kind in the country – with the budget set by government also used to improve conditions at work.Care workers are not expected to feel the benefits of the change for several years. After the employment bill passes parliament, there will be a consultation on the new pay body, which will be formally convened next year. It will conduct the negotiations in 2027, so that the pay and conditions improvements can come into force the following year.It is hoped that the enhanced pay and conditions will improve retention in the sector, where a vacancy rate of nearly 10% is expected to be exacerbated by a crackdown on visas for overseas care workers.Both employers and trade unions will sit on the new body. Its recommendations will be applicable across the sector, for private and public sector workers. The cash will come from the £4bn allocated in the spending review to adult social care.Streeting will say at the Labour conference on Monday that the government “will no longer accept a system built on poverty pay and zero-hour insecurity”.He will pledge that the fair pay agreement will be backed in law. This was a key demand of care sector unions Unison and GMB, whom the government has been keen to keep onside amid faltering relations with other unions.Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: “This is the first government to take the many problems in social care seriously, and more importantly, to act on them. The best way to begin getting a grip on this complex, fragmented sector in crisis is to improve wages through a fair pay agreement, backed by proper funding.”But she said that although £500m was welcome, “substantially more will be needed to deliver the national care service the public deserves”.She added: “Ministers will have to increase the funding behind the fair pay agreement at the earliest opportunity. Then wages in care can rise more quickly and the staffing crisis end.”Streeting is expected to recommit to plans for a national care service, though the government has been criticised for the slow pace of the change. Lady Casey, a renowned Whitehall troubleshooter, has been tasked with producing a plan for delivering the new service over the course of a decade.Streeting will also pay tribute to the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who was forced to step down earlier this month over errors in her stamp duty payments.He said it was Rayner, a former care worker, who was the architect of the fair pay agreement, and “who understands the struggle care workers face, because she was one”.Explore more on these topicsCare workersSocial careWes StreetingLabour conference 2025LabourHealthNHSShareReuse this content"

The beats of the genre – the initial obstacles, the double-edged sword of success, the actors’ pursuit of industry awards for spirited impersonation – are by now so familiar that you’re almost expected to enter with more than a bit of skepticism, even when the artist at hand is one as widely beloved asBruce Springsteen.Anemone review – Daniel Day-Lewis returns for a bleak and painfully serious misfireRead moreLikeA Complete Unknown, in which Chalamet portrayed Dylan from 1961 until his pivot to electric in 1965, Deliver Me from Nowhere, Springsteen’s authorized biopic starringJeremy Allen White, tries to thread a difficult needle between offering the standard treats and subverting expectations, between narrativizing genius and resisting hagiography. This may be an impossible task, given that the magic and cliches of popular music often go hand in hand, and Deliver Me from Nowhere certainly has its spoof-worthy moments. I went in braced for success montages, leaden flashbacks and capital-R Realizations, and at times met them. (Though to be clear, the expected treat of watching White, of the Bear and Calvin Klein underwear ad fame, tear up the stage as The Boss is still exactly that.) But more often I was won over by its diversions in form – its specificities, its smallness and its portrait of mental fragility.That’s largely down to its rewardingly limited scope. Based on the book by Warren Zane (and informed by Springsteen’s 2016 memoir), Deliver Me from Nowhere burrows into a pivotal phase of life for both rockstars and civilians: the early 30s, when the excuses of youth start running out and demons start catching up. The bulk of the film takes place in 1981, when Springsteen returns to New Jersey after touring his first number one record, The River, on the brink of superstardom but burned out. Record execs at Columbia (embodied by David Krumholtz) want him to strike with more hits while the iron is hot; Bruce, played by White as hollow behind the brown-eye contacts, wants to hole up in a rental house in Colts Neck and tinker with the ideas that will become his 1982 album Nebraska, a folk-tinged acoustic album full of blue collar workers, outlaws, and other downtrodden outsiders in the heartland.The story of Springsteen’s hard left artistic turn, inspired by Flannery O’Connor stories and TV dramas, is certainly an interesting one. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to visualize the churn of one person’s brain on fire, the ups and downs of the creative process; we end up spending a lot of time watching Bruce write lyrics in black marker indicative of overstatement – “Why???,” he writes when looking at an old headline about Charles Starkweather, whose 1958 murder spree inspired the title track. (It’s because he was “mad at the world”.) Perfunctory, too, are the black-and-white flashbacks to his working class childhood in nearby Freehold, which communicate the scarring fear of his alcoholic, abusive father (Stephen Graham), the explosive fights with his mother (Gaby Hoffmann). Same for scenes in which Bruce’s beloved manager Jon Landau (Succession’s Jeremy Strong) acts as buffer between commercial expectations and Bruce’s refusal of it.It’s hard, in the film’s first half, to see past Strong and White’s respective on-screen reputations, each different strains of broodingly serious. In literal tone and line delivery, they’re not terribly far removed from their most famous characters. White, in particular, takes some getting used to, the familiar ticks of Chef Carmy’s red-hot anxiety occasionally peeking through Bruce’s cool avoidance. But he eventually settles into character, especially as Bruce’s depression spirals into panic post-recording.Deliver Me From Nowhere picks up steam in this aftermath of genius, as Bruce’s team scramble to preserve the haunted sound of his Colts Neck bedroom demos despite all market sense. The film’s lingering focus on the technical process of recording, how cassette limitations begot a beloved sound – what Brian Enocalledthe “sound of failure” – is a surprising highlight, at least for this viewer nostalgic for CDs. Meanwhile, Bruce’s mental health crumbles along with his relationship with local waitress Faye (Odessa Young), the film’s only composite character given one standout scene to rise above her parenthetical role exemplifying Bruce’s penchant for disappearance and need of professional help.Deliver Me from Nowhere thankfully avoids overly mythologizing the Boss – we see him on stage just a handful of times, in flashes; he walks around New Jersey mostly unrecognized and unbothered, the trappings of major celebrity the subject of another film. Arguably the film’s most idealized sequence – the recording of Born in the USA, also written in that bedroom – briefly blazes by like a comet; the cut ended up sitting on the shelf for three years, its popularity and political legacy outside the scope of this film. Deliver Me From Nowhere ends before that – the wins and wounds of one landmark, heart-wrenching album still fresh. I floated out of the theater to Nebraska’s rueful highlight Atlantic City, and haven’t wanted to stop listening to it since, stuck in its Americana groove – which is perhaps, ultimately, what we want from a biopic.Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere is screening at the New York film festival and will be released in Australian cinemas on 23 October and in the US and UK on 24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmFirst look reviewBruce SpringsteenJeremy Allen WhiteBiopicsJeremy StrongreviewsShareReuse this content"

His family moved to Newcastle and he grew up on what he described as “the edge of the edge” of the city, “on a building site next to the fields”, in a council estate called the Grange.He stayed in the city, graduating with a degree in architecture from the Newcastle University School in 1961, before crossing the Atlantic to attend the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia where he obtained a master’s degree in urban planning.Farrell would come back to the UK, working briefly with the architects department of the Greater London Council, by which he was unimpressed. He told the Observer: “It was astonishing, leaderless and rudderless; people just invented their own solutions.”View image in fullscreenThe Deep aquarium in Hull.Photograph: Vincent Lowe/AlamyIt was away from the public sector that Farrell would flourish.In 1965 he moved to London, forming a partnership with Grimshaw. Dubbed the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership, they also shared a studio with experimental British architecture collective Archigram.Grimshaw would go on to design the Eden Project in Cornwall, while Farrell was often described as the “less assertive” of the pair. “For 15 years I tagged along in Nick’s wake,” he once said.Despite his modesty, Farrell’s buildings were often bold and loud.The MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall, which opened in 1994, is perhaps Farrell’s best-known building. Once described by the architecture criticRowan Moore as a “flesh-coloured ziggurat”of a building, it was typical of “the big, imposing buildings for powerful institutions” that Farrell specialised in.Other Farrell buildings include Embankment Place and the Home Office headquarters in London as well as The Deep in Hull, andAlban Gate– the “shoulder-padded office block” that defined the “big bang architecture” in the City of London.View image in fullscreenFarrell pictured in 2023.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverHe also worked in east Asia, designing Beijing railway station and Guangzhou South railway station in China. He also created the 442-metreKK100 tower in Shenzhen– the world’s tallest building by a British architect.Sir Nicholas Grimshaw obituaryRead more“Terry was frequently called a maverick and a nonconformist, which he relished,” his studio continued in its social media post. “He was an architect who was never quite part of the ‘club’. He will be remembered as the UK’s leading architect planner whose enduring commitment to urbanism has helped shape government policy on key built-environment issues.”He was 84 when theFarrell Centre, part of Newcastle University, opened. It includes a gallery and an “urban room” – a place where “local people can go to learn about the past, present and future of where they live”, something that was important to Farrell, who invested £1m of his own money in the project.Farrell campaigned for conservation but was also keen on buildings being adapted. “Conservation is a mind thing rather than a designation,” he said in 2023, when the Farrell Centre was opened. “A cardboard house,’’ he added, if people are motivated to take care of it, “lasts for ever.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureTerry FarrellnewsShareReuse this content"

What we have is a swag gap. I’m the cool one, and you aren’t. It’s an ill fit, and frankly I think we’re doomed.I require examples.Take Justin and Hailey Bieber. Clear swag gap. People pay attention to the effort she puts into looking good when they’re out together.And Justin?No effort whatsoever. His posture is bad. His clothes are all over the place. He looks like her nephew who’s been forced out against his will.And that’s the gap.Correct. The centre cannot hold. The outcome of this swag discrepancy is stark.

The Alchemised author shares why they were drawn to a war-torn love story, how a conservative upbringing shaped their writing, and the snobbery around fanfictionMon 29 Sep 2025 12.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 18.44 EDTShareIn recent days, bookish pockets of TikTok and Instagram have been talking about one thing only. “I’ve been looking forward to this day more than I look forward to my wedding day,” says one creator, holding up to the camera a copy of the 1,040-page novel that was Penguin’s most pre-ordered debut of the year and has already netted apotentially record-breakingseven-figure film rights deal.How does a first-time novelist get out of the starting blocks quite likethat? The thing is, the author behind the doorstopper dark fantasy novel, Alchemised, is no unknown debut: SenLinYu, 34, started off writingHarry Potterfanfiction that blew up online during the pandemic, racking up more than 20m downloads. Sen’s Draco and Hermione (“Dramione”) fanfic, heavily inspired by The Handmaid’s Tale, has now been rewritten – with third-party IP necessarily removed – and published traditionally as Alchemised. But if you didn’t know about Alchemised’s origins, you would be unlikely to clock them: even squinting, it’s hard to see any trace of Harry Potter in the revamped version, set in a different world and magic system.At the beginning of Alchemised, published last Tuesday, we meet Helena Marino, a prisoner of war held captive on the dilapidated estate of Kaine Ferron, a former classmate who is tasked with scouring her mind for lost memories. Set in a world of necromancy and alchemy, the three-part novel traces the twisty, obsessive relationship between the pair, while exploring war trauma and picking at the borders of good and evil. And its billing as “dark” fantasy is no understatement: Sen’s website lists 12 content warnings, extending to human experimentation, medical torture, eugenics, cannibalism and necrophilia.I was never wanting to write a relationship that was supposed to be aspirationalWhile Alchemised is often lumped in with romantasyin media coverage, Sen, who goes by they/them pronouns, has “never really thought of it as a romantasy”, or a romance. They don’t read much romance, because the genre tends towards idealised stories. “I was never wanting to write a relationship that was supposed to be aspirational.” Getting people to stop calling Alchemised a romantasy “has been a bit like playing Whac-A-Mole”. However, they do see it as a love story.The conflation of fantasy subgenres has parallels with the narrow cultural view of fanfiction, often exclusively associated with smut. People “tend to take the most scandalous, the most salacious thing about it and then run with that”, or they will see it as “really derisible”, accusing fanfiction writers of not having original ideas, says Sen. The author notes that Greek retellings – books such asCirce,The Silence of the GirlsandThe Song of Achilles– which have become so popular in recent years aren’t criticised for being unoriginal, despite relying on the same principle as fanfiction. “The inconsistency is funny to me.”“Whenever it’s something that women or LGBTQ+ people tend to do a lot,” there is more criticism, says Sen. “Men do fantasy football, and no one is like, ‘Oh your little imaginary players, that’s so cute that you do that’ – it’s treated seriously, people talk about it in the office.”While Sen had always been drawn to fantasy, they grew up in a conservative, “very religious” family in the Pacific Northwest of the US, and the genre “was looked upon with scepticism”. While they could read books that were written by Christian authors – The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings – other strands of fantasy were “not really something that we had at our house”.They put off writing seriously, believing they needed more life experience, but by their late 20s, after having two kids, they realised they could “die waiting for more perspective”. They began writing Manacled in the notes app on their phone, during their baby’s nap time. Fanfiction appealed as a form because they could post pseudonymously (they’ve retained the SenLinYu pen name for Alchemised), yet there was a level of accountability: “If I say I’m going to update on Thursdays or something, I as a people pleaser – as a perfectionist, as a child who always had to do my assignments a week early because I’d be so stressed about missing a deadline – I will finish this, because I said that I was going to post a chapter.”Sen began rewriting Manacled around Christmas 2022, and as they were finishing up, they were approached by a literary agency. Stripping away the Harry Potter and overt Handmaid’s Tale references was not “in any way pleasant”, or something they would ever want to do again. “I would rather be shot,” Sen told their Tumblr followerslast year. They described the process as taking two 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzles and “having to use both to build a new puzzle that somehow makes sense. Do not recommend. I also had to scrap and build from scratch a entirely new healing and medicine system and it was literally traumatic.”War is a major theme of the book, a plot line partly inspired by Sen’s family story. Their “traditionalist” upbringing meant they heard “very specific narratives” about the second world war and US contributions. While they grew up in a circle that was “very, very white”, they are half Japanese, and their “mother’s mother and all of her extended family were interned during world war two because they were Japanese”. Sen wanted to probe those parts of history that are “omitted from the narrative” in order to create neat binaries of “these are the good guys, these are the bad guys”.Sen was influenced by feminist history, includingSvetlana Alexievich’s The Unwomanly Face of War, an oral history of Soviet women during the second world war, andKatrine Kielos’s Who Cooked Adam Smith’s Dinner?“There had been so many women in the Resistance” – the movement protagonist Helena is part of – Sen writes. “Not many in combat, but everywhere else; they’d staffed the hospital, gone to the front lines as field medics and dragged the wounded bodies to safety, operated the radios and relayed messages, washed and repaired the clothes and uniforms, and cooked the meals. All the ordinary tasks that never ended.”Many in Sen’s fanbase were “very excited” for Manacled to be turned into a traditionally published work. Speaking ahead of Alchemised’s release, the author said they felt like “a champagne bottle about to pop”. Now, fans are busy digesting the rollercoaster love story, with many sharing their reactions on TikTok. One popular format involves the creator showing a smiling shot of them holding the book and saying “this is me before reading Alchemised”, before switching to “after” footage of them sobbing. “I feel a loss that I’ve never felt before,” says one creator. “I don’t know how I’m going to move on from this.”Alchemised is published by Penguin (£25).

By the time she died aged 39 in 2006, taken by ovarian cancer, she’d left behind a body of ultra-simple, mega-bold, hyper-colourful painting that functions as a testament to a life lived honestly, independently and very, very hornily.The earlier works here are stranger and more enigmatic than what comes later. Murni paints hybrid figures, half-plant, half-human, part-animal, part-woman. Branches grow out of bare bums, heads poke out of scale-covered fish bodies, long limbs loop and distend, bodies twist and undulate.There is endless symbolism here. High heels, mermaids, fish, mirrors, eyes, clocks. It’s heavily surreal, a sort of ultra-feminine comic book take onGiorgio de Chirico.Everywhere you look there are cocks throbbing and piercing and eruptingShe wasn’t working in total isolation. One wall in the opening gallery is dedicated to the small circle of artists she was part of, includingMondo(an Italian who had relocated to Bali),MokohandTotol. They also took a simple, bold approach to surreal mythical painting, but with different results. Totol’s monochrome beasties wear military hats in an outwardly political move; Mokoh’s creatures are notably more traditional and Balinese; and Mondo’s approach is way closer to classical portraiture. All different, but with so much shared intention that it’s easy to see why this group was so attracted to each other.Murni’s later work stands apart though. The paintings are now infinitely more brazen, a total embrace of desire and sexuality. A pig in a bra puts on lipstick. High heels – sexily feminine and absolutely lethal – kick and stomp. Vaginas are worshipped by kneeling figures or penetrated by tentacles; breasts are bound by wristwatches; couples hump and writhe; everywhere you look there are cocks throbbing and piercing and erupting. They pop out of cups, wrap around women’s bodies, nudge at orifices. It’s all desire, totally unbound, totally free.View image in fullscreenA total embrace of sexuality … Eye Meets Eye by I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih.Photograph: Courtesy Gajah Gallery & The Estate of I Gusti Ayu Kadek MurniasihBut those wristwatches and clock faces haunt the work, an awareness of impending mortality. Time is short, death is coming. And what better way to spend what little time you have left than bonking?The exhibition doesn’t do a particularly good job of placing Murni within the wider context of Indonesian art. You don’t come away with any sense of how different – or similar – her work was to the dominant forms of art of her time, or Indonesian art history, which leaves you floundering as a viewer. Context matters, especially when introducing an unfamiliar artist.But it’s also an intentional move. Murni explicitly rejected her circumstances. She wasn’t interested in the norms of Balinese society, in going to temple, dressing traditionally, being subservient. She lived her life, and she lived it on her terms. And that’s how the work is presented – as the visual output of a singular, independent, defiant woman. This isn’t aboutBalior tradition, it’s about sex, dreams, desire and, most of all, it’s about Murni.I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih: Feels Strangely Good, Ya? is at Nottingham Contemporary until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designBalireviewsShareReuse this content"

Even after coming out as gay, I struggled to know what to wear. But I think I’ve finally found my lookLucy KnightMon 29 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 06.24 EDTShareAbout a year ago, when I was packing to move to a new flat, I got rid of the only dress I owned. Before that, I hadn’t realised I was down to just the one. I knew I rarely reached for dresses and skirts any more, either in shops or in my wardrobe. And I had already taken the step of binning the unloved tangle of tights in my sock drawer. But the move to wearing only trousers had been gradual. A few months ago, I even surprised myself when my automatic response to someone’s question about my outfit was a calm and confident: “I’m not really a dress person.”But it’s true, I’ve realised. I’m just not. That last dress – a simple black midi that represented the little black dress that 00s magazines taught me all women should have – had only been worn a handful of times. So on to the charity shop pile it went.Though I was never one of those children who had tantrums when a parent insisted they wore a dress, I wasn’t a naturally “girly” girl either. I was cast as Joseph in my first ever nativity play, at a mixed gender nursery. When I started school and had to wear a skirt as part of my uniform, my reception teacher used to say “lady Lucy” during lessons to remind me to sit with my legs together. And, in one photo of a childhood fancy dress party, I am pictured standing proudly behind the other little girls, who are all wearing princess dresses, with my arms outstretched, inexplicably dressed as a crow.View image in fullscreenI finally felt confident about ‘not being a dress person’ … Lucy Knight, pictured in 2015.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy KnightWhen I came out as gay in my late teens, it had a liberating effect on my fashion choices – I no longer felt a need to look like a stereotypical straight woman – but it also came with its own pressures. Comments like “just because you’re a lesbian it doesn’t mean you have to look like a man” scared me off presenting in a more androgynous way for a while. And I knew I didn’t really fit into either “butch” or “femme” categorisations.The one change that worked: I sobered up – and started to listen to what my body was telling meRead moreBut bit by bit, as I’ve experimented and found the clothes I feel most myself in, I’ve found that not being a “dress person” is what seems to work for me. It can take a bit more effort to find the right outfit, especially for formal events. I agonised over what to wear for an uber-fancy wedding last year, for example, for which the dress code was floor-length gowns and tuxedos (I ended up going for a satin suit). But I’ve found that, as long as you have made an effort to look smart, people don’t seem to mind whether you’ve followed the dress code to the letter.I don’t want to pretend that looking more obviously queer is all sunshine and roses in today’s political climate – I’ve experienced an increase in homophobic harassment in recent years. And I really hope all the noise about who should be allowed in which bathrooms doesn’t stop people dressing in gender non-conforming ways – because, when I’m wearing a killer suit, I feel as if I can do anything, and nobody should be intimidated out of experiencing that.In ditching dresses for good, I’ve learned to love my childhood self, who confidently picked out that crow costume. Not because it was a good look (it really wasn’t)but because that little girl didn’t care about being different, or about looking the way a girl is “supposed” to look. I think I’ve been finding my way back to her ever since.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just one year, and already close to crashing. The question is whether Labour’s leader, chancellor and cabinet can tug open enough parachutes to prevent calamity. But the next election is aeons away: only five years ago, Boris Johnson was king of the world, due for another 10 years in No 10. Things go faster, up and down, in this dizzying era. The local elections next May are approached with dread: for many in Labour there is expectation of a massive loss of seats, and the once unthinkable loss of the Senedd in Wales.Arriving here, graveyard humour echoed around halls and corridors. “Welcome to the walking dead,” one new MP murmured to me. The newbies are the most “frit”, many with tiny majorities, always at risk of just one term on the green benches. But Keir Starmer’ssudden assault on Faragismsent a bolt of electricity through glum delegates. His “battlefor the soul of the nation”has raised hope. (Battle and soul were lacking until now.) Gloves off, with Reform UK a terrifying 10 points ahead, he has started to throw off facing-both-ways caution. This marks a turning point, supporters hope. For the party that championed race discrimination laws, calling out a “racist” policy as “immoral” is compulsory, with vicious abuse on the rise again.Starmer hasamends to makefor his “island of strangers” speech. He apologised, but its effect, says Prof Rob Ford, was that it “increased the salience of immigration and decreased the Labour vote without gaining any voters back from Reform”. Fordwrites this weekthat Farage’s plan to abolish indefinite leave to remain and deport people working in the UK legally for years will backfire: polling finds it deeply unpopular. Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, should be wary of following Reform far down that path. Prof Sir John Curtice, an editor of the British Social Attitudes survey,has warned Starmerto stop chasing Reform voters: they’ve gone. Labour is losing many times more voters to the left than to Farage.Beyond self-interest, an authentic disgust spurs Starmer to confront the enemy at the gates. Rachel Reeves in today’s speech called Reform “the single greatest threatto our way of life and to the living standards of working people”. At last, here’s the clarion warning that Farage is a far greater threat than Oswald Mosley, who never came so close to power. Labour will keep sounding that klaxon from now on. Reeves will be summoning business to join this battle: those industry leaders who made the error of keeping their heads down in cowardice over Brexit have paid a heavy price in lost trade and GDP. They know a Reform government would sink the country, break its existing EU deals and make us a pariah for investment and everything else. They must speak up now. Labour needs wit and mockery too, against the faux-patriotism of pro-Trump, pro-Putin Farage. I first heard the migrants-eat-our-swans myth 30 years ago. The royal parks always exploded it.This spirit of alarm has the power to galvanise depressed Labour troops and maybe erstwhile voters. Perversely, Andy Burnham’s brash shadow coup may also help the Labour leadership. While his path to actual power looks tortuously near-impossible, his influence is felt around this conference. He says, mostly, what party members think, as his protege Lucy Powell’sincreasing leadin the deputy leadership polling shows. At his speech at the proportional representation rally on Sunday, I watched Burnham show them how to do it, thumping out popular tunes, daring the cabinet to follow him. My guess is that they will. He has given them a kicking and a reminder that a party at near-rock bottom (it could get worse) has little to lose but its nerve. On electoral reform, Burnham hammers out the clear and present danger that the next election can be won again on a small minority of votes: he calls for a national commission and a manifesto commitment to introduce proportion representation in the next parliament. Personally, I’d do it now, before it’s too late.But Burnham’s bad blunder on refusing to be “in hock to the bond markets” reveals a deep vulnerability. Liz Truss’s crash-test dummy demonstration showed where that can lead. Of course Labour people want Margaret Thatcher’s disastrous 1980s privatisations reversed, as he pledges, but where’s his money to buy energy and water companies, or reclaim the 2m council homes calamitously sold off? Plenty here may wish they had a different leader, but don’t relish behaving like the Tories: Starmer took over as the sixth prime minister in eight years. Given the extreme impatience of an electorate that seems to expect a Deliveroo government dispensing next-day Amazon parcels of shiny new public services, the chances are a new leader of any party would plummet in no time too, facing all the same intractables that Reeves will struggle with in her budget.Wise pollsters, such as YouGov’s Patrick English, say people only confront a straight choice as elections approach. Currently the left block, if willing to vote tactically, would beat the right block. A YouGov poll in Marchsuggested some Torieswould hold their noses and vote Labour if that was the only choice against Farage in their constituency. Ditto some Labour voters would vote Tory in seats where that was the only serious challenge to Reform.English was speaking at a Best for Britain fringe event that was filled with longing forLabourto break its Brexit omertà. Time to call “patriot” Farage out on the damage he did to Britain. The act of bravery in calling out Farage’s “racist” policy could lead Starmer to many more, as he finds the sky doesn’t fall in.(He could start by revoking the absurd ban on Palestine Action: criminal damage is not terrorism. Dozens of their alleged protesters were arrested outside the fence.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Groundwork has been done: huge investment in green and nuclear energy, in housing, in health, transport and defence. But it takes time to propel the UK to energy self-sufficiency, to see those 12 new towns rise up, to get every “neet” youth into a guaranteed job, to cut child poverty, let alone for people to see and feel change. Starmer will only earn that time by stepping up his battle for the soul on every front. Conferences only secure a few minutes on the news, but they can reset the direction of a party.

But I hadn’t expected this to be such an emotional wrenchMon 29 Sep 2025 10.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 13.51 EDTShareNot counting the many thousands of words I spent complaining about being pregnant, I wrote my first column about my son, T, 18 years ago today, when he was three hours old. Someone said, “Is there some kind of union you could join? Because I’m sure you’re entitled to at least one whole day of maternity leave,” and I was baffled. As far as I was concerned, they should have held the front page – this wasn’t work, this was a dispatch from the frontline of a brave new world.Anyway, some time passed, and T could suddenly talk, and then some further time passed, and he was his own person, out there in the world, and then I blinked, and he was as tall as a tree. People always say to you, “Treasure this time, it goes by in a flash,” right at the moment you have an armful of toddler, puree in your hair and a mouth full of wet wipes because you ran out of hands – which in retrospect was fortunate, because it meant you couldn’t say the thing you would otherwise have said.But I’m not kidding around – this time passed ina flash. I can’t really recall how I spent it, except it can’t all have been staring out of a window, because I was constantly in a rush. And now here we are, and he’s a grown-ass adult, and nothing has changed in so far as he is still him and I am still me, except everything has changed.Technically, it’s now ethical for me to write about him again. Years 2012 through 2025, it wasn’t really OK, since he could read it but he couldn’t meaningfully consent. Even though I knew that, it didn’t stop me, so I guess this next phase will be my apology years.There are mothers who will see themselves into their graves telling you you’ve had too many potatoes (like mine)There are a lot of things I now have to butt out of: it’s none of my business whether he’s vegetarian or how often he washes his hair or what his phone manner is like. And, truthfully, 18 is a completely arbitrary watershed. There are mothers who will see themselves into their graves telling you you’ve had too many potatoes (like mine, for instance), and mothers who, very early on, leave the boundary-setting to a favourite teacher plus CBeebies, then sit back and hope for the best.But let’s say you’re setting the age at which an adult human can say “This is none of your business”: 18 is that age. I don’t know why this is so devastating to me; his manners are lovely and I don’t care how clean his hair is. He isn’t even going to university for another year at the earliest. I walk around the house, fighting back tears, muttering “Nothing has changed”, like Theresa May.My blood type made me a donor superhero – until my weakness for crisps let me down | Zoe WilliamsRead moreIf I had any respect at all for his adult autonomy, this would be the moment I would stop trying to make friends-by-proxy with the parents of his friends. The mum-alliance was a matter of life or death when they were tiny, because how else would you make common cause and blame some Third Other for giving everyone nits? Over time, it transpired that these were very beautiful, unexpected, late-life bonds, but now … now it would just be weird.Of course appalling misdeeds of mine will come up when he gets a therapist, in the fullness of time, but surely by now, those can’t be helped. So my final adaptation, now, is to not just acknowledge the adulthood, but make an effort to actually believe it. No more grabbing his arm when we’re out and about, going: “Look, a horse! T, it’s anair ambulance!” Trust that, whoever’s lost their keys, it’s more likely to be me than him. Accept that just because I made it, it is his hair to do what he wants with.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

The big worry was that the second largest company on the London Stock Exchange would skip off entirely to New York, keeping only a secondary listing in the UK as a face-saver for the government. That, fortunately, is not the plan.Instead, the pharma giant is upgrading its listing on the New York Stock Exchange to give it equal status with the ones in London and Stockholm.AstraZenecawill retain its UK headquarters and its presence in the FTSE 100 index. So, if one is determined to don rose-tinted spectacles, it is possible to pretend there’s nothing fresh for London’s capital markets to fret about.The company says its new “harmonised” listing structure will merely make it easier for those US funds that aren’t allowed to own American depositary receipts (ADRs, a wrapper provided by a handful of banks for US investors) to get their hands on full-fat AstraZeneca stock. “A global listing for global investors in a global company,” as the cheerful corporate spin put it.But this definitely is not a moment to accentuate the positive. The problem is what happens next. It is not hard to imagine AstraZeneca’s arguments being adopted by other large FTSE companies that could equally call themselves “global” on account of generating more of their revenues in the US. Just scroll down the list: Shell, BP, Unilever, Diageo, Relx and so on.None have exactly the same immediate incentive to dress up in stars and stripes while President Trump is on the warpath overUS medicine pricesandpharma tariffs(possibly a factor in the timing of AstraZeneca’s announcement). But all could take the view that ADRs are a hassle and an imperfect substitute for actual shares traded in New York.And, if AstraZeneca’s move were to mark the start of a mid-Atlantic drift – big FTSE 100 companies staying in the index but choosing an equal New York listing – the process inevitably wouldn’t stop there. Share-trading might gravitate to New York because the investment pool there is simply bigger. The other important technicality is that the US, unlike the UK, does not charge a ludicrous stamp duty of 0.5% on share transactions. On that score, a note in AstraZeneca’s circular on Monday revealed that even UK buyers of its shares won’t pay the tax because settlement of trades will happen under the US system. Such a setup would seem to drive a coach and horse through the UK’s stamp duty regime.Welcome to globalisation in action. It may be in retreat in other commercial areas, but it is alive and kicking in capital markets. The traffic won’t be entirely one-way – optimists can point to a £13bn US datacentre company, Fermi, that is joining London’s main market this week alongside its primary US listing – but globalisation comes with a gravitational pull to the US.Rachel Reeves will have weightier matters on her mind currently, but she needs to see the risks here. Stamp duty is a terrible advert for London,as argued here many times, and needs to be abolished. If the chancellor needs to raise £3bn-£4bn from financial transactions, she should find a different design. After that, the job is about stimulating a deeper pool of domestic buyers for UK equities from both the pension fund and retail population.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so tragicMon 29 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 12.44 EDTShareWatching the Kamala Harris presidential campaign unfold last year, I remember thinking,and writing, about how striking it was that she had been rehabilitated almost overnight into a political titan. Authoritative accounts of her before that moment portrayed a lo-fi vice-president, who, evenaccording to peoplewho had worked to get her there, had “not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country”. Another striking feature of her campaign was how it leaned into vibes and spectacle rather than substance, or building faith in Harris as a clean break from an unpopular and visibly deteriorating Joe Biden. Her new book, 107 Days, a memoir of the exact number of days she had to win the presidency, goes a long way in explaining why that was. In short, Harris – and those around her, including supportive media parties – got high on their own supply.This was not the intention, but 107 Days is a hilarious book. The kind of “you have to laugh or else you’ll cry” type of hilarity. As the second Trump administration unfolds in ever-more disastrous ways, Harris and the other timeline that was possible had she won take on a calamitous, mythical quality. Here she comes, alerting us to the fact that her defeat was no fateful tragedy, but a farce. There was no hidden, better version of Harris that was muzzled and limited by circumstance. There was only a woman with a formidable lack of self-awareness and a propensity to self-valorise.The book reveals a politician who is all about the machinery of politics, rather than one with conviction spurred by a sense of duty, or a coherent and specific set of values that differentiate her. The “not a thing that comes to mind” answer she gave whenasked during the campaignif there was anything she would have done differently to Biden was not caution, but the truth. There is no sign here that she would have liked to meaningfully diverge on Gaza, for example, other than to introduce more parity in the rhetoric of compassion. Or any indication that she would have liked to grasp the nettle on economic policy and make more of her accusation that Donald Trump’s economic agenda “works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers”.This dearth of a unique Harris agenda explains why she often seemed so vague, skittish and rambling. How does she receive the news she will be the candidate? By reminding herself (and us) that she had the best “contact book” and “name recognition”, as well as the “strongest case”. She tries to cloak her ambition, saying “knew she could” be president, but only because she “wanted to do the work. I have always been a protector.” It’s fine to have ambition to be the president of the United States! Every cardinal dreams of becoming pope, as Cardinal Bellini of Conclave said. Even he did himself, to his shame, when he lamented upon the discovery of his ambition: “To be this age and still not know yourself.”My abiding feeling reading was: oh God, this was all just as bad as it looked. The celebrity-packed campaign roster was not, in fact, panicked desperation, but the preference of the candidate and her team. They thought that such a range of characters would show that Harris was “welcoming everyone into the campaign” – as if the power of celebrity could do the unifying work of coalition-building, rather than her own programme and politicking. The immersion in the filmic, the celluloid ofUS politicsis so complete that there is a line about Jon Bon Jovi performing for her and it being a good omen, because he performed for a candidate who won in The West Wing. The media loved her. “And behold,” Harris quotes a Washington Post writer, praising her approach to Gaza, “she had her boat through the impossible strait.” Jon Favreau said Harris was “a sight to behold” at the Democratic convention.I lost count of the number of descriptions of crowds exploding, roaring, on fire. The audience applause to Harris’s Saturday Night Live appearance was some of the loudest ever heard. She replays her greatest hits, revealing a politician captured by the reverie of rapturous self-selecting crowds and buzzy studios, fatally unable to connect to thevoters outside the bubble, who had soured on the Democrats and were checking out, or voting for Trump.View image in fullscreenThe then US president, Joe Biden, attends a department of defense commander-in-chief farewell ceremony, in Fort Myer, with Kamala Harris.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersBiden pops up often, a self-involved and petty figure, snapping at her heels and distracting her. But she is loyal, she tells us – often. So loyal that she couldn’t disparage him in the way that people needed her to (“People hate Joe Biden!” she is told by a senior adviser). But not so loyal that she doesn’t more artfully disguise that she wants you to know the man was a real drag who mentioned her too late in his speeches, and then called her before her big debate with Trump to unsubtly threaten her if she bad-mouthed him. But what is most telling, and alarming, is what she reveals about the Democratic establishment, and therefore what hope there is of an awakening among its ranks. One that could pose a meaningful challenge to Trump now, and Trumpism in the future. The 107 days were short, but they were a concentration of a process in which the party and its candidate had to dig deep quickly to unearth the most compelling and defining vision for the American people. The result was to take no risks, offer continuity and scold dissenters as Trump enablers, but with style. It wasn’t enough, and will never be.The answer to the question “what went wrong” isn’t “we didn’t have enough time” to establish Harris. It was that Harris, even now, with all the time to reflect and be honest with herself, is a politician who invests too much in presentation, and entirely exculpates herself of failures because she was dealt a bad political hand. What can you say besides, “to be this age and still not know yourself”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could – and must – act differentlySharon Graham is the general secretary of UniteMon 29 Sep 2025 11.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 12.45 EDTShareThe past two decades in the UK have been dominated by crisis. The 2008 financial crash changed everything, but aside from a bit of dinner party embarrassment, elites carried on as if nothing had happened. For workers, however, it was a different story. And so it almost doesn’t matter what Keir Starmer says in his speech to the Labour party conference on Tuesday. His government still has not grasped the real problems faced by ordinary British people, and that is why Labouris crashing in the polls.Between 1945 and 2008 in the UK, real increases in average wages werethe norm. But after the crash, they stopped rising. If wages had grown to this day as they did prior to 2008, the average worker would be £11,000 a year better off.As if falling wages weren’t bad enough, British people were then clobbered by austerity. Between 2010 and 2019, public services were butchered; the4% real terms cut in spendingwas unprecedented. The axe swung wildly, but perhaps nowhere felt its blade more than local government. The effectsof austerity are stillbeing felt to this day: councils havesold off£2.9bn of public assets in the past two years alone, including sports clubs and day centres.Then came Covid. When politicians took to the airwaves and implored essential workers to come to the aid of the country, they promised that things would be different on the other side – that they would be rewarded with more than banging pots. Nothing could have been further from the truth.Starmer should have conference in his hands – instead, power is slipping through his fingers | Frances RyanRead morePrices have soared while essential workers’wageshave stagnated. Food prices are up by 38% since 2021 and forecast to rise by another 6%. Household energy bills are 44% higher than they were duringwinter 2021 with the cap due to increase againnext week.But not everyone has suffered. Since 2021, Tesco has paid out £12.4bn to its shareholders, and Unite’s latest research shows that the top 200 energy companies recorded profits of more than £30bnin 2024.A Unite studyof 17,000 companies found that average profit margins have soared by 30% since pre-pandemic levels, as workers and communities pay the price of these profits by spending an ever-greater portion of their income on goods. No wonder people feel the system is rigged against them. Our politicians, meanwhile,argue about black holes and fiscal rules. The government’s focus on arbitrary fiscaltargets means it is constantly panicking over the latest economic news, rather than delivering a long-term plan for jobs and British industry. This has led to a string of terrible choices, such as trying to pitchpensionersanddisabled peopleagainst workers and their communities.Labour hasdoubled down on Liz Truss’s promise to give the bankers back their mega bonuses. Are any lessons being learned?Labour’s performance has been compounded by what the Resolution Foundation called the weakest spending review since George Osborne’s austerity years. Between 1966 and 2010, government spending on health and social care grew by an average of 4.2% each year. This year’s increase was only 2.8%. Other departments fared even worse.It doesn’t have to be this way. If politicians made different choices, they couldsupport our services and rescue our crumbling national infrastructure.They have done it before. After the second world war, the debt-to-GDP ratio was close to 250% – more than double what it is now. But Clement Attlee’s government chose massive public investment, created the NHS and rebuilt the country. Even in the 1950s, public investment as a share of national income stood at 7.3%. Now it is 2.7%,and well below the average for advanced OECD economies since the turn of the century.Our government isfiddling while others fully commit. Labour has put just over £50bn into theNational Wealth Fundand theBritish Business Bank. The equivalent institutions in Germany have €1tn (£870bn) in funding: its state investment fundKFWhas €580bn and the new ““special fund” has €500bn allocated for investment into the country’s defence and infrastructure.So long as growth remains anaemic, the only option other than economicderegulation is public investment. The government can restore our public services without hiking the taxes of everyday workers. Unite has looked atproposals from academic expertsthat together would raise more than £50bn a year. From taxing the wealth of the top 1% at an annual rate of 1%, to equalising capital gains tax with income tax rates and extending national insurance to apply to investment income, the government has options. This is what Starmer should be proposing in his speech to conference. But he will not. All these solutions require a departure from the failed economic norms of the last generation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other Labour voters are moving rapidly towards Reform UK, whose attraction lies not just in flags and culture wars, but in the perceived possibility of change.Those whomarched with Tommy Robinsonin London are not all racists. Many are simply trying to make their voices heard against what they believe to be a rigged political system. They march against a cost of living crisis that has no end. Against an economic system that is broken. There is a growing belief that the traditional political parties do not speak for them or care about their concerns.Is it any wonder that both main political parties, this conference season, are on their knees?

Facebook mums clink plastic cups of frozen cocktails. Dads sneak their teenage daughters to the front of the heaving queue for the women’s toilets, which a girl with large hoop earrings has taken it upon herself to run like the navy (“Go! No time for wiping!”). A man desperately tries to keep up with his drunk-on-a-mission missus by hanging on to her belt loops, while a group of lads with photorealistic tattoos argue over whether to load up on pints or head in to secure a premium standing position. In every direction, best friends of all generations doggedly traverse a packed-out Wembley Stadium, each clutching two pints and a Twix to their chest. Others lean in for group selfies beneath the gigantic digital sign proclaiming “Oasis Live ’25”.The air is a tangle of Glaswegian accents, Rochdale accents, Cardiff accents, East End accents and Scouse accents as strangers genially befriend each other; the horizon a jumble of jeans-and-shoes, jorts, and bucket hats of all designs. There are people in original 1994 Definitely Maybe tour shirts, and people who weren’t even born whenCreation Recordsdissolved; Gen X ravers who now manage sales teams, and millennials repping the H&M Pacha collection. There are sober twentysomethings, retired pillheads and, judging by the (small) number of people walking sideways, active ketamine enthusiasts. This is, in short, the most accurate cross-section of the British general public you will ever experience outside of a motorway service station.This weekend marked the final UK dates of Oasis’s sold-out reunion tour, which began in Cardiff on 4 July and is due to end in Sao Paulo on 23 November. “Did you miss us?” Liam, chewing gum, rhetorically asks the first of two 90,000-strong crowds. Then the band promptly launch into “(What’s The Story) Morning Glory?” and £8 pints go up in the air.The scenes have been essentially the same around the world. Fans in Mexico City held up hand-drawn banners saying “Oasis saved me” and “R kid can I have your tambourine”. Fans in Dublin wore little round glasses over Irish flag balaclavas. Despite their relative lack of popularity in the US previously, Oasis fever has been as strong there as anywhere else. A Varietyreview, titled “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend”, describes a nostalgic and star-studded Rose Bowl Stadium crowd (which included Leonardo DiCaprio and Kamala Harris) trying and failing to do Man City’s Poznań dance.Anotherdescribes coffee shops and bars in Pasadena packed to the rafters with British paraphernalia, dovetailing with a summer in which Anglophilia has been strangely prevalent – be it through Bonnie Blue, that American TikTok lad who’s obsessed with being a “charva”, or the omnipresent jingle of “nothing beats a Jet2Holiday”.Everyone is here. It’s the most accurate cross-section of the British general public you will meet outside of a motorway service stationIt’s easy to write Oasis off as a “damaging pop cultural force” at home, where their image is invariably wrapped up with Cool Britannia messaging, the false promise of New Labour, and the simplicity of Euro 96 and that Walkers campaign where they shoved fivers into packets of crisps. As the band runs through a two-hour bangers-only setlist, however, it’s clear that A) no one cares, and B) that argument over-intellectualises something that is actually pretty simple: Oasis are responsible for a sizeable chunk of the most timeless songs in rock history.You don’t need to be from the UK to understand them, but their blend of bravado and tenderness articulates a fundamental experience of being British. Working-class egos are often demonised in the media, but in Oasis’s lyrics they run free: stifled ambitions are turned into supernovas. They have made an art form of our tendency to romanticise the banal and the abject in order to imagine lives much larger than the ones afforded to us (“You could wait for a lifetime / To spend your days in the sunshine …”). And, like Premier League footballers, we admire them because they made it happen.View image in fullscreenMore Oasis fans in Cardiff.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianAt Wembley, the Gallaghers, men of few words (on stage, anyway), communicate mostly through brief affirmations (“Nice one”) and “fucking come on then” hand gestures, and nod to broader goings-on through homage. Noel dedicates Half the World Away to the Irish and Little By Little to “the mandem”, and an image of the late boxing legend Ricky Hatton fills the screen at the end of Live Forever. Lads with shotta bags hug and climb on each other’s shoulders. Girls twirl each other. Men arrange themselves in circles and do that dance where they bend their knees, poke their arses back and point their index fingers one hand at a time. Primary school kids to the retired all throw their arms in the air alike, outstretched like Jesus on the cross, and the whole stadium erupts into a cry of “Why, why, why,why” as Champagne Supernova closes the set.The Sunday papers prepare to print Tony Blair’s face on their front pages as he makes his utterly unwanted return to geopolitics. Meanwhile, the closest anyone has felt to national peace in decades comes courtesy of some fiftysomething blokes from Longsight and Burnage playing songs about cigarettes, alcohol, and brief glimpses of glory.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

But trying to outflank Reform UK carries electoral risksMon 29 Sep 2025 13.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 17.41 EDTShareRachel Reeves andShabana Mahmood– Labour’s Iron Ladies – made revealing interventions at their party conference. They appear to be scripting a new governing philosophy: fiscal restraint,border controlfrom the state, good behaviour from the public. It’s a message designed to deflect attacks from the right and pre-empt internal criticism. But it will also unsettle Labour’s base and blur the party’s moral line.Ms Reeves was first up, saying she no longerstandsby a pledge made last year not to raise taxes, blaming an uncertain world. That bombshell news was primed for detonation by the chancellor’s insistence that there would be no further softening of her self‑imposed fiscal rules. LastOctobershe had changed them to enable higher investment spending. But the public, she was clear, should expect no such largesse this time round.Ms Mahmood, meanwhile, used her first speech to conference as home secretary to dramatically redraw the immigration compact. She proposed raising the threshold for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) from five years to 10. Controversially, she also said successful applicants would be required to have no criminal record, speakEnglish to a high standard, be in work, receive no benefits, and give back to their community. Contribution, it seems, would determine settlement.The political logic is straightforward. Labour’s leadership team is triangulating the threat from Reform UK on the right while insulating itself from the soft‑left threat posed by the mayor of Greater Manchester,Andy Burnham. The goal is to be rhetorically tough on migration and spending while still gesturing towards fairness and security.This approach carries electoral risks that Labour’s leadership underplays. At aDemos fringe meeting, Sir John Curticeshowed that Labour is already losing votes to the Greens and Lib Dems. These losses are concentrated in urban areas and university towns, seats that the party cannot afford to neglect. The ILR proposals may alienate ethnic minority and liberal voters who hear in Ms Mahmood’s speech not a challenge to Nigel Farage but an echo of him. Triangulation may keep Reform UK at bay, but it risks unraveling Labour’s own coalition from within.Though Ms Mahmood explicitly warned against the rise of ethno-nationalism, her policy platform muddies the waters. Deterrence, removals, conditional settlement are not rhetorical gestures; they are policy commitments. Talking tough is one thing. But if Labour ends up with outcomes similar to those Reform covets, voters may not see any difference. There is an important distinction. Sir Keir Starmer branded Reform’s plan to deport migrants already settled in the UK as “racist and immoral”. Ms Mahmood targets only future applicants. But by adding tests of work, English and “volunteering”, she risks turning the right to settle here into a political judgment of a person’s worth. That invites legal challenge, moral ambiguity and confusion over who truly belongs.Ms Mahmood’s speech looks less like a chasing of headlines than a fundamental repositioning. She is defining herself as afuture Labour leaderand a patriotic, plain-speaking, Muslim home secretary. She is also staking out a new Labour doctrine: migrants have to earn the invite. But this comes at a price. The party’s ideological centre of gravity is shifting – away from liberal universalism and towards transactional belonging. But it is a step backwards for Labour to only offer belonging to those who pass a morality test rather than one that guarantees rights as a matter of principle.Explore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionRachel ReevesShabana MahmoodKeir StarmerImmigration and asylumNigel FarageReform UKeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Diplomatic efforts must be intensifiedMon 29 Sep 2025 13.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 15.12 EDTShareWhen the history of the 21st century is written, the name of El Fasher will surely appear on its bleakest pages. Thebesiegement of the cityby Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) haslasted more than 500 days. Families aresurviving on animal feed. An estimated 260,000 civilians face a terrifying choice: to stay anddie of starvation or in an airstrike– or attempt to flee and face rape, robbery and death.El Fasher is the last major city in Darfur still defended by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) – and allied fighters – in the bloody and unrelenting struggle with the RSF, which has lasted almost two and a half years. Yet a conflict that has created the world’slargest humanitarian crisishas remained largely ignored as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have consumed international attention. In the runup to the UN general assembly in New York last week, the US finally appeared to bemaking a push for action.With Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it called for a three-month truce to allow aid deliveries, leading to a permanent ceasefire. Separately, the African Union, European Union, UK and others called for the two sides to resume direct talks.For too many, especially in Darfur, the diplomatic action has come far too late. Even as discussions took place in New York, the horrors in El Fasher mounted. About 150,000 people – perhaps many more – are believed to have been killed in the civil war and 12 million people have been displaced, many of them intoother fragile states. Almost25 million face acute hunger. The US hasaccused the RSF of genocide, both sides have committed war crimes and the Sudanese army is accusedof using chemical weapons.This conflict could not have been so deadly without the interference of outside parties. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are aligned with the SAF; the UAE denies backing the RSF, but diplomats, analysts and campaigners believethat it is supplying arms and other support. The joint call was a rare and faint sign of potential diplomatic progress.There is no indication that the internal players are any closer to considering peace. Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the SAF, may be even less minded to give ground since his troops took back Khartoum this spring. That led the RSF, under Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – tointensify its campaignin Kordofan and particularly Darfur. Some believethe RSF is serious about partitioning Sudan; others that it wants leverage. Divisions and competing interests within both forces may make it harder to resolve the war.Renewed diplomatic effort is welcome, but it must be serious and it must be sustained. Critics say that the UK – the penholder on Sudan at the UN security council – has prioritised maintaining its relations with the UAE. The devastation in Sudan speaks to a wider crisis too, as Dr Comfort Ero, head of the International Crisis Group,warned this month. More leaders worldwide now feel confident to pursue their aims militarily, without expecting significant pressure on them, while middle powers are exporting their interests and rivalries. This war is currently being waged most brutally in El Fasher. But what happens in Darfur in the days and weeks to come will help to determine what happens elsewhere in Sudan, in the region and around the world.Explore more on these topicsSudanOpinionDarfurHungerUnited NationsSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesEgypteditorialsShareReuse this content"

Our unwritten constitution rests on the hard-won principle that we are citizens, not subjects of the government. Free people who are not required to carry papers at the demand of authority – an authority that is our servant, not our master. At present, the state may ask us for identification, but it cannot compel us. That distinction is not a quibble of law but a line in the sand – it defines the relationship between people and power.Britain has long stood apart from continental traditions of state surveillance. The freedom to go about one’s business without having to show papers has always been more than a convenience; it is a quiet assertion of dignity, liberty and trust in the people. To surrender that would not be a mere technical change, but a constitutional rupture. We should resist it with all the clarity and passion such a betrayal deserves.Dorian KellyColchester, EssexYour report says “Tony Blair’s plans for ID cards were abandoned in the 2000s” – this is not quite right. TheIdentity Cards Actreceived royal assent in 2006. Steps were then taken to implement it, including issuing cards (I used mine instead of a passport on various occasions). Jacqui Smith, the then home secretary, announced in 2008 that by 2014-15, 90% of all foreign nationals in the country would have been issued with a card.However, the first act of Theresa May when she became home secretary in 2010 was to repeal the legislation, abandon ID cards and set up a photocall to physically destroy the hard disk containing the data on the national identity register. Her decision severely weakened this country’s capacity to control immigration, with the disastrous consequences we see today. I am delighted that this government is intending to re-establishing a modernised digital system.Charles ClarkeHome secretary, 2004-06As a retired director of IT, I find myself screaming when I hear politicians misrepresent how a digital ID would work. It is clear that they have only a rudimentary grasp of IT when they talk about “carrying a digital ID on your smartphone”. This is not how the system would work.What is proposed is for anyone with the right to live and work in the UK to have their biometric details (typically, photograph and fingerprints) held on a government database. This already happens in many cases (eg when applying for a passport or a work visa).As well as the risks of holding such data centrally, there is the issue of how the data will be accessed. Yes, you might be able to carry a copy on a smartphone, but how secure is your phone? A lot of people sacrifice security for convenience. Yes, an employer might need to access the database, but how will that be controlled? This is a can of worms and I wish politicians could explain it accurately.John RobinsonDeal, KentWhy doesKeir Starmernot mention the most important advantage of ID cards, that they make it easier and simpler to vote? The framing of the issue in terms of controlling immigration rather than strengthening democracy speaks volumes about how far his government has abandoned the last vestiges of socialism. Even when it does the right thing, it is for the wrong reasons.Andrew HallidayBremen, GermanyHere inFrance, where I’ve lived since 1997, ID cards are a major convenience. They’re invaluable when registering a car, dealing with banks, applying for loans, entering hospital and many other everyday situations. Over the border in Spain, hotel receptionists ask for them during check-in. Nobody here understands the paranoia in a Britain. But our ID cards are physical. If I was Keir Starmer, I’d introduce paper ones and forget digital.Martin CastellanLéran, Ariège, FranceI doubt unscrupulous employers hiring illegal migrants, or the migrants themselves, are going to be deterred by a national identity card that seeks to stop both parties from breaking the law. They already know they’re doing that. It’s called the “shadow economy” for a reason.Mike GalvinWinchcombe, GloucestershireI assume those whose opposition to a digital ID is based on the threat posed by having their data stored on a central computer system will no longer be visiting EU countries once they are forced to provide fingerprints and a photograph to travel to those countries (Will the EU’s new fingerprint entry system cause gridlock? The Guardian tried it out, 27 September).Mike LowcockSandbach, CheshireWhy the fuss about ID cards? I still have my national registration identity card, issued in 1943 and signed by my father.

As both an alumna of the school and a professor of English literature, I am deeply concerned about this act.The rationale for the ban for year 10 – that the novel teaches children that “skin colour” makes them “baddies” – is simply not supported by the novel. At its centre is a relationship between young people from different ethnic backgrounds learning about racial difference from each other. The suggestion that “by extension” the novel leads Britain itself to be cast as “a baddie” is deeply worrying.It suggests a notion of Britishness that excludes non-white people but does include Americans – perhaps recalling our own migrant and colonial history. There is an irony there that those supporting the ban may wish to ponder.Finally, as a first-generation academic who learned the importance of literature in that very library, I am keen that we widen rather than narrow the opportunities for reading. Progression into higher education islower in south-west coastal communitiesthan elsewhere in the country. Budmouth students should be encouraged to read and expand their knowledge of the world – especially when it doesn’t coincide with their own worldviews.This novel has been powerful in encouraging children to come back to reading and should be celebrated for that.

Watson’s comments come after Rory McIlroy confirmedhis wife, Erica, was hit by a beer thrown by a fan.“I’d like to congratulate Europe on their victory,”said Watson on X. “Your team play the first few days was sensational. More importantly, I’d like to apologise for the rude and mean-spirited behaviour from our American crowd at Bethpage. As a former player, captain and as an American I am ashamed of what happened.”US fan ugliness at the Ryder Cup was merely a reflection of Trump’s all-caps America | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreWatson, an eight-time major winner who played in five Ryder Cups and captained the US team in 2014, also relayed his apology directly to the European team.His comments are in stark contrast to the class of 2025.Collin Morikawa had asked for fans to bring “chaos”and the American captain,Keegan Bradley, stopped well shortof properly condemning the situation at Bethpage despite police and dogs lining fairways. “I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” saidMcIlroy, who encountered vehement abusetowards himself and his wife.Watson’s comment shows it may take some time for dust to settle on the 45th Ryder Cup. European team celebrations, which ran long into the night, were understandably wild after a first victory on US soil since 2012.Success underLuke Donaldmeans Europe now favour captains for multiple Ryder Cups. Those behind the team regard it as far easier to prepare for an away staging of the event with knowledge built up from a Ryder Cup at home. His approach to captaincy in Rome two years ago and New York has been widely praised. It seems inevitable he will be involved in some capacity in the future. For now, he is not completely ruling out a third term.Donald had taken guidance from tennis players, including the three-time US Open champion Ivan Lendl, on how to handle a New York crowd. Lendl defeated home favourite John McEnroe for the first of his victories, in 1985. Donald believed the backdrops to tennis and golf, where spectators are urged to remain quiet for shots, were the most comparable.3:31Rory McIlroy condemns Ryder Cup abuse after his wife was hit by a beer – video“The weeks we spend together are the ones we remember the most and the ones we cherish the most because of the time we get to spend with each other,” he said. “That’s a big part of my captaincy, to create an environment where these guys are having the best weeks of their lives. We’ll always remember this. We’ll always go down in history.Eagles, Donalds and bubbly: Ryder Cup 2025 – in picturesRead more“We talk about all the people that came before us that paved the way for us. Now future generations will talk about this team and what they did and how they were able to overcome one of the toughest environments in all of sport.”Justin Rose had been the most likely European captain for 2025 and Adare Manor in Ireland. However, Rose’s playing performance here may give him cause to think he could compete again in two years’ time. Francesco Molinari would come into the frame in that circumstance.It has been widely assumed Tiger Woods will succeed Bradley and lead the US, but the absence of the 15-time major winner from Bethpage raises questions over that scenario.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupLuke DonaldTom WatsonGolfUS sportsRory McIlroynewsShareReuse this content"

The self-styled “special one” is back with Benfica for Tuesday night’sChampions Leaguetie and he repeated another famous old line of his to set the scene.Mourinho anticipates no hostility from Chelsea’s supporters as he seeks to ignite his Benfica tenure, having only joined them 11 days ago after his sacking by Fenerbahce at the end of August.Mourinho’s return looms large as Chelsea and Maresca endure untimely blipRead moreIt has not always been the case when he has gone back to Stamford Bridge, with the nadir coming when he was barracked as the visiting Manchester United manager during an FA Cup defeat in March 2017. Mourinho, who won three Premier League titles for Chelsea across two spells, made the point back then that until another manager won four at the club, then “Judas is No 1”.“Chelsea is a winning machine that had in the past two or three years a moment without trophies,” Mourinho said on Monday night, back at the stadium where he gave his original ‘special one’ press conference.“But Chelsea won something before my time and then we start winning and then my team kept winning and then a transformation of new teams, new coaches, more trophies, European trophies, the biggest one and the Champions League. So Chelsea is a winning machine. I am the biggest one until someone wins four.”Mourinho has been back to Stamford Bridge with Inter, United and Tottenham; his lone victory in seven attempts came with Inter in 2009-10 en route to winning the Champions League. There was warmth from him as he held court in the stadium’s Drake Suite, which is adorned with giant framed photographs of him celebrating each of his three Premier League titles.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho said the fracas after a late Chelsea equaliser against his Manchester United side in October 2018 has been misinterpreted.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMourinho’s family home remains close by in south-west London and he said that his son came every weekend to the ground. He also talked about how the club would be “my Chelsea before the game and my Chelsea after,” although – by dint of the terms of engagement – he stressed it would be “my Benfica” during it.“I’ve already played here with Tottenham, Man United and Inter Milan,” Mourinho said.“In 90 minutes, I didn’t think where I was or with who I was playing. So I say: ‘I am not a blue any more … I am [Benfica] red now.’ And I want to win.“But of course, I will always be a blue. I am part of their history and they are part of my history. I helped them to become a bigger Chelsea and they helped me to become a bigger José. When I say I am not a blue I hope everybody understands me – I am speaking about the job that I have to do.”“But in relation to these pictures [in the Drake suite] … there are not many clubs that do this. In many, many clubs it looks like there is a fear of what happened in the past and there is continuous transformation of pictures – sometimes it looks like they want to delete people that made history in the clubs. I think this shows that Chelsea is really a big club because big clubs are also about principles.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came in October 2018 when his United team conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to the Chelsea of Maurizio Sarri.“When something happened, it was that one member of the Chelsea dugout insulted me,” Mourinho said, meaning Sarri’s coach, Marco Ianni. “I reacted and people thought I was reacting to the Chelsea goal because they scored in the last minute. It was not the case.“The coach was Sarri and he was absolutely top in the way he reacted to his assistant. Also, Chelsea was top in the way they dealt with it. And I was also top because Chelsea wanted to sack the guy and I told them no. Not because of something that happened in a football match. Leave the man in peace and on the bench.

It was a huge privilege to be here and watch one of the best rugby occasions of all-time. Historic, special, incredible and many other words to describe an incredible tournament.“In my view and I have been involved in a few of these, we have been involved in the greatest Rugby World Cup of all-time. A tournament that delivered on every single level. It didn’t just raise the bar, it has gone stratospheric, broken records, changed perceptions and showcased the very best of our sport and our players.”Gilpin also added that he believed the men’s tournament could bring players’ personalities out more at their next World Cup, which is being held in Australia in 2027.“What stood out [during the 2025 tournament] the most was the power of personality,” he said. “The tournament has showed young people everywhere that in rugby you can be yourself. It’s a sport where individuality and diversity are celebrated, where old perceptions are now being challenged and overturned and a sport where everyone belongs.“A few weeks ago I sat here and said I thought the men’s game could learn a lot from this tournament, I think that is even clearer now. Greater accessibility and more personality creates more stars. That is what we need in our sport. It is the future of sport. This World Cup has proved that being yourself, being visible on social media, sharing opinions, engaging the fans and the media is not a distraction, it’s a performance-enabler because when players are happy they play their best rugby,”A record 5.8 million viewers tuned in on BBC One for the final, the most watched rugby game of the year in the UK, including the men’s Six Nations and the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia.The next women’s international competition is the Women’s Six Nations which kicks off on 11 April.

A revitalised West Ham earned a point at Everton, but deserved more after a fine second-half performance.It is a green shoot of hope, which did not look forthcoming before the break when Everton held a lead thanks to Michael Keane’s header. West Ham equalisedthrough Jarrod Bowen’s superb strikeand from then on were the most likely winners. It was not to be for Nuno but he knows this point and performance give him a platform to build on.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“I love it, it is my life,” Nuno said of coaching. “This is just a very small step forward for us. We are starting now with a lot of work in front of us, but we are delighted with the challenge.”After a couple of training sessions with his new charges, Nuno deployed his favoured 4-2-3-1 formation. The players were adapting to the new system as each second ticked by, offering intensity to impress their new coach, but were outplayed byEvertonin the early stages.If West Ham are at the design stage, Everton are becoming a well-oiled machine under David Moyes. This helped the hosts dominate early on, controlling possession and moving the ball across the pitch as they looked to find gaps. Beto and Iliman Ndiaye had chances but sent their efforts straight at Alphonse Areola while Everton were on top.There is plenty of individual quality at Nuno’s disposal and it is his job to maximise its potential and form a cohesive unit. Graham Potter paid the price for not consistently getting the best out of players but he could also point the finger at a disjointed recruitment policy that began long before his arrival. The former West Ham head coach will be irritated that he did not have Crysencio Summerville available for much of his tenure because the winger was the visitors’ best outlet, causing problems by driving at Jake O’Brien down Everton’s right that persisted throughout the night.View image in fullscreenMichael Keane heads the ball beyond the reach of Alphonse Areola.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/ShutterstockWest Ham were conservative, as Nuno demands. Everton pushed them back and an opener felt inevitable. It arrived through a perfect inswinging cross from the left by James Garner, which an unmarked Keane rose highest to head home over the goalkeeper, leaving Nuno frustrated by his side’s indiscipline. Moyes has added more flair and quality to his squad for this season but Keane is quickly becoming one of his most dependable players in both boxes, an impressive turnaround for someone who was previously maligned. It was, however, the last real threat of the night from Everton as they allowed West Ham back into the match.At this point, Nuno might have been wondering if he should have spent more time off practising the handpan and riding horses. Instead, he is trying to drag a struggling side out of the relegation zone. Unfortunately for Nuno, one thing he cannot remedy are the constant mistakes that have been made by those above the coaching and playing staff. There is growing discontent among the West Ham supporters, who chanted “sack the board”, “we want our club back” and more explicit things aimed at the owner, David Sullivan, and the hierarchy. “It’s our main priority that we come closer to our fans,” Nuno said. “We have to deliver so they can appreciate the work of the boys. It’s a nice moment for us moving forward.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Summerville almost levelled after capitalising on an error from O’Brien. The winger, aided by El Hadji Malick Diouf, terrorised the Everton full-back throughout the game. Diouf created the equaliser, swinging in a cross which Keane flicked straight to Bowen, who proved his talismanic status through a fine touch and sublime finish beyond Jordan Pickford. He kissed the badge in front of the away end and took the acclaim.West Ham were on top at that point and their momentum built, forcing Everton, who drifted out of the contest, into mistakes and Pickford into saves, but they could not find a winner. If it was not for some last-ditch blocks, West Ham might have secured only their second victory of the season, the first coming against Nuno at the City Ground. Either way, Nuno knows nothing compares with the joys and intensity of being aPremier Leaguehead coach. The music and equestrian can wait: this is Nuno’s first love.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Grimacing through the agony of a dislocated shoulder, it made for front page news and a fitting, albeit unwitting, exit.Few Test careers get endings such asStuart Broad’s mic‑dropat the same ground, or the sentimental farewells laid onfor Jimmy Andersonor Alastair Cook. But this one suited Woakes: full circle at the scene of his Test debut 12 years earlier and still putting the team first.Chris Woakes retires from international cricket to end 15-year England careerRead moreAged 36, with salt and pepper in the beard and the central contract expiring, there was really only one outcome. Though the wise old owl of the post‑Anderson attack – entrusted with overseeing its transition at home – the numbers from two previous Ashes tours had made selection this winter touch and go, even before that shoulder popped.Butthose well-documented struggles on the road– arrested a touch last winter, it should be said – are not the epitaph. The career highlights are bucket-list stuff for any cricketer worth their salt, with 192 Test wickets, more than 2,000 Test runs, two white‑ball World Cup winsin 2019and2022, plus the Compton‑Miller medal for player of the series in the 2023 Ashes.There were the Boy’s Own moments, such as man of the match in aWorld Cup semi-final demolition of Australiaon his home ground,hitting the winning runs in an Ashes Testat Headingley anda century against India at Lord’sto claim an entry on all three honours boards. Whether with a Dukes ball or his trusty Gray-Nicolls in hand, the Wizard cast a fair few spells along the way.That nickname first came about on an under-19s tour in 2006-07 as part of some epic darts tournaments in the team hotel.Woakes, a quiet but confident lad from Great Barr in Birmingham, was one of those all-round sporty types who flirted with professional football at one stage.But encouraged by his cricket‑loving father, Roger, and two older half‑brothers, Woakes was only ever set on one path. Starting out at Aston Manor, before moving to Walmley in search of a higher standard in the Birmingham and District League, he was whispered about as a future England player during a frictionless rise through the Warwickshire academy.View image in fullscreenChris Woakes was a big part of the England side that won the 2019 World Cup.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APNot that it was plain-sailing. After a one-day debut in Australia in 2011 aged 21 – and a six-wicket haul in his second outing – came a spell of patchy returns, injuries and a struggle to convince. England were pushing hard for more pace from their hopefuls, but this initially compromised his natural swing and seam movement.Just when it looked like it might never happen for him – a chastening tour of South Africa in 2015-16 prompted a swathe of criticism – came the season that changed it all. An injury to Ben Stokes opened up a place and Woakes, fresh from a career-best nine-fer for Warwickshire, and backed by Cook, truly blossomed.The public were not just won over by a summer that ended with him being named one of Wisden’s cricketers of the year, including 11 wicketsagainst Pakistan at Lord’sto start something of a love affair with the ground. Folks also began to truly appreciate the understated, unflashy qualities that were the foundation to it all: qualities such as attitude, selflessness and professionalism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps if Stokes had not emerged from the rubble of the 2013-14 Ashes, Woakes might also have stepped up as the Test side’s all-rounder, with seven of his 10 first-class centuries compiled before turning 25.England’s Chris Woakes: ‘It’s not the way you want to be front-page news’Read moreBut Woakes was always appreciative that he shared a dressing room with all three, while Eoin Morgan’s decision to pension off Anderson and Broad at the start of his white‑ball project in 2015 presented an alternative path. As the two greats specialised, Woakes spread his wings as an all‑format player and the attack leader for Morgan’s all-conquering side.A family man who met his wife, Amie, at school, Woakes never courted controversy and was widely acknowledged as one of the nicest guys on the circuit. Even his one slip-up during 15 years of media interactions – saying Jofra Archer’s late World Cup call-up might not be “fair” on the man to miss out – was a case of politely trying to engage with a loaded question.Woakes let his cricket do the talking in the main, which in English conditions often proved irresistible. Just ask Australia who, for all the focus on Broad’s bail-flipping farewell in 2023, were chiefly undone by Warwickshire’s Wizard on the day.Two years later, Woakes said goodbye on that very same stage, arm in a sling and to an ovation that recognised the man as much as the moment. After a career that always put England first, he leaves with his head held high.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is not quite five months since Tottenham last came north of the Arctic Circle and, for all that Thomas Frank insisted this is a “new situation”,that previous meeting with Bodø/Glimtin the semi-final of the Europa League can not but colour this one in the league phase of the Champions League.There was an odd echo, too, in the buildup. Back then, the Glimt full-back Fredrik Sjøvold was dismissive of Tottenham’s pressing, which clearly riled Ange Postecoglou.Arsenal’s late heroics at Newcastle and peerless Palace beat Liverpool – Football WeeklyRead moreFrank is not somebody who gets riled, but he seemed taken aback by a (non-critical) comment from the Bodø goalkeeper Nikita Haikin expressing surprise at how much focus Spurs place on long throws and set-plays. A third of goals come from set-plays, Frank pointed out; why would Spurs not try to use them? “Set pieces are extremely important.”Creativity, though, has been a problem for Tottenham as their flying start has yielded to a slightly more difficult phase. They lie fourth in the table, but are ninth in the Premier League for chance creation.“Last year,” said Frank, “most of the games, it was [Dejan] Kulusevski, [James] Maddison, Sonny [Heung-min] and Dom[inic Solanke] who played. Now we have more or less a new front four and they are doing very well. Maybe we are creating more chances, dominating a bit more. All the right signs are there.”It will be some time before Solanke is available. He sustained an ankle injury in the summer and has been restricted to two substitute appearances in the league this season. An injection during the last international break failed to resolve the problem so he will have what Frank referred to as “a small procedure” that is likely to keep him out for a few more weeks. Cristian Romero did not travel for precautionary reasons, while Randal Kolo Muani is just getting over a dead leg.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank dismissed any significance the artificial pitch may have.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersBodø’s artificial pitch, inevitably, has drawn a lot of the attention, but Frank was determined to play down its significance. “It’s the same in Denmark, when I was coach for Brøndby, we were facing Nordjylland at that time. It was also a different surface. It’s the same today. It’s fine. They’re good here, they’re very good at home.“There’s a lot of talk about the pitch. I rather want to praise the team, the Bodø team, and their coach, what they do. Because they do it quite consistently, home and away, the way they play.”Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreFrank turned down the opportunity to have his side train on the pitch. “If we have training here and we want to do a little bit of tactical work, with all due respect it would be a little bit more obvious what we would do. That’s the thing we like to keep for ourselves.“If we train here, for how long we are allowed, 45 minutes? Is that going to make a difference? I know the surface is different. If you really want to get used to it, you need to train here day in, day out as Bodø do.”Even at this short remove it is hard to fathom just how tense that game last season seemed at the time.Spurs led 3-1from the first leg, but, largely because they conceded seven minutes from time when apparently in complete control, there was a fear they could somehow mess it up.Tottenham’s history plus Angeball was a potent brew. Or rather the memory of Angeball, because Postecoglou had by then long since abandoned his ultra-attacking principles for something more orthodox and more effective. A scrappy game was settled by goals from Solanke and Pedro Porro in the space of six minutes midway through the second half. It was a functional way of winning, but it was the penultimate stage on the journeyto triumph in Bilbao, so it stands as part of a glorious narrative.For Frank, an awayChampions Leaguegame against the same opponents simultaneously matters less and will probably be judged more harshly, but no team is ever going to rebound from finishing 17th in the Premier League directly to the sunlit uplands.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurThomas FrankBodø/GlimtEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

For the moment at least, however, the chance of something adjacent to summer ground this weekend will be welcome news for connections of a three-strong Japanese challenge – Croix Du Nord, Byzantine Dream and Alohi Alii – but perhaps less so for backers of Aidan O’Brien’s second-string, Los Angeles, who was third home on soft ground 12 months ago, behind Bluestocking and Aventure.O’Brien has already racked up 19 Group One wins this season after True Love’s success in the Cheveley Park Stakes on Saturday, and he has entries in all eight of the Group One events over the two-day Arc meeting. Minnie Hauk, who has Group One-winning form on both good-to-soft and good-to-firm ground this year, is vying for favouritism with Christophe Ferland’s Aventure with British bookmakers at around 4-1.“Everything has gone well with them since their last runs,” O’Brien said of his two runners over the weekend. “Christophe [Soumillon, the stable’s temporary number one rider with Ryan Moore sidelined by injury] rode Minnie Hauk during the week and he was very happy.“Los Angeles has made great improvement since his last run and if the ground gets soft it would bring him right into it, he’s a big powerhouse.”A fractured femur, which was diagnosed in late August after troubling him for several weeks, has forced Moore on to the sidelines for the remainder of the year, but also offers Soumillon an unexpected chance to add a third Arc to his record, after wins on Zarkava and Dalakhani in 2003 and 2008 respectively.Soumillon has been such a force in the saddle over the past 20 years, both in France and worldwide, that it is a little jarring to realise that his last Arc victory was 17 years ago. But then even O’Brien, who has saddled no fewer than 11 Derby winners at Epsom over the course of his career, has just two Arc wins to his name, with Dylan Thomas and Found in 2007 and 2016 respectively.O’Brien’s relative lack of success in the Arc is a reminder of how difficult it can be to beat the French on their home turf, and adds further lustre to André Fabre’s astonishing record of eight wins.Fabre still has two live runners – Sosie and Cualificar – in the race on Sunday, while the British challenge is expected to run to no more than three horses, with Kalpana (Andrew Balding), Giavellotto (Marco Botti) and Estrange (David O’Meara) still among the entries.“Aventure’s win in the Prix Vermeille [in early September] was a real relief,” Ferland said on Monday. “We had really been waiting for that victory. Before that, she had raced four times at this level … [and] she was only beaten by horses of the calibre of Bluestocking, the Arc winner, or Calandagan [the 2025 King George winner at Ascot]. It was a major step in her career, though we naturally have more goals ahead.“Aventure performs well on soft ground as well as on heavier going. It might rain a little before the race, but I’m not obsessively checking the weather – it’s something we simply can’t control. Nights are cool and humid now, so the track won’t dry as quickly as it does in summer.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowAyr2.00 Penelope’s Sister 2.30 Jeddaal 3.00 Cisco Disco 3.30 Tactical Plan 4.00 Lima Sierra 4.30 Dandy Magic 5.05 MakaiahSedgefield2.07 Roadshow 2.37 Ammes 3.07 Moonshine Man 3.37 Zamond 4.07 Harel Du Marais 4.37 SiouxfonicBath2.22 Blue Hero 2.52 Jimmy Mark 3.22 Fact Or Fable 3.52 King Of Speed 4.22 Blue Courvoisier 4.52 Cressida Wildes 5.25 Geeman 5.55 On EdgeNewcastle5.00 Hashtagnotions 5.30 Saratoga Gold 6.00 Hello Goodbye (nb) 6.30 Golden Conqueror 7.00 Fanjove 7.30 Second Fiddle (nap) 8.00 Penelope Valentine 8.30 A Lady ForeverWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There were just two British-trained runners in the 16-strong field last year, when Ralph Beckett’s Bluestocking came home in front.

They were available for the first set of Prem games last weekend, but could not take part in the two rounds of Prem Cup matches before that.Women’s Rugby World Cup writer awards: best player, best match – our verdictsRead moreAs a result, McCall believes that the England No 8 Tom Willis as well as the Scotland fly-half Fergus Burke – regulations apply to all internationals whose summer tours ended in mid-July – were not sufficiently prepared for the start of the club season, claiming they began the campaign cold. McCall pointed to how some clubs, such as Bath, arranged pre-season friendlies and fielded largely youth sides in the Prem Cup, but said it should not require loopholes to ensure players are battle-hardened.In the case of the British & Irish Lions, whose third Test against Australia was on 2 August, they are not available until the third round of the Prem season. Clubs can apply for dispensation, however, and Owen Farrell was allowed to start the season with Saracens having missed large spells with Racing 92 because of injury. It is understood he would have also been allowed to play in the Prem Cup.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje exceeded the 30-match limit for players last season.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesThe 10-week stand-down period was agreed in March and is designed to ensure sufficient rest periods after a campaign. Numerous players – including the England and Lions captain, Maro Itoje, and his Saracens teammate Ben Earl – exceeded the 30-match limit.“The RFU and Premiership Rugby dictate that you have to serve a 10-week period before your next game,” McCall said afterhis side’s 39-17 victory against Newcastlelast Friday. “For me, people therefore come into Premiership Rugby unprepared for the demands of the game.“Owen came off with some tightness. Ferg [Burke] was tight, but we couldn’t get him off. We need to look at that because if they had been able to play 20 or 30 minutes last weekend, you get ready for what a real match is like.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a different world: the teams flew economy, no side had professional contracts and there was no team dietitian to raise an eyebrow at Edwards’s condiment of choice.The 2025 World Cup, which begins on Tuesday in Guwahati and concludes with the final on 2 November, might as well be taking place on a different planet. The dizzying changes in women’s cricket over the past 12 years are perhaps best summed up by the growth in tournament prize money. In 2013, it totalled $200,000; this time, it amounts to $13.88m. The eagle-eyed will spot this is more than the $10m total prize pot for the most recent 50-over men’s World Cup – a big statement by the InternationalCricketCouncil (ICC) as to the value of the women’s game.‘Cricket gave me everything’: South African sports star brings township children into the gameRead moreCricket World Cups in India are always a big event. This one, coming in the wake of the 2023 launch of the successful India Women’s Premier League, should be an opportunity to demonstrate just how far we have come since Edwards’s last foray. Note the word “should”. The powers that be appear to be doing their best to squander that opportunity.In August, the ICC announced awholesale rejig to the schedulefor security reasons, including moving one semi-final and (possibly) the final from Bengaluru to Navi Mumbai. All of Pakistan’s games (including the semi-final and final, should they qualify) are taking place in Sri Lanka because ofthe deteriorating India-Pakistan political situation.When did tickets go on sale for this showstopper event? Less than a month ago. Bizarrely, more seems to be being done to promote next year’s T20 World Cup in England and Wales than to shout about the 50-over one starting this week.In all the chaos for any travelling fans, the players are battling with a five-city round-robin schedule that leaves little time for rest and recovery. Of the eight teams, Pakistan (who have never reached the knockout stages of a World Cup) have a significant advantage, given they will be based in Colombo for the duration.Australia,the reigning champions, are the next best off, with only three internal flights and 5,194km to contend with in the group stages. At the other end of the spectrum, New Zealand will rack up almost 9,000km of travel as the team crisscross between venues in Mumbai, Guwahati, Indore, Visakhapatnam and Colombo. England have to manage 7,000km: Edwards is going to need a lot of ketchup.View image in fullscreenIndia’s captain Harmanpreet Kaur, Australia’s captain Alyssa Healy, England’s captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and New Zealand’s captain Sophie Devine at the World Cup Captains’ Day in Bengaluru with the remaining captains event taking place in Colombo.Photograph: Idrees Mohammed/AFP/Getty ImagesEngland’s campaign starts on Friday against South Africa in Guwahati. Even allowing for the fact this is the first World Cup for the new coach-captaincy duo of Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt, reaching the semi-finals must surely be a minimum expectation.The latest blow to public confidence in England came when the 33-year-old seamer and popular podcaster Kate Cross has lost her England contract, as the head coach chooses to focus on the next-gen of Em Arlott and Lauren Filer. Whether it was the right call got lost in the outpouring of sympathy towards Cross and showed clearly that this is a team who still need towin back hearts and mindsafter the Ashes hammering in January and a shaky 2-1 defeat against India in the one-day international series in July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A careless defeat could turn their subsequent fixtures against the big guns of India and Australia into must-wins.Those two teams were last seen facing-off in a record-aggregate ODI in Delhi when Australia scored 412 and India were within touching distance of chasing it down, finishing on 369. On the same day, England limped to a victory in their unofficial warm-up against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi, reaching 287 only by virtue of being able to field eight batters.As ever, England’s hopes will rest heavily on Sciver-Brunt. The signs are good: she hit an unbeaten century in Thursday’s warm-up against India and after being unable to bowl for months and also sent down four overs. But Australia are buoyed up by Alyssa Healy’s return from injury, and the world No 1 batter, India’s Smriti Mandhana, is in the form of her career, having just scored back-to‑back hundreds against Australia.It is hard to predict anything other than an India v Australia final come 2 November. As for the prospect of an India win, to secure a maiden world title on home soil?

Their bill does not have these – they never talked to us.”But there was little sign that Republicans had shifted from their demands that Senate Democrats vote for their bill that would keep the government open through 21 November, so that long-term funding talks may continue. The GOPpassed that billthrough the House on a near party-line vote earlier this month, but it needs at least some Democratic support to advance in the Senate.“This is purely and simply hostage-taking on behalf of theDemocrats,” said Senate majority leader John Thune.Referring to the Republican funding proposal, Thune said: “We could pick it up and pass it tonight, and pass it tomorrow before the government shuts down.”Vance sought to pin the blame for any shutdown on the Democrats, saying: “I think we’re headed into a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing. I hope they change their mind, but we’re gonna see.”Trump has not yet commented publicly on the meeting, which was not opened to reporters. In an interview earlier in the day with CBS News, the president said “I just don’t know how we are going to solve this issue” and alleged the Democrats “are not interested in waste, fraud and abuse”.The Democratic stand on healthcare comes as the party seeks to regain its footing with voters ahead of next year’s midterm elections, in which they are viewed as having a shot at regaining control of the House and winnowing the GOP’s majority in the Senate.The party has refused to support the GOP funding proposal unless it includes an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans, which expire at the end of the year. They also want the undoing of cuts to Medicaid – the program providing healthcare to poor and disabled Americans – and public media, whichRepublicansapproved earlier in the year.Schumer signaled that the Democrats may be willing to compromise. Outside the White House, he said Trump was “the decision-maker, and if he will accept some of the things we ask, which we think the American people are for, on healthcare and on rescissions, he can avoid a shutdown, but there are still large differences between us”.If Congress does not act, a shutdown will begin Wednesday at midnight, and would see workers furloughed and federal agencies close their doors. Last week, the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo saying it would exploit a shutdown to carry out more mass firings as part of its crusade to slash government bureaucracy.Polling from Morning Consult released on Monday found that 45% of voters would blame congressional Republicans for a shutdown, while 32% would blame Democrats.In March, House Democrats voted against a Republican bill to extend government funding, only to see Schumer encourage his colleagues to advance the measure through the Senate, arguing a shutdown at that time would be “devastating”. The episode amplified disillusionment with the minority leader among the Democratic base.On Monday afternoon, reports circulated that Schumer had discussed with Democratic lawmakers the possibility of voting for a bill that would keep the government open for about a week. At a press conference that evening, Schumer insisted he was not going to change his demands.“We have to get it done,” he said. “The way to do this is the president, who is really listening to us, tells the Republicans to do it.”Explore more on these topicsUS CongressUS politicsUS healthcareDonald TrumpDemocratsRepublicansUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

The concentrated bloodletting, spread out across four states, took the lives of nine people, including the suspect in Sunday’s shooting at Grand Blanc’s Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church, as well as injuring at least 33.The weekend’s spate brings the archive’stallyof mass shootings – defined as events with at least four victims injured or killed, not counting the shooter – to 324 this year alone, as of Monday morning. That is a rate of more than one a day.The weekend’s carnage began in the early hours of Saturday morning when multiple shots were fired in separate incidents in Alexandria, Louisiana, and in Raleigh, North Carolina. At least four people were injured onHighway 71 Southin Alexandria.At about the same time, 4am local time, four people were shot and injured onMillbrook Road in Raleigh. Three of the hurt individuals were found at the scene of the gunfire, and a fourth presented later at hospital.Saturday’s third mass shooting broke out at about 9.30pm when a gunman armed with a semi-automatic, short-barreled rifle opened fire from a boat on a waterfront bar inSouthport, North Carolina. The shooting left three people dead and eight injured.View image in fullscreenPolice at the scene after the mass shooting in Southport, North Carolina.Photograph: APLocal news reporters said the target had been the American Fish Company. The suspect fled by boat but was arrested by the US Coast Guard and has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and other felonies.Then, just before midnight on Saturday, a 34-year-old gunman opened fire atKickapoo Lucky Eagle Casinoalong the border with Mexico in Texas. The gambling spot was packed at the time with customers at a raffle event.One person was pronounced dead at the casino and a second died on the way to hospital. One of those killed was a retired US Customs and Border Protection officer, the mayor of Eagle Pass said on social media.The suspected shooter has been charged with two counts of murder carrying the possibility of the death penalty.The intense burst of mass shootings underlines America’s crisis of gun violence fueled by the country’s unique relationship with firearms. There are almost400m gunsin circulation in the US – far more than in any other wealthy country.Mass shootings are just the thin end of a very thick wedge. Though they are among the most heavily reported and terror-inducing cases, the scourge of gun deaths extends far wider than that.In 2023, the last year for which official figures are given, nearly 47,000 people died by the gun in the US, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It was the third-highest year on record, after a Covid pandemic-induced spike through the previous two years.The weekend’s devastating run of mass shootings carried into Sunday. At about 2.22am, shots rang out when a fight appeared to break out onBourbon Street, the famous tourist destination in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Four people were struck, including a woman who died at the scene, police said.New Orleans police superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said the woman who died was a 33-year-old bystander celebrating her birthday from Chicago. Among the injured victims was the woman’s sibling.Kirkpatrick pointed to the laxity of Louisiana’s gun laws as a factor in the disaster. The state requires no permit to openly carry a firearm.“We recognize the legality of being able to carry a gun, but when you mix it with people who have been drinking, then we have a high-risk situation,’” she said. “Please, leave your guns at home.”The last of the six mass shootings was the catastrophein Michigan, where the attacker rammed open the front door of the church using a silver pickup truck bearing two American flags. He then opened fire on congregants as they were in worship, killing four people, before setting the building on fire with gasoline.The suspect was minutes later shot and killed by police.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS gun controlUS crimeMichiganLouisianaTexasNew OrleansnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “We didn’t want it, it’s sometimes strange, a war of new type, but it’s still a war.”Ukraine has been subjected tonightly barrages of drone and missile attacksfrom Russia since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion more than three years ago. It is able with a mixture of air defence systems, jet patrols, jamming and other techniques to down more than 90% of the incoming drones.Unidentified drones have disrupted Danish airspace on at least three occasions in the past week, forcing the closure of Copenhagen airport on Monday and two smaller airports on Wednesday. On Friday they were observed over a military airbase at Karup.None of the drones have been shot down and authorities in the country have been unable to say definitively who was responsible, though on Monday the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, pointed the finger at Russia.“The authorities cannot conclude who is behind the hybrid attacks. But we can state that there is primarily one country that poses a threat to Europe’s security – and that is Russia,” she said on social media.Danish forces have so far failed to shoot down any of the drones, which would allow an examination of the wreckage. Zelenskyy indicated that there was growing evidence they were being launched from tankers in the Baltic, which would leaveDenmarkand other nearby countries little time to respond.“If tankers used by Russia are serving as drone platforms, then such tankers should not be free to operate in the Baltic. This is de facto Russia’s military activity against European countries, so Europe has the right to close straits and sea routes to protect itself,” the Ukrainian leader told the conference in Warsaw.The UK, France, Germany and Sweden said on Monday they would help Denmark increase its security during two European summits in Copenhagen this week. The capital is due to host EU leaders on Wednesday and the wider 47-member European Political Community on Thursday.Britain has also sent a counter drone system to Denmark, defence secretary John Healey said at a fringe event the UK Labour party conference.Germany said it would send 40 soldiers to Denmark to help detect, identify and counter drones, while France will deploy a military helicopter plus another 35 troops. Sweden said it would sent a counter drone system plus extra radars, as well as additional police to enhance security on the ground.Romania’s defence minister, Ionut Moșteanu, told the meeting in Warsaw that new drone fragments were found on Monday near Tulcea, a city just over four miles from the Ukrainian border. A fortnight ago,Romaniasaid a Shahed attack drone had crossed into its airspace for 50 minutes, before flying back into Ukraine.A few days earlier, about 20 unarmed Russian Geran decoy dronescrossed into Polandforcing the closure of four airports. Three or four drones were shot down after Polish and Dutch jets were scrambled to respond to the situation, a relatively low proportion compared with what Ukraine achieves, although there were no casualties.On Saturday night and Sunday morning Ukraine suffered a 12-hour bombardment from Russia. It shot down or otherwise neutralised 566 out of 593 Russian attack or decoy drones, according to figures provided by the country’s air force.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaPolandDrones (non-military)RomaniaDenmarkShareReuse this content"

Such beliefs are legally protected, and I wouldn’t want to see any of them threatened with loss of work, or violence, or death, because of them.”She adds: “However, Emma and Dan [Radcliffe] in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right – nay, obligation – to critique me and my views in public.”Watson, along with Harry Potter co-stars Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, has previously taken issue with the author’s gender critical beliefs. She responded to Rowling’s essay about the need for single-sex spaces due to the threat of violence against women by tweeting in 2020: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.” And Watsonpointedly said “I’m here for all of the witches”in a speech at the 2022 Bafta film awards.In her post, Rowling says she has “repeatedly declined invitations” to comment on Watson’s views, as she “didn’t want her to be hounded as the result of anything I said”, and describes a note she was given from Watson, following her 2022 Baftas remarks. “This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family’s safety. Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”Rowling added: “Like other people who’ve never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she’s ignorant of how ignorant she is … I wasn’t a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous. I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women’s rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.”Rowling hadearlier indicatedthat she was unprepared to forgive Watson and Radcliffe for having “cosied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights”.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmma WatsonJK RowlingHarry Potter (Film)Harry Potter (Books)TransgenderScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is set to announce a target of creating 400,000 new jobs in clean energy, doubling jobs in the sector by 2030. It will include a number of priority jobs from engineers and researchers to welders, electricians and construction workers.In his speech at Labour conference on Wednesday, Miliband will also promise to accelerate unionisation of the green energy sector – amid a backlash among trade unions on the drive to net zero which they have said comes at a cost of highly paid unionised jobs in oil and gas.Miliband said that the fight against Reform meant showing how net zero would benefit ordinary working people. But he added that Labour MPs should focus on fighting for their own values and beliefs, rather than reacting to the whims of Nigel Farage.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband, Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer take a boat trip on the River Tees last year.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty“Reform is now part of a powerful network across the world who want to take away rights for workers, who want to reverse clean energy,” he said. “Elon Musk, he is a poster child in a bad way for this movement, and we have to take that on.“The consensus hasn’t broken down because the British people have changed, the consensus has broken down, because the Tories and Reform have thought, ‘Let’s import the culture war from the US.’”Miliband said Reform’s pledge to end all net zero investments were attacks on “workers in Hull, people at cable factories in Scotland, at the people doingNet Zero Teesside, and it’s a war on future generations.”He said Labour would only beat Reform by offering its own more compelling story of why working people’s lives felt so difficult. “They want to say that the problems of the country can be put down to migration, diversity, net zero,” he said.“The truth is the reason why people’s living standards are stuck, why growth has been so low, and public services are on their knees, is … trickle-down economics from the 80s, which left us with huge inequality and austerity in the 20s.”The energy secretary has come in for fierce criticism from some unions, including GMB and Unite, over the risk to the jobs forworkers particularly in the North Sea.The government is set to require offshore wind developers to pay into a skills fund to support oil and gas workers, apprentices or school leavers to move into offshore wind.On Wednesday he will pledge to create a “fair worker charter”, which will mean that companies which receive public funding will have to guarantee fair pay, flexible working and access to unionisation.View image in fullscreenMiliband will say Reform’s pledge to end net zero investments was a ‘war on future generations’.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThe final rules could include enhanced pay, bonuses and sick leave, flexible working and contracts, as well as new access for unions, new rights for offshore workers and workers on the boards of publicly owned bodies such as Great BritishEnergy.Miliband said the green industry was playing catch-up over workers’ rights. “The renewables industry came of age under the Tories when unions were a dirty word,” he said.“I’m sending a very clear message in my speech on Wednesday, which is we’re putting an end to this. We want to support companies, we want to work with business, but trade unions are an essential partner in building this new economy.”The energy secretary said the government was “doing everything we can to bear down on bills” but admitted that the need for investment in creaking network infrastructure and the high price of gas was making the challenge extremely difficult.He is also facing mounting calls for a delay to the 2030 target for decarbonising the grid, with warnings from the state-owned National Energy System Operator (NESO) that the target is extremely difficult. He said the target had been “unbelievably important in galvanising the industry … We wouldn’t have this clean energy jobs opportunity if it wasn’t for 2030.”Miliband said he acknowledged that Labour MPs were feeling the heat from the constituents – many also from parties on the left such as the Greens as well as Reform. But he said he had learned from his own experience as Labour leader that the argument had to be made for core values and beliefs, rather than as a kneejerk response.“I lost the election in 2015. I decided to stay in politics. The reason I decided to stay is because I thought there were big things to fight for,” he said. “There’s no bigger thing to fight for than changing our economy. After 30 years of neoliberalism and changing our economy and the Green New Deal climate is an essential part of that.“I don’t care so much what the Greens say or what Reform says. I care about what we say. We should use the power of government to do what we believe.

Coal, the most polluting and costly fossil fuel, has been on a rapid decline over the past 30 years, with the US halving its production between 2008 and 2023,accordingto the Energy Information Administration (EIA).“This is an industry that matters to our country,” interior secretary Doug Burgum said in alivestreamed press conferenceon Monday morning, alongside representatives from the other two departments. “It matters to the world, and it’s going to continue to matter for a long time.”US is violating human rights laws by backing fossil fuels, say young activists in new petitionRead moreCoal plants provided about 15% of US electricity in 2024 – a steep fall from 50% in 2000 – the EIA found, with the growth of gas and green power displacing its use. Last year, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal in the US for the first time in history, according to the InternationalEnergyAgency, which predicts that could happen at the global level by the end of 2026.Despite its dwindling role, Trump has made the reviving the coal sector a priority of his second term amid increasing energy demand due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence data centers.“The Trump administration is hell-bent on supporting the oldest, dirtiest energy source. It’s handing our hard-earned tax dollars over to the owners of coal plants that cost more to run than new, clean energy,” said Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the national environmental non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council. “This is a colossal waste of our money at a time when the federal government should be spurring along the new energy sources that can power the AI boom and help bring down electricity bills for struggling families.”The administration’s new $625m investment includes $350m to “modernize” coal plants, $175m for coal projects it claims will provide affordable and reliable energy to rural communities, and $50m to upgrade wastewater management systems to extend the lifespan of coal plants.The efforts follow previous coal-focused initiatives from the Trump administration, which has greenlit mining leases while fast-tracking mining permits. It has alsoprolonged the life of some coal plants, exemptedsome coal plantsfrom EPA rules, andfalsely claimedthat emissions from those plants are “not significant”.The moves have sparked outrage from environmental advocates whonote thatcoal pollution has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the past two decades. Onestudy estimatedthat emissions from coal costs Americans $13-$26bn a year in additional ER visits, strokes and cardiac events, and a greater prevalence and severity of childhood asthma events.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCoalFossil fuelsEnergyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The government said it suspected charcoal production next to the park, which is home to 114 mammal species including the critically endangered black rhino, was to blame.On Saturday, the government said 49 soldiers were being deployed to fight the fires and a further 500 on Sunday. Itsaidmore than 775,000 hectares inside the park, about a third of its area, had been burned and another 171,000 outside it.“All fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues,” the prime minister, Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare,postedon his Facebook page on Monday morning, listing 10 separate blazes in the region.View image in fullscreenElephants drink at a waterhole in Etosha national park in Namibia on 23 September.Photograph: Werner Pillich/APHowever, Sean Naude, a businessman who leads Namibian Marshall Rangers, a group of rescue service volunteers, said there were at least four “active fires”. He said: “Fires in the park are pretty much contained, but not extinguished and the others running from the park are still out of control. However there is not much in the park left to burn.”He criticised the government for not coordinating with citizens and private organisations sooner. “Why did they take so long to accept our help? [It took them] five days… [and] only on the fourth day was the army deployed.”Namibia wildfires mapFrank Stein, who runs Bay Air Aviation, a medical air ambulance company, flew reconnaissance flights at the weekend to help farmers battling to stop the fires spreading further south of the national park on to their land. He said: “I read in the news that the Namibian Defence Force is fighting the fires and this might very well be, but I didn’t see them on the ground.“All I saw was a handful of farmers, maybe 50 people in total, different groups, trying to fight the fires with, I wouldn’t even call it limited resources.”View image in fullscreenThe fire in the Etosha national park has killed nine antelopes and spread further into communal land in the Oshana and Omusati regions, according to the environment, forestry and tourism ministry.Photograph: Ministry of environment, forestry and tourismView image in fullscreenThe wildfire on Sunday.Photograph: Namstrong/AFP/Getty ImagesStein said the government was now asking his company and others to submit proposals to help them fight the fires, adding: “All of a sudden there’s an emergency and … then everybody’s happy to pay, but by that time it’s too late. The economy of scale option has passed you.”Earlier on Monday, Namibia’s prime ministerpostedon Facebook: “We appreciate those in the private sector that are assisting in curtailing the fire … Let’s work together: government and private sector. Let’s discourage those engaging in helpless blame game [sic]. Government has deployed resources to ensure the fire is contained.”The government said that an elephant death had been reported but not confirmed, nine antelopes had been killed by the fire and one pangolin rescued.The park’s main attraction for tourists is the ancient Etosha salt pan.

They said theUN report found genocide was happeningand that this required meaningful action to end the risk of British complicity.One union source said that while there had been some “back and forth” about its proposed motion, there was no particular anger and most unions were onboard with the agreed wording.A Labour source said: “It was a civilised, totally collegiate discussion which included some respectful disagreement.”It comes after Labour sought to rule out motions onPalestinebeing debated at the conference, which triggered accusations that the party had tried to stifle debate. About 30 motions about Palestine from local parties had been struck off earlier this month.Delegates were told the union-backed motion passed because of the sheer weight of its affiliated backing, given 18 constituency Labour parties and affiliates including the TSSA union supported it. The leadership motion failed as a result.Labour sources said the show of hands indicated the majority of delegates had actually voted in favour of the leadership motion. Some delegates had said they would not be able to back the union motion because it did not acknowledge the actions of Hamas in the conflict.Activists believe the vote will encourage the government to acknowledge and accept findings of the UN commission of inquiry, which had found “genocide is occurring inGazaand is continuing to occur”, and apply further sanctions to put pressure on the Israeli government to respect international law.Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said: “This is a huge defeat for the government, with the Labour party finally accepting that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.“If the government tries to ignore this momentous vote, it would not only be in denial of the facts, against public opinion, increasingly globally isolated, but also at war with its own party.”Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary, had asked all members to vote for the union-backed motion. She told the conference: “This is genocide. But if we wait for this to be confirmed by a court, it will be too late, because it’s already happening as we sit here.”The debate erupted into fury as seven delegates not in favour of the motion were selected to speak, prompting activists to accuse Labour of silencing its members.I lead a top Israeli human rights group. Our country is committing genocide | Yuli NovakRead moreThe union-backed motion also urged the government to “ensure individuals and corporations in the UK are not involved in aiding and assisting the genocide”.It comes as ministers are looking at a fresh assessment prepared by officials as to whether there is a “serious risk” that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.Ministers have asked MPs to not only report on the assessment’s findings but to give an explanation. If it is found that there is “a serious risk of a genocide”, the UK faces obligations as asignatory to the genocide conventionto act to protect the Palestinian people.The assessment, taking in evidence until June, is at least four weeks behind the schedule ministers had set to make evaluations of whether Israel’s conduct means there is a serious risk of genocide.The findings, once disclosed, are likely to prove controversial since it will either enrage the Israeli government or cause disbelief in large sections of the Labour party membership.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has accused Israel of committing genocide, and the charge is nowcommonplace among leaders in the global south. UK ministers have described what is happening inside Gaza as grotesque but have not said there is even a serious risk of a genocide.Ministers point out there is a high evidential bar since a genocide requires proof of intent to destroy the Palestinian population in whole or in part.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking to the UN general assembly on Friday, said Israel was not driving Palestinians out of Gaza, and could not therefore be accused of a genocide.0:51Dozens walk out during Benjamin Netanyahu's United Nations speech – videoMore than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military since Hamas invaded Israel in October 2023, according to the ministry of health.The government is required by law to make an assessment of the risk of genocide, owing to its obligations as a signatory to the genocide convention.Speaking to the business select committee a fortnight ago, Lord Falconer said the government was required to make a series of risk assessments, including one concerning the risk of genocide.Given the assessments are undertaken at least once every two months, and the latest report includes evidence only until the end of June, the report should have been completed by the end of August.Explore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025IsraelLabourMiddle East and north AfricaGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

A judge ordered that Scottish schools must provide single-sex toilets for pupils.For WomenScotland, which brought the supreme court case, supported the parents in the Borders case.The guidance identified the risk of “outing” a young person because of the changed guidance. “This may mean that it is necessary that practical arrangements such as enabling young people to use facilities outwith usual breaktimes, or for particular facilities to be available aligned to the young person’s activities within school, to reduce visibility of them moving across and within the school building to access toilet or changing room facilities,” it said.Marion Calder, of For Women Scotland, welcomed the update. “We are glad to see recognition that toilet provision is made on the basis of sex,” she said.For Women Scotland had been pursuing further legal action against the Scottish government for its failure to update its schools and prisons guidance following April’s judgment.Calder added: “However, we will take some time to look at the updates, especially with those relating to sports and residential trips, to be sure the Scottish government has fully accepted the implications of the supreme court judgment. We will discuss with our legal team the implications of this update on our current legal action.”A group of parents of trans people based around Edinburgh expressed concern about the new guidance, in particular that gender-neutral facilities were considered an “afterthought or stopgap”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s why most trans kids limit their fluids and don’t use facilities in schools, with all the health consequences and stress that brings.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandSchoolsTransgenderChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Fares also showed possible signs of asphyxia.The inquest opening was attended by the children’s father, Alfil Bash.Speaking outside the hearing, he cried as he spoke of his devastation at the loss of his children. Bash described his oldest son as a “genius boy” who loved football, singing and maths.Hundreds of people attended a vigil in memory of the three children.After the incident, Avon and Somerset police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over previous contact with the household. The watchdog said no investigation was required.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as axing staff, Dyson also slashed the annual dividend it pays to the family’s holding company.The payout to Weybourne Holdings, which also houses the Dyson family’s fast-growing investments in agricultural land and farming, declined from £700m to £200m in 2024.However, notes attached to the accounts reveal that Dyson has since topped up the payments with £225m of dividends spread over January and February of the current financial year.Dyson founded the company in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in 1991. While it makes most of its products overseas, it does most of its research, development and design of products in the UK, at the company’s facility in the town.Amidcriticism of his decisionto move the company to Singapore, particularly in the light of hisvocal support for Brexit, Dyson has previously said that the UK will remain a major research and development hub for the company.The 78-year-old entrepreneur, is among the largest landowners in the UK afterinvesting heavily in farming and cutting-edge food production, while two of his children, Jacob and Sam, are on the board of Dyson Holdings.

But many suspect they could be a prelude to a broader military intervention designed to end Maduro’s 12-year rule.Speaking on Monday, vice-president Delcy Rodríguez, who is one of Maduro’s closest allies, called US claims that its strikes were about fighting drug trafficking “a big lie”. She alleged the US president’s campaign was actually about seizing the natural resources of the country with the largest proven oil reserves on earth.“It has only one purpose and objective: the reserves of oil, gas, gold, minerals [and] the biological wealth that Venezuela has – and which they need for this new era in which the US government declares war on the entire planet,” said Rodríguez, attributing US “warmongering” to its secretary of state,Marco Rubio, who she called “the Lord of War”.Rodríguez said that the state of emergency – if activated - would immediately give Maduro special powers to mobilize the armed forces, to seal the country’s borders and to place the military in charge of key infrastructure. “We will never handover our homeland – never!” she vowed, warning that Venezuelans who voiced public support for such an intervention would face consequences. “Those who openly call for an invasion, cannot consider themselves Venezuelan,” Rodríguez said.Until recently many experts were convinced Trump’s pressure campaign against Venezuela was political theatre, designed to please voters back home and possibly spark a military rebellion against Maduro.Top Obama-era Latin American expert warns of ‘disastrous’ US intervention in VenezuelaRead moreBut Trump’s deadly strikes – which legal experts and Latin American leaders have denounced as unlawful extrajudicial killings – have left some thinking further escalation is on the cards.On Friday, NBC Newsreportedthat US military officials were drawing up options to target drug traffickers inside Venezuela, with those discussions primarily focused on drone strikes, possibly “in the next several weeks”.Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for Crisis Group, said: “I would feel fairly comfortable in ruling out an invasion and [US] occupation of Venezuela – boots on the ground, as they tend to say. But apart from that, I think all the options are there.”Gunson still thought a missile or bomb attack on Venezuela’s presidential palace, Miraflores, or the military compound where its leaders live unlikely. “Perhaps more plausible is [the US] blowing up something somewhere in the interior of Venezuela that they can try to convince us is… [connected to drug trafficking].”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS militaryAmericasMarco RubioShareReuse this content"

The president has frequently sought to paint the city as out of control and, as he described in September, like “living in hell”.During the first Trump administration, Portland was the site of majorrightwing gatherings, counterprotests andclashesbetween both groups, and in 2020 it became a hotspot for the racial justice protests that swept the US in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd.In response to the large racial justice protests, the president sent federal agents, including an eliteborder patrol unit, which teargassed crowds and arrested protesters off the streets into unmarked vehicles.Earlier this month, the presidentsuggested he would send troopsto Portland after watching a TV news report that showed footage from a 2020 protest, which was incorrectly said to have taken place over the summer.Trump’s announcement on Saturday that he will send federal forces to Portland follow his administration’s moves of deploying federal troops toLos Angelesafter protests over immigration raids andWashington DCto address crime (although violent crime in the Capitol is at a 30-year low).Trump has also threatened to send troops to other Democratic-run cities including Chicago and Memphis.During aphone call over the weekend, Tina Kotek, Oregon’s governor, urged the president not to deploy troops, telling him that there was no insurrection or threat to national security in the city, she said.Oregon sues to block ‘illegal’ deployment of 200 national guard troops to PortlandRead more“What I said to the president is: ‘I don’t understand what information you have.’ When he says to me that the federal courthouse is under attack, that is absolutely not true,” Kotek said.“Some demonstrations happening at one federal facility, that are being managed on a regular basis by local law enforcement, if that is the only issue he’s bringing up, he has been given bad information,” Kotek said.Trump on Sunday appeared less set on the deployment, telling NBC’s Yamiche Alcindor he had spoken to Kotek. “I spoke to the governor, she was very nice,” Trump said. “But I said: ‘Well wait a minute, am I watching things on television that are different from what’s happening? My people tell me different.’ They are literally attacking and there are fires all over the place . ..it looks like terrible.”Still, a department of defense memo received by state leaders later on Sunday said the administration was federalizing 200Oregonnational guard troops, who will be tasked with protecting Ice officers and federal facilities for up to two months.Oregon leaders argue the deployment would be unlawful, and that the president, Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, have “infringed on Oregon’s sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity”.“Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry,” the lawsuit states.Explore more on these topicsPortlandOregonDonald TrumpWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Stevie reaching into the back seat and bringing out a plastic box full of sweet treats he has lovingly baked is a sign that all is well.The opening credits are yet to roll when we get the reassuring sight of Grace and Stevie biting through frosting. But this isn’t just a moment of calm before all hell breaks loose again on their Belfast beat. At the end of season two, the “will-they-won’t-they” between the two main characters became a “yes they definitely will”, and with some time now having passed – Stevie’s got a beard – the couple are browsing for houses together online.View image in fullscreenThe affair might soon be over? … Siân Brooke as Grace and Martin McCann as Stevie in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionLike Grace and Stevie’s relationship,Blue Lightshas evolved. When it began, it was a hard-edged saga about the struggle to police a city where the Troubles are over. Lingering tensions between communities and resentment towards the police, combined with the poverty and drug problems that blight every modern British town, meant trouble flared every day. Offsetting many tense scenes, where it looked as if one of the cops had walked into a lethal ambush, was a weakness for soapy drama based on stifled longing between colleagues at the station. As viewers have got to know and like these people, the soppier character work has started to push the tough sectarian dynamics aside.“The section’s like a flipping dating shop,” says Stevie on one of the many shared car journeys he and Grace take so we can eavesdrop on their couple chat. “It’s messy.” He might have a point: with fellow “peelers” Tommy (Nathan Braniff) and Aisling (Dearbháile McKinney) also cohabiting, not to mention Shane (Frank Blake) and Annie (Katherine Devlin) still at that tingling maybe stage, the personal might be about to eclipse the political.The comeback episode shows little sign of the uniquely Northern Irish energies that have previously made Blue Lights shine. Instead of the police having to win the trust of hostile communities where old loyalties and grudges outweigh citizens’ commitment to the rule of law, the situation in Belfast could be from any crime drama. Gangsters have invented a delivery app for premium-grade cocaine, and when bobbies on the beat intercept a junior drug runner and his naive girlfriend on courier duty, the regular police have once again stood on the toes of the organised crime division.View image in fullscreenA tad worn … Andi Osho as Sandra, Dearbháile McKinney as Aisling and Katherine Devlin as Annie in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PAA veteran of cracking Northern Ireland’s toughest gangs, “Colly” Collins (Michael Smiley), arrives at the station to disrupt the hierarchy and rekindle some tricky personal relationships. Meanwhile, at the posh end of town, the opening of a private members’ club ends prematurely when a guest uses the new coke app then overdoses in the bar – but the club’s owner, Dana Morgan (Cathy Tyson), doesn’t seem quite as concerned for his welfare as she should be.‘The stab vests make us look like Ninja Turtles’: on the beat in Belfast with the Blue Lights castRead moreIt’s solid urban-decay fare, and the part of the story involving the kids in care swept up into serious crime lets the show put pressure on the weakness in its central relationship: while Stevie is a veteran officer who has learned to live with the police’s limitations when it comes to helping desperate people, Grace is a former social worker who keeps bringing her compassionate instinct to her new job. But as the season goes on, the question of whether their relationship can survive working together is a dramatic uncertainty that’s simply less fun than the old days, when we wondered when they’d finally take down each other’s particulars.The bad guys are slightly less thrilling, too. That this scary big boss is actually the employee of that other, scarier boss, while this other boss is someone who doesn’t appear to be involved in organised crime at all, is a narrative shape that’s a tad worn, as is the revelation that people involved in one sort of wrongdoing turn out to be perpetrators or victims of different, darker crimes.When Grace says to Stevie, “We should check it out,” referring to a situation that we know is potentially too dangerous for two cops full of cake to tackle, the pure dread Blue Lights used to instil in us isn’t there any more. We still love it, but in a way that’s safe and familiar. The affair might soon be over.Blue Lights aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsBlue LightsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in a spectacular production, its first performers are bringing it back. But would Bausch have approved?Chris WiegandMon 29 Sep 2025 11.43 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 13.24 EDTShareTheatres are haunted houses: on any stage, the ghosts of past performances can rise. At the opera house in Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, you can imagine the decades-ago premieres of Pina Bausch’s first potenttanztheatershows, which left audiences either enraptured or slamming the exit door. An original cast member may still appear in revivals today, giving a tantalising link to the history of a company now packed with dancers who joined after the German choreographer’sdeath in 2009. But tonight a full house in Wuppertal is watching Bausch’s classic Kontakthof delivered by a cast of nine, all of whom created it here almost 50 years ago. And they are accompanied by ethereal archive footage of the production from 1978, blown up to a dizzying scale.It is uncanny and moving to see them enter, in monochrome outfits, their steps mirroring those from the black and white film projected on an enormous gauze screen. It engulfs the performers so the images of their younger selves, at a height of several metres, loom over them.Kontakthofwas first staged with 20 dancers and those who have not returned for this iteration – some of them deceased – remain frozen in time in film, accompanying tonight’s cast who have more than doubled in age since.I walked in like Joan Crawford wearing red lipstick and fur coat. Pina gave me a smileA scene with two performers in 1978 is recreated with just one, the missing member’s absence keenly felt. At times, the older dancers seem to partner their young selves, bringing shades ofStephen Sondheim’s Follies. How does it feel to live in these bodies, half a century on? A sequence combining orgasmic cries from then and now gives one answer. Later, in a round of confessions, the cast assess their personalities. Meryl Tankard tells the audience she wishes she’d had children, she misses her mum and she is shy. Plus: “Resourceful, resilient, reliable.”View image in fullscreen‘I was quite shocked’ … another recreated moment.Photograph: Ursula KaufmannShe’s not wrong. Kontakthof: Echoes of 78, conceived and directed by Tankard, is a spectacular feat, not just in technical execution but in how the concept deepens the themes of the original. When we meet at the opera house, Tankard – born in Australia in 1955 – lists her initial worries. “The whole fear at the beginning was Pina and how dare I touch her work. But I just felt I was going right back and actually finding the essence of it.” Her voice wavers. “Ithinkshe would like it.”Bausch herself had a notion that the original cast might return to the piece in later age. More than most of her works, Kontakthof has been expressly staged with performers’ ages in mind: in 2000 it was put on with a new cast ofover-65s; eight years later it was done with teenagers (documented in the filmDancing Dreams).View image in fullscreen‘You should be grateful that you have been asked to give’ … Pina Bausch.Photograph: Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/AlamyIts themes are eternal: cruelty, control, loneliness, seduction and the quest for pleasure, accompanied by airy reverie and surreal humour. “For me, she choreographed vulnerability,” says Tankard, remembering how Bausch would give dancers cues to open up and create autobiographical material. “She hardly ever directed how you did it. If she liked it, that’s exactly what she wanted you to replicate. She always said: ‘A lot of people can’t repeat that spontaneity.’ I realised how important this vulnerability was. It was not so much the action but the fear.”Tankard joined Bausch’s company in 1978. “It was my third year in the Australian Ballet.Anne Woolliamshad taken over and she said to me: ‘You should choreograph.’ I used to design huge cakes, knit complicated jumpers, anything creative … I did feel a bit frustrated. I guess she saw that.” Tankard created a piece, Birds Behind Bars, which won prize money that she spent on travel to Europe. Acquaintances kept recommending that she watch Bausch’s work and she was handed the number of a fellow Australian in the company, Josephine Ann Endicott, who took her to a rehearsal in Wuppertal.“There were all these intellectual German actors sitting there,” she says, adopting a serious pose. “I walk in wearing a South American skunk coat like Joan Crawford, and red lipstick. Pina gave me this little smile, and said I could join the rehearsal.” That day’s improv was to show six ways of being surprised. “I remember my little sequence. She was going: ‘Schneller! Schneller! Schneller!’ … I stayed the whole day, then she said she would audition me. We did a ballet class, three hours, with Rite of Spring movements. At 11.30pm, she says, ‘OK, I’ll take you.’”At 11.30pm, she says, ‘OK, I’ll take you’Extricated from her ballet contract, Tankard returned to Wuppertal. It had been five years since Bausch took over at the opera house, breaking new ground with her dance-theatre. “They were still booing,” says Tankard. “Scheiße, get out of town, you know?” Tankard turned up “with two suitcases full of vintage clothes. I had all these 40s dresses – I used to wear cocktail hats, smoke Sobranies.” Rolf Borzik, Bausch’s partner and designer, saw she loved clothes. “He would say, go to the market, buy some dresses, we’ll put them in the show.” She sees Echoes as a posthumous creative collaboration with Borzik who filmed more than 20 tapes of footage that she edited and who died in 1980.View image in fullscreenHomage … Meryl Tankard.Photograph: Régis LansacTankard, who graduated from the Australian Film and Television School in 2010, pursued the project after a movie she had written stalled in development. Borzik’s footage is kept in the vast archives of the Pina Bausch Foundation, overseen by the choreographer’s son, Salomon Bausch. “We always wanted the archive to be something productive, something living,” he says. “I couldn’t imagine a better way to do this than this project.” Echoes makes a fascinating companion piece to Boris Charmatz’s treatment of another 1978 classic, Café Müller, which he presented six times in a row, interspersed with the cast’s personal memories of Bausch, in aphenomenal new productionat the Avignon festival in 2024. (Charmatz has since left his post as artistic director of the company.)View image in fullscreen‘Overwhelming’ … Taylor Drury in Kontakthof in 2022.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhy did Borzik document Kontakthof in so much detail? “He was curious – taking pictures, filming, drawing, it’s part of who he was,” says Salomon Bausch. “For rehearsal purposes, they used videos a lot.” Those original materials are still essential for revivals. Taylor Drury, who joined the company in 2020, says that after veteran company members have passed on precise insights and instructions (“their body knowledge”), today’s casts look at the original performance videos for inspiration.Watching Echoes was “really trippy” for Drury. “We’d been performing Kontakthof and then to be in the audience in the same theatre with the same set, seeing the original cast members paired with the videos we have referenced as source material … It was overwhelming.” Drury says there is a “plethora of history and knowledge” around Kontakthof. For her generation, the task is “carrying forward the legacy, staying true to it, while also finding ourselves in the work”.View image in fullscreenLess to prove now  … Josephine Ann Endicott and Meryl Tankard with their younger selves.Photograph: Evangelos RodoulisOnce they had settled on the idea for Echoes, “we thought we shouldn’t wait too long,” says Salomon Bausch. “People don’t get younger!” Some cast members were still active in professional dance, such as Endicott who has restaged several pieces, including Kontakthof. Lutz Förster, who temporarily ran the company after Bausch’s death, danced on and off in Kontakthof for almost 20 years. Others spent a much shorter time in the company and moved on from dance. Echoes – which has a series of international tour dates – is a significant commitment for its cast who are mostly in their 70s. Tankard hadn’t danced on stage for years. But rehearsals proved a triumph for muscle memory. The dancers discovered a different attitude to the material – Elisabeth Clarke says it feels lighter as she has less to prove now.Kontakthof has some horrifying sequences, yet started out exploring tenderness. Bausch could take a caress and turn it into aggression, says Tankard. “I was quite shocked by how much physical violence there was in Kontakthof.” At three hours, it was gruelling to perform. “I said to Pina when I left [in 1984], I just can’t give you any more, I’m sorry. Emotionally, physically, everything … She said, ‘You should be grateful that you have been asked to give.’”Back home in Australia: “I couldn’t get an agent. They said, ‘Oh, you’re not an actor, you’re a dancer … you’re too weird, you don’t fit into a box.’” The shyness she mentions in Echoes was another hindrance. “I think that came from the ballet or from being a Catholic, probably. You’re told to be humble. But nowadays if you don’t get out there and sell yourself, forget it.” She reflects on how dancers today hop across the work of many choreographers: “You get so little time to just find the movement from within, or to be involved emotionally and connected.”Tankard realised, upon their reunion, how little she had got to know her co-stars first time round. “We’ve had time to really value each other.” They all had their fears but the show is notable for its camaraderie. Someone told her after seeing Echoes: who’d have thought Kontakthof, with all its battling characters, would now be about friendship? Tankard smiles as she reflects on those haunting projections towering over the cast. “Our younger selves, I think, gave us a bit of confidence.”Kontakthof: Echoes of 78is on tour and at Sadler’s Wells, London, in April.

First off, the film is beautifully shot, from the opening scene, which tracks back from a hallucinatory landscape until we see the source of a strange sound: a riffled deck of cards in a desperado’s hands. And its central conceit – a little girl (Emily Katherine Ford) whose touch is fatal – flowers into an intriguing metaphor for the consequences of the white man’s burden.Except here the girl is, initially, a black woman’s burden. Formerly enslaved Sarah (DeWanda Wise) runs a homestead on the edge of an Arizona town in a plague-stricken time. The already on-edge locals shun her and her daughter, even though she keeps her child’s apparently deadly hands gloved. Increasingly ground down, Sarah enlists mentally shattered doctor Bender (Guy Pearce) – who ethers himself to sleep every night after his own family tragedy – to escort them across the wilderness to see a preacher to exorcise this dark force. A sour rationalist, he scoffs at her scheme – but he’s happy to take her money.Crowley keeps the focus on the old west’s outcast and marginalised – with Sarah and Bender joined by loquacious farmhand Edward (Jack Alcott); Bender calls him a “simpleton”, but we’d now recognise him as autistic. So their trek is less a strident Searchers-style moral crusade than a procession of oddball encounters reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch’s 1995 western Dead Man (the influence is a little too obvious when, like that film’s William Blake, they take up with a literary-named guide).The film is never far from a spasm of extreme violence, though – for which Crowley, who also co-wrote, often assigns white responsibility. Sometimes he insists on this a little too bluntly, but he develops the idea into something richly suggestive as the exact nature of the girl becomes unignorable. Brought into the world thanks to an act of white original sin, she seems to represent some satanic principle at work in the brutality and death all around. Perhaps Bender’s steadfast scepticism, refusing to acknowledge evil, is a form of self-protection from the notion of his own complicity. Pearce hits the notes of defensive self-denial sharply in the climactic scenes, with Bill Pullman’s leering preacher in an enticing moral conflagration that tiptoes into Cormac McCarthy territory.Devil in the Dust is on digital platforms from 3 October and on DVD from 13 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsGuy PearceScience fiction and fantasy filmsPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, director Luke Sparke angles downwards in his intro from a massacre in an office high-rise overlooking a devastated skyline, towards the ground zero of the action: the bottom of a crater where stricken civilian Mark (Jamie Costa) is pinned under a boulder.After freeing himself just before a rockfall that seals him into a tunnel, Mark encounters Kate (Emalia) also scrabbling around in the dark. Displaying a striking level of panic and a nasty leg wound, she insists – at gunpoint – that he take the rear as they look for a way out. Not only does this petty thief’s looking-after-number-one attitude augur an imminent sticky end for her, the chittering they hear in the dark all around suggests the means is close at hand.Sparke shows some camera chops in conducting this crawlspace nightmare in a series of long takes, sometimes pulling back for poignant, Zippo-lit distance from the spelunkers. But the scenario, as written by Tom Evans, gives the film painfully little room for manoeuvre; there’s lots of tedious wrangling over resources such as light and phone signals, and all-too-obvious false dawns for exit possibilities. When Mark and Kate aren’t scrabbling around, they swap contrived character revelations that feel as if they were invented on the spot to pass the time. And there’s little sense of how the critters – chitinous escapers from Starship Troopers – act behaviourally, or how they fit into the bigger apocalyptic picture.One thing you have to admit is that the film is paced nicely for the experience of two people trapped in a tunnel; it’s both somehow agonisingly underwritten and, with the antic camera and incessant score, strangely overblown. At least the lead actors get a good workout: as an evident graduate of theShelley Duvallschool of panicky acting, Emalia displays a full overadrenalised palette, from hyperventilation to stressed-out severity to throat-tightening meltdown.Scurry is on digital platforms from 6 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Partners in life and in art, the couple build much of their practice around their community in Walthamstow, eastLondon. Their previous project involved setting up an artist-run bank, selling their own currency notes and using the proceeds to buy back £1.2m of debt owned by ordinary local people. This latest film charts an even more ambitious undertaking: to equip the houses on their street with solar panels, transforming the neighbourhood into a power station.Much of the film was shot by Edelstyn during lockdown, when the couple’s master plan first took shape. Zoom meetings with energy experts and collaborators are punctuated with mundane everyday worries, like dirty dishes piling up in the sink. For activists, it seems, life and work are never truly separated. The lo-fi, handheld cinematography, through which Powell and Edelstyn often directly address the viewer, lends a moving intimacy to their momentous endeavours. From sleeping on the roof for a fundraising challenge to planting a thousand sunflowers, their approach prioritises collective action as much as visual impact.Powell and Edelstyn do not shy away from showing some of the lower points of their campaign, though perhaps it would have been informative to learn about their various financial hurdles and organisational missteps in more detail. Still, the film is a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when we simply talk to our neighbours, and it is heartwarming to see different people, from diverse backgrounds but bound by shared economic struggles, come together to make green energy a reality. On this beautiful street, no one is a stranger.Power Station is in UK cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLondonSolar powerArtEnergyRenewable energyreviewsShareReuse this content"

After the deaths of two members, reissuing their debut has proven bittersweetMon 29 Sep 2025 06.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 08.07 EDTShareIf you were an American indie rock act in the mid-90s, life could be strange. After the breakthroughs of Nirvana and Green Day the music industry spent several frenzied years trying to refine the formula for rock success. Labels indiscriminately hoovered up guitar bands in the post-grunge glut.But the newfound interest in alternative music also buoyed some unexpected acts. “There were a lot of people looking to independent labels for the next Nirvana,” says Christian Frederickson, violist with the Louisville chamber music act Rachel’s. “While that obviouslywasn’tus, I do think we benefited.”Centred on guitarist/bassist Jason Noble, pianist Rachel Grimes and Frederickson, Rachel’s also sometimes incorporated clarinet, cello, vibraphone, samples and dancers as they crafted graceful, shapeshifting music that could, loosely, be described as post-rock – or a precursor to the neo-classical phenomenon led byNils Frahmand the label Erased Tapes.Despite their vast remove from the feedback-drenched clangour of grunge or punk, their 1995 debut, Handwriting, became an unexpected success. They were embraced by indie fans and demand outstripped supply: the occasion for our talk is a 30th anniversary re-pressing. Nevertheless, classical purists back then were not always so enthusiastic. “There were a lot of people who seemed deeply insulted that we’d put bass and drums with piano and strings and tried to pull it off with a serious face,” Grimes says with a smile.In reality, Rachel’s were far from rabble-rousers – but they were a product of a fertile punk scene – part of a lineage that included Slint, Squirrel Bait, June of 44 and Bonnie “Prince” Billy, AKA Louisville-born musician and actor Will Oldham. “Louisville had a strong cultural identity at least into the 1980s – an identity that had the arts at its core,” says Oldham. He doesn’t qualify where Rachel’s fit in, only that theydid. “I feel like to a great extent we can’t choose the sounds that come out of us and the music folks made here in Louisville always felt like a project of compulsion more than design,” he says. “With this in mind, the idea of genre is a time waste. This is what these people made and it lifted up all of us.”Rachel’s: Water From the Same Source – videoThe band had coalesced slowly. Noble, who later also played in the influential post-rock band Rodan, was at art school in Baltimore when a chance encounter in 1991 set the wheels in motion. “My friends and I were on the same bus as him and his friends,” says Frederickson, then studying at the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University. “They were very clearly art students, and we were very clearly classical music students. We started going to each other’s events – I’d go up to the art institute for poetry readings or art openings, and he’d come down to the Conservatory for concerts. We started talking about this music he was working on and eventually cobbled together a recording session.”Noble dropped out of art school and returned to his native Louisville. He later passed a tape of the session to pianist, composer and fellow Kentuckian Grimes. “I met Jason at a party,” says Grimes, who was living a dual life studying music at the University of Louisville by day and playing indie rock at night. “He came to my composition recital, and the band I was in, Hula Hoop, were playing shows with Rodan. We started hanging out and writing introverted piano music together. It was a very gradual way of becoming part of each other’s musical lives.”View image in fullscreenThe full lineup of Rachel’s: Christian Frederickson, Bob Weston, Edward Grimes, Eve Miller, Rachel Grimes, Jason Noble.Photograph: Harvey WangFrederickson, meanwhile, would visit Louisville in his downtime, helping Noble transcribe, arrange and record new material. The trio formally became Rachel’s in summer 1994, recording Handwriting later that year.They found a home with Quarterstick Records – the “arthouse” sister label to indie powerhouse Touch and Go Records. Feted for releasing records by Slint, Die Kreuzen and the Jesus Lizard, label owner Corey Rusk felt Touch and Go had become pigeonholed, so established Quarterstick to reflect his more eclectic tastes.“Jason and I would have long gab sessions about music we liked,” says Rusk, who had worked with Noble on Rodan’s sole, labyrinthine album, Rusty. “It came to light that we both likedArvo PärtandHenryk GóreckiandGavin Bryars. Jason told me he and some friends had been working on music somewhat along those lines. I told him he had to send me a tape. He did, I loved it, and the rest is history.”Released in 1995, Handwriting was unlike anything produced by America’s indie rock underground. Influenced by Michael Nyman, the album was lyrical, moving and elegantly understated, its sense of completeness belying its patchwork construction and the ad hoc manner in which additional players – from classically trained pals to members of “garage jazz”’ act the Coctails and recording engineer and Shellac bassist Bob Weston – had been recruited.Almost overnight, Rachel’s went from being a recording project to a practical concern. “We had to figure out how to be a band,” says Grimes. “There wasn’t a master plan, but we had youth, energy and intention on our side. We gave it a lot of time and serious attention because it just felt so important and exciting.” Two albums were released the following year: Music for Egon Schiele, which Grimes was commissioned to compose for a theatre and dance group, then, later, the Pablo Neruda-inspired The Sea and the Bells. This flurry of activity was followed by albums Selenography (1999), Systems/Layers (2003) and EPs that included a collaboration with electronic act Matmos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The long-gestating Systems/Layers became the band’s final album. A rewarding collaboration with the Saratoga International Theater Institute, with a stage setting involving nine actors, projections and a live pit orchestra, it left the musicians exhausted and overwhelmed. “We created a piece of art that was just completely unaffordable,” says Grimes. “We never, ever thought practically about the cheapest way to tour.”‘We’d play for a frozen burrito’: post-rockers Tortoise on the changing face of Chicago, Steve Albini and their new-gen fansRead moreRachel’s would receive praise from the likes of Lou Reed and their music appears in films from Will Smith vehicle Hancock to Paolo Sorrentino’s Oscar-winning The Great Beauty. Today, Grimes continues to perform, publish and compose. In 2019 she unveiled a folk opera entitled The Way Forth, exploring the stories and voices of women through Kentucky’s history. The project continues to bear fruit, having led her to the life of the enslaved violinist and bandleader Henry Hart. She is now researching Hart’s family history, and preparing to publish new arrangements of his work. Frederickson, meanwhile, teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while writing music and crafting sound design pieces for theatre.Noble died of cancer in 2012 , and Edward Grimes, Rachel’s brother and the band’s longtime drummer, died in 2017. Reissuing the band’s work has, understandably, been a bittersweet process. “It’s weird and hard but that’s what it is to miss the people you love,” says Grimes. “Being in a band with my brother and my friends was such a fun romp. It’s impossible not to feel grief, love, joy and appreciation that we got to do all of this. It can be hard to work on and I have to put it down sometimes. Yet I know they would be excited about it, and the records still being in print is somehow miraculous.”The 30th anniversary reissue of Handwriting is out now on Touch and Go RecordsExplore more on these topicsMusicClassical musicExperimental musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The radical psychiatrist made clear the influence of unacknowledged baggage, the conscious or unconscious laying of traps for the other speaker, and helped us see more clearly the pitfalls of even our most routine conversations. In an era like ours, where global relations can contain as much psychodrama as private ones, Laing’s Zen-like exchanges have more than just individual pertinence.The contrast between Laing’s absurdist, tragicomic sensibility and Steven Pinker’s crisp reasonableness is obvious. But there is more common ground than we might at first think. Pinker illustrates his arguments with piquant little dialogues, some of them worthy of Laing (“You hang up first”. “No, you hang up first.” “Okay.” “She hung up on me!”); this book is as lively an exposition of cognitive science as you are likely to find.The central theme is simply expressed: all acts of communication occur against a background of intricate, recursive assumptions (I know x; you know that I know x; I know that you know that I know x; you know that I know that you know … ad infinitum). What Pinker calls “common knowledge” is both what makes intelligible exchange possible and what complicates it. Communication is not a neat trading of information packages. It is the product of long histories of assumption and symbol; we need to deploy reason in order to arrive at outcomes that are good for everyone involved, and to resist the seductive but potentially suicidal narratives that promise benefit for ourselves alone.Pinker discusses the famous “prisoner’s dilemma”, in which two criminals being interrogated separately have to decide whether or not to betray each other in order to minimise their sentences. If both refuse to help the police they get a light sentence. If one implicates the other, he or she may go free, while their partner suffers an even worse fate: an enticing possibility. But if each prisoner gambles on that strategy – betraying their friend – then it fails and they’re both jailed for a long time. What this shows is that finding the least unfavourable outcome for all may require parking individual interests.As Pinker says, this is a pattern that applies to a very wide range of choices – and precisely because of this, it can be tempting to use it as a universal grid for choosing. It is a model in which there is always an optimal answer, where the choices can be set out diagrammatically to show plainly what is best for everyone. But this works only if both parties have some sort of knowledge of the other – or, to put it more realistically, perhaps, have some sort of trust that the other will respond in an intelligible way. When parties in a conflict stand on the precipice of destruction, this trust transforms into a dangerous gamble that each knows the other well enough to predict they’ll back down (partly, in an absurdly ironic twist, because that’s what they would do in the other’s place). It is why the so-called “madman” strategy in international relations (when a leader behaves in such an unpredictable way that no one could possibly guess how they would respond in a crisis) is so powerful a tool for intimidating others.All this highlights the centrality of “common knowledge” in making sense of another’s acts and words (Pinker is very good on the role of our ability to read physical indicators of thought and attitude). Common knowledge is at work in a whole range of habits that may seem pretty obscure or arbitrary, but which consolidate the mutual trust intrinsic to social cooperation, from myth and ritual to social convention. And this is also why, to cite Pinker’s neat formulation, “rational argument should be really more like a dance than a war”. It is – or can be – a ritual deployment of allusion, shared expectations and cultural performance in which reasonableness is framed and animated by other factors.Pinker directs his strongest polemic at those who deliberately seek to suppress or limit common knowledge in order to protect what is thought to be a vulnerable or fragile social consensus. He argues that the problem with “the cancelling instinct” is that it muddles fact and value, and, through defending what is “right” via legal or social silencing, reinforces the dangerous inference that claims about what is true are always veiled bids for power. But he is not a free-speech absolutist, and makes a careful case for “quarantined topics” where we might agree that unrestrained communication is disproportionately harmful – as with, for example, the manifestos of mass shooters. He does not quite spell it out, but he seems to be saying that this “quarantining” must itself be a matter of shared cultural discernment rather than inquisitorial processes (whether in the courts or online).Overall, then, a lucid, measured discussion of what we need to understand about our communications with each other. Pinker shares with a good many other secular philosophers at the moment a tone of deeply exasperated rationality – a default conviction that there really are ultimately reasonable positions about which sane people cannot sanely disagree, and a despairing acknowledgment that this seems an increasingly unpopular idea. He struggles a bit to give weight to aspects of our moral lives that aren’t always amenable to reason (he is predictably dismissive about religion, for example), yet he does ultimately take this dimension seriously, conceding the legitimacy of social markers of solidarity, without which the mutual trust he is exploring would not survive.This is not a book for anyone in search of metaphysical analysis of the “linguistic animal” (to use the philosopher Charles Taylor’s term). But it enlightens and provokes; to pick up his own metaphor, it is worth dancing with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It is a rather melancholy tale, in which the sky is always grey and the mood is always despondent, where secrecy and shame are the prevailing emotions, and violence is never far away. As gay men in pre-2018 India, Neville and Pavan exist in an in-between world. There are dating apps and hookups galore, but there is also open hostility and the threat of prosecution. Tempering this bleakness is Rao’s pleasingly wry humour and sharply satirical eye, which he casts over this period of cultural flux. The narrative is split into two sections – Darjeeling in 2014 and Mumbai in 2018 – proceeding in short chapters that alternate between Neville’s and Pavan’s points of view.The story begins as a landslide blocks the routes to and from the Golden Peaks Hotel, a subpar establishment in the hills of Darjeeling where Pavan works and where Neville, along with his haughty mother Audrey and servile family friend Lorna, is a guest. With little else to do, and emboldened by the novel circumstances, the two men strike up a furtive romance. “[Pavan’s] sense of the world being held in suspension had continued to grow. The hotel was cut off. Rations were low. Routines had changed. There seemed to be a fated quality about his encounter with Neville.”Aside from being trapped in a hotel together, though, Neville and Pavan do not seem to have much in common. They come from very different backgrounds. Neville is a workshy college student from a well-heeled Catholic Brahmin family; Pavan is an industrious hospitality worker who has done well to escape his humble beginnings and abusive father. Neville is careless and promiscuous (“darting wherever he could to seek his pleasures”), while Pavan is shy and uptight (“a figure only half in the light”). Differences of race, class, age and sexual experience imbue their relationship with an interesting power dynamic, which over the course of the narrative subtly shifts.The alternating back-and-forth structure leaves the reader feeling almost as disoriented as the characters themselvesInevitably, their hotel idyll comes to an end. Perhaps just as inevitably, it is a violent end. The seeds for a possible act of violence are sown early on, with Pavan discovering an abusive term daubed across his workstation (“the angry shade of red, the unstable lines, its sudden appearance, all unsettled him”). Rao successfully establishes an atmosphere freighted with malevolence, where there is a “sense of ugliness in the air”, and where being your true self could be costly. Walking among a group of young men, “Pavan feared that his deviance gave off some odour, that one of them would detect it and the entire group would turn on him”.Deeply shocked by the incident, the two men separately leave Darjeeling for Mumbai, and resolve to forget all about it, as well as about each other. At this point the narrative shifts gear a little, becoming more diffuse and anecdotal as we follow Neville and Pavan through various trials and tribulations in work and in love. A number of these vignettes are highly enjoyable – Pavan’s excruciating interview for a possible arranged marriage; Neville’s disastrous hookup with an older man – but others are more forgettable. The more affecting hothouse intensity of the first half has been lost, and the connection between the two men made less clear. The plot wanders.In fact, all together Half Light feels somewhat hazy and unfocused. To some extent this is surely intentional, an approximation of the mental states of two confused young men trying to figure out themselves, and their place in the world. But the lack of a strong narrative thread and the alternating back-and-forth structure leave the reader feeling almost as disoriented as the characters themselves.That said, there is much to enjoy and much to admire here. Despite its ambivalent tone and unhappy events, the novel does offer a glimmer of hope for a new world that could come into being and, for Pavan at least, new emotions too. What are they? “He could not be sure – but it felt a little like pride.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A storm cloud threatened,dark as a spaceship. Should it pour,a sister ship down in the waterwould throw up grappling nets to the surface,rain rise to soak me. Behind a sandbank,waves touched the shore, no more than a shimmer.Less rare than its cousin, the antimacassar,a doily’s placed between sweet thing and china.Both survive where vicars arrivefor tea, are given thin cup and saucerinstead of a mug. If your cake’s so richthat it’s leaking syrup, you’ll need a doily.Held up, its paper’s the filigreeof snowflake, or fingers looked through in fear.The shower holds off. My shoe’s a doily.Without it, where would I be on these shellsthat crunch underfoot, like contact lenses,as I walk, a mermaid, on razor-torn feetback to my husband in his human dwelling?Someone is pulling a blue toy trawleralong the horizon to port, so smoothlyit looks realistic. Sea’s partly doily.Surfers ride its lace to their downfall,after all, we’re nothing but froth.Like a carpet salesman, the indolent tideflops a wave over, showing samples: ‘Madam,this one is durable, has a fringe.’ Underits breath the sea sighs, ‘Has it cometo this? Must everything always end in … doily?’It must. Broad afternoon. The rain-cloud bargeshave passed and here’s a cumulonimbus paradeof imperial busts, the Roman rulersin historical order which, I think, would please you.Their vapour curls and noble foreheadsare lit up in lilac because they’re invadingthe west. Next come the philosophers and, last of all,the poets. Pulleys draw them delicately on.Here comes Lucretius, then Ovid, then Horacein lines, saying relentlessly, ‘Doily’, ‘Doily’,till stars take over and do the same.Concluding Gwyneth Lewis’s latest collection,First Rain in Paradise, An Explanation of Doily opens a strange, humorous, mysterious window out of trauma. The combination of the word “doily” and the name of the poem’s dedicatee, the late Polish poet and novelist,Adam Zagajewski(1945-2021), plucks the first enticing chord, with a faint reverberation from Zagajewski’s great poem of exile,To Go to Lvov: “But the cathedral rises, / You remember, so straight, as straight / As Sunday and white napkins and a bucket / Full of raspberries stands on the floor”. The decorative British item, named after a 17th-century London draper, was originally known as a “doily-napkin”.Zagajewski’s question, presumably asked in a real-life communication, is freighted with further questions for Lewis. She defers her answer in the first stanza, not merely setting the scene, but expanding it. The stanza reflects the picture which was the origin of the collection’s title, the second panel of a manuscript illumination by Rudolf von Ems,God With Adam and Eve; the First Rain in Paradise. For Lewis, as for von Ems, the effect is both desolate and decorative.An Explanation of Doily seems braced by the experiences of childhood abuse Lewis recounts in her memoir,Nightshade Mother, A Disentangling, and revisits in many of the poems of First Rain in Paradise, and it summons defensive-aesthetic strategies. At first, sea and rain conspire to “soak” the coatless speaker. But, viewed from “behind a sandbank”, the waves move delicately, “no more than a shimmer”. While, in stanza three, the shoe-as-doily evokes the pain-filled Hans Christian Andersen story of The Little Mermaid, it allows the current narrator to protect their feet.Ambivalence continues in stanza four: the “blue toy trawler” seems harmless, but there’s something grim about the light-heartedness of “lace” and “froth” metaphors that carry the surfers’ “downfall” – the latter word a menacing kind of pun. Menace also haunts the assertions that “Sea’s partly doily”. Once more, the aestheticising perspective seems tyrannical. If the tide resembles “a carpet salesman”, isn’t the sea’s reality being sold short by playful, figurative language? The sea itself is dissatisfied: “Must everything always end in doily?”Lewis doesn’t resist the word’s straightforward invitation to a few shafts of backward-glancing, class-aspiring mockery. The second stanza refers to the antimacassar as the doily’s “cousin” and associates the doily with the visiting vicar and the best china. It produces the kind of moral warning the vicar himself might have been moved to enunciate: “If your cake’s so rich / that it’s leaking syrup, you’ll need a doily.” And then comes the poet’s sense of the cost demanded by fascination with privilege: “Held up, its paper’s the filigree / of snowflake, or fingers looked through in fear.” Despite the teasing tone, the psychological damage wreaked by the combined “doily” forces of social and religious repression is clearly intimated.Shaped by the mutability of its narrative weather, the poem nevertheless keeps faith with the ineluctable doily. Clouds returning imperiously as “Roman rulers / in historical order”, with lilac lighting-effects suggesting invasion and a rainy sunset, morph into poets – Lucretius, followed by Ovid and Horace. The epicurean Lucretius sought to lift the oppressive weight of religion (resurrected by the tea-sipping vicar of stanza two, perhaps) and show humanity the “true reality” of things. Is it the ordering intellect which the author of De Rerum Natura has in common with Ovid and Horace? Do the riches of both knowledge and imagination need containment in “lines” to avoid swamping the creators? Unavoidably, Lewis is implicating herself and Zagajewski in the chorus of those saying relentlessly, “‘Doily’, ‘Doily’”: the reticence of artifice appears elevated to an eternal, if eternally inadequate, principle of nature.Nightshade Mother, A Disentangling received a Wales book of the year nonfiction award in 2025, and, at the time of writing, is nominated for the Sky Arts award in literature. First Rain in Paradise was published earlier this year by Bloodaxe.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Booker-longlisted, a New York Times bestseller and Oprah’s Book Club pick, it even appeared on that list of stuff Barack Obama likes that I’ve always assumed some poor zoomer intern is tasked with making up at the end of every year (I’m maybe being cynical here – there is a non-zero chance that Obama really did spend 2022 blasting Ethel Cain. In which case, my apologies – and, samesies, Mr President!).If Harris did feel sophomore jitters, then Amity, his 2025 follow-up, certainly doesn’t show them. This is a smart, sensitive and very assured novel, albeit one that doesn’t stray radically from the winning formula of its predecessor. Once again, Harris takes the Reconstruction-era deep south as his setting, and African American characters, recently – and tenuously – liberated from slavery are the driving force of his narrative.Cut to 1860s New Orleans, where Coleman, a freed man in the wake of the Confederacy’s dissolution, still works as a household servant to the Harper family, to whom he and his beloved elder sister June were given as a wedding gift when they were only children. The paterfamilias, Mr Wyatt Harper, aggrieved by his perceived loss of social privilege in postwar Louisiana, joins an expedition to Mexico in search of wealth and adventure that might soothe his bruised ego. Coleman and June are tragically separated by his acquisitive ambitions: the infatuated Mr Harper takes June westward, while Coleman is forced to remain behind with the hypochondriac Mrs Harper and her belligerent daughter Florence.The novel opens in 1866, when Mr Harper, after several years’ absence, has at last sent for the rest of his family to join him. The Harper women, thoroughly in denial of the realities of frontier life, buy passage aboard a steamship and begin to toss their ballgowns into trunks. Coleman must screw his courage to the sticking place and accompany them if he is ever to be reunited with his sister, the “only individual” who has ever treated him “like a real person”.Harris shows the more subtle ways that white supremacy undergirds ‘civilised’ middle-class society in the American southThe novel unfolds in chapters alternating between the perspectives of Coleman and June. While June’s life in Mexico is told in the third person, Coleman’s chapters are presented as a retrospective first-person account. The choice makes sense by the novel’s close – and the sweet, fastidious Coleman is an engaging storyteller, whose voice Harris is able to seamlessly maintain. A garrulous autodidact, Coleman knows he is “not just learned but intelligent” in comparison to most; the Harpers, meanwhile, view him with a melange of snobbish affection and disdain, “a house-servant of so delicate a make-up that he could hardly do more than serve champagne”. The journey westward – which, of course, goes metaphorically south – is a voyage of self-discovery for Coleman, who despite his intellectual brilliance must assume some of his sister’s instinctual courage if he is ever to regain her love.Harris’s perceptive writing of the fraught relationships between Amity’s central characters is outstanding, and shows a deep consideration of the more subtle ways that white supremacy undergirds “civilised” middle-class society in the American south. Wyatt still treats June with the utter entitlement of the slave owner, and Harris conveys her emotional exhaustion as vividly as her physical: “Her place was to assure [Wyatt] that he was on the right side of every transaction, every argument, every encounter in the short history that was his unremarkable life.” Elsewhere, Coleman’s relationship with Florence Harper – a spoiled and careless young woman, but in possession of a “strange, unsettling resolve” – is also beautifully done. Unwilling companions on a journey across perilous country, their repartee, in which every verbal jab is freighted with a complex history of mutual resentment and dependence, is a joy to read.There are some aspects of the novel that didn’t work for me. Coleman’s slightly pompous, ornamental voice is not a natural fit for the action set pieces, which occur more frequently as the narrative progresses, and tend to slump away into lethargy. The inner lives of the novel’s core characters are also so richly rendered that the wider cast end up weirdly undertuned by comparison. The primary antagonists seem especially thin and tacked on, a pale reach for a peril never really felt.Harris’s novel is being marketed as a western, but I think the “wanted” poster fonts and bleachy sunsets of the cover might be mis-selling it slightly. It wears a Stetson and spurs self-consciously, at best. At its core, Amity is a warm-hearted and worthy contribution to the American literature of emancipation.Amity by Nathan Harris is published by Tinder (£20).

Titled Endless Dungeon, the show will see the LA-based performer teaming up with local comedians including Tom Cardy, Demi Lardner and Jordan Raskopoulos to create an improvised game of D&D.Diehard fans of the tabletop role playing game will revel in “the absurdity and depth” of the show, Mulligan says. And for everyone else, there’s “absolutely wild hijinks”.D&D has been around since the 70s, previously considered either a nerdy pursuit for basement dwellers or a scapegoat for satanic panic, depending on who you speak to – but in recent years it has exploded in popularity. “Actual play” series – where hosts and guests record the entire, often lengthy process of gameplay for audiences – have burgeoned across podcasts, YouTube and Twitch, becoming a genre in their own right.View image in fullscreenFrom living rooms to arena tours: D&D is now a ‘spectator’ sport.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianCritical Role– the show which Mulligan will be helming for its fourth campaign – has a fanbase of millions and itsown Amazon Primespin-off. It has helped make Mulligan a tiny king of D&D: another one of his actual play shows, Dimension 20, recently toured around the world with sold-out dates atthe Hollywood Bowl and Madison Square Garden.“It feels crazy. It all just feels so crazy. And I hope it stays feeling crazy because it should,” Mulligan says, describing not only the insanity of playing a tabletop role playing game in front of 20,000 people, but also the general success of his career. “We stay bewildered out here. Bewildering gratitude … as long as I get to do this.”Notably, many of Mulligan’s tour venues have been traditionally used as sports arenas, including Melbourne’s Margaret Court Arena. Could it signal a shift into D&D becoming a spectator sport?“Sport’s a great analogy for it because nothing about watching a game of soccer means that you are not likely to play a game of soccer yourself, or vice versa,” Mulligan says. “They are really different pursuits, right? Getting a gaming group together is very hard, but you can watch actual play in your normal time where you want to decompress and relax and just watch a great story, or just laugh or something like that. You’re watching, effectively, a panel show where the episodes are hours long, of comedians playing a game.”View image in fullscreen‘Sport’s a great analogy for it’: Mulligan on how tabletop games like D&D have become thriving communitiesTouring these shows also means that fans are able to connect with their hobby in person – creating a thriving community. While big arena shows might seem less intimate than a living room game, you could see them as a scaling up of the same phenomenon. Mulligan even tells me how fans have found their own D&D groups from connecting with others attending live shows.“We make no bones about the fact that our show is an inclusive show and a welcoming one,” Mulligan says. “And we want people from identities that, especially in this weird global moment happening, who would have some reason to feel unwelcome in many places, to know that they are welcome at our show. We feel like the forces of oppression and discrimination are ascended in this moment.”View image in fullscreenD&D features fantastical characters – but it also offers audiences a chance to exorcise contemporary woes.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianPerhaps the appeal of D&D lies not just in its fantastical escapism, but in its ability to exorcise our contemporary woes. “To be in an arena of tens of thousands of people who all get to laugh at a libertarian crypto dragon, or all get to cheer as someone’s magical same-sex partner appears on screen? That fucking rules. And I think the live shows are people realising we are very much not alone.”Brennan Lee Mulligan’sEndless Dungeon live showwill tour to Melbourne on 13 October and Sydney on 15 October.

Bacchae reveals the virtues and vices of creating a new play from oldMichael BillingtonMon 29 Sep 2025 09.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 09.41 EDTShareHow on earth do we stage Greek tragedy today? Broadly speaking, there are three possible approaches: re-creation, updating and rewriting. All three have been tried at the National Theatre across 30 productions, starting with Philoctetes in 1964 and leading toNima Taleghani’s new Bacchae. Having seen virtually all of these, and visited the excellent exhibition about them in the Olivier’s Wolfson Gallery, I should be able to decide which is the best method. Yet, in all honesty, I find the National’s approach to the Greeks a strange mixture of hit and myth.Re-creating the past is, of course, impossible: as Edgar Allan Poe once remarked, reproducing an Attic tragedy for a modern audience is “the idea of a pedant and nothing beyond”. But, even if we are not living in Athens in the fifth century BC, we can adopt the staging techniques then used. The most zealous attempt to do so came from Peter Hall who, in his 1981 production of Aeschylus’s The Oresteia, had an all-male cast entirely in masks. Masks were employed in ancient Athens because the occasion was a religious ritual. One actor played many roles and facial features had to be exaggerated in a vast space; what was once a practical necessity now seemed an artistic barrier. But that doesn’t invalidate the attempt to imaginatively recreate the past.View image in fullscreenTragedy unlocked … Christopher Eccleston (Creon) and Jodie Whittaker as Antigone at the Olivier theatre, directed by Polly Findlay in 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn his 1980 Berlin production of The Oresteia, the great German director Peter Stein made you feel, as you watched Clytemnestra standing over the bodies of her husband and his lover with a sword dripping blood, that you were tapping into a collective historical memory. The more common approach in the UK is to retain the text but update the setting and this has been tried, mostly with great success, at the National.Katie Mitchell set Euripides’sIphigenia at Aulisin a dilapidated, requisitioned mansion (2004) and hisWomen of Troyin the bleak offices of a war-scarred ferry terminal (2007). Polly Findlay’sAntigone(2012) began with the whirring sound of a helicopter; as everyone cheered the capture of an enemy of the state, one was reminded of the White House situation room during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. In Carrie Cracknell’sMedea(2014), our first sight of Helen McCrory’s stunning heroine was of a woman in singlet and dungarees emerging from a bathroom, cleaning her teeth. It is striking how often at the National it has been female directors, going back toAnnie Castledinewith Women of Troy in 1995, who have found the key to unlocking Greek tragedy.View image in fullscreenBleak office politics … Kate Duchene (Hecuba) in Women of Troy by Euripides, directed by Katie Mitchell at the Lyttelton theatre in 2007.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut there is a third category of plays that are inspired by Greek tragedy – and here the results are decidedly mixed. The most ambitious was Edward Bond’s The Woman (1977), which used Greek myth to show the exiled Trojan women delivering from Athenian occupation the island on which they were shipwrecked. My memory is of a terrific play which put female realpolitik before male posturing as the key to physical survival. Less successful, in my estimation, were Kae Tempest’sParadise(2021), which relocated Philoctetes to a modern refugee camp and regendered the leading roles, and Simon Stone’sPhaedra(2023), which was a muddled, scenically overblown attempt to show the classic protagonist as a charismatic politician in thrall to the son of her dead lover.Which brings us to the present version ofBacchae, which demonstrates the virtues and vices of creating a new play out of an old myth. On the plus side, there is the way Taleghani individualises the chorus members and suggests that a reconciliation of state power and personal freedom is still a possibility. But the writing is often crude, Taleghani ticks off too many hot topics and, when it comes to dramatic storytelling, he is no match for Euripides. (To take just one example, Agave’s realisation that the decapitated head she is clutching is that of her son, Pentheus, seems anti-climactic after she has earlier, and noisily, dismembered his messenger.)There is no doubting the exuberance of Indhu Rubasingham’s production but, looking at this work along with that of Tempest and Stone, I find myself wishing that instead of rewriting the Greeks – or indeed any past masterpieces – we could grapple with them in all their baffling, multiayered complexity.Bacchae is at theOlivier theatre, National Theatre, London, until 1 November. The Greeks: Radical Reinvention is at theWolfson Gallery, London, until February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatrePolly FindlayKatie MitchellCarrie CracknellHelen McCroryEuripidesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All you need to know about global power games, the artist explains, is right thereMon 29 Sep 2025 07.39 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 08.06 EDTShareIn her bright Glasgow studio, artist Tanoa Sasraku is showing me her collection of paperweights produced by oil companies. “I find them so alluring, almost like perfume bottles or snow globes, but so grotesque,” she explains as we handle the etched and sculpted objects, which each have a precious drop of crude oil at their centre. “They have these shiny, dazzling exteriors, but when you get close you see the death mulch inside. All presentations of power are fragile; they collapse once you get close enough.”Sasraku’s paperweights form the centrepiece ofMorale Patch, her forthcoming solo exhibition at the ICA in London: a poetic interrogation of the role of oil in geopolitics and national identity. Drawn from oil-producing nations around the world, the tacky paperweights embody both the seductive allure of extraction and the pomposity and fragility of its resulting wealth and power. Like an absurd game of Battleships, they are displayed on a grid of velvet-lined jewellery boards forming a map of worldwide oil production – and subsequent conflict. “I was thinking about oil alliances and clashes between nations and this stalemate that has occurred. When you map them out, you get the sense that if one warhead went off, it would all collapse.”I got into bidding wars for paperweights on eBayThe work in Morale Patch is ostensibly an about-turn for the 29-year-old, Plymouth-born artist known for tactile works using pigment drawn from soil andmaterials soaked in the ocean. But it initially stemmed from her perennial preoccupation: the narrative power of organic materials, in this case crude oil. “It’s death matter: the product of marine bodies and prehistoric plants pressurised under the ground,” Sasraku says, “but it unleashes as a life force; it explodes out of the ground and powers human development.” She visited sites of oil production in Scotland, where she relocated from London in 2024, but wanted to get her hands on the crude material. Oddly, it was most easily sourced in the tiny amounts within paperweights commissioned by oil companies as corporate gifts.View image in fullscreen‘I was thinking of politicians playing war games in their offices’ … a detail of Shell, a custom-made paperweight.Photograph: Courtesy the artistShe became obsessed with collecting as many as possible. “I felt like I had to collect the world’s source of them,” she laughs. “It became part of my daily practice to type in keywords on eBay and get into bidding wars.” She describes one particularly fierce but sadly unsuccessful contest over a paperweight produced to commemorate a Kylie Minogue concert in Aberdeen in the early 1990s – “such a weird mix of pop culture and Scottish industry.”Sasraku also got her own paperweights made for the show, using a Highlands-based company that produces corporate ones (“They may have made some in my collection”). Some of these take the form of military coffins with flags draped over them, their precious cargo not dead bodies but pen ink.Wall-based works in the show also allude to flags – fragile things made from soaked, stacked newsprint held together with bulldog clips. “The whole show is made from office ephemera,” she says. “I was thinking about politicians playing war games in their offices, toying with the lives of others.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re fed this logic’ … Tanoa Sasraku.Photograph: Belinda LawleyIn both its found objects and fabricated work, Morale Patch plays with a particularly gaudy design sensibility inspired by Sasraku’s repulsion and fascination with 1980s Americana. “The sentiments from that time about ambition, greed and masculinity have really defined where we are now in geopolitics,” she explains. “Look at Donald Trump. He’s got huge power-suited shoulders and uses language like a jock from an 80s film.”Symbols of American ambition are dotted around her studio, where art materials are stored alongside cheerleaders’ pom-poms and aspirational vintage adverts. The same theme is present in an ongoing series based on patterns for men’s clothing, equally inspired by the exaggerated shapes of power suits and the work of Sasraku’s late father, the celebrated Ghanaian fashion designerKofi Ansah.Making this work has been a process of interrogating her relationship with the “dominant culture” of America. As a child, her consumption of US TV was reflected in “my vernacular, my clothing, even food that seemed appealing”. She remembers finding out about 9/11 via footage of Michael Jackson watching the news, “this clash of the ultimate American icon, and the event that changed the course of western history.” As a teenager, she yearned for the perceived glamour of an American life, but in 2025 that has changed. “My interest in America has remained but my desire tobeAmerican has really shifted.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s very much been taken into consideration,” she says.It goes without saying that the imagery and ideas in Morale Patchare particularly charged right now, but the process of making the work has been cathartic for its artist. “Specifically with Britain, Israel, America, Russia and Ukraine, we’re fed this logic as to why certain countries are aligned as allies,” Sasraku concludes. “If you think about where the oil is, what mineral resources are required to maintain these relationships, they’re revealed as very flimsy.“That’s been useful to understand, particularly in this moment, when there’s so much obscene violence being co-signed by the UK. Now the real impetus behind all of that makes sense to me, which is liberating.”Tanoa Sasraku: Morale Patch is atthe ICA, London, from 7 October to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtSculptureOil (Business)CommoditiesOil and gas companiesOil (Environment)Fossil fuelsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The basis is a production originally made for Manchester international festival in 2017,a film and scoreby the late Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (best known for Arrival, Sicario and The Theory of Everything), with text adapted from the 1930 sci-fi novel of the same name by Olaf Stapledon.The narration is coolly voiced by Tilda Swinton, describing the last humans, two billion years from now. They have evolved way beyond current Homo sapiens, communicate only by telepathy and create a few select offspring, each 20 years in gestation. But obliteration is coming. The new element of the production is three dancers (Fukiko Takase, Kelvin Kilonzo and Aoi Nakamura) from choreographer Adrienne Hart’sNeon Dance. Their place is less certain: advanced creatures – with costume props like a glove that extends a hand into a spear – but also fragile humans fiddling while Rome burns.View image in fullscreenHighly evolved humans … Last and First Men.Photograph: Miles HartThe four elements don’t synthesise. What works very well is the film and the score, played by live string quintet. Dense chords simmer into life and fade to silence, like a fissure opening up in a rock revealing a deep well of sound inside. On screen, in black and white, huge hulking structures come into view against greyscale clouds. They are spomeniks, monuments built in the former Yugoslavia in the 20th century. With their great carved curves framing the sky, some look like Oscar Niemeyer’s futuristic architecture, others like ancient standing stones. They are looming, powerful, mesmerising too.Whereas the dance feels the opposite of monolithic, in a way that must be intentional (and there’s only so much you can do with three dancers) but operates as a distraction. Against all that concrete solidity, presence and heft, their bodies are quiet, unimposing; individuals attending to their own small concerns, moving along their own rhythmic paths, busy typing on laptops while the sun explodes. (There’s social commentary there, but like the text, it’s not galvanising). In the end, it’s hard to compute all the inputs, and the dance and text can’t compete with the awe-inspiring scale of the visuals and sound.Explore more on these topicsDanceScience fiction booksScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a good question to ask about an opera whose two main characters spend much of the evening being unhappy. But the answer, in Martin Constantine’s well judged new production for English Touring Opera, is - plenty. With witty sets and costumes by April Dalton, Constantine’s production neatly transports the setting from rural Italian village to English coastal town, but with no loss of the music’s sparkle, affability or poignancy.The setting offers Constantine the use of almost every available cliche of the rundown English seaside resort – there are donkey rides, a fish and chip van, a pair of lifeguards, a solitary fisherman in sou’wester and oilskins, as well as a theatre that has seen better days. Though it stops short of theDonald McGillworld of double entendre postcards, that’s maybe because there’s a contemporary point being made here too. A conman from outside arrives in town to play the pivotal role in this opera, and Dr Dulcamara’s snake-oil elixir has a delicate whiff of Farage, never overstated, about it.View image in fullscreenScarcely misses a beat … the lively ensemble in The Elixir of LovePhotograph: Richard Hubert SmithSung in English, in the late Amanda Holden’s deft and vivid translation, and with a reduced orchestra impressively conducted by Alice Farnham, this is a show that scarcely misses a beat. Donizetti’s pre-Wagnerian use of the Tristan and Isolde legend as an echo of Nemorino and Adina’s quest for love is cleverly embodied. Ensembles and stage business are notably well marshalled at several points, and the costumes are often surreal – one character dresses as a fish, another as a 99 ice-cream cone. Nemorino’s tendency to climb up onto the van roof remains a bit of mystery.Tamsanqa Tylor Lamani captures Nemorino’s optimism and pathos. He really makes one care about his quest for love. His is, though, a notably small-voiced tenor, and his nasal sound is stretched by the opera’s most famous aria, Una furtiva lagrima. Natasha Page’s Adina has an impressive range of vocal colours and she sings with increasing conviction as the evening goes on. Though the two are a winning pair of lovers, the dominant stage and vocal presence is Emyr Wyn Jones as Dulcamara, who commands the show whenever he gets the chance, and for whom bigger things surely beckon. Timothy Nelson gives Nemorino’s rival Belcore plenty of testosterone, while singing the role with refinement; and Rosie Lomas is a bright-voiced Gianetta.Touring until 22 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaEnglish Touring OperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve been driven mad by this book,” she said. “I know that if somebody else made it, I’d be furious. It’s very personal material for everyone. It’s very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private.”Fennell said her first adolescent experience of the novel inspired her approach to the sex-charged retelling of Catherine Earnshaw and orphan Heathcliff’s relationship, set on the moors of 18th-century Yorkshire. “It’s an emotional response to something. It’s primal, sexual,” she said.Fennell added: “[It is] an act of extreme masochism to try and make a film of something that means this much to you. There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it.” Working on it has been “a kind of masochistic exercise”, she said, “because I love it so much, and it can’t love me back, and I have to live with that”.The production hasreceived backlash for the castingof Margot Robbie as Catherine and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff, with critics calling for a Black actor to play the latter character, described in the book as having dark hair, dark eyes and dark skin.Fennell explained her decisions, recalling the moment she “wanted to scream” when she saw Elordi with sideburns on the Saltburn set, as he reminded her of Dirk Bogarde and “looked exactly like the illustration of Heathcliff on the first book that I read”.View image in fullscreen‘A godlike power’ … Margot Robbie (Cathy) in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: YouTubeRobbie, she continued, is “not like anyone I’ve ever met and I think that’s what I felt like with Cathy”. Describing the wily protagonist as a “sadist” who “likes to pinch you”, Fennell added that Robbie is “the type of person who, like Cathy, could get away with anything. I think honestly she could commit a killing spree and nobody would mind.”“It needed somebody like Margot … somebody who has a power, an otherworldly power, a godlike power, that means people lose their minds.”Kharmel Cochrane, the film’s casting director, previously defended the choices, saying there is “no need to be accurate” as the source material is “just a book”.Fennell also confirmed that, as with many other adaptations, the film will only focus on the first half of the book and not continue the story after Cathy’s death. She added that “an enormous amount of dialogue is verbatim” because “I couldn’t better it, and who could?”For the sceptics, Fennell said that part of the novel’s enduring power is that “no one is in agreement about any element of it”, and she added: “I can’t make something for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmerald FennellWuthering HeightsFilm adaptationsEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordinewsShareReuse this content"

His fluid playing enriched the albums Five Leaves Left (1969) by Drake and Solid Air (1973) by Martyn, and he went on to form a long working relationship with Martyn, and, later, the singer-songwriterRichard Thompson(no relation).It was Lonnie Donegan’s hits of the mid-50s that first inspired Thompson as a young teenager to build a tea-chest bass and join a skiffle band. Working Soho clubs and US airbases in the 60s, he built a name as a capable bassist, and in 1964 he joined Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated.As a band leader, Korner brought together a wealth of young British talent, includingGinger Baker,Charlie Watts, Eric Clapton and Brian Jones, and his stewardship led to Thompson engaging with many rising stars at Korner’s Marquee club base. He became the bassist of choice of jazz musicians such as John McLaughlin and Tubby Hayes, and folk artists such asDavey Graham.In 1967, he and the drummer Terry Cox, also from Blues Incorporated, joined the guitaristsBert JanschandJohn Renbourn, and vocalist Jacqui McShee, to complete the lineup of Pentangle. While initially branded a “folk” band, Pentangle employed jazz and classical elements as they reimagined traditional songs, with Thompson playing an important part in that experimentation.The various members having established their names in the Soho folk and rock scene, the band’s first public concert, at the Royal Festival Hall in 1967, was a huge success, as was their debut album, The Pentangle, released the following year. Their 1969 album, Basket of Light, was even bigger commercially, containing the hit single Light Flight, used as the theme for a BBC TV drama, Take Three Girls. It was not the first theme tune for Thompson, who, having realised that recording sessions were more financially rewarding than playing live – “all the money I used to earn on jazz gigs used to get blown before I got home” – had in 1964 played on the recording for the theme music of the TV series Thunderbirds.After Pentangle split in 1972, Thompson chose not to join another group, but to concentrate on playing sessions – the record producer Joe Boyd having already paired him with Drake for Five Leaves Left, did the same with Martyn and Solid Air.Thompson and Martyn were kindred spirits, heavy drinkers who delighted in displays of disruptive, drunken behaviour while touring. Alcoholism would affect both men and led to a notable drop-off in session work for Thompson.However, in the late 70s, Thompson sobered up, and the reverence his recordings with Drake and Martyn were now held in eventually found him again in demand as a session player: in the mid-80s David Sylvian, Bush, Talk Talk, The The, Everything But the Girl, Coxon and Skin all employed him for his lyrical playing.In 1987 Thompson released his debut solo album, Whatever, leading a jazz trio playing the muscular fusion he loved. He released five more low-key solo jazz albums over the next quarter century, alongside continuing to work prodigiously with others, most notablyRichard Thompson, the two veterans of the 60s folk scene recording 14 albums together. Last year, he performed at Richard’s 75th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall.View image in fullscreenThompson, second left, performing with Pentangle in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the late 1960s, with, from left: John Renbourn, Jacqui McShee and Bert Jansch.Photograph: Jorgen Angel/RedfernsDanny was born in Teignmouth, Devon. He never knew his father, a miner who enrolled in the Royal Navy at the start of the second world war and was killed in action. Danny’s sister died soon after and he and his mother moved to Battersea, south-westLondon, where he attended Salesian college. He excelled in boxing and football as well as playing a variety of instruments, before settling on the upright bass.Having left school and home aged 15, Thompson earned a living playing bass in Soho strip clubs. After a year, he began working the American airbase circuit. Aged 18, he was arrested for failing to turn up for national service, and three days before being sent to Winchester barracks, married his girlfriend, Daphne Davis. He was then posted to Penang, Malaysia, for two years, where, against orders, he became involved with the local music scene.Returning to England in 1963 he took a job backing the American singer Roy Orbison – playing electric bass for the only time in his life – on a UK tour while watching headliners the Beatles kick off Beatlemania. In 1964 he spent £5 on buying his acoustic bass, Victoria – which he used his entire career – before joining Korner’s Blues Incorporated.Thompson was known for his warmth and good humour. He continued to practise for an hour a day. His mantra remained: “Music is like a religion, if you want to do something you have to work at it, you have to practise.”After embracing sobriety, Thompson set up Hero Productions to produce TV documentaries. His 1983 wildlife film A Passion to Protect (directed by Roy Deverell) won a Hugo award at the Chicago film festival. He converted toIslamin 1990, taking the Muslim name Hamza, and in 1999 he was interviewed for the BBC TV series Faces of Islam. The following year he travelled to Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem as the presenter of the documentary The Furthest Mosque.Thompson underwent major heart surgery in 1998, during which he suffered a stroke. Three months after his operation he organised an all-star charity concert in Sarajevo and he continued performing until ill health forced him to slow down several years ago.Thompson’s first marriage ended in divorce in the late 70s. In 1990 he married his partner Sylvia. She survives him, as does his son, Danny Jr, from his first marriage.Daniel Henry Edward Thompson, musician and film producer, born 4 April 1939; died 23 September 2025Explore more on these topicsFolk musicPop and rockJohn MartynRichard ThompsonJazzTelevisionDevonobituariesShareReuse this content"

The creators of trippy, four-hour art forgery epic Rohtko on their quest for truthBased on a New York gallery scandal that was traced back to a Chinese maths teacher, Łukasz Twarkowsk’s play makes audiences question absolutely everythingRyan GilbeyMon 29 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘It was only meant to be a small experimental project,” says Łukasz Twarkowski with a knowing smile. The 42-year-old Polish-born director is discussing his show Rohtko, inspired by a real-life art forgery scandal. In 2009, it was revealed that the prestigious New York gallery Knoedler & Co had paid more than $20m for paintings byMark Rothkoand other abstract expressionists, which transpired to be fake. The gallery folded, the art world quaked, and the paint trail led back to a Chinese maths teacher living in Queens.The case has already been the subject of Netflix documentaryMade You Look: A True Story About Fake Art. In Twarkowski’s hands, it becomes a vehicle to interrogate preconceptions about originality and authenticity. These he holds up to the light, finding them suspect if not counterfeit. True to his intentions, Rohtko (the title is deliberately misspelt) is experimental. But at just under four hours in length, with a spectacular set by Fabien Lédé and a palette as stylish and sumptuous as any Michael Mann or Wong Kar-Wai film, “small” it is not.View image in fullscreenSizzling … the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant where most of the action takes place.Photograph: Arturs Pavlovs“That wasn’t a decision so much as an accumulation,” explains Twarkowski when we meet in Amsterdam during the show’s run at the Holland festival. “At some point, you put all the interesting scenes together and you’re terrified because you didn’t expect it to be so long.” Then again, his productions – such asThe Employees, set on board a cube-like spacecraft, andRespublika, an immersive six-hour rave complete with functioning bars, dancefloors and even a sauna – tend to be events rather than plays. “Theatre doesn’t have to be boring,” he says, proving himself a master of understatement as well as spectacle.A densely layered intellectual thriller scripted by Anka Herbut and scored by invigorating techno beats, Rohtko hops between past, present and future. The action is restricted mainly to a Chinese restaurant decked out in sizzling reds and greens, and housed on stage within a transparent box the size of a shipping container.Theatre doesn’t have to be boringWhat unfolds in that smoky establishment is relayed to the audience on video screens via a team of camera operators whom we can see moving around inside the murk like divers, their live feed coming to us as if from the ocean bed. An actor might exit the restaurant and address us directly – speaking, as well as thinking, outside the box. Eventually, the restaurant splits in half, as does the narrative timeline, with Rothko and his wife in the 1950s sharing the stage with two modern-day actors auditioning to star in their story. Then things getreallytrippy …Lédé gives me a tour of the set, which is cracked open on stage like a fortune cookie after the previous night’s performance. We peek inside the restaurant’s kitchen. It is here that the show’s Chinese cook bemoans the art world’s deference to “the cult of the original – it’s as if they didn’t know that nothing comes out of nowhere”. Another character advises: “Start copying what you love. At the end of the copy, you will find yourself.”Lédé, a painter who was coaxed into theatre by Twarkowski, recalls how Rohtko began. “We knew this would be about the art market, the life of Rothko, fakes and originals. I created an abstract playground that we could build a story inside before we had a script.” One of his touches was to foreground the crew members who break apart and reassemble the set. “Rather than pretending it’s magic, we make the crew very visible in white costumes, like art handlers.”View image in fullscreenMaster of spectacle … Łukasz Twarkowski.Photograph: Beatrice BorgersSeveral scenery-shifters appear on stage at that moment in a way that suggests Lédé has summoned them for my benefit. That’s the Rohtko effect: audiences may not be able to step up and inspect the set, as they could during The Employees, or join actors on the dancefloor as in Respublika, but the show’s aesthetic and intellectual spell makes it tricky to discern where the drama ends and life begins.An example: despite the theatre’s warning that photography is prohibited, the woman seated beside me during the performance kept sneakily snapping away. In a show about the integrity of imitation, she was making her own copies. I ask Twarkowski whether she was a plant. “No,” he laughs. “And if you really love something and want to keep it with you, why not?”Rohtko challenges the sanctity of originality on every level, from its use of a Chinese rendition of one of pop’s most famous cover versions (Prince’s Nothing Compares 2U, immortalised by Sinéad O’Connor) to the unstable relationship between physical action and its video reproduction. “There is a strange tension between what is happening live and what you see on the screen,” Twarkowski agrees. “Framing the action with cameras builds a false promise of an unfinished, unseen world beyond the frame. But when you look away from the screen, you can see very clearly where the stage ends.”‘It really bores me’: Wayne McGregor on why he won’t spell out his striking dance creationsRead moreThe show makes notions about artistic purity begin to feel materialistic, even fascistic. “Of course,” he says, “it’s why I think Asian culture is better prepared for a world of NFTs and the whole digital era. From our Judeo-Christian tradition, we are born with the feeling of a beginning and an end. We don’t have the eternal loop which is central to Asian culture. When you have a never-ending process, you cannot have anything that is original because that would prove there is a beginning.”All this is spoken breathlessly, with boyish excitement, and with nothing to suggest that Twarkowski has been mulling over these ideas since long before the show premiered in 2022at Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia. Ever since he read the philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in fact, and realised that the two Chinese signs for “original” translate as “authentic trace”.The only unambiguous moment in Rohtko is its curtain call, when the stage is dominated by a profane anti-Russia slogan set against the Ukrainian flag. It’s a “small gesture”, says Twarkowski, but one that will remain until the war is over. With Rohtko, Twarkowski tells us: go fake yourself. His message to Russia isalmostthe same.Rohtko is at the Barbican, London, 2-5 October.

Has he finally found peace?Mon 29 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 08.07 EDTShareIt’s nearly three decades since Iain Lee roamed the streets for Channel 4’s11 O’Clock Show, armed with clipboard and microphone, a string of filthy questions tucked up his oversized suit sleeve. He’s 52 now, and presumably he’s matured sincehe memorably interviewed the singer Cleo Laineabout her husband’s masturbatory habits. But maybe not, because this summerLee hit the streets again, where among other things, hemimed giving a blowjobto a 76-year-old who said he’d never been attracted to a man. A lot of the content on the original show was homophobic, Lee says, but he came out as bisexual in 2019, and maybe he now goes where his younger self didn’t dare.Next month Lee returns with Impostor Syndrome – his first solo live gig in 10 years. The show is billed as a commemoration of three decades in showbusiness, but it’s also a self-experiment. Actually, he clarifies, he’s “recoveringfrom impostor syndrome”. It’s an important theme for Lee, who is a recovering drug, sex and alcohol addict, nearly five years sober. It’s fair to say he has had a chequered career – for years, it seemed as if Jimmy Carr got everything Lee went for – and an eventful personal life, much of which has played out on air.View image in fullscreenLee with co-host Katherine Boyle in 2020. They recently got engaged.Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images“I don’t really have a filter,” he says. “So it all kind of comes out.” After he switched from TV to radio in 2005, his catalogue of on-air disclosures included being sexually abused by his cubmasters when he was nine, coming out as bisexual, discussing his addictions, and announcing his divorce. On 2017’s I’m a Celebrity, he shared that he had previously felt suicidal and called the Samaritans. In 2019, he had“a kind of breakdown on air”in which he declared his own TalkRadio show pointless. Before he says a word, I know fromlistening to his podcast on Patreona few nights ago that he’s been trying to lose weight for the photo shoot – “Holy shit, man! Did I say that?”, he says, running his fingers through his hair – and that he’s just proposed, on a boat on Lake Como, to long-term best friend, co-host and producer Katherine Boyle. (She said yes.)Lee has beena professional counsellorsince 2022,having retrained partly in response to some of the life events above. The blue-painted lounge his Patreon subscribers see doubles as a “counselling room” for his 20 clients. But, a few months ago, he phoned Katherine. “I said, ‘I’ve just booked a night at the Stables [venue in Milton Keynes]. She said, ‘What the fuck are you doing?’ I said, ‘I don’t know, butsomething is happening.’”Something is happening?“Something has shifted,” he says. He had this feeling before The 11 O’Clock Show took off in 1998. He had a vision. “Me in a grey suit with a microphone and a crowd of people behind me.” He can’t see it this time around, “but I know something’s gonna happen.Something’sgonna happen.”Impostor Syndrome includes a watchalong of The 11 O’Clock Show. His mum recorded all his shows on VHS tapes, which he stashed in boxes in the garage. But this year,he digitised them. His social media platforms are laden with his archive. I can’t help wondering if he’s living off his youth – or learning to live with it. What’s he going back there for?“I’m making peace with my past,” he says. “I was never very proud of my TV career. I thought it was shit.”View image in fullscreenIn I’m a Celebrity … in 2017.Photograph: James Gourley/ShutterstockHe was “fortunate and unfortunate” to have Sacha Baron Cohen, Ricky Gervais, Daisy Donovan and Mackenzie Crook among his 11 O’Clock co-stars. (He’s stayed in touch only with Crook, his former flatmate.)“I compared myself to Sacha and Ricky. Which is a fool’s errand … I held a lot of bitterness and resentment towards them. I’d think, ‘They’ve stolen my career.’ Well, of course they hadn’t. It was lightning in the bottle twice. They were phenomenons.”He didn’t get over the feeling till he was in his 40s. “If anyone was fucking up my career, it was me,” he says. “I was taking loads and loads of drugs and becoming incredibly unreliable and obnoxious to work with … an asshole.”The fear persisted that “I do not know what I’m doing… So I took cocaine and it gave me this false bravado. It looked like arrogance but it came from absolute terror.”It’s hard to marry this with the cocky guy in a cheap suit who asked the unaskable on The 11 O’Clock Show. Even Cleo Laine sent a message after his interview saying, “Thank you. I enjoyed that.” His interviews were brilliant.“See, I feel uncomfortable you saying that,” he says, “because there’s still part of me that’s trying to think,Is that true?I’ve had it so ingrained that I’m not very good, that I’m a terrible human being. So when you say something like that …”He’s squirming inside?View image in fullscreenA publicity image of Lee in 2001.Photograph: Shutterstock“No, it makes me tear up. That’s over half my life. And for so long, that poor boy, that poor me, thought I was rubbish,” he says. “My past has been chaos from a very young age. Sexual abuse – that never does anyone any good. And then ADHD [he was diagnosed six years ago, along with bipolar disorder], and then being really, really unsure of my sexuality and having this gay side no one knew about. I was so scared of being outed …”So, reviewing those old videos, “I guess I’m going back to tell eight-year-old me and 12-year-old me and 24-year-old me that, actually, you’re not worthless, and you’re actually really good at some things. I guess it’s making amends with myself.”Lee “grew up working class” on the Britwell council estate in Slough. His mum was a secretary at a school, then a PA at a chemical company before being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. His dad worked in the BBC props department and once stole a dalek, which he hid in the garage, pushing Lee and his sister around in it. He introduced Lee to Tom Baker, and the set of The Young Ones.It’s a surprise to hear this stream of happy memories. Lee has previously suggested he had a difficult relationship with his dad.“He was very flawed. Definitely a sex addict,” he says. “I still don’t know how many brothers and sisters I’ve got … We fell out for a long time.”Lee can’t go into details about the sexual abuse he experienced in the cubs in Slough. He has given a statement to police, along with other men, and he plans to sue the Scouts. What he can say is that the repercussions of abuse “impacted all my life how I see older men. I had that around my dad. I could never talk to him.”The most glaring example of this came when Lee was 23. His dad was working in Pakistan on the film Jinnah, and Lee had gone with him.View image in fullscreenOn The 11 O’Clock Show with Mackenzie Crook and Daisy Donovan.Photograph: Channel 4“I was Christopher Lee’s double. Imagine that. We were in Pakistan. And [my dad] said, ‘Your uncle Don has had a serious motorcycle accident. I think he’s going to die. I have to fly back and see him.’ I was like, ‘That’s awful!’”After his dad left, Lee’s co-workers came up to congratulate him. “I went, ‘What?’ They said, ‘You’re having a baby brother, right?’”It is, by any standard, a heck of a lie, but Lee sounds unsure of himself when he asks, “That was a shit lie, right? A bad lie?” His dad had “gone to see the birth of one of his kids … But I didn’t say anything when he came back.”He didn’t call him out on it?“I couldn’t.”Even when his dad visited the set of The 11 O’Clock Show a couple of years later, Lee “went into this very quiet subservience thing”.But then, he says, “I went home, took some cocaine and phoned him up. And I was able to let all this stuff out. And he kept hanging up on me, and I kept phoning him up. I said, ‘Tell me how many brothers and sisters I’ve got!’” He’s almost shouting now. Lee didn’t get an answer. But asking the question “had broken the spell”.Lee is a father himself, to two boys, 15 and 13, from his marriage to the broadcaster Helena Wilkinson, which ended in 2018. Given the impact of his father’s addictive behaviours, does he worry about the impact of his own addictions on his sons?“Of course I worry. Which is in part why I’ve spoken about all of this stuff.”View image in fullscreen‘My sons asked me: “Do you know what an alcoholic is?”’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAfter Ant McPartlin’s car crash in 2018, his sons came to him and asked, “Have you heard of Ant and Dec? Do you know what an alcoholic is?”It took Lee a couple more years to summon the courage to tell them, “‘Boys, you know I don’t drink? Ever wondered why? It’s because I’m an alcoholic. And if I start drinking, I can’t stop drinking. And if I start drinking, I’ll probably take drugs.’“And they went, ‘Oh my God, have you done a drug?’ We had a chat. Hopefully they won’t go through the same self-loathing, and if there’s any questions about their sexuality, or they get into drugs, they’ll know that I’ve been through that,” he says. “They’ll know there is an alternative.”The experience of parenting has clearly been transformative for Lee. Maybe even a kind of rebirth. He was born Iain Lee Rougvie, but dropped Rougvie before he got married. It was hard to pronounce, “and that was a period when I wasn’t talking to my dad. I regret that now.”A few years ago, he says, “I gave my kids the gift of giving me my middle names.” The boys chose “Felix” and “Diamond”, after DanTDM, a YouTuber they liked. “I said, ‘Boys, you can go wilder if you want … My full name legally is Iain Felix Diamond Lee.”It’s such a poignant story, and I wonder if Lee was able to make peace with his dad?“I found some stuff [of his] in a box in my flat,” he says. This was in 2012. “We met up in this cafe. I walked in … And he looked old. And suddenly I wasn’t scared of him. And we had a really nice chat. I’m gonna cry,” he says, but he carries on talking.“I told him everything I could remember that he’d done that hurt me.” Lee was in Narcotics Anonymous at the time. “And I said, ‘Do you know what? I forgive you for it.’ And I apologised for shouting at him when I was on cocaine. At the end, I said, ‘Right. I’m not prepared to call you Dad yet, but maybe there is something salvageable here …’View image in fullscreenLee in the TalkRadio studio in 2016.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The Observer“Shortly after that, he phoned up and said, ‘I’ve got cancer.’ He was dead, I think, within a year. He fucking left me again!” Lee says, raising his voice. “He abandoned me again! And that was devastating! And some people couldn’t get it – ‘But you hated him your whole life’ – but we were making peace.” He looks out the window. The rain is coming down in thin, grey sheets.“I’ve had good things happen to me,” he says. “I’ve had fun things happen.”You got engaged, I remind him.Boyle has been at his side since they met at BBC Three CountiesRadioin 2012. She was in the studio for the episode of The Late Night Alternative when he had his “kind of breakdown”, in the course of which he also apologised for sending some listeners intimate images.“You can ask me about the dick pics,” he says. “I don’t want to sound like Russell Brand and go, ‘Well, it was all consensual’, but itwasall consensual.” Boyle has been there through it all.“She’s a remarkable human being and I am blessed that she’s my fiancee. See, now I’m going to cry again!” he says. “I’ve put her through so much.”Many of the key events in Lee’s recent life – his relapse, coming out, deciding to retrain – cluster around 2019. In February that year, he was in a car crash on the M40. A car went into the back of him.View image in fullscreenMaking a guest appearance on This Morning in November 2011.Photograph: Ken McKay/Rex Shutterstock“And I got out, and I was angry. ‘What the fuck was that, man?’ And then we looked behind his car, and a motorbike had gone into the back of him, and there’s a bloke lying in the road. It was fucking horrendous.”Someone removed the man’s helmet. Someone gave mouth-to-mouth. Lee held the man’s hand. “And I’m shouting, ‘Don’t fucking die, man! Don’t die, come on!’” A few months earlier, Lee hadkept a suicidal caller to his show talking, helping to save him. Here he was in the rescuer role again, or maybe he felt he was riding shotgun with death. The man survived, with lifelong injuries.“And, honestly, it did me in. I stammer when I talk about it. I thought, this is my fault. This is why I went into therapy – because I thought it was my fault … And that’s when my counsellor said, ‘Do you know you’re bisexual?’ And clearly Iwasbisexual.”In June 2020,Talk Radio didn’t renew Lee’s contract. “Katherine said, ‘Don’t worry. You’re Iain Lee. You’ll get a phone call.’ And for the first time since 1998, the phone didn’t ring. The phone didn’t ring at all,” he says quietly.Within a few months, he started counsellor training – in the course of which a psychiatrist diagnosed him with ADHD and bipolar disorder. It’s a lot to learn in a short space of time but, Lee says, “It was great! It changed everything. I could start making sense of stuff.”I can’t help wondering what Lee actually wants now. As well as Impostor Syndrome, he’s mooted the idea of reviving The 11 O’Clock Show, and he’s managing the bandThe Man From Delmonte. But “I’m just doing it because I think it’ll be fun,” he says. “It sounds corny, but I’ve got enough to pay the mortgage … I’ve never been in such an honest, open relationship … I get on so well with my boys … I’m more content than I’ve ever been.”Iain Lee’s Impostor Syndrome isat the Stables, Milton Keynes, on 5 October, and theRondo Theatre in Bathon 7 February 2026.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe big interviewRadio comedyComedyRadioTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

She has no plans to stopPaula CocozzaMon 29 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 11.01 EDTShareWhen the urge became impossible to ignore, Sarah Cook bought a touring bike and an “all-singing, all-dancing four-season tent”, and packed her belongings into 68-litre bike bags.She was 60, and, having rented out her flat in Cumbria, England, set off alone to pedal the Pacific west coast of the US. As she cycled away from Vancouver airport, “I was like ‘See you in six months!’,” Cook says. “Not having the weight of bricks and mortar and possessions was so liberating.” By the time she arrived in La Paz, Bolivia, 111 days later, she knew, “this is how I want to live my life.” Now 67, she has been itinerant ever since, and has cycled 24,000 miles.Cook wanted to find out, she says, what happened “when your life was on the road. I thought something must switch in your head or your emotions … It is the ultimate living in the moment.” Each day, as she starts to turn the pedals, she says, “I feel weightless – as if I’m flying.”Cook’s highlights include cycling nearly 3,000 miles across Europe, from the Black Sea to the Atlantic Ocean; camping beneath giant sequoia trees in California; wild camping in the Colombian páramo; and pedalling 2,000 miles of Patagonian coastline into Ushuaia in Argentina, to fulfil a childhood dream.Growing up in a Surrey village, Cook traced explorers’ routes on to greaseproof paper from her parents’ world atlas. The eldest of six, she would lead her siblings down the garden with ingredients for tea, lift a piece of turf with her penknife, and make a campfire.She studied medical sciences at university and worked for a while in a hospital hematology laboratory, but stopped to home school her three daughters and son.But as she entered her 40s, “the negative committee” in her head asked her: “What have you done with your life apart from raise children?’ I was a bright girl with a degree.” When her children went to university, “I was like ‘What do I do now? Who recognises home-educating kids as personal development?’’She trained for a mountain leader qualification, and another to teach English as a foreign language, then worked part-time – leading walking holidays, expeditions with teenagers and teaching English. She needed to be financially independent, having separated from her husband.View image in fullscreen‘When I start turning the pedals, my spirit takes off’ … Cook.Photograph: Jack Boniface/The GuardianAlthough Cook returns regularly to England to see family, she has no fixed base, and switches between rentals or campsites. Between tenants, she has camped in her sleeping bag on the carpet of her flat. “It’s not my home now,” she says. “Although home is where I am.”She feels settled even if she is only staying one night. “Everything that goes in my tent has an order to how I unpack it, and a place that I put it. And I’m amazed every time. How does this piece of fabric feel like home when I do that?”Cycling, and living itinerantly, has given Cook “the knowledge that I can survive pretty much whatever happens”. She has two mantras. “One: ‘It’ll work out.’ The other: ‘Just do the next thing.’ When everything seems horrendous and you don’t think you can cope, just do the next thing. It might be sitting down to eat a banana.”Cook has osteoarthritis in one hip, and cycling has its challenges. She had to push her bike uphill for five hours in Colombia. “My body is ageing and needs more rest and recuperation,” she says.But she has no plans to stop. In the UK, where she is visiting family, she has toured the south of England and pedalled from the Shetlands to the southernmost tip of Cornwall.It was grey and grizzly in Scotland, and everything was damp when she packed up and fastened the lights to her bike. The cloud was low, the gulls screeched. “And I have this vivid memory of thinking, ‘Why do I feel so ecstatically happy, setting off on my bike on this grey, drizzly morning?” Truth is, she says, “I get on the bike and start turning the pedals and it’s like my spirit takes off.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60CyclingFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has a short season and, when it’s freshly picked, it’s so sweet that you can chomp it right off the cob. I reserve some to eat straight from the grill slathered with butter, then dabbed with a wedge of lime rolled in chilli powder to recreate a favourite Kenyan street food snack from my childhood. I find the combination of hot chilli with naturally sweet corn an irresistible one, so both of today’s recipes have a jolt of something fiery.Charred sweetcorn, prawn and green chilli spaghetti (pictured top)Green chilli adds essential heat to the sweet prawns and corn – I like to use jalapeños here for their fragrant heat. Keep the seeds in if you are a heat seeker.Prep10 minCook30 minServes43 corn on the cob1 tbsp salt400g spaghetti100ml olive oil8 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely sliced2 green chillies, such as jalapeño or bird’s eye, finely slicedFinely grated zest and juice of1 lemon400graw tiger prawnsBlack pepperHeat up a griddle or chargrill pan, then grill the corn for about 10 minutes, until charred all over. Slice the kernels off the cobs with a sharp knife and reserve the cobs.Put a large saucepan of water on to boil for the pasta and add a tablespoon of salt and the reserved cobs – they will add flavour to the pasta. Boil the pasta for eight to 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water and discarding the cobs.Meanwhile, pour the olive oil into a frying pan and put it on a low heat. Add the garlic, chilli and lemon zest, and leave to gently infuse for a couple of minutes. Add the prawns, turn up the heat and cook for three to four minutes. Add the drained spaghetti, corn and a splash of pasta water, and toss vigorously. Season with salt and pepper, if required, and serve at once.Sweetcorn, gochujang and cheddar croquetasView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogul’s sweetcorn, gochujang and cheddar croquetas.Croquetas are basically deep-fried balls of bechamel and my undisputed favourite snack in tapas bars.

Bubble for a minute, stirring constantly, then take off the heat and fold in the cheese, sweetcorn and spring onions. Season with sea salt and pepper, leave to cool to room temperature, then cover and chill for about two hours, until firm.Using wet hands, shape the firm mix into 3cm balls and put on a lined baking sheet. Freeze for an hour.Put the flour for the coating in a shallow bowl, the panko breadcrumbs in a second bowl one, and beat the eggs in a third. Carefully roll each ball in flour, then in beaten egg and then in the breadcrumbs.Half-fill a pan with oil, then heat to 180C, or until a cube of bread turns golden brown in 20 seconds. Fry the croquetas in batches for two minutes each, until golden brown, then drain on kitchen paper; make sure the oil comes back up to temperature between batches. Serve immediately.Creamed corn cacio e pepe with toasted corn and pickled chilliesView image in fullscreenThis borrows from the comforting, sensory pleasures of pasta cacio e pepe and is assertive with black pepper and pecorino.

Heat the butter in a saucepan over a low heat, add the shallots, garlic and oregano, and saute for about 10 minutes, until soft and translucent.

Brush with butter and season with sea salt. Once cool enough to handle, slice the kernels off the charred corn in slabs.Put the cooked corn and shallot mix in a food processor, blitz smooth, then stir in the pepper and pecorino.

Bullion has hit a series of record highs in 2025, putting it firmly on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979, when revolution in Tehran rocked the global economy.Why is gold in such demand?The short answer is that gold is acting as a haven and a store of value, a role it’s played for thousands of years, since the kingdom of Lydia started churning out gold coins in the sixth century BC. Investors can be a jumpy lot, and there are plenty of reasons to shift money out of riskier assets today – from fears of economic slowdown to rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Nato.As well as traditional valuation drivers such as interest rates, the dollar and inflation, concerns overDonald Trump’s attacks on the US central bank, his trade war, and his tax and spending plans are also pushing gold higher, analysts say.Why can’t other precious metals play the same role as gold?Gold’s role as a store of value comes, in part, from its scarcity. According to the World Gold Council, if all the gold ever mined was gathered into a single cube, it would measure approximately 22 metres on each side.Total supplies are rising by an estimated 1.7% a year. That means “no policy, no discovery, no quantitative easing of geology” can debase gold, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.That makes it attractive when investors worry that governments are losing their grip on the public finances – finding it politically unpalatable to raise taxes, and impossible to cut spending.Copper, in contrast, can’t operate as a store of value as huge quantities are used, and consumed, each year, with demand set by the health of the global economy.Platinum and palladium fail this test too, despite an ounce costing over a thousand dollars as new supplies are quickly swallowed up by industry.How much has the precious metal risen by – and are we at peak gold?Since 1 January, the spot price of gold has risen by a blistering 45% to a record high of $3,831 per ounce on Monday. That outpaces all other leading asset classes this year.Gold hasn’t had such as strong year since 1979, when it jumped by 126% as Iran’s revolution led to a surge in the oil price, crushing investors’ hopes that inflation could be tamed.A line graph showing the price of gold steadily rising since the 1970sData from Bank of America (BofA) on Friday shows that $5.6bn flowed into gold last week. Over the past four weeks, the bank says there were record inflows of $17.6bn.BofA cautions that gold is tactically “overbought”, but structurally “under owned” – as it only represents 0.4% of private client assets under management. It is maintaining a long position on gold, indicating it expects the price to keep rising.Gold has further to rise, analysts predict. Arnab Das, global macro strategist at Invesco, for example, says the gold rally still “has legs”.“We see no true alternative to gold as a hedge against US risks and expect central banks to keep buying gold … In my view, central banks are buying gold because they see no fiat alternative to the dollar,” Das says.Who is buying it, and why?The World Gold Council says western investors and speculators have been the drivers of the recent price gains.They cite two reasons. First,evidence that a slowing US economywill allow the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further. That means the interest on cash reserves will be lower, making it less attractive compared with gold (which doesn’t provide a yield).Second, increased rhetoric against the Fed and its independence from the Trump administration is leading to concerns about the stability of the US dollar and the Treasuries market.A bar chart showing how much the price of gold has grown since the late 1970sCentral banks have also been adding to their gold reserves in recent years. Notably China. Bloomberg reported this week that China aims to become custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves in an attempt to strengthen its standing in the global bullion market, and become less dependent on the dollar and western centres like the US, the UK and Switzerland.What about the Trump effect?Overall, markets have not been badly hit by the jump in US tariffs this year to the highest level since the 1930s. But the most obvious vehicle of trade war worry has been the US dollar.M&G fund manager Eva Sun-Wai told M&G’sBond Vigilantesforum last week that this has led to a “broader de-dollarization trend, which has caused angst in markets”.“And I think it’s a big reason why gold, for example, has become the safe haven choice,” Sun-Wai added, as investors go for gold when they don’t want to buy the dollar or expose themselves to the risk of interest rate moves by holding bonds.The greenback is enduring a bruising 2025 – down more than 9% so far this year, amid concerns about Fed independence and those trade war concerns. That mechanistically lifts the value of gold in dollar terms.Should I buy gold?“Caveat emptor” certainly applies, given the edginess among investors thatasset prices might generally have risen too high. But some experts do see more value in gold – earlier this month, Deutsche Bank raised its gold price forecast for 2026 by $300, to $4,000 per ounce.You can buy physical gold, perhaps from the Royal Mint, which sells gold coins and bars. The bulk buying chainCostco even stocks gold bars, which often sell out, perhaps because of the precious metal’spopularity with doomsday preppers. But “such investments come with extra costs and complications, however, like insurance and storage,” says Jemma Slingo of Fidelity International.Alternatively, you could put money into a gold exchange traded fund (ETF), which closely mirror movements in the gold price.Another option is to buy shares in gold miners, such as Fresnillo, whose share price is up 250% so far this year.There is a risk, though, of a pullback in gold after such strong gains, or a more sizeable drop, perhaps if inflation falls back towards central bank targets, or geopolitical crises ease.Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesexplainersShareReuse this content"

Ryan Chin Taw Cheong, an ear, nose and throat consultant and sleep surgeon at University College London hospitals, says men are almost twice as likely as women to snore. “But that gap narrows at two particular points in women’s lives,” he says. “One is after menopause, typically between 45 and 55. The second is pregnancy, especially in the third trimester.”Snoring happens when airflow is partly blocked through the upper airway, causing vibration in the back of the nose, the soft palate, the throat, tongue or epiglottis (the “lid” over your windpipe). This happens because the muscles of the airway relax while we’re sleeping and are dragged down by gravity when we lie in bed. Other factors can make us more likely to snore. Alcohol relaxes the muscles further. Extra body weight puts pressure on the throat. Allergies, nasal polyps, a deviated septum or simply a heavy cold can all block the airway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But ACL injuries are notoriously slow to repair:Sam Kerr made a goal-scoring return for Chelseathis month after tearing her ACL in January 2024.Before the show Fowler told Guardian Australia her recovery was going well and being ready for the Asian Cup was a “big motivator” but “I’ll be back whenever my body is ready”.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

I like to take my time with my rehab work to make sure I’m doing it properly and getting the most out of it so I’m not too focused on how long the sessions take.”Fowler said she had requested heels as part of her fashion ensemble because she loves wearing them.But her usual fashion choices can be “quite basic some days”, she said. “My go-to outfit would most likely be baggy jeans, a knitted sweater and a pair of loafers. I love streetwear fashion but I also love looking artsy.”Fowler said she has become quite passionate about beauty because “I’ve seen how closely linked feeling good in your own skin is to someone’s level of self-worth”.“I think a lot of beauty standards these days make young girls feel like they’re never enough,” she said.L’Oréal’s celebrity-heavy runway event, now in its eighth year, took place during the spring/summer 2026 womenswear showings but is not on Paris fashion week’s official calendar, which is determined by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and only includes fashion brands.Explore more on these topicsBeautyAustralian lifestyleFootball AustraliaMakeupL'OréalnewsShareReuse this content"

Bright says the exhibition’s broad scope allows the many generations of artisans who have worked at Cosprop to reminisce on the productions that inspired them to enter the world of costume design.“Most of the girls in the workroom remember [‘90s BBC series] The House of Eliott, whereas the 50-year-olds sort of remember A Room With a View as their key thing,” he says. “It’s quite nice seeing the different generations relating to different aspects.”Costume Couture highlights a key element of Cosprop’s mission: It makes clothes, not costumes. The distinction is clear for Lodwick. “Cosprop don’t do Bridgerton – Bridgerton is costume. The metaphorical volume has been turned up, the colours, the shapes, the styles, they really have nothing to do with the Regency period,” he says.“Cosprop anchors itself in clothing that is accurate to the time and place, which is why you can look at something like A Room With a View, made 40 years ago, and it hasn’t dated, because it’s authentic 1906 clothing they’re wearing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For most dramas, it’s best to be rooted in reality.”Many of the techniques employed by Cosprop’s staff are no longer in common practice outside the couture ateliers of fashion houses such as Chanel and Dior. Bright says it’s important to keep these techniques alive in an era dominated by cheap machine work “because the past is always what we build the future on – it’s good to have a string that takes us through from the past to the future”, he says.He provides an example of a lavish, beaded mermaid’s dress on display from his film, The Underwater Film. “It embodies all the old craft, but in a slightly new way. I always think it’s important to use the past to tell us more about what we could or should be doing in the future.View image in fullscreenJohn Bright’s quest is to give people ‘a view of another time that isn’t our own’.Photograph: © Paul BulleyLodwick says “a lot of those skills – from alterations to making to millinery – have been lost, and so this one costume house is keeping all those skills alive, so that no matter what project is presented to them, they will apply those [period accurate] techniques, whether it’s Elizabeth or Game of Thrones or Peaky Blinders”.Princess Leia’s Star Wars gold bikini fetches $175,000 at auctionRead moreThe relative historical accuracy of these garments – made using period-accurate materials and techniques – makes it easy to forget that the clothes in Costume Couture aren’t “old”, they just look old. Bright has a large archive of historical clothing; where possible, his employees investigate the structure and design of these clothes up close, giving them first-hand understanding of how to construct recreations so close to the real thing that “you can’t tell what’s original,” says Lodwick.While period dramas are hardly in vogue in the way they may have been in the 1980s and 90s, Lodwick says that there will always be demand for Cosprop’s work. “There will always be ebb and flow – audience taste always changes. There can be a backlash to costume dramas, but as we speak, they’re making a new Pride and Prejudice, they’re making a new Sense and Sensibility, they’re making a new Age of Innocence,” he says. “Perhaps in turbulent times, we kind of need those dramas to take us back to a time where we thought it was all better.”Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsCostume & cultureLondonTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I heard the call, I felt the suffering, I understood the impact on daily life,” he said.Applications for a new premier will be received over the next three days before a new government is formed, he said.The president said he wanted to create space for dialogue with young people, and promised measures to support businesses affected by looting.Thousands of people, many dressed in black and chanting for Rajoelina to resign, have marched in the capital Antananarivo since the demonstrations began last week.View image in fullscreenRiot police use teargas to disperse protesters.Photograph: Zo Andrianjafy/ReutersPolice have responded with a heavy hand, firing teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. More than 100 people have been injured.The UN’s human rights office blamed a “violent response” by security forces for some of the deaths, with other fatalities caused by violence and looting by gangs not associated with the protesters.Madagascar’s ministry of foreign affairs rejected the casualty figures reported by the UN, saying the data did not come from competent national authorities, saying they were “based on rumours or misinformation”.On Monday, protesters gathered at a university where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march towards the city centre, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed.From Colombo to Kathmandu, the furious youth movements toppling entrenched elitesRead morePolice fired teargas to disperse the crowd after authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew last week.The protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign earlier this month, and they have also used similar online organisation tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation.Rajoelina first came to power in a 2009 coup.

He said: “Fires in the park are pretty much contained, but not extinguished and the others running from the park are still out of control. However there is not much in the park left to burn.”He criticised the government for not coordinating with citizens and private organisations sooner. “Why did they take so long to accept our help?

The economy of scale option has passed you.”Earlier on Monday, Namibia’s prime ministerpostedon Facebook: “We appreciate those in the private sector that are assisting in curtailing the fire … Let’s work together: government and private sector. Let’s discourage those engaging in helpless blame game [sic]. Government has deployed resources to ensure the fire is contained.”The government said that an elephant death had been reported but not confirmed, nine antelopes had been killed by the fire and one pangolin rescued.The park’s main attraction for tourists is the ancient Etosha salt pan.

He had expected to be released to his wife and children, who are US citizens.He said he was beaten by immigration and customs enforcement (Ice) agents when he refused to board a US military plane headed to an unspecified location, which turned out to be Ghana.Ice did not respond to a request for comment.View image in fullscreenJohn Mahama, the president of Ghana,has saidhis country is ready to accept more west African nationals deported by the US.Photograph: Ghana Presidency/APUp to 28 people have arrived in the west African nation from the US so far in the deportation programme.Accra disclosed an initial batch of 14, and Meredyth Yoon, a US-based lawyer, said a second plane that could carry the same amount had since landed, though it was unclear how many people were on it.The initial 14 deportees had won protections in US immigration courts preventing their removal to their home countries for fear of persecution, their lawyers said.But Washington was sending them to Ghana as a loophole, Yoon said – with Accra making it clear people would be forwarded on to their home countries.One deportee, a bisexual man from the Gambia, was immediately sent home by Ghanaian authorities and is living in hiding because same-sex relations are criminalised in the socially conservative country, according to court filings.Two Togolese nationals were deported to theTogoborder with Benjamin.

Instead, they were driven to the Aflao border crossing on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lomé. With the cooperation of Togolese border officials, they were taken “through the back door” of the facility and left on the other side.“We are in hiding right now because we have no type of documents, ID, whatsoever,” said Emmanuel, a Liberian national who arrived in the US in the 1990s during the first Liberian civil war and was granted asylum.Emmanuel and Benjamin had been green card holders, and are married to US citizens.

But under prime minister Mark Carney, the standoff has shown signs of easing after the countries announced plans to share intelligence in an effort to combat the rising threat of international crime and extremism.Anandasangaree said the Bishnoi gang had grown emboldened on Canadian soil, creating “a climate of insecurity in [diaspora] communities by targeting them, their prominent community members, businesses and cultural figures” through threats and violence.Anandasangaree’s decision reflects both an escalation in Canada’s fight against powerful and well-organized street gangs – and the challenges of combatting a gang whose leader governs with impunity while behind bars in an Indian jail.Lawrence Bishnoi, the 32-year-old from a small village in Punjab, is now widely regarded as India’s most feared mob boss. He has been confined to a prison cell for nearly a decade, but his sprawling criminal enterprise, which started as a from a small-time racket on a university campus, has morphed into an international syndicate linked to some of the most high-profile killings both in India and abroad.The 2022 murders of Punjabi rapper Sidhu Moose Wala and the Mumbai-based Baba Siddique, an influential 66-year-old politician, are allegedly linked to operatives of the Bishnoi gang.Last year, Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said Indian diplomats hadengaged in criminal activityin Canada including the harassment and targeted killing of Canadian Sikhs linked to the Khalistan separatist movement. Police named the Bishnoi group in their allegations and said investigators believed they were “connected to the agents of the government of India”, operating as part ofNarendra Modi’s strategy to pursue opponents and rivals.Delhi has long rejected the allegations as “strange” and “ludicrous”. But Canadian police say they have a growing list of examples, including the 2023 murder Nijjar in the parking lot of his gurdwara near Vancouver.They also point to Sukhdool Singh Gill who was shot dead in Winnipeg. Gill, a member of the Bambiha gang, was wanted in India on charges of extortion, attempted murder and murder. But Indian officials also said he was also linked to the separatist Khalistan movement.A year later, police on Vancouver Island were called to the house of AP Dhillon, a prominent singer and producer who was born in Punjab and grew up in Canada. The building had been peppered with gunfire, and two vehicles were charred ruins.Footage of the attack –apparently filmed by one of the assailants– was later posted online and shared widely in India. The British Columbia public safety minister called the attack “absolutely outrageous”.RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme said police had uncovered “well over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life” leading police to issue “duty to warn” notices, including to the brother-in-law of New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh.Canadian police have arrested at least eight people, including three believed to have killed Nijjar, in connection with homicide cases and nearly two dozen people in connection with extortion investigations.Under Canada’s criminal code, it is an offence for anyone in the country, and those abroad, to knowingly deal with property owned or controlled by a terrorist and to directly or indirectly provide property knowing that it will be used by or to benefit a terrorist group.The designation of the Bishnoi gang was welcomed by the World Sikh Organization, which said criminal activities are at an “unprecedented high with countless businesses” facing extortion and threats.“While this designation is an important first step that equips law enforcement with stronger tools to confront this menace, it is critical that the true architects of this violence are also held to account.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasIndiaNarendra ModiSikhismnewsShareReuse this content"

At times, his role has superseded that of Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser.The strikes on theVenezuelanboats allegedly carrying narcotics, which the administration has claimed were necessary because interdiction did not work, have been orchestrated through the homeland security council (HSC), which Miller leads as the homeland security adviser.Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity inDonald Trump’s second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.The rise of Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s hardline immigration policyRead moreAs a result, the HSC has taken the lead on engaging the Venezuelan boats, the people said, a situation evidenced by his top deputy, Tony Salisbury, and others being the gatekeepers to details about what boat to strike until they are about to occur.That was the case for instance with the second Venezuelan boathit with hellfire missileson 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.A White House spokesperson said in a statement the strikes were directed by Trump, saying he oversaw all elements of foreign policy. “The entire administration is working together to execute the president’s directive with clear success,” the statement said.But the previously unreported role of Miller – and his massive influence with the president – also explains how striking Venezuelan boats became a major priority, and why Trump has been happy to deploy extraordinary military force to the region.The US military presence presently involves the Iwo Jima amphibious ready group – including the USS San Antonio, USS Iwo Jima, USS Fort Lauderdale carrying 4,500 sailors – and the 22nd marine expeditionary unit, with 2,200 marines, the Guardian haspreviously reported.Miller’s role also opens a window into the dubious legal justification that has been advanced for the strikes, which has been a matter ofdeep controversyamid allegations it amounted to extrajudicial murder in international waters.View image in fullscreenThis screen grab from a video posted by Donald Trump shows what he says is US military forces conducting a strike on a boat carrying alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea on 15 September.Photograph: US President Donald Trump’s TRUTH Social account/AFP/Getty ImagesSince the start of the Venezuela campaign, White House officials have sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article II powers, which allows the president to use military force in self defense in limited engagements.The self defense argument revolves around Trump’s designation ofTren de Araguaas a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Miller in order to defend thedeportations of dozens of Venezuelansearlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of Venezuelan presidentNicolás Maduro– and so the presence of the cartel’s members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.Colombia’s Petro urges ‘criminal trial’ against Trump for Venezuelan strikesRead more“It is a drug cartel that is running Venezuela,” Miller told reporters at the White House earlier this month as he characterized Maduro as the head of the cartel. “It is not a government, it is a drug cartel, a narco-trafficking organization that is running Venezuela.”But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.A divided three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit on 2 September ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Actwere unlawful, because the administration had not met the high burden of showing Tren de Aragua was an arm of the Maduro regime.It remains unclear who signed off on the legal justification for the strikes. Neither the HSC nor the national security council have dedicated legal advisers like in previous administrations, after the White Housestarted restructuringthe national security council in May.But multiple people said it was approved by the Pentagon general counsel, Earl Matthews, who was until recently a Trump White House lawyer; the justice department; and the White House counsel’s office, which has a lawyer tasked with handling national security council matters.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVenezuelaDonald TrumpUS politicsLaw (US)Nicolás MaduroUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

It is small and tawny, with impressive talons and large dark eyes. Kārearea are powerful aerial hunters and watch other birds, lizards or small mammals – sometimes larger than themselves – from a high vantage point before diving at high speed to snatch their prey.“The kārearea is just a stunning bird,” Emma Blackburn, the chair of the Karearea Falcon Trust said. “It’s our only remaining endemic raptor and a really important part of our ecosystem.”Penguins in the pond, kiwi in the back yard: how a city brought back its birdsRead moreThere are between roughly 5,000 to 8,000 kārearea left, according to the Department of Conservation. They live in forests around the country and nest on the ground, typically under boulders or fallen trees. The birds are “very vulnerable” to predation by introduced mammals such as cats, hedgehogs and stoats who feast on their ground-dwelling eggs, Blackburn said.Habitat loss through tree logging and the conversion of tussocked grassland into pasture has also likely reduced populations. Meanwhile, the birds sometimes fly into power lines, buildings and nets over vines and trees, Blackburn said.The bird of the year competition – run by conservation group Forest and Bird – was scandal-free this year but New Zealanders still took to social media to plug their preferred candidates. Each of the 73 contenders had their own campaign manager.The contest was launched 20 years ago to raise awareness about the plight of New Zealand’s native birds, many of which are threatened, on the brink of extinction or already extinct due to the introduction of pests, human activity and declining habitats.New Zealand’s only native mammals are bats and marine species, putting the spotlight on its birds, which are beloved – and often rare.The two-week competition attracted more than 75,000 verified votes from 123 countries. The kārearea, which also won in 2012, joins last year’s winner,the hoihoand the kākāpō as the only birds to have taken out the poll twice.New Zealand’s only alpine parrot, thecheeky keacame second, while the tinykarure, a small “goth” black robin found only on New Zealand’s Chatham Island came third.View image in fullscreenThe endangered kea is the world’s only alpine parrot.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianOver the years, the contest has been subject to scandal, fromcrowning a bat the winnerin 2021, to accusations ofRussian interferencein 2019, and claims Australians attempted to rig the contestin favour of the shagin 2018.In 2023, British-American comedian and talkshow hostJohn Oliverran aglobal campaignfor the threatened pūteketeke – a grunting, puking bird with an unusual repertoire of mating rituals. His efforts were rewarded when the pūteketeke was crowned the 2023 winner.“Behind the memes and mayhem is a serious message,” said Nicola Toki, Forest and Bird’s chief executive.“This year’s top 10 [birds] matches the statistics exactly – 80% of them are in trouble,” she said, adding climate change, habitat loss and predators are pushing species towards extinction.“People fall in love with these birds – and once they know their stories, they care, they advocate and they act.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

And the people who will bear the consequences will be future generations.”That structural challenge involves climbing spending commitments that have to be met with an ever-rising tax take, the burden of which increasingly falls on younger workers.The budget predicts that the deficit dwindles away to nearly zero over the coming decade.But that budget repair only happens because workers pay a steadily higher average share of their wages on income tax, in a phenomenon known as “bracket creep”.A recent analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Office shows that to eventually balance the books, the average worker’s tax rate will rise from 25% now to 27% by the mid-2030s.Assuming no further tax relief, total personal income tax as a share of overall government revenue will climb from 48% to 53% over the coming decade.This government or future ones will have to grapple with telling voters they need to accept higher taxes or lower spending on services, Yeaman says.“Ultimately there’s a choice to be made.”Patrick Commins is Guardian Australia’s economics editorExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyJim ChalmersKaty Gallagher (Australian politician)Australian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

If neither party withdraws before Cop30 ends in November, hosting rights automatically revert to Bonn in Germany.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterIt is unclear how the impasse will be resolved or what the new solutions could be.In 2019, then UK prime minister Boris Johnson used a package of incentives to convince Turkey to pull out of the bidding contest for Cop26, including promising to back its candidates in other international events and to push countries on reclassifying Turkey under the UN convention for climate aid.Johnson also reportedly agreed to support Turkey’s bid to host Cop31.Keir Starmer’s Labour governmenthas since publicly backed Australia’s bid.Albanese will need to resolve the standoff with Turkey if Australia is to host Cop31Read moreAnthony Albanese’s efforts to meet the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in New York failed, and the government has ruled out using taxpayer funds to effectively buy off the opposition.Turkey’s first lady, Emine Erdoğan, is considered a key player in her country’s bid. A longtime environmental campaigner, she is reportedly eager for Turkey to host the summit in Antalya, the resort city where world leaders met for the 2015 G20 summit.Australia wants delegates to meet in Adelaide, in a partnership with Pacific Island nations.Kurum said Turkey planned to officially submit its nationally determined contribution to carbon emission reductions and “successfully complete consultations for Cop31” before this year’s summit in Belém, Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We believe that hosting the Cop presidency in our country would also be an opportunity for the world.”Bowen said the Albanese government respected Turkey’s desire to host the event.“While there is strong support for Australia and the Pacific’s bid, the process requires consensus, and so we remain in discussions with Türkiye towards a mutually acceptable outcome, in consultation with our Pacific family,” he said.Bowen and Albanese have declined to discuss the status of negotiations with Turkey in recent weeks, other than to say they remained a work in progress. Both describe Australia’s support among partner countries as overwhelming. Australia has at least 23 votes among the critical 28-country Western European and Others group whose turn it is to host the summit.Guardian Australia revealed last weekBowen had appeared with Emine Erdoğanat a major environment event.

Andrew Hastie and the rise of the ‘Maga right’Read more“[Abandoning net zero] is unpopular with women and it’s unpopular with young people and I don’t think that’s news to anyone,” she told Guardian Australia.“It’s why people walked away from us in metropolitan areas. We can pretend that other things are afoot but that was the reality.”The shadow energy minister,Dan Tehan, is reviewing the Liberals’ energy policyand commitment to net zero, after Ley put all of the party’s policies on the table for examination following the federal election.Butseveral conservative voices, including Hastie and the Nationals senators Matt Canavan and Michael McCormack, are not waiting for that process to play out, and have publicly called for net zero to be scrapped.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe Liberal senator Jonno Duniam also warned that there would be a “mass exodus” from the Coalition frontbench if the party agreed to a net zero policy “by any cost”.Jane Hume, who was relegated from the frontbench by Ley, has become one of the most outspoken advocates for net zero, and the push to bring more women into the party.The former shadow finance minister said the party should not be focusing on the seats it now holds, but the 33 seats it needs to win back.“The electorate has told us time and time again at elections, and even in the most recent Newspoll, that they care about climate and want to see action,” she said.“We need to actually show those Australians that not only have we heard the message, but that we agree with it.”The former cabinet minister Karen Andrews also called on the party to take climate action seriously if it wants more women to join its ranks.“If they [Liberal party] want to regain government, they are going to have to take seriously the issues that women and young people, but particularly women, are concerned about,” she said.“One of those issues that is front of mind for so many women is climate change.”Andrews campaigned for her successor, Leon Rebello, during the election, and said climate was a key issue women raised with her, in a seat that also saw a challenge from a teal independent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eight whales were tangled in shark nets in 2024.Crisafulli insists on more shark nets to protect human lives despite trapped mother and baby whaleRead moreProf Rob Harcourt, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University, said late September and early October was “peak whale” on the east coast as humpbacks made their southerly migration towards their Antarctic feeding grounds.While whale entanglements in nets were “horrible”, Harcourt said the higher number this year likely reflected the growing humpback population, as well as the position of an ocean current bringing them closer to shore.The recovery of humpback whales – with numbers reaching 50,000 this year – had been a success story, he said.0:58Humpback whale and calf caught in shark net off Noosa – video“With that increasing population, you have a lot more bubs born” – and more that could get caught in shark nets.The location of the east Australian current – a strong ocean current running north-to-south along Australia’s east coast – was likely a contributing factor, he said.AUniversity of Sunshine Coast studyin 2020 found entanglements in shark nets were more likely to occur when the inner edge of that current shifted closer to the shore.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe study’s lead author, Dr Jessica Bolin, said the current’s inner edge formed a large thermal front – a boundary between warm and cool water – which whales may use as a natural navigation cue during their migrations.“The [east Australian current] is a warm, powerful and highly dynamic ocean current that changes position from day to day,” she said. “When that front hugs the coastline, humpbacks may be following it inshore, which unfortunately also raises their chances of encountering shark nets.“The Sunshine Coast is also a pinch point on their migration route, with multiple shark nets placed right across that corridor,” she said.In the worst case, entanglements could cause drowning, Harcourt said. But even minor incidents could have long-term effects on the animal due to the high levels of stress.“The only way to stop entanglement, really, is to take the nets out,” he said.Other approaches such as acoustic deterrents had been trialled but were ineffective, he said.On Sunday,Queensland’s premier, David Crisafulli, saidthe state was “not for turning” on its plan to expand shark netting after reports of another mother and calf trapped off Rainbow Beach. He said the state would not put protecting whales “at the expense of one single human”.The total number of whales affected each year in Queensland fluctuated between 1 and 15 (in 2022), according to QFish data. QFish is part of the state’s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.Twelve whales had been affected so far in the 2025 migration season, which has four weeks still to go.A spokesperson for Queensland’s Department of Primary Industries said all whales caught in nets had been released “safely and alive”.Dr Olaf Meynecke, who researches marine mammals at Griffith University, said the majority of entanglements used to occur near the Gold Coast but have shifted towards the Sunshine Coast since 2020.Most involved mothers and calves, he said. “We’ve got higher calving rates, and that increases entanglements.”A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Primary Industries said its 51 shark nets were fitted with acoustic “whale alarms” and “dolphin pingers” designed to deter marine mammals away from the nets.Smart drumlines are designed to break apart if a whale swims through them, which occurred in 22 cases this year. However in June a whale became tangled in one off Nobby’s beach in Newcastle.A federal environment department spokesperson said humpback whales were listed as a migratory species and protected under federal environment laws.“However, as shark nets and subsequent cetacean entanglements occur within state and territory jurisdictions, incident response activities are a responsibility of the relevant state or territory government.”Explore more on these topicsWhalesAustralian climate and environment in focusQueenslandMarine lifeWildlifeCetaceansAnimal behaviourOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

French officialshave previouslysaid they were investigating Russia’s role in destabilising operations that have stoked social tensions and sown division in France.On Monday, Serbia’s interior ministry said the 11 people arrested were Serbian nationals. They were believed to have been trained by another suspect who was “acting under the instructions of a foreign intelligence service” and who remained on the run, it added. The ministry did not specify the nationality of the other suspect.The ministry alleged the group had been involved in acts that took place between April and September this year, citing the defacing of a French Holocaust memorial and three synagogues with green paint, the placing of pigs’ heads outside Paris-area mosques and “concrete skeletons” inscribed with messages left at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate.“Their objective was also to spread ideas advocating and inciting hatred, discrimination and violence based on differences,” the ministry said.View image in fullscreenThe Agoudas Hakehilos synagogue in Paris, which was defaced with green paint in May.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersThe arrests came weeks after the latest incident prompted outrage across France.

The two people involved were believed to have crossed into Belgium a few hours after the acts.France ‘investigating whether Russia behind’ graffiti on Holocaust memorialRead moreThe prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the tactics used to target the mosques echoed other incidents thathad rocked Francein the past two years, from the painting of about 60 stars of David on buildings in Paris and districts on the outskirts, and the red hands spray-painted on the wall of the city’s Holocaust memorial.“So we could be convinced that these incidents are acts of interference,”she told broadcaster BFMTVearlier this month. “Why? Because they have similar modus operandi.”She said the acts were carried out by eastern Europeans who often take photos to document what they have done and send these images to people beyond France’s borders.French police had detained several suspects in connection with these attacks. Three Serbian nationals were detained in May, linked to the green paint used to vandalise synagogues and a Holocaust memorial, while four Bulgarians are expected to stand trial next month over the red-hand symbols.After the appearance of stars of David on Paris’s buildings sparked fears of antisemitism, police arrested a Moldovan couple and prosecutors said they were investigating whether the graffiti had been carried out at the behest of someone abroad.An alleged handler, a pro-Russian Moldovan businessman, was later identified amid suspicions that Russia’s security services were behind that campaign, according to Agence France-Presse.With contribution from Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsSerbiaFranceGermanyIslamophobiaAntisemitismEuropeReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

That compared with 24.26% for a Moscow-leaning alliance of Soviet-nostalgic parties led by the former president Igor Dodon, according to results published on the election commission’s website.View image in fullscreenA PAS supporter checks the election results on his phone.Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/APPAS outperformed pre-election polls, which predicted it would stay the largest party but risk losing its majority – a result that could have curbed Sandu’s push to deliver EU membership within a decade.The result marks a significant victory for Sandu, who has staked her presidency on a pro-European course and accused Russia of deploying unprecedented underhand tactics to sway voters in the impoverished country squeezed between Ukraine and Romania.Power is shared in Moldova between the directly elected president and a prime minister appointed by parliament, with Igor Grosu, the PAS leader and a close ally of Sandu, expected to take the post.The results will be greeted with a sigh of relief in Brussels and other European capitals, where there had been fears that Moscow could regain a foothold in a strategically vital region as it steps up its hybrid campaign across the continent.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, wrote on X: “Moldova, you’ve done it again. No attempt to sow fear or division could break your resolve.“You made your choice clear: Europe. Democracy. Freedom. Our door is open. And we will stand with you every step of the way.”Sunday’s election is a major boost for those hoping Moldova joins the EU, but the path to membership remains uncertain. The country still needs to push through a series of reforms and address the unresolved issue of Transnistria, the breakaway region where 1,500 Russian troops are stationed.Results chartOther European leaders struck a similar congratulatory tone. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on X: “Despite attempts at interference and pressure, the choice of the people of the Republic of Moldova has asserted itself with force.“France stands by Moldova in its European project and in its momentum of freedom and sovereignty.”This year’s parliamentary campaign was overshadowed by mounting allegations of Russian interference. Moldovan authorities accuse Moscow offunnelling millions of dollars into pro-Russian parties, vote-buying schemes and propaganda campaigns aimed at stoking anti-western sentiment.Two pro-Russian parties were barred from the election on Friday over financing irregularities, a move that angered the opposition and drew sharp criticism from Moscow.Polling stations on Sunday closed after a turbulent day marked by officials reporting attempts to disrupt the vote, including cyber-attacks on election systems and fake bomb threats at polling sites abroad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ballots of Moldova’s sizeable diaspora, which tends to back closer ties with Europe,were expected to play a decisive role in the outcome.The Kremlin, meanwhile, accused Moldova of curbing the voting rights of its citizens in Russia by providing only three polling stations there, compared with far more in Europe and the US.Dodon, who heads the Patriotic bloc opposing Sandu’s pro-European course, rejected the results, saying his allies had documented electoral violations and were compiling evidence. He joined other opposition parties in staging a protest in Chișinău on Monday.View image in fullscreenPeople attend the protest organised by Igor Dodon in Chișinău.Photograph: Paul Dza/SIPA/ShutterstockMoscow has consistently rejected claims of interference in Moldova, labelling them “anti-Russian” and “unsubstantiated”. Yet the outcome will come as a setback for the Kremlin, which Moldovan officials say invested unprecedented time and resources in supporting pro-Russian parties.A western intelligence official said that in recent months Moscow had made Moldova its “key foreign policy priority after Ukraine”, noting that the Kremlin had reshuffled the team handling Moldova earlier this year to pursue a more aggressive strategy.Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova has oscillated between building closer ties with Brussels and clinging to Soviet-era relations with Moscow.Sandu is a former World Bank official who waselected as president in 2020 on a wave of anti-corruption sentiment.Her government oversaw a referendum last October in which Moldovans voted narrowly to enshrine EU membership as a constitutional goal. On the same day, Sandu was re-elected as president for a four-year term.She will now hope to tackle her administration’s main vulnerability: the economy. Inflation remains stubbornly high, emigration shows no sign of slowing and GDP growth has been modest.Her supporters argue these problems stem largely from external shocks, with Russia’s war in Ukraine disrupting trade routes, triggering an energy crisis and forcing Moldova to take in tens of thousands of refugees.Explore more on these topicsMoldovaRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In Sunday’s parliamentary elections, the pro-EU party of president Maia Sandu won a convincing victory, confirming the westward path of this former Soviet republic of 2.4 million people.With nearly all votes counted, Sandu’s ruling Action and Solidarity party hadsecured 50.03% of the vote, compared with 24.26% for the pro-Russian Patriotic bloc. The solid win came despite widespread reports of Russian meddling and a series of shocks that could have toppled any incumbent government.Since the last parliamentary elections in 2021, Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine has led to the settling of 135,000 people in Moldova – the highest per capita number of Ukrainian refugees in the world – and an energy price shock that sent inflation spiralling to a 34% peak. Despite these headwinds, the PAS saw its share of the vote drop by less than 3% compared with 2021.For Sandu, a former World Bank official who wasre-elected Moldova’s president in 2024, it is an emphatic victory. She wants Moldova to join the EU by 2030. With a secure parliamentary majority, rather than the divided coalition many pollsters had predicted, it should be easier to push through the demanding political and economic reforms required to join the union.It was an equally important result for the EU, which has invested political capital in Moldova. The European Commission has pledged €1.9bn (£1.7bn) in grants and cheap loans to Moldova to build infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals and internet cables to boost the economy and speed its arrival into the European single market. Last month, the leaders of Germany, France and Poland made a high-profilejoint visit to Moldova on the anniversary of its independenceto express solidarity.But sighs of relief are tempered by understanding that this is only one chapter in a long story. “The fight is not over,” Moldova’s former prime minister Natalia Gavrilița told a security conference in Warsaw on Monday. “Of course, we are very determined to carry out the reforms with all the challenges and capacity constraints and so on,” she said.Moldova’s election result bolsters move towards EU and away from MoscowRead moreClara Volintiru, the head of the Bucharest office of the German Marshall Fund, said it was clear that electoral mobilisation in favour of the pro-Moscow Patriotic bloc had not been massive. But that did not mean Russia’s “tactics of manipulation and interference” had failed, she cautioned, with Russian interference focused on the full electoral cycle, not just Sunday’s vote.“The goal of the Russian interference is to amplify societal distrust, to diminish the confidence that the Moldovan public has not just in its government and president, but also in its European future,” she said.In the run-up to the vote, Moldovan authorities accused Russia of spending hundreds of millions of euros in an attempt to tilt the results.Dozens of men were arrested, accused of travelling to Serbia for training in how to break through police cordons and resist security officers. Meanwhile, aReuters investigationfound that Orthodox priests in the highly religious country had been treated to all-expenses paid trips to Russia and received sums up to €1,200 (£1,000) – more than double the average monthly wage – for promoting anti-western narratives.The Kremlin has denied meddling in Moldova’s elections.Volintiru said Moldova was “a laboratory” where Russia was testing “a wide array of tools and tactics” that could be deployed in other European democracies. The analyst cited unpublished polling from the Moldovan government’s StratCom centre she had knowledge of, which showed that 70% of the population felt an elevated level of anxiety. “There is a widespread anxiety and fear across the population. And this is the end game of Russian interference, not just to promote one or another political option, but to make sure that the entire democratic process is challenged or there is doubt laying over it.”Against this backdrop, Moldova is pressing ahead with the ambitious goal of joining the EU by 2030. It is a high bar. During the past 18 years the EU has admitted only one country, Croatia, amid widespread mistrust of the enlargement process in western Europe, especially France, Denmark and the Netherlands.Many politicians contend that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine changed everything. France’s Europe minister, Benjamin Haddad, told the Warsaw Security Forum on Monday that after “a form of scepticism about enlargement in France … there has been a shift in the last few years”, as people realise that extending the bloc’s influence further to Ukraine, Moldova and western Balkans “is a geopolitical necessity that will export security and stability for Europe” and present an economic opportunity.That does not mean the path is clear. Moldova’s EU membership talks are stalled, because Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly government refuses to open substantive negotiations with Ukraine. Ukraine’s and Moldova’s EU applications are informally linked, meaning one objection can stymie both.The European Council president, António Costa, who chairs EU summits, is trying to solve the problem by dropping the requirement for every step in the negotiating process to be approved by unanimity. Big milestones, such as opening and closing negotiations, would still require all members to agree, but other decisions – such as opening talks on EU policies – could proceed with a majority vote, the Guardian understands. In this way Costa hopes to keep momentum for Moldova, Ukraine and western Balkan countries seeking to join the EU.Volintru believes enlargement has become a question of political will, not simply a bureaucratic process. “The geopolitical pressures are very high and I think Brussels understands very well the stakes that are involved.”Explore more on these topicsMoldovaRussiaEuropean UnionEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Palestinians.Trump and Netanyahu to Hamas: accept Gaza peace plan or face consequencesRead moreThe plan does not require a full Israeli withdrawal ahead of the release of the hostages. Rather, Israeli forces would withdraw to an agreed upon line, insideGaza, to prepare for a hostage release. The plan says that all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended during the release process and battle lines will remain frozen until “conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal”.Once all hostages are released, amnesty will be granted to members of Hamas – the Islamist military group that Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly vowed to destroy – who agree to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons.Those who wish to leave Gaza will be given safe passage to countries who have agreed to receive them.The 20-point plan envisages Gaza as “a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbours”. In a separate point, it says the territory will be “redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough”.Vitally, and in defiance of the vision of some of Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners, Israel will not occupy or annex the territory, which was home to 21 Israeli settlements before their inhabitants were withdrawn in 2005. Nor will anyone be forced to leave Gaza, the plan promises. Those who wish to leave will be allowed to do so freely and permitted to return.Hamas will not be permitted any role, “directly or indirectly”, in the future governance of the territory.As to the immediate future, the plan provides for “full aid” to be sent to Gaza, parts of which are suffering from famine and regular deaths from starvation.“Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,” the plan says.The restoration of aid will mean the reopening of the border crossing at the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which has been largely razed by Israel.With Hamas banished, Gaza’s governance would be passed to a temporary transitional body in the form of a “technocratic and apolitical Palestinian committee”, which would in turn be overseen and supervised by an international “Board of Peace”, headed byDonald Trump. The board would include other heads of state and international officials, including the former British prime minister, Tony Blair.That body would organize and set the framework for funding the redevelopment of Gaza while the Palestinian Authority, the political entity nominally in charge of Palestinian affairs in the West Bank, had undergone a process of reform.A panel of experts will be convened to create what the plan calls a “Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize” the territory, which the US president has previously envisioned being transformed into a “riviera” with a string of hi-tech megacities.Mention of the thorny issue of a future Palestinian state, which Netanyahu vehemently opposes, is left until the end of the plan, with “an interfaith dialogue process” to be set up to promote “the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence”.The aim is to “try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis”.Even then, a Palestinian state is held out only as a vague possibility. “While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people,” the plan says.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpTrump administrationIsraelForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has sunk a lot of political capital in bringing peace to the Middle East after “thousands of years”, as he put it. There is apparent deep and wide regional support and, seemingly, that of the Israeli prime minister.But this is less a detailed roadmap than a rough back of an envelope sketch that allows an equal chance of getting badly lost as reaching the desired destination.First, Hamas is unlikely to look kindly on a plan that explicitly says it has to give up all or most of its arms and watch as a technocratic “Council of Peace” headed by Trump himself takes overGaza. The offer of an amnesty for members of the militant Islamist organisation who accept peaceful coexistence with Israel is hardly attractive, even if the group could claim credit for sufficient aid finally getting into the devastated Palestinian territory, delivered by the UN and the Red Crescent.Trump and Netanyahu to Hamas: accept Gaza peace plan or face consequencesRead moreCan Qatar or others lean on Hamas hard enough to get a grudging even temporary acquiescence to a programme that will basically eliminate the organisation as a political and military force, at least in Gaza? Will its leaders be convinced by the argument that the 50-odd Israeli hostages held by the group there are now a liability because they provide a pretext for Israel to continue the campaign? Will Hamas military commanders in the territory agree with its political leaders in Qatar or Istanbul? None of this is certain.Arab countries have committed to demilitarise Gaza, Trump says, which is a major and positive step if true. But there is no indication of what this means in practice. Will they all send troops, or money, or both? None has so far made explicit pledges of sending soldiers to complete what would be a hellishly complex and dangerous task. To organise this would take months, and offer plenty of opportunity for squabbling and recriminations.The linkage of Israeli withdrawal to the pace and extent of disarmament and demilitarisation is also to Israel’s advantage. Any land that is surrendered has been flattened by Israel’s relentless offensive. A slow withdrawal costs little. Israel may eventually pull back to a perimeter, but how long this might take is also unclear. The published maps are vague. All of this is a very long way from Hamas’s demands in recent negotiations. Nor has there been any promise of anything approximating a Palestinian state.As Netanyahu and Trump both made sure to emphasise, if things don’t proceed as they want, and the Arab countries cannot push Hamas to do their will, then the Israeli military will go back into action with full US backing. Once Hamas has handed over the hostages – within 72 hours of an agreement coming into effect – there is little that might stop Israel reneging on any promises. In March, Israel broke a promise to move to a second scheduled phase of the two-month ceasefire, which could have led to a definitive end to the conflict.Is Trump’s new Palestine plan a breakthrough or diplomatic mirage?Read moreAnd, yes, the idea of getting regional normalisation back on track and building on the Abraham Accords is attractive, but the last two years have shown quite how much this prospect weighs in the balance for Israeli policymakers.With divisions deepening and anti-war sentiment spreading at home as well as increasing isolation and a string of diplomatic setbacks, Netanyahu may have made the calculation that more war would bring incremental gains at significant cost and now is the moment to declare victory.He now begins a new campaign. Throughout the conflict Netanyahu, who is threatened with jail on corruption charges, has made his own hold on political power a key objective. This time, it appears he thinks he can ride out the opposition of far-right members of his coalition who could quit the ruling coalition and bring down the government. He may call their bluff, or he may have the numbers in the Knesset, Israel’s national assembly, to keep power anyway. There must be new elections within a year or so, which he could win despite poor showings in the polls.For now, Trump has got all but one of the main actors in this appalling conflict to sign on to his plan, or at least plug his somewhat sketchy directions into their collective geopolitical satnavs. This is an achievement. But much hard work is still to come: Even if Hamas is persuaded, there are a host of details to be agreed and then set down and then, somehow, implemented. This is a journey that could take a very long time, and any kind of arrival, let alone a safe and comfortable one, is far from guaranteed.Explore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Mahmoud Mardawi, a Hamas official, said the group had not even received the plan at the time of the announcement, the Reuters news agency reported. It was later briefed that Qatari and Egyptian mediators met with Hamas on Monday evening to provide the group with the peace plan.Both Trump and Netanyahu made clear that they were not offering Hamas a choice in the matter. If the group refused, Trump told reporters, “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.“But I hope that we’re going to have a deal for peace, and if Hamas rejects the deal … Bibi, you’d have our full backing to do what you would have to do.”The Israeli prime minister said ominously: “If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.”Netanyahu added: “We’d prefer the easy way but it has to be done. All these goals must be achieved because we didn’t fight this horrible fight, sacrifice the finest of our young men to have Hamas stay inGazaand threaten us again and again and again with these horrific massacres.”Neither man took questions from reporters. Earlier the White House released the 20-point plan aimed at ending the war in the Palestinian territory that erupted after the deadly attack on 7 October 2023.It calls for a ceasefire, a swap of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, Hamas disarmament and a transitional government led by an international body.Trump said: “If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case more than 72 hours … The hostages are coming back.”The plan also demands that Hamas lay down its arms and renounce governance in the strip. Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence would be given amnesty to remain in Gaza or they would be granted safe passage to receiving countries.Trump’s plan would also establish a temporary governing board that would be headed by Trump himself and include Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Postwar Gaza authority potentially led by Tony Blair ‘would sideline Palestinians’Read moreTrump said: “To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for a new international oversight body – the Board of Peace – which will be headed, not at my request … by a gentleman known as President Donald J Trump of the United States.”Earlier, a leaked 21-page draft document, seen by the Guardian and Haaretz inIsrael, showed that a postwar Gaza governing authority would sideline key Palestinian political figures while giving significant authority to its chair on most key issues.The president caused uproar earlier this year whenhe spoke of turning Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”that involved massive financial investment and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.Monday’s 20-point plan does state that “a Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East”.But it also notes: “No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return.”At the joint press briefing in the state dining room, against a backdrop of US and Israel flags, Trump said they were “beyond very close” to forging the elusive peace deal and that he hoped Hamas militants would also accept it.“We’re not quite finished. We have to get Hamas, but I think they’re going to be able to do that. So now it’s time for Hamas to accept the terms of the plan that we’ve put forward today.”Trump added: “I also want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction that we’ve seen for so many years, decades, even centuries and begin a new chapter of security, peace and prosperity for the entire region.”In Netanyahu’s fourth visit to the White House since Trump returned to office in January, the rightwing Israeli leader was looking to shore up his country’s most important relationship aftera slew of western leaders formally embraced Palestinian statehoodlast week in defiance of the US and Israel.Trump, who sharply criticised the recognition moves as a prize for Hamas, was seeking Netanyahu’s agreement despite Israel’s misgivings on parts of the plan.Washington presented its peace plan to Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the UN general assembly last week, and Trump’s main objective on Monday was to try to close the remaining gaps with Netanyahu. He appeared to have succeeded.Netanyahu, who has an international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant against him for alleged crimes including starvation as a method of warfare, used the White House platform to lavish praise on Trump and list his demands.“I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” he said. “It will bring back to Israel all our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities, end its political rule, and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”He added: “Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarized. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter, for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful, civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas nor by the Palestinian Authority.”But Hamas’s apparent absence from the negotiations has raised questions about the prospects for the latest initiative.In a statement late on Monday, Blair said: “President Trump has put down a bold and intelligent plan which, if agreed, can end the war, bring immediate relief to Gaza, the chance of a brighter and better future for its people, while ensuring Israel’s absolute and enduring security and the release of all hostages.“It offers us the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering, and I thank President Trump for his leadership, determination and commitment.”Netanyahu earlier extended a formal apology to his Qatari counterpart fora recent military strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emiratethat infuriated Arab leaders and triggered rare criticism by the US of Israel.Netanyahu made the call to Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, as he met with Trump, according to the White House.Trump described the exchange between the Israeli and Qatari leader as a “heart-to-heart” call.“As a first step, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret that Israel’s missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,” the White House said in a statement. “He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future.”Netanyahu added to reporters: “Israel was targeting terrorists, it wasn’t targeting Qatar, and of course we regretted the loss of the Qatari citizen who wasn’t our target.”Late on Monday the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt welcomed Trump’s announcement in a joint statement.The proposal was also welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which said it supported Trump’s “determined efforts” to end the war.But the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group chief, Ziad al-Nakhala, said he considered the plan a “recipe to blow up the region”. The group, which also has taken hostages, is an Iran-backed ally of Hamas.Previous US-backed ceasefire efforts have fallen apart due to a failure to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas is completely dismantled.The White House talks came as Israeli tanks on Monday thrust deeper into the heart of Gaza City. Israel has launched one of its biggest offensives of the war this month, with Netanyahu saying he aims to wipe out Hamas in its final redoubts. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000 since 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It also proposes a Gaza investment promotion and economic development authority involving “public-private partnerships and blended finance instruments” aimed at delivering “commercially viable returns” for investors.The administration of Gaza would also split off from the Palestinian Authority in theWest Bank. The Guardian has confirmed the document – labelled confidential – is genuine and was drawn up in the last fortnight.No Palestinian figures are mentioned by name in the document but it lists several prominent outsiders for potential roles, including the Egyptian billionaireNaguib Sawiris, Marc Rowan of Apollo Global Management, and Aryeh Lightstone of the Abraham Peace Accords Institute, a former senior adviser to Donald Trump’s first ambassador to Israel, David Friedman.Trump’s plan for Gaza is ambitious but peace is far from guaranteedRead moreSources close to those behind the document suggested that the names had been included for illustrative purposes without the individuals’ permissions.Washington backing plan for Tony Blair to head transitional Gaza authorityRead moreThe draft for the so-called Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita) puts substantial flesh on reporting of the ideas that Blair and Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushnerare reported tohave been circulating, including that Blair “wants” the role of running Gaza.Palestinian critics who have seen the proposal – and who have long viewed Blair with suspicion – warned that Gita would be a “disaster” forPalestine, creating an alternative jurisdiction in Gaza to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City on Monday.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPAThe proposal was leaked before a planned Oval Office meeting Netanyahu and Trump when the US president is expected to lay out his “plan” for Gaza’s postwar governance and reconstruction. Trump is alsoexpected to demanda permanent ceasefire in Gaza, leaving Netanyahu with few options.Aspreviously reported, Gita would operate initially out of El-Arish in Egypt, close to Gaza’s southern border, and be led by a council of seven to 10 members approved by the UN security council.Only one of that group is envisaged as being Palestinian, “from the business or security sector”, the leaked document says, while it lists potential “leading international figures with executive or financial experience”.It would also include “a strong representation of Muslim members to secure regional legitimacy and cultural credibility”, suggesting figures perhaps nominated by Gulf states orEgypt.The council, the document makes clear, would issue “binding decisions” and approve legislation and major appointments and report to the UN security council.It is clear that the document sees the chair as holding overarching authority within the body, setting the “political and strategic direction for Gita” in consultation with the board and the Palestinian Authority. The chair would also lead diplomacy and strategic security diplomacy with external actors includingIsrael, Egypt and the US. There is no mention in this latter context of the Palestinian Authority.“You would have a council with a majority of foreign members legislating for Palestinians inGaza,” said Xavier Abu Eid, a former member of the PLO’s diplomatic negotiating team. “There is already suspicion of Tony Blair because of the Palestinian experience when he was the Quartet representative [of the UN, US, EU and Russia mediation group].“But the biggest is over what it means for Palestine as a single political entity, something that was recognised even by Israel in the Oslo Accords. This plan effectively legally separates Gaza from the West Bank and does nothing to explain how they will remain part of the same territory.”A source who spoke to the Guardian said that while Blairhad been involved in talks, the former UK prime minister was clear that “the guiding principle is that Gaza is for Gazans, with no displacement of the population”.“We do not support or endorse any proposal that involves the displacement of Gazans,” the source said, adding: “The document states that any transitional governing body for Gaza would ultimately return authority to the Palestinian Authority, as part of a pathway toward a Palestinian state.”View image in fullscreenTony Blair is understood to have met recently with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe leaking of the draft plan follows reports in recent days that Blair has been involved in discussions about leading a postwar transitional authority in Gaza.Under the proposal, said to have backing from the White House, Blair would lead a governing authority supported by the UN and Gulf nations before handing back control to Palestinians. His office said he would not support any proposal that displaced the people of Gaza.Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative and a critic of Blair, told the Washington Post on Monday: “We’ve been under British colonialism already. He has a negative reputation here. If you mention Tony Blair, the first thing people mention is the Iraq war.”While Blair is understood to have recently met the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Trump earlier this summer, it is unclear how much the Palestinians were briefed on the proposal.The UK deputy prime minister, David Lammy, until recently the foreign secretary, said he had no idea if Blair would take such a role.“I would say that it’s hugely important that there is a transition to a Palestinian authority,” he told a fringe event at the Labour party conference.“And clearly any authority, in terms of its administration, the policing of Gaza or rebuilding of Gaza, would have to have the confidence of Palestinian people, and so I suspect it would have to include leadership that they can identify with.“I’ve seen speculation about Tony. I have no idea whether that is a serious proposition. I suspect Tony might play a part, or has a role potentially to play, but there’s quite a lot of dimensions as to the governance of Gaza afterwards.”Trump’s proposal to stop the war in Gaza calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages within 48 hours, and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territory, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan.Blair, who took the UK into the Iraq war in 2003, served as Middle East envoy for the quartet of international powers – the US, EU, Russia and UN – after stepping down as prime minister.He focused on economic development in the Palestinian territories and laying the groundwork for a two-state solution.In August, he joined a White House meeting with Trump to discuss plans for the territory, which the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said were “comprehensive”.Additional reporting by Peter Walker and Frances MaoQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Annual food price inflation, which has been steadily accelerating all year, levelled out at 4.2% in September – the same rate as in August.Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said:“Households are finding shopping increasingly expensive. The impact on retailers and their supply chain of both global factors and higher national insurance and wage costs is playing out in prices for consumers.”She said high energy and labour costs, including the government’srise in employers’ national insurance payments (NICs), continued to push up input prices for many producers, including farmers, with dairy and beef prices remaining high.However, Mike Watkins, the head of retailer and business insight at NIQ, said low consumer confidence meant retailers were likely to have to continue offering promotions and deals to ring up sales.“With inflationary pressures persisting, many shoppers remain concerned about their personal finances and are becoming increasingly price-sensitive,” he said.The BRC figures are the latest indication thatfood inflation has peaked, with retailers expecting it to ease late this year or from early 2026.However, earlier this month the Bank of England held off from implementing a cut in interest rates on fears that rising food prices were putting upwards pressure on headline inflation.Rachel Reeves has hinted thattax rises or spending cutscould be on the way as the chancellor faces having to find up to £30bn to plug a spending gap amid slower than hoped for growth and expected changes to official calculations on UK productivity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because growth is the pound in your pocket. It is more money for trips, meals out, the little things that bring joy to all our lives, the peace of mind that comes from economic security.“But it is also the antidote to division. That’s the most important aspect of national renewal. The way you grow an economy, not just how much, but who and where benefits that can either build a nation or it can pull it apart.“And in the world we must face the threats we must defeat, Britain needs an economy that unites, every person, every community, every great nation on these islands. Standing together, as so often in our past, facing down the threats of a volatile world.”His speech was released after Rachel Reeves on Monday said the country would face “further tests” in the months ahead, adding that her choices atnext month’s budgetwould be made “all the harder” by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage done to the economy by the Conservatives.The chancellor faces the prospect of having to find up to £30bn in tax rises or spending cuts next month if,as expected, the Office for Budget Responsibility cuts its forecast for future productivity growth to match the consensus of other experts.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves warned that the country would face ‘further tests’Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Monday evening Reeves signalled she would raise gambling taxes at the budget. “I do think there’s a case for gambling firms to pay more,” she told ITV.Darren Jones, the prime minister’s chief secretary, refused to rule out the possibility the government would break Labour’s manifesto pledge to not increase income tax, VAT or national insurance rates. “The manifesto stands today because decisions haven’t been taken yet,” he told Sky News. “I’m not ruling anything out, and I’m not ruling anything in.”However, Reeves also urged Labour conference in Liverpool to “have faith” that things would get better, despite the difficult economic landscape. Taking on Farage’s Reform UK directly, she said she wanted to “silence the nagging voices of decline”.The chancellor also warned Labour figures“peddling the idea”that the government could abandon fiscal responsibility to free up more money for public spending were “dangerously wrong” and risked serious damage to the economy.In a veiled criticism of Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor who has urged the government to take a bolder approach to the economy, she said the party should be “honest” about what calls to borrow more would mean.However, Burnham, a former chief secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, rejected suggestions that he was “hopeless” on the economy or had “no idea about how to make it add up” as he defended his recent interventions in national politics.He told the Guardian’sPolitics Weeklypodcast: “You need strong fiscal rules, but it doesn’t mean in exactly their current form … If there was an investment that could be shown in a short order to reduce current spending, then I think that is an investment that can prudently be made.”Burnham also sought to address the “sense I’m completely out for myself, disloyal”, citing behind-the-scenes work he had been doing over the summer to help to progress the government’s Hillsborough legislation.“It sticks in my throat somewhat for people who have just arrived on the scene to be throwing some of the comments at me that they have done,” he said. “I did everything that I possibly could have to make this conference a success.”Burnham, whose leadership ambitions have dominated the conference, insisted that he had been seeking to provoke a wider debate within Labour about the party’s direction ahead of local elections next May, as the government faces a sustained lag behind Reform UK in the polls.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, arrives at a fringe meeting in Liverpool.Photograph: Jon Super/AP“While the government’s done good things, I don’t think it’s come together yet as that powerful story of the future of Britain,” the Labour mayor said.In his speech, Starmer is expected to warn that Britain faces a “defining choice” between “decency and division”. He will say: “We can all see our country faces a choice, a defining choice. Britain stands at a fork in the road.“We can choose decency. Or we can choose division. Renewal or decline. A country, proud of its values, in control of its future, or one that succumbs, against the grain of our history, to the politics of grievance.”The prime minister is expected to draw on the memories of the 1945 Labour government to inspire his party, while warning supporters there will be more tough choices to come. “It is a test. A fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge,” he will say.“And yet we need to be clear that our path, the path of renewal, it’s long, it’s difficult, it requires decisions that are not cost-free or easy. Decisions that will not always be comfortable for our party.”Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, warned delegates that they would not like some of the measures she expects to implement to deal with small boats, implying they would involve some significant curtailment of human rights.“In solving this crisis, you may not always like what I do. We will have to question some of the assumptions and legal constraints that have lasted for a generation and more,” she said.“But unless we have control of our borders, and until we can decide who comes in and who must leave, we will never be the open, tolerant and generous country that I know we all believe in.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourLabour conference 2025Economic policyEconomic growth (GDP)Budget deficitTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

An unknown number did so last year and early this year over changes to their contract that they were opposed to.“Online systems currently cannot distinguish between non-urgent and urgent patient queries, and with practices already understaffed and overworked, GPs fear this could lead to potentially serious and life-threatening problems being delayed or missed entirely,” the BMA said.“Doctors will need to be reallocated away from booked appointments to manage the potential online triage tsunami, leading to fewer GP appointments with patients.“GPs are worried that without any increase in practice capacity, considerable amounts of practice time will be diverted to reviewing the barrage of online requests and queries, thus reducing time for routine appointments and planned patient care.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, dismissed the BMA’s concerns and insisted the changes would go ahead as planned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Patients can still phone or walk in, but now they’ve also got the online option available all day.“More people requesting bookings online means quieter phone lines for those who need to call.”Some of England’s 6,400 GP surgeries already operate the system the BMA is concerned about. They have found it brings “a smoother workflow and better service”, the DHSC said.The Patients Association said what patients wanted most from GPs was fast access to advice and care, irrespective of how they sought an appointment.Its chief executive, Rachel Power, said: “Patients should feel confident that when they book or request an appointment, whether online, on the phone, or in person, their needs will be assessed swiftly and safely by someone with the right training and skills to judge urgency.”Explore more on these topicsGPsDoctorsNHSEnglandHealthTrade unionsIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

I have many conversations with MPs.”Burnham was speaking soon after Rachel Reeves had appeared to criticise him for previous comments he made that the UK should not be in hock to the bond markets.The chancellorsaid in her speech: “There is nothing progressive, nothing Labour, about government using one in every £10 of public money it spends on financing debt interest.”Burnham hit back. He said: “If you change the way things are run, you can make public money go further … I reject entirely this idea that I am hopeless and have no idea about how to make it add up.”He also rejected the call from his former cabinet colleague Alan Johnson to rule out a leadership tilt. “I remember Mr Johnson not being a model of loyalty when it came to Jeremy Corbyn,” he said.“Someone has to speak up for some of the ideas that we need to have that plan to beat Reform.”He urged the prime minister to be more radical to help the party keep seats in Wales, Scotland and other parts of the UK at next May’s local and devolved elections.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I hope in my lifetime I see this country rejoin the European Union.“I believe in unions of all kinds. The union that is the UK, the European Union, trade unions, [all] benefited this country.

Some children died from Covid, while others continue to live with the “severe, and, for many, long-lasting” consequences of the pandemic.Dobbin described the curtailment of play and the loss of all the normal rites of passage – birthdays, proms, exams – as well as the damage done to young people’s mental health and their ability to make and sustain friendships.She also spoke about children who suffered “grievous” harm at the hands of the people who were meant to care for them, when they were told to stay at home and lost the protection that schools usually offer.Some young people were exposed to violent pornography and other harms as their lives rapidly moved online, while many struggled to access online lessons and ended up spending most of the day gaming instead of learning.One described “sitting there with no school, playing [the video game] Animal Crossing for, like, six months”. Another said they played Roblox online for up to 19 hours a day.Dobbin quoted one child as saying: “People would answer the remote lesson call in bed, people would be in science third lesson, and would literally have the camera off and would be posting on their Instagram stories or their Snapchat stories, literally them watching The Only Way is Essex.”View image in fullscreenGavin Williamson, the then education secretary, said there had been a ‘24-hour sea change’ in the attitude to school closures.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesShe said said: “[Covid] deprived children of much of the fun that makes a childhood: birthday parties, playing sport, proms, school trips, holidays; all everyday aspects of what it means to be a child but which comprisethe very fabric of childhood.”The inquiry heard the decision to close schools “had ramifications which are difficult to overstate”. The Department for Education (DfE) had undertaken zero contingency planning for school closures before lockdown was declared in March 2020.“In England, evidence that the [DfE] did not start planning for the closure of schools until after 16 March 2020 is a cause for alarm,” Dobbin told the inquiry.She said Jonathan Slater, then permanent secretary to the DfE, had provided evidence that between January and 16 March 2020, the department’s contingency plans were “premised on the assumption that schools and other educational settings would remain open. And according to him that was in keeping with the government’s overall approach to pandemic preparedness at the time.”Evidence from Gavin Williamson, the education secretary at the time, agreed, but on 17 March there seems to have been a sudden change of direction. Dobbin said: “[Williamson] explains in his words that there’s a discombobulating 24-hour sea change from keeping schools open on 16 March, to discussions about closing schools on 17 March.”On 18 March, schools were ordered to close. Dobbin added: “[Williamson] did not ask DfE officials to prepare an assessment of the impact of school closures because school closures had not been recommended and No 10 officials had not commissioned this advice from the DfE either.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She added: “It’s my respectful submission that it’s significant that there should be a dispute about whether planning for so seismic an event existed … and perhaps alarming is the suggestion that it was not for the DfE to instigate its own planning for school closures but to wait for it to be commissioned.”In her opening comments to the reconvened inquiry the chair, Heather Hallett, said the pandemic’s impact on children and young people was “severe and, for many, long-lasting”, as they missed educational opportunities, social interaction and for the most at-risk they lost protection from abuse.An impact film shown at the start of proceedings detailed some of the children’s stories, voiced by adults to protect their identities. One contributor said her friend had died, another lost 12 kilos while suffering from Covid, while a third had to be put on a ventilator.A single parent described the challenge of trying to home educate and care for three children all at different stages of their education. “In the end I just said we’re not doing it,” she said, adding: “Being confined, just us in that house, was hell.”Another mother said her son had been out of school since February 2022. “Our family life completely stopped. It’s a huge worry to us how his life will go. How he will manage to look after himself. We should not sacrifice children. Children are the future.”The inquiry continues on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryCoronavirusSchoolsYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Their bill does not have these – they never talked to us.”But there was little sign that Republicans had shifted from their demands that Senate Democrats vote for their bill that would keep the government open through 21 November, so that long-term funding talks may continue. The GOPpassed that billthrough the House on a near party-line vote earlier this month, but it needs at least some Democratic support to advance in the Senate.“This is purely and simply hostage-taking on behalf of theDemocrats,” said Senate majority leader John Thune.Referring to the Republican funding proposal, Thune said: “We could pick it up and pass it tonight, and pass it tomorrow before the government shuts down.”Vance sought to pin the blame for any shutdown on the Democrats, saying: “I think we’re headed into a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing. I hope they change their mind, but we’re gonna see.”Trump has not yet commented publicly on the meeting, which was not opened to reporters. In an interview earlier in the day with CBS News, the president said “I just don’t know how we are going to solve this issue” and alleged the Democrats “are not interested in waste, fraud and abuse”.The Democratic stand on healthcare comes as the party seeks to regain its footing with voters ahead of next year’s midterm elections, in which they are viewed as having a shot at regaining control of the House and winnowing the GOP’s majority in the Senate.The party has refused to support the GOP funding proposal unless it includes an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans, which expire at the end of the year. They also want the undoing of cuts to Medicaid – the program providing healthcare to poor and disabled Americans – and public media, whichRepublicansapproved earlier in the year.Schumer signaled that the Democrats may be willing to compromise. Outside the White House, he said Trump was “the decision-maker, and if he will accept some of the things we ask, which we think the American people are for, on healthcare and on rescissions, he can avoid a shutdown, but there are still large differences between us”.If Congress does not act, a shutdown will begin Wednesday at midnight, and would see workers furloughed and federal agencies close their doors. Last week, the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo saying it would exploit a shutdown to carry out more mass firings as part of its crusade to slash government bureaucracy.Polling from Morning Consult released on Monday found that 45% of voters would blame congressional Republicans for a shutdown, while 32% would blame Democrats.In March, House Democrats voted against a Republican bill to extend government funding, only to see Schumer encourage his colleagues to advance the measure through the Senate, arguing a shutdown at that time would be “devastating”. The episode amplified disillusionment with the minority leader among the Democratic base.On Monday afternoon, reports circulated that Schumer had discussed with Democratic lawmakers the possibility of voting for a bill that would keep the government open for about a week. At a press conference that evening, Schumer insisted he was not going to change his demands.“We have to get it done,” he said. “The way to do this is the president, who is really listening to us, tells the Republicans to do it.”Explore more on these topicsUS CongressUS politicsUS healthcareDonald TrumpDemocratsRepublicansUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

According to theboard’s website, the revocation was issued on Sunday.In aletterdated 28 September and addressed to Roberts, the board’s executive director, Michael Cavin, wrote that their office had “received information that you no longer possess legal presence in the United States, therefore you [are] not able to hold a license issued by the Iowa Board of Educational examiners”.The letter states that the license issued to Roberts is “no longer valid” and that his “authority to serve as superintendent is revoked”.The letter states that Roberts has until 28 October to appeal the decision.On Saturday, the Des Moines school boardvoted toplace Roberts on administrative leave.Roberts, 54,began his termas superintendent of Des Moines schools in July 2023. Prior to joining DMPS, he served as superintendent of the Millcreek Township school district in Pennsylvania for three years, according to the Iowa district’s 2023announcementof Roberts’ appointment.The announcement also stated that Roberts “was born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn”.On Friday, Jackie Norris, the Des Moines school board president,saidthat Roberts has been an “integral part of our school community”.The district alsosaidin a statement: “Roberts has a previous firearm charge related to a hunting rifle which he disclosed to the DMPS Board during the hiring process.”“He provided sufficient context and explanation of the situation to move forward in the hiring process,” they added. “He has also spoken publicly about this experience.”The district saidon Saturdaythat “everything the district has on file indicates Dr. Robert [sic] affirmed that he was a citizen who was eligible to work for the school district” and a “comprehensive background check” was completed as part of the hiring process.On Monday, the Des Moines school districtsaidin a news release it had learned the Iowa board of educational examiners had officially revoked Roberts’ education license to practice in the state of Iowa, and the school board is now scheduled to take action to place Roberts on unpaid administrative.“This action is required by law,” the statement added.Norris said in the release that “new information and confirmed facts will continue to inform our decisions as we develop a path forward”.“Two things can be true at the same time – Dr. Roberts was an effective and well-respected leader and there are serious questions related to his citizenship and ability to legally perform his duties as superintendent,” Norris added.In the news release, the board also saidit hadreached out to Roberts’s counsel and “hopes to soon have more information that will guide the Board’s next steps”.A Des Moines public schools board special meeting is scheduled for Monday afternoon to “consider new information that has been learned relating to the detainment of Superintendent Dr. Ian Roberts”.According to theDes Moines Register, Roberts is currently being held at Woodbury county Jail.Explore more on these topicsIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)IowaUS educationnewsShareReuse this content"

In a report sent last month to Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, Heenan, Osadebe and two anonymous colleagues wrote that fighting discrimination under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was “not a priority” for the administration, and that their office had been targeted for downsizing because it presented an “optics problem”.On Monday, Osadebe was called into a meeting with HUD managers, who informed him he was being placed on leave in anticipation of firing. A document he was given cited interviews he had given tothe New York TimesandWashington Postas violating department policy.“This was purely for whistleblowing activity. There was nothing about conduct, performance, any of that,” Osadebe said in an interview. “They said, this is why we’re firing you, because you spoke out. They are as blatant as can be about it.”Heenan, who was in the probationary phase of his employment, was fired in a similar meeting for “the disclosure of non-public information”, according to a letter he was given by HUD.The department’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs, said in a statement following the firings: “Donald Trump doesn’t want Americans to know that his administration is engaged in a systemic attack on their rights.“So theTrump administrationis silencing those who are speaking out about how Donald Trump and Scott Turner [the HUD secretary] are turning their backs on the American people, including women experiencing domestic violence, families being denied mortgages because of the color of their skin, and older folks who need extra help getting down the stairs.”Heenan and Osadebe were recently told they would be moved out of the OFH, which had already lost several staff members and was poised to shrink further through a series of reassignments. Last week, they and three other colleagues sued Turner to prevent the transfers, arguing they were part of the effort to undermine enforcement of the law.“Although we knew we were taking a risk, I am still surprised that this administration would violate the whistleblower statute so blatantly,” Heenan said, referring to federal law intended to protect employees who make reports like theirs.“I’m not going to stop speaking out. I’m not going to stop fighting because these rights are just too damn important.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

MSOS, an AdvisorSharesCannabisexchange-traded fund (ETF), also soared on Monday, after Trump posted the video.The video was produced by the Commonwealth Project, a group promoting cannabis use for senior healthcare, and praised Trump for his 2018 farm bill that legalized industrial hemp.“Now it’s time to educate doctors … provide Medicare coverage for CBD and give millions of seniors the support they deserve,” the video said.The cannabis industry has long hoped the White House would take further steps to decriminalize cannabis at a federal level.Under Joe Biden’s administration, the Department of Health and Human Services requested that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reclassify cannabis as a lower-risk substance. Marijuana is now classified as a Schedule Idrugin accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, which means it has no accepted medical use and has a high risk for abuse.But the Trump administration had been silent about decriminalizing marijuana until August, when Trumptold reportersthat his administration is “looking at reclassification and we’ll make a determination over the next few weeks”.“I’ve heard great things have to do with medical, and I’ve heard bad things having to do with just about everything else,” Trump said. “It’s a very complicated subject.”Currently, 40 statesallowthe use of medical cannabis products, and 24 states allow non-medical cannabis use.Tilray led a rally by industry stocks in New York on Monday, surging by more than 40% in the wake of Trump’s video.Advocates for cannabis for medical use say legalizing marijuana at a federal level will allow for better investment into research and broaden access.“While the DEA plans to reschedule cannabis, today it is still a Schedule I drug – a controlled Substances Act classification for the most dangerous drugs such as heroin and LSD,” the Commonwealth Project says on itswebsite. “As a result, studying cannabis is challenging and not integrated into comprehensive medical care, depriving millions of Americans aged 65 and older of potential life-changing alternative therapies for medical ailments.”But it’s unclear where Terrance Cole, Trump’s DEA administrator, stands on reclassifying cannabis. Advocates pointed out that upon Cole’s appointment in July, he did not mention cannabis reclassification among hispriorities, instead focusing on cracking down on fentanyl.Explore more on these topicsCannabisDonald TrumpTrump administrationHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

She had pleaded not guilty and is expected to appeal her conviction. Prosecutors with the Manhattan US attorney’s office had sought a 12-year prison sentence.Javice founded Frank in 2017, and won praise for simplifying college financial aid for students and parents. She became a rising star in finance, and appeared on Forbes magazine’s “30 Under 30” list in 2019.JPMorgan bought Frank in September 2021, but found itself unable to email much of Javice’s claimed customer base, and concluded she faked her customer list.Prosecutors said Javice claimed she had 4.25 million customers, but the real number was closer to 300,000. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called buying Frank a “huge mistake”.Lawyers for Javice sought a prison term significantly shorter than 12 years, calling her “lapse of judgment” an aberration and the harm to JPMorgan inconsequential.Javice added prominent appellate lawyer Alexandra Shapiro to her legal team this month. Shapiro’s other clients include hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is expected to appeal his conviction on prostitution-related charges, and cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who is appealing his fraud conviction and 25-year prison sentence.Javice’s co-defendant Olivier Amar, who was Frank’s chief growth officer, was convicted on the same counts as her. His sentencing is scheduled for 20 October.Explore more on these topicsUS newsJP MorganBankingNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Affinity Partners is a private equity firm run by Donald Trump’s son-in-law,Jared Kushner.Electronic Arts would be taken private.The total value of the deal eclipses the $32bn price paid to take Texas utility TXU private in 2007.If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA’s 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted $0.52.The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by Strat-O-Matic as a teenager during the 1960s.EA has been run by its current CEO, Andrew Wilson, since 2013.This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake isalso part ofa newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the US oversight of TikTok’s social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven’t been divulged yet.Abu Dhabi royal family to take stake in TikTok US under Trump dealRead moreSilver Lake has also previously bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9bn deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9bnbuyoutof personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returnedto the stock marketwith publicly traded shares in 2018.By going private, EA will be able to reprogram its operations without being subjected to the investment pressures and scrutiny that sometimes compel publicly held companies to make short-sighted decisions aimed at meeting quarterly financial targets. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA’s annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4bn to $7.6bn.Meanwhile, one of its biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft fornearly $69bnin 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified.After being taken private, formerly public companies often undergo extensive cost-cutting that includes layoffs, although there has been no indication that will be the case with EA. After jettisoning about 5% of its workforce in 2024, EA ended March with 14,500 employees and then laid off several hundred people in May.Explore more on these topicsBusinessGamesJared KushnernewsShareReuse this content"

Bullion has hit a series of record highs in 2025, putting it firmly on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979, when revolution in Tehran rocked the global economy.Why is gold in such demand?The short answer is that gold is acting as a haven and a store of value, a role it’s played for thousands of years, since the kingdom of Lydia started churning out gold coins in the sixth century BC. Investors can be a jumpy lot, and there are plenty of reasons to shift money out of riskier assets today – from fears of economic slowdown to rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Nato.As well as traditional valuation drivers such as interest rates, the dollar and inflation, concerns overDonald Trump’s attacks on the US central bank, his trade war, and his tax and spending plans are also pushing gold higher, analysts say.Why can’t other precious metals play the same role as gold?Gold’s role as a store of value comes, in part, from its scarcity. According to the World Gold Council, if all the gold ever mined was gathered into a single cube, it would measure approximately 22 metres on each side.Total supplies are rising by an estimated 1.7% a year. That means “no policy, no discovery, no quantitative easing of geology” can debase gold, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.That makes it attractive when investors worry that governments are losing their grip on the public finances – finding it politically unpalatable to raise taxes, and impossible to cut spending.Copper, in contrast, can’t operate as a store of value as huge quantities are used, and consumed, each year, with demand set by the health of the global economy.Platinum and palladium fail this test too, despite an ounce costing over a thousand dollars as new supplies are quickly swallowed up by industry.How much has the precious metal risen by – and are we at peak gold?Since 1 January, the spot price of gold has risen by a blistering 45% to a record high of $3,831 per ounce on Monday. That outpaces all other leading asset classes this year.Gold hasn’t had such as strong year since 1979, when it jumped by 126% as Iran’s revolution led to a surge in the oil price, crushing investors’ hopes that inflation could be tamed.A line graph showing the price of gold steadily rising since the 1970sData from Bank of America (BofA) on Friday shows that $5.6bn flowed into gold last week. Over the past four weeks, the bank says there were record inflows of $17.6bn.BofA cautions that gold is tactically “overbought”, but structurally “under owned” – as it only represents 0.4% of private client assets under management. It is maintaining a long position on gold, indicating it expects the price to keep rising.Gold has further to rise, analysts predict. Arnab Das, global macro strategist at Invesco, for example, says the gold rally still “has legs”.“We see no true alternative to gold as a hedge against US risks and expect central banks to keep buying gold … In my view, central banks are buying gold because they see no fiat alternative to the dollar,” Das says.Who is buying it, and why?The World Gold Council says western investors and speculators have been the drivers of the recent price gains.They cite two reasons. First,evidence that a slowing US economywill allow the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further. That means the interest on cash reserves will be lower, making it less attractive compared with gold (which doesn’t provide a yield).Second, increased rhetoric against the Fed and its independence from the Trump administration is leading to concerns about the stability of the US dollar and the Treasuries market.A bar chart showing how much the price of gold has grown since the late 1970sCentral banks have also been adding to their gold reserves in recent years. Notably China. Bloomberg reported this week that China aims to become custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves in an attempt to strengthen its standing in the global bullion market, and become less dependent on the dollar and western centres like the US, the UK and Switzerland.What about the Trump effect?Overall, markets have not been badly hit by the jump in US tariffs this year to the highest level since the 1930s. But the most obvious vehicle of trade war worry has been the US dollar.M&G fund manager Eva Sun-Wai told M&G’sBond Vigilantesforum last week that this has led to a “broader de-dollarization trend, which has caused angst in markets”.“And I think it’s a big reason why gold, for example, has become the safe haven choice,” Sun-Wai added, as investors go for gold when they don’t want to buy the dollar or expose themselves to the risk of interest rate moves by holding bonds.The greenback is enduring a bruising 2025 – down more than 9% so far this year, amid concerns about Fed independence and those trade war concerns. That mechanistically lifts the value of gold in dollar terms.Should I buy gold?“Caveat emptor” certainly applies, given the edginess among investors thatasset prices might generally have risen too high. But some experts do see more value in gold – earlier this month, Deutsche Bank raised its gold price forecast for 2026 by $300, to $4,000 per ounce.You can buy physical gold, perhaps from the Royal Mint, which sells gold coins and bars. The bulk buying chainCostco even stocks gold bars, which often sell out, perhaps because of the precious metal’spopularity with doomsday preppers. But “such investments come with extra costs and complications, however, like insurance and storage,” says Jemma Slingo of Fidelity International.Alternatively, you could put money into a gold exchange traded fund (ETF), which closely mirror movements in the gold price.Another option is to buy shares in gold miners, such as Fresnillo, whose share price is up 250% so far this year.There is a risk, though, of a pullback in gold after such strong gains, or a more sizeable drop, perhaps if inflation falls back towards central bank targets, or geopolitical crises ease.Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesexplainersShareReuse this content"

Watson’s comments come after Rory McIlroy confirmedhis wife, Erica, was hit by a beer thrown by a fan.“I’d like to congratulate Europe on their victory,”said Watson on X. “Your team play the first few days was sensational. More importantly, I’d like to apologise for the rude and mean-spirited behaviour from our American crowd at Bethpage. As a former player, captain and as an American I am ashamed of what happened.”US fan ugliness at the Ryder Cup was merely a reflection of Trump’s all-caps America | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreWatson, an eight-time major winner who played in five Ryder Cups and captained the US team in 2014, also relayed his apology directly to the European team.His comments are in stark contrast to the class of 2025.Collin Morikawa had asked for fans to bring “chaos”and the American captain,Keegan Bradley, stopped well shortof properly condemning the situation at Bethpage despite police and dogs lining fairways. “I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” saidMcIlroy, who encountered vehement abusetowards himself and his wife.Watson’s comment shows it may take some time for dust to settle on the 45th Ryder Cup. European team celebrations, which ran long into the night, were understandably wild after a first victory on US soil since 2012.Success underLuke Donaldmeans Europe now favour captains for multiple Ryder Cups. Those behind the team regard it as far easier to prepare for an away staging of the event with knowledge built up from a Ryder Cup at home. His approach to captaincy in Rome two years ago and New York has been widely praised. It seems inevitable he will be involved in some capacity in the future. For now, he is not completely ruling out a third term.Donald had taken guidance from tennis players, including the three-time US Open champion Ivan Lendl, on how to handle a New York crowd. Lendl defeated home favourite John McEnroe for the first of his victories, in 1985. Donald believed the backdrops to tennis and golf, where spectators are urged to remain quiet for shots, were the most comparable.3:31Rory McIlroy condemns Ryder Cup abuse after his wife was hit by a beer – video“The weeks we spend together are the ones we remember the most and the ones we cherish the most because of the time we get to spend with each other,” he said. “That’s a big part of my captaincy, to create an environment where these guys are having the best weeks of their lives. We’ll always remember this. We’ll always go down in history.Eagles, Donalds and bubbly: Ryder Cup 2025 – in picturesRead more“We talk about all the people that came before us that paved the way for us. Now future generations will talk about this team and what they did and how they were able to overcome one of the toughest environments in all of sport.”Justin Rose had been the most likely European captain for 2025 and Adare Manor in Ireland. However, Rose’s playing performance here may give him cause to think he could compete again in two years’ time. Francesco Molinari would come into the frame in that circumstance.It has been widely assumed Tiger Woods will succeed Bradley and lead the US, but the absence of the 15-time major winner from Bethpage raises questions over that scenario.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupLuke DonaldTom WatsonGolfUS sportsRory McIlroynewsShareReuse this content"

Police chief Todd Schmaderer ordered an internal affairs investigation, a move Omaha’s mayor, John Ewing, said he supported.According to police, officers working in the downtown area observed a vehicle driving recklessly shortly before 1.30am. While speaking with the driver, an officer observed a gun on the driver’s side floorboard. All four occupants were ordered out of the vehicle at gunpoint.Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stageRead moreThe driver was later identified as Crawford, and he was ticketed for reckless driving. One passenger, a member of Crawford’s security team, was also found to be carrying a legal firearm. Police confirmed all occupants of the vehicle are legally permitted to carry firearms. A police supervisor and lieutenant responded to the scene at Crawford’s request.“I thought we were getting ready to lose our lives ... That was a nightmare, you know, future husband, just had a brand new child and children and stuff like that,” Qasim Shabazz, the head of Terence Crawford’s security team,told WOWT NBC Omaha.Crawford is a hero in Omahaand still lives in his hometown, where he has raised his kids and runs a non-profit boxing academy to help at-risk children.Ewing said in a Facebook post that he spoke to Crawford after he learned of the traffic stop.“I acknowledge the seriousness of what occurred and how trust between law enforcement and our community is important and shows the need to be continuously vigilant about building relationships,” Ewing said. “Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer has pledged an internal investigation, which I support and want to be full and thorough. We will gather all the facts and be transparent with the public about our findings.”Crawford became the unified super middleweight champion with his unanimous decision victory over Álvarez in Las Vegas. He became the first male boxer to capture three unified division titles. Crawford is 42-0 with 31 knockouts.The city held a parade through downtown in Crawford’s honor during the day, and a party to celebrate his 38th birthday was held at a live music venue near where the traffic stop occurred.“Understand that my heart dropped in learning of this end to an otherwise wonderful day and evening celebrating our city’s world boxing champion,” Ewing said. “Omaha needs to remember this important day as a good one while we seek answers to how it ended.

The self-styled “special one” is back with Benfica for Tuesday night’sChampions Leaguetie and he repeated another famous old line of his to set the scene.Mourinho anticipates no hostility from Chelsea’s supporters as he seeks to ignite his Benfica tenure, having only joined them 11 days ago after his sacking by Fenerbahce at the end of August.Mourinho’s return looms large as Chelsea and Maresca endure untimely blipRead moreIt has not always been the case when he has gone back to Stamford Bridge, with the nadir coming when he was barracked as the visiting Manchester United manager during an FA Cup defeat in March 2017. Mourinho, who won three Premier League titles for Chelsea across two spells, made the point back then that until another manager won four at the club, then “Judas is No 1”.“Chelsea is a winning machine that had in the past two or three years a moment without trophies,” Mourinho said on Monday night, back at the stadium where he gave his original ‘special one’ press conference.“But Chelsea won something before my time and then we start winning and then my team kept winning and then a transformation of new teams, new coaches, more trophies, European trophies, the biggest one and the Champions League. So Chelsea is a winning machine. I am the biggest one until someone wins four.”Mourinho has been back to Stamford Bridge with Inter, United and Tottenham; his lone victory in seven attempts came with Inter in 2009-10 en route to winning the Champions League. There was warmth from him as he held court in the stadium’s Drake Suite, which is adorned with giant framed photographs of him celebrating each of his three Premier League titles.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho said the fracas after a late Chelsea equaliser against his Manchester United side in October 2018 has been misinterpreted.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMourinho’s family home remains close by in south-west London and he said that his son came every weekend to the ground. He also talked about how the club would be “my Chelsea before the game and my Chelsea after,” although – by dint of the terms of engagement – he stressed it would be “my Benfica” during it.“I’ve already played here with Tottenham, Man United and Inter Milan,” Mourinho said.“In 90 minutes, I didn’t think where I was or with who I was playing. So I say: ‘I am not a blue any more … I am [Benfica] red now.’ And I want to win.“But of course, I will always be a blue. I am part of their history and they are part of my history. I helped them to become a bigger Chelsea and they helped me to become a bigger José. When I say I am not a blue I hope everybody understands me – I am speaking about the job that I have to do.”“But in relation to these pictures [in the Drake suite] … there are not many clubs that do this. In many, many clubs it looks like there is a fear of what happened in the past and there is continuous transformation of pictures – sometimes it looks like they want to delete people that made history in the clubs. I think this shows that Chelsea is really a big club because big clubs are also about principles.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came in October 2018 when his United team conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to the Chelsea of Maurizio Sarri.“When something happened, it was that one member of the Chelsea dugout insulted me,” Mourinho said, meaning Sarri’s coach, Marco Ianni. “I reacted and people thought I was reacting to the Chelsea goal because they scored in the last minute. It was not the case.“The coach was Sarri and he was absolutely top in the way he reacted to his assistant. Also, Chelsea was top in the way they dealt with it.

And it could get a lot deeperWhile Kansas City got their season back on track with an excellent offensive performance, their AFC rivals are 1-3 and lost one of the finest players in the NFLDoug FarrarMon 29 Sep 2025 07.09 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 09.47 EDTShareTheKansas City Chiefsand the Baltimore Ravens came into Sunday’s slate in very unusual circumstances – two of the best teams of the last few years were struggling. Both were 1-2, and after the Chiefs’ 37-20 blowout win on Sunday, the Ravens are in the kind of real trouble one doesn’t usually expect from such a normally stable franchise.First, the Chiefs. This offense has been a problemtranscended by Patrick Mahomesfor a long time, for all sorts of reasons, but there was at least a one-week reprieve from such worries. Mahomes was dynamite, completing 25 of 37 passes for 270 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 124.8. It helped that speedy receiver Xavier Worthy was back in action for the first time since Week 1, and Worthy lived up to his … well, worth, with five catches for 83 yards. Mahomes threw touchdown passes to four different receivers and for the first time in goodness knows how long, Andy Reid’s offense was a fun watch.Mahomesalso made NFL history(again), but the revival of the KC offense as a whole was far more important.On throws past the sticks, Mahomes – who by metrics was the NFL’s least effective deep passer last season – completed nine of 14 passes for 133 yards, three of his touchdowns, and a passer rating of 134.8.That said, the Ravens didn’t hit the field at Arrowhead Stadium with anything approaching a healthy roster, and it got worse as the game went along – especially when Lamar Jackson left the game in the third quarter with a hamstring issue. Linebacker Roquan Smith and cornerback Marlon Humphrey also went out, and Baltimore’s defense was already without pass-rusher Kyle Van Noy, and defensive tackles Travis Jones and Nnamdi Madubuike.So maybe a victory against a battered opponent doesn’t mean Kansas City are completely back. But at least, at 2-2, they can still think about playoff tickets. We’ll find out more about what this really means when Mahomes and his crew travel to Jacksonville for next Monday night’s game against a surprisingly stingy Jaguars defense.Meanwhile, the Ravens – 1-3 for the first time since 2015 – have to fight their way out of a deep hole. And if they have to do so without Jackson for any length of time, their odds become much longer: 1-3 teams don’t usually go on to make the postseason, never mind without their star player. For what it’s worth, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh’s description of the injury was: “There’s nothing that looks like it’s season-ending by any stretch for anybody”.If the Ravens do have one fleeting hope, it’s that the rest of the AFC North isn’t exactly stunning. The Browns (more on them in a minute) are wasting a great defense, the Bengals are Joe Burrow-less, and the Steelers are a big bag of who-knows-what from week to week. A loss would have been far more damning for the Chiefs, who reside in the AFC West with the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers.MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenAshton Jeanty is having an excellent start to his NFL career.Photograph: Chris Unger/Getty ImagesAshton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas Raiders.It’s not often that a player on a losing team gets this award, but if Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley can do it in Super Bowl V, Jeanty can do so despite his team losing a 25-24 heartbreaker to the Chicago Bears. While Raiders quarterback Geno Smith was busy extracting defeat from the jaws of victory with three interceptions, Jeanty – the sixth overall pick in the 2025 draft after a transcendent career at Boise State – finally looked like the back the Raiders wanted. Through his first three games, Jeanty had no shot behind a horrid offensive line, but some personnel and schematic changes – including offensive coordinator Chip Kelly allowing Jeanty to use the same standup pre-snap style that was so successful in college – finally paid off. Jeanty gained 138 yards and scored a touchdown on 21 carries, and he caught a couple of passesfor 17 yards and two more scores.If you’re mortally offended by the concept of MVP “losers,” there is another MVP of the week on the Bears’ side – safetyKevin Byard, whopicked off Smithtwice.Video(s) of the weekThere is only one choice for this, and Indianapolis Colts receiver Adonai Mitchell would obviously prefer that there wasn’t. Mitchell had first-round talent, but developed a reputation of not always being on the same page as the playbook dictates and he was taken in the second round last year. But he was on track for his firstNFLtouchdown against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, until he wasn’t. In the third quarter, Mitchell made one of the best catches you’ll see this season on a deep pass from Daniel Jones, had a free path to the end zone, and then engaged in a premature celebration.Former Philadelphia Eagles receiver DeSean Jacksonis the most (in)famous for this particular mistake, but he’s far from the only one.Last December, I wrote about an epidemic of players fumbling the ball before they reached the end zone,including Colts running back Jonathan Taylor.It was a really rough day for Mitchell – in the first quarter, Rams safety Kam Curl gave Jones his first interception of the season on another deep target to Mitchell, andit didn’t appear that Mitchell was awareof the fact that Curl was about to jump the route. Then, with 2:25 left in the game – which was tied at 20-20 at that point – Mitchell’s holding penalty negated what would have been a 53-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Taylor.Jonathan Taylor with what would've been an ABSURD 53-yard touchdown run to give the Colts the lead, but it's called back for offensive holding:pic.twitter.com/OP1kRa2ZAg— Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL)September 28, 2025The Rams scored a touchdown on their next drive, it ended 27-20, and Mitchell has to deal with the fact that he cost his team two touchdowns on one day in a career in which he’s never scored one. That’s tough to overcome.Stat of the weekView image in fullscreenJosh Allen has led the Bills to an unbeaten start.Photograph: Jeffrey T Barnes/AP45.The number of times in his NFL career that Josh Allen has had at least one passing touchdown and one rushing touchdown in the same game. Allen reached that mark in the Bills’ 31-19 win over the New Orleans Saints, and that tied him with Cam Newton for the most such games in league history. It took Newton 11 seasons to get there; Allen has accomplished that feat in seven full seasons and four games. He is not just an amazing quarterback – the defending NFL MVP is a nonpareil power runner as well, and there are times when he resembles an athletic edge-rusher at his size.josh allen would bring one hell of a euro step as a 6-foot-5, 240-pound edge-rusherhttps://t.co/aWfghYx0ub— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar)September 28, 2025Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenDak Prescott and Micah Parsons embrace after Sunday’s game.Photograph: Sam Hodde/Getty Images--In their Sunday night game against the Green Bay Packers, the Dallas Cowboys spotted their guests a 13-point lead, which seemed especially generous after handing Micah Parsons to the Pack a month ago in a trade that had the Cowboys’ defense looking awful through the first three games of the season. But they fought back as the game ended 40-40,the second-highest score in a tiein pro football history, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a more exciting game in the annals of football than this one.Dak Prescott's 34-yard pass to Jalen Tolbert had a completion probability of 7.2%, the second-most improbable completion in the NGS era.Tolbert was 0.2 yards from the sideline when the pass arrived.#GBvsDAL|#DallasCowboyspic.twitter.com/d9zMS7P8XR— Next Gen Stats (@NextGenStats)September 29, 2025Eighty points would suggest the Cowboys defense is still missing Parsons badly – and perhaps that he hasn’t made the Packers D into a world-beating unit either. But that would be a disservice to excellent quarterback play from Dak Prescott and Jordan Love, who threw for three touchdowns each … and zero interceptions. When a game is as excellent as this –this catch was just one highlight– it’s best to forget the off-field wrangles and appreciate what a thrilling experience football can be. That seemed to be the case for Parsons and his old teammates too, many of whom he warmly greeted at the end of the game.-- The game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings, which marked the NFL’s first regular-season foray into Ireland, began as an unexpected quarterback efficiency festival. Neither Carson Wentz nor Aaron Rodgers threw an incompletion until Wentz was picked off by Steelers safety DeShon Elliott with 5:58 left in the first half. Wentz, who has been with a different team every season since 2020, then continued his usual dichotomy between “wow” plays and ones deserving of far stronger (and unprintable) adjectives.In the end, this 24-21 win for the Steelers came down to Wentz’s final drive, which began with 1:08 left. With the ball at his own 20-yard line, and the need to get in field-goal range in a hurry, Wentz became a victim of his own worst tendencies. He got his team as far as the Minnesota 39-yard line before delay of game and intentional grounding penalties derailed everything. On fourth-and-17, Wentz threw over the middle into a gaggle of Steelers, and Elliott’s pass breakup ended the game.Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell may be the NFL’s best passing game designer, but with a guy like Wentz, you can only lead him to water. Meanwhile, the Steelerswere Riverdancingtheir way home.-- New York Giants head coach Brian Daboll did the right thing this week by announcing that Jaxson Dart would replace Russell Wilson as his quarterback, and the rookie pulled out a 21-18 win (the Giants’ first of the season) over the Los Angeles Chargers with a lot lined up against him. Dart had to play most of the game without Malik Nabers after the receiver, one of the NFL’s best, suffered a torn ACL onMetLife Stadium’s disastrous turf. Moreover, Dart was also facing a defense that came into Sunday rankedseventh in the NFLin opponent-adjusted efficiency.It mattered not to the rookie, who completed 13 of 20 passes for 111 yards, a touchdown, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 96.0. Dart also rushed for 54 yards and another touchdown. At the 2025 scouting combine, Dart said that his ideal quarterback is Jalen Hurts, and this was a very Hurts-like debut: Do just enough as a rusher and as a passer to win.-- There was one pitched battle of 3-0 teams on Sunday, as the Philadelphia Eagles outlasted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31-25 after running out to leads of 24-3 and 31-13 before Baker Mayfield and the Bucs woke up. This was an old-school pier-sixer all the way, to the point where you expected Brian Dawkins and Warren Sapp to come out and trade punches.While the Bucs took far too long to get rolling offensively and were surprisingly compliant on defense, the Eagles simply did what they do – enough to keep the wins coming, impressive or not. Hurts completed 15 of 24 passes for 130 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 104.5 –this without completing a single pass in the second half. Saquon Barkley ran 19 times for 43 yards and a touchdown, and still the Eagles nearly won this one going away. While the Bucs have enough to impress most weeks, this was an instance in which they learned a lesson in how to win when you need to – no matter how it looks.-- One week after they were blanked 30-0 by the Carolina Panthers, who have one of the NFL’s worst defenses, the Atlanta Falcons came out against the Washington Commanders in determined mood. This time, in a 34-27 win that pushed his team to 2-2 on the season, Michael Penix Jr completed 20 of 26 passes for 313 yards, two touchdowns, one interception, and a passer rating of 126.0. Maybe it was a wakeup week for Atlanta’s offense, but Penix looked more in control than at any other time in his NFL career, and running back Bijan Robinson (who could make an NFL roster as a slot receiver) added a career-high 181 yards from scrimmage. The NFC South is a bit more open after the Bucs’ loss, and the Falcons already have a playoff-level defense. If this is the true turnaround, Atlanta are suddenly a team to watch.-- It’s been a nice career for Joe Flacco, but it’s time for the 18-year veteran to hang ‘em up. The Cleveland Browns are wasting a great defense with abysmal quarterback play, and it happened once again in their 34-10 loss to the Detroit Lions. Only this time, the defense’s wafer-thin margin for error busted through against Detroit’s dynamic offense. Flacco completed 16 of 34 passes for 184 yards, no touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 39.3. Flacco has been a disaster all season, turning down throws NFL quarterbacks must make, and if head coach Kevin Stefanski wants any chance of competitiveness,he needs to put Dillon Gabriel out there once and for all. Testing a rookie QB worked for the Giants, after all.Explore more on these topicsNFLKansas City ChiefsBaltimore RavensUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pressure was intense, their need desperate, but of all the things that aretrulyimportant in your lives, he wanted to know, is there anything that’s not right? Does anyone have any problems?“All of them said ‘no’,” Atlético Madrid’s manager admitted later, when the Metropolitano had finally fallen silent, the singing drifting in from down Avenida de Luis Aragonés instead. “So I said: ‘then play, have fun. You’re good. Enjoy yourselves. A footballer’s life passes quickly, make the most of it; these games don’t come back.’”And sometimes they never go away. Saturday’s left Real Madrid just wanting to get as far from there as they could, a plane handily waiting to take them 7,500km east the following day, and Atlético enjoying a moment that will be for ever. Asked what anastonishing 5-2 victory over Madridmeant, Simeone gave a two-word reply, offering only “three points” and a full stop, but if the players had bought his message before the game no one was buying it now. This meant more, the release so complete that when Julián Alvarez curled in a free-kick, Thibaut Courtois sent crashing past the post, over on the touchline the coach’s legs gave way and he started to cry. “There’s a lot of emotion in your body,” he said.Harry Kane at Bayern: how a marriage of convenience turned into true love | Andy BrassellRead moreThat was Atlético’s fourth goal and they hadn’t even finished yet. In added time, Antoine Griezmann slipped a shot into the net,number 199 in red and white. This time, Simeone turned to the stands and blew kisses. Up in the directors’ box, Madrid’s president Florentino Pérez tapped at his phone with a single finger, launching a million memes. Around him, the Metropolitano sang:show those Vikings who rules the capital, the lyrics demand. History really had been made. Atlético hadn’t put this many past their neighbours in 75 years.“An exhibition,” AS called it. “Fantastic,” El País said. “Historic,” ran the cover of Marca; this was “legendary” wrote Alfredo Relaño inside, while still managing to whine about a referee who got virtually everything right. It had been perfect for Atlético, in just about every way, even the bad bits good in the end, a resurrection second only to Koke. They had taken the lead, as they had in every game this season, and then lost it again, as they had in every game bar one. 1-0 up and 2-1 down, they made it 2-2 just before half-time, 3-2 just after it, then four. Now, a decade on fromthe last derby demolition, they had five. In Spain, they call it a little hand and it has a special significance, a goal for each finger: Robin Le Normand, Alex Sørloth, Alvarez, Alvarez again and Griezmann. Theirs formed a fist that crushed Madrid. “There are no excuses: the defeat was deserved, and it hurts,” Xabi Alonso said.“There are no words that can console us,” Madrid’s captain Dani Carvajal insisted, which didn’t stop him trying: “Maybe this beating will be good for us to see that not everything is the colour of roses.” Madrid had won six from six, a structure emerging, a system too. They arrived with an opportunity to eliminate their rivals from the race, Atlético’s title challenge ended before September: win and Simeone’s team would be 12 points behind already, which might have been part of the reason it didn’t happen. There was a shift too, Jude Bellingham’s return seeing Franco Mastantuono left out and Arda Guler moved to the right in a move that felt early and like an accommodation. In the middle, no one took control, Fede Valverde looking lost in a system that reduces this ability to run, his late error a portrait of a player trying to find his place. “We didn’t compete,” Alonso admitted. “This is a building process, and within that process there will be hard days.”Days like this, which perhaps also hinted at a simpler reality for both of them. Madrid’s wins had come against the sides currentlysitting in 19th, 18th, 17th, 14th, 13th and seventh. And theteam in seventh was Espanyol, who hadn’t won at the Bernabéu in 30 years. Now, they had been outplayed by the first truly strong team – and Atlético are a strong team, or should be, whatever the table says.View image in fullscreenDiego Simeone hides his face after Atlético Madrid go 4-2 ahead of Real.Photograph: Diego Souto/Getty ImagesWhat the table said was that Atlético had won just twice and it wasn’t as if they had played the best teams either: beaten at Espanyol, they had drawn with Elche, Alavés and Mallorca. Simeone, meanwhile, had said a lot about pressure and responsibility, victory bringing only reliefwhere once there was happiness. The coach, in his15thseason, had said a lot about efficiency too.Contundenciais the word, born of a blunt object: the ability to be decisive, definitive in both areas, to hit hard. Atlético hadn’t: in all six games they led, five times they let it slip. “We’re the team that have created most chances,” Alvarez said, which wasn’t entirely true (they’re fourth in shots, fifth in opportunities); what is true is that for every 10 shots they took, there was a goal and for every two they faced there was as well.On Saturday it was happening again, or so it goes. A goal up through Le Normand, Atlético suddenly found themselves 2-1 down. Madrid had taken two shots and scored them both out of nowhere, flashes of vision from Guler first, to set up Kylian Mbappé, and Vinícius Júnior next, to set up Guler, looking set to leave Atlético 12 points behind. A moment later, Alvarez hit a post to floor them further, a sense of inevitability invited in, minds messed with. “That’s the hardest part,” Sørloth said. “But I could see in the eyes of my teammates that they believed today.”Faith, Simeone called it. A plan too, executed to perfection. “We were very clear about what we had to do,” the coach said and his team just kept coming: relentless, first to every ball, and so superior that Madrid couldn’t stop them. They ran and they fought and theyplayed. Everywhere, Alonso’s team were outdone. Álvaro Carreras couldn’t handle Giuliano Simeone; let alone Simeone, the extraordinary Pablo Barrios and Marcos Llorente together. On the other side Nico González, who Simeone Sr said has “Atlético DNA”, went at Carvajal. In the centre, Koke, 33, making his 42nd derby appearance and still the best midfielder they have, moved them all. “Magisterial,” Simeone called him. Over and over, the ball came,aimed at the Hit Man, Sørloth dunking on Dean Huijsen and Carreras. Behind him, space was swept for Alvarez to play, and boy can he play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Alvarez, this was especially significant. Six days earlier he had sat on the bench at Son Moix, withdrawn and angry, muttering words that if they weren’t “always me”, as the lip readers said,weren’t happy ones either. That day he had missed his first penalty, yet to score since the opening night; the last penalty he had taken against Madridhad beenthatone, taken from him. But, he said, “every penalty is a new moment”, and this time he beat Courtois.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAtlético Madrid 5-2 Real Madrid, Barcelona 2-1 Real Sociedad, Elche 2-1 Celta Vigo, Getafe 1-1 Levante, Girona 0-0 Espanyol, Mallorca 1-0 Alavés, Rayo Vallecano 0-1 Sevilla, Real Betis 2-0 Osasuna, Villarreal 1-0 Athletic BilbaoMondayValencia v Real Oviedo (8pm BST)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He did so again 12 minutes later. Standing over the ball just outside the area with González, he gave his countryman the shot only for González to give it back: “nah, you take it,” González said, so Alvarez lifted a free-kick over the wall and down again and into the net, leaving his coach left in tears, sobbing behind his hands. “I don’t know how he does it; he reminds me of [Milinko] Pantic,” Simeone said, saying much: such was Pantic’s impact that before every game Margarita Luengo still lays a bunch of flowers by the corner flag in honour of the Serbian whose set plays led them to the double in 1996. “But what I most like in Julián,” Simeone said, “is the humility he has; a World Cup winner who comes to Atlético Madrid and runs and works every game.”They all had; now, at last, they had their reward. Alvarez had not got a goal since the opening night; now, scorer of a hat-trick to produce adramatic comeback against Rayo55 hours earlier, he had five in less than three days, life good again. It was done. There was just time for one more for the fun of it, the symbolism, Griezmann adding a little finger to complete a historic hand at the end of a derby day when all of them, 16 footballers and 69,167 fans, had done exactly what their manager asked.

The Cowboys beat the Giants 40-37 in overtime two weeks earlier when Russell Wilson was starting for New York.The second-highest scoring tie inNFLhistory, behind the Raiders’ 43-43 draw with the Boston Patriots in the AFL in 1964, was the first for Dallas since 1969. The Packers last tied in 2018.Baltimore Ravens 20–37 Kansas City ChiefsPatrick Mahomes threw for 270 yards and four touchdowns while outdueling Lamar Jackson, who left in the second half with a hamstring injury, and theKansas City Chiefsrouted the beat-up Baltimore Ravens.Xavier Worthy returned from a shoulder injury to catch five passes for 83 yards, igniting a Chiefs offense that had been struggling to find its footing without the reciever and his suspended teammate, Rashee Rice, early in the season.The Chiefs (2-2) built a 20-10 half-time lead against Baltimore (1-3) before cruising to their seventh win in the past eight meetings.Jackson threw for 147 yards with a touchdown and his first interception of the season before hurting his hamstring midway through the third quarter, though by that point the game was mostly decided. Cooper Rush played the rest of the way for the Ravens, who suddenly find themselves in a dire situation just four weeks into the season. Only five teams in the 14-team playoff era have started 1-3 and made the postseason.Los Angeles Chargers 18-21 New York GiantsJaxson Dart shone in his NFL starting debut, leading theNew York Giantsto victory over the previously undefeated Los Angeles Chargers (3-1). Dart threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score, helping the Giants (1-3) secure their first win of the season. The excitement was tempered by an injury to wide receiver Malik Nabers, who was carted off with a knee injury in the second quarter. The Giants’ defense also played a crucial role, with Brian Burns sacking Justin Herbert late in the game.Indianapolis Colts 20–27 Los Angeles RamsTutu Atwell caught an 88-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford with 1:33 to play, and the Los Angeles Rams (3-1) rallied to end the Indianapolis Colts’ unbeaten start. Daniel Jones passed for 262 yards for the Colts (3-1), but Indy couldn’t overcome receiver Adonai Mitchell’s mind-boggling fumble right before he crossed the goalline with what should have been a 76-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter. Stafford passed for 375 yards and three touchdowns for the Rams.New Orleans Saints 19-31 Buffalo BillsJosh Allen threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score, and the Buffalo Bills (4-0) shook off a sloppy first three quarters to stay undefeated, beating the winless New Orleans Saints (0-4). James Cook had 117 yards rushing and a touchdown in a game that wasn’t decided until midway through the fourth quarter. The Bills never trailed, but were clinging to a 21-19 lead when Allen hit a wide-open Dalton Kincaid for a 28-yard touchdown pass with 7:07 left. The five-time defending AFC East champion Bills are 4-0 for the 10th time in team history and first since 2020. The Saints are 0-4 for the first time since 2012.Steelers beat Vikings in Dublin after Pittsburgh’s Thompson injured in robberyRead moreCleveland Browns 10–34 Detroit LionsJared Goff threw two touchdown passes to Amon-Ra St Brown, Kalif Raymond returned a punt 65 yards for another score and the Detroit Lions beat the Cleveland Browns. The Lions (3-1) took advantage of Joe Flacco’s two interceptions in the first half and scored 20 straight points, giving them a 13-point lead at halftime. Detroit forced Flacco to fumble in the fourth, setting up another touchdown. The Browns (1-3) opened with an 88-yard, 13-play touchdown drive, then had 44 yards with three punts and two turnovers the rest of the half.Philadelphia Eagles 31–25 Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe Philadelphia Eagles (4-0) used a fake tush push, another special teams touchdown and a late defensive stop to stay undefeated. Jalen Hurts tossed two touchdown passes, Sydney Brown returned a blocked punt for a score and the Eagles beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-1) for their 20th victory in 21 games. The only loss in that span for the reigning Super Bowl champions was against Washington last December in a game Hurts left with a concussion in the first half. Chase McLaughlin’s 65-yard field goal for Tampa Bay on the final play of the first half was the longest in NFL history in an outdoor stadium.Jacksonville Jaguars 26-21 San Francisco 49ersParker Washington scored Jacksonville’s first punt return touchdown in eight seasons, leading the Jaguars to victory over the San Francisco 49ers (3-1). The Jaguars’ defense delivered four takeaways, including a strip-sack by Arik Armstead that sealed the win. Jacksonville (3-1) have generated at least three takeaways in all four games this season. They turned those into 17 points against the 49ers, highlighted by Travis Etienne’s 48-yard run. Trevor Lawrence threw a four-yard TD pass to Hunter Long, helping the Jaguars achieve just their second 3-1 start in the past 18 seasons.Chicago Bears 25–24 Las Vegas RaidersJosh Blackwell blocked a 54-year-old field-goal attempt by Daniel Carlson in the final minute to preserve a fourth-quarter rally led by Caleb Williams, and the Chicago Bears stunned the Las Vegas Raiders. After D’Andre Swift’s touchdown run with 1:34 left put the Bears (2-2) in front, Geno Smith led the Raiders into position for Carlson’s kick with 38 seconds left. Blackwell came in nearly untouched from the left side, dived and deflected the ball. Chicago had four takeaways for the second game in a row, including three interceptions of Geno Smith. The Raiders (1-3) have lost three straight.Minnesota Vikings 21-24 Pittsburgh SteelersKenneth Gainwell ran for 99 yards and two touchdowns and the Pittsburgh Steelers held on to beat the Minnesota Vikings (2-2) in Ireland’s first regular-season NFL game. DK Metcalf had five catches for 126 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown for the Steelers, who improved to 3-1 going into their bye week. Carson Wentz, making his second consecutive start for the injured JJ McCarthy, was 30 for 46 for 350 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions for the Vikings.Tennessee Titans 0–26 Houston TexansRookie Woody Marks had a touchdown reception and ran for another score and the Houston Texans (1-3) beat the Tennessee Titans (0-4) for their first win this season. It’s the third time the Texans have shut out a team and the first time since blanking the Titans 29-0 in 2010. The Titans were shut out for the first time since a 16-0 loss at Denver in 2019. CJ Stroud threw for 233 yards and two touchdowns as the Texans scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter Sunday to put the game away and match their TD total in the previous three games combined.Washington Commanders 27–34 Atlanta FalconsMichael Penix Jr. bounced back from his worst NFL start, Bijan Robinson had a career-high 181 yards from scrimmage and the Atlanta Falcons beat the short-handed Washington Commanders. The Falcons were coming off a 30-0 loss to the Panthers in which Penix and the offense were totally ineffective. Against the Commanders, Penix completed 20 of 26 passes for a career-high 313 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Robinson had 75 rushing yards on 17 carries and four catches for 106 yards. Marcus Mariota threw two TD passes for the Commanders, who were missing starting quarterback Jayden Daniels and top receiver Terry McLaurin. Both teams are 2-2 this season.Carolina Panthers 13–42 New England PatriotsMarcus Jones had an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown, Drake Maye added two touchdown passes and ran for another, and the New England Patriots (2-2) rolled to a 42-13 win over the Carolina Panthers (1-3). TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson added touchdown runs and Jones had a 61-yard punt return that set up another TD to help the Patriots avoid their fifth straight 1-3 start. The Patriots were turnover-free while going 4 for 4 in the red zone.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York GiantsUS sportsKansas City ChiefsBaltimore RavensDallas CowboysGreen Bay PackersnewsShareReuse this content"

Can it?With three years to go, experts agree that the city has set bold goals and faces steep challengesLois Beckettin Los AngelesMon 29 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 10.45 EDTShareHosting the summerOlympicsused to be a dream for many global cities, but it is now seen by many as more of a nightmare. There’s the cost of hosting –$10bn and up, in recent years – the displacement of local residents, the environmental toll, and the risk of being left, likeRio de JaneiroorAthens, with major debt and crumbling Olympic stadiums.In the decade sinceLos Angelessecured itsbidfor the summer 2028 games, the city’s leaders have promised they will do it differently, and that Los Angeles is prepared to deliver world-class Olympics andParalympicgames in its “sunny, ideal weather”, all while keeping costs, environmental damage, and community disruption to a minimum.This would be a challenge in any context, but it has grown far more difficult recently. Los Angeles has spent much of 2025 in crisis. The number of Hollywood projects being filmed in the region hasdroppeddramaticallyin recent years, leaving the region’s entire economy shaky. Then, in January, historically damagingwildfiresmade worse by the climate crisis burned down 16,000 homes and other buildings and killed 31 people. In June, federal agents began staging aggressive immigration raids across southern California, leaving many of the region’s millions of Latino residentsterrifiedof sudden arrest. In response toprotestsover the immigration raids,Donald Trumpsent in thenational guardand USmarines, and he and his officials have engaged in repeated attacks on the leadership of California governorGavin Newsomand Los Angeles mayorKaren Bass.View image in fullscreenView of balloons above a crowd outside the entrance to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during the opening ceremony for the Olympics in Los Angeles, California, on 28 July 1984.Photograph: Howard Ruffner/Getty ImagesWith LA facing so many pressing environmental and political problems, some southern California residents arepubliclyquestioningwhether investing massive resources in the summer 2028 Olympics makes sense.City and state leaders are staying firm:Los Angeles, the home of “many of the greatest storytellers on earth”, of Venice Beach volleyball and palm-tree lined Sunset Boulevard, is ready and willing to host the 2028 summer games.With less than three years to go, experts agree that the city has set bold goals and faces steep challenges. But it is also doing well in some areas, opening the possibility that the city might break even on hosting the games, offering itself once again as a model for a smooth and budget-friendlyOlympic Games.That is, of course, if Trump doesn’t disrupt the effort.Break even or break down?Some recent summer Olympics hosts, including Brazil in 2016 and Greece in 2004, ended the games burdened by debt – and doubts over whether hosting the games was worth the tremendous cost to taxpayers.Los Angeles, in contrast, is aiming to repeat the success of the city’s 1984 Olympics, whichmade a profit of $223mand created a new model of financial prudence for Olympic host cities. Pulling that off is crucial: the city is alreadyfacinganearly $1bn budget deficitthis year, with more economic woes on the horizon.While the current budget estimate for the 2028 games has grown to nearly$7.15bn, organizers are aiming to cover that cost with corporate deals, licensing deals, ticket sales, and contributions from the IOC.If costs go over budget or other sources of revenue fail, Los Angeles and California taxpayers will ultimately be on the hook: the city signed a contract with the IOC agreeing tocover the first $270min cost overruns, while the state of California will cover the next $270m, and Los Angeles taxpayers will have to fund the remainder.View image in fullscreenLos Angeles police arrest immigration raid demonstrators on 11 June.Photograph: Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesBut organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic committee, a privately funded non-profit, say they are on track to deliver the $2.5bn in corporate sponsorship deals needed to make their plan work.“We’ve driven significant commercial progress this year by securing 12 new partnerships to date, with more to come, and anticipate closing in on $2 billion in revenue by the end of this year with confidence that momentum will continue to build,” an LA28 spokesperson said in a statement.Aiding LA in its goal to stay debt-free is its ambition to build as little new infrastructure as possible.The city made its existing sports and hospitality infrastructure a center of its bid to host a lower-cost games, highlighting its wide range of already-built facilities, from the SoFi stadium, which has hosted the Super Bowl, to Dodger stadium, to the Los Angeles Coliseum at the University of Southern California, which hosted the 1932 Olympic Games. A Universal Studios backlot where Back to the Future was filmed willhost squash games; the stunning beaches of San Clemente in Orange county will host surfing.LA28 to break longstanding tradition with corporate venue names at GamesRead more“The 2028 Games will mark the first time in Olympics history that no new permanent venues will be built to host the Games,” USC announced in a press release touting its participation.Unlike in Paris, where an “Olympic Village” for athletes was constructed from scratch in a low-income area north of the city, Olympic athletes in LA will be housed at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, while the global news media covering the games will be housed at the USC. The city’s massive hotel, tourist infrastructure, and theme park infrastructure is already poised to host millions of visitors. Even experts who tend to be Olympics skeptics say those already-built, already-operating facilities put Los Angeles in a much better position than many other host cities.In fact, the city’s infrastructure puts Los Angeles in a pretty good financial position, said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist who wrote a book on the “economic gamble” of hosting the Olympic games or the World Cup.“At the end of the day, I think there’s a decent chance that LA is going to break even,” Zimbalist said.‘A no-car games’ – or at least a ‘transit-first games’When Bass told interviewers during the 2024 Paris Olympics that Los Angeles was aiming to deliver a “no-car games”, many listeners were shocked (the Guardian evenwrote about it). Was Los Angeles, city of bumper-to-bumper traffic that makes driving across town during rush hour impossible, really claiming it would deliver fans to the Olympics using only public transportation?The answer was “yes” at the beginning: the city’s official bid to host the Olympics described its aim “that 100% of ticketed spectators travel to competition venues by public transport or Games transport systems designed specifically for spectators, such as shuttle bus systems”.But with the games three years away, the official rhetoric about public transportation is already being watered down. The mayor’s office has since described the Olympics as a “transit-first Games” that will also “promote the use of zero-emissions vehicles”.“The Games have always been transit-first. Mayor Bass has been taking urgent action to improve public transit in the region, including by securing funding to electrify Metro buses and strengthen critical infrastructure,” a spokesperson for the mayor’s office said in a statement.One of the recently announcedcorporate sponsorsof LA28 is Uber, which was named the “official rideshare and on-demand delivery partner”. Another was Archer, an electricair tax companythat aims to transport “VIPs, fans, and stakeholders”.“LA28 is committed to hosting a transit-first Games that prioritizes moving athletes, fans and games personnel effectively and efficiently to trainings and competitions while keeping LA residents moving throughout the region,” a spokesperson said, describing the use of Uber and Archer as “a key part of that plan”.LA28’s recently released sustainability plan did reiterate one factor designed toradically limit the use of carsat the 2028 games: “No spectator parking will be available at or near most Los Angeles area venues,” it noted.View image in fullscreenVehicles travel along the 110 freeway in downtown Los Angeles, California, on 17 October 2023.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the city has made progress with some key new transit developments, including finally extending its metro line to the Los Angeles airport.“The vast majority of what’s being invested is being invested for the long-term health of transportation in LA,’ said Joshua Schank, the former chief innovation officer for theLA Metro system, and now a transportation consultant.“Any time you have a major infrastructure undertaking, there’s going to be projects that are behind schedule,” he said. “ I think setting ambitious goals is a good thing.”Schank said that many transit advocates see the attempt to hold a transit-first Olympics as a huge win for transit advocates – no matter how the attempt plays out.“This is an opportunity for people to come to LA and experience the city differently than it’s ever been experienced before,” he said.And, if the Olympics public transit “goes well”, it could build support for public transit in the future, Schank said.One troubling sticking point is how the city is going to get funding to pay for an estimated 2,700 energy-efficient buses and the workers to drive them, a cornerstone of the current transit plan for the games. (Buses were a key part of thesmooth functioning of the 1984 games.) The city is currently hoping the department of transportation will come through with $2bn for the buses, part of anoverall $3.2bn federal funding request. The federal government provided support for supplemental bus programs to move spectators at the 1996 and 2002 US Olympic Games, a spokesperson for LA28 noted.The IOC handed LA the Olympics. Now Trump is weaponizing them | Jules BoykoffRead moreWhile Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has offered somehopeful rhetoricin a letter in June, an LA Metro spokesperson told the Guardian it had no new updates to share from the department or the administration since then.“In the short term I don’t doubt [Trump will] put political pressure on for a variety of reasons,” said Daniel Durbin, the director of the Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media & Society at the University of Southern California. “I really do believe, in the end, the federal government will come through with money and support.”“It’s going to be nerve-racking,” he added. “ I think there will be a lot of political infighting before the money comes.”Another major concern for local organizers has been LA’s most vulnerable populations. Olympic host cities often prioritize looking prosperous and attractive to international visitors – which can mean trying to cover up or even raze neighborhoods that are struggling. During the 1984 Olympics, the Los Angeles policespoke openlyabout efforts to “sanitize” the city byhiding homeless peoplefrom sight.“In Rio, they displaced 77,000 people who lived in the favelas,” said Zimbalist, the economist who has written several books about the Olympics. “In Atlanta, in 1996, they displaced tens of thousands of people who were living in the central city where they ended up building the Olympic Village. They tore down two neighborhoods that were minority neighborhoods–Black and brown people living there, and that’s very common.”View image in fullscreenHomeless people and tents are seen on a sidewalk on 24 July in Los Angeles, California.Photograph: VCG/Getty Images“In addition to tearing down neighborhoods and forcing people to be displaced: they build walls, so people traveling to Olympic events don’t see the poverty behind the walls and the television cameras don’t pick up the poverty behind the walls,” he added.For 2028, Los Angeles has pledged not to displace local residents in order to impress tourists. But activists and community members are worried that the city will not keep that promise, particularly when it comes to harsh treatment of unhoused people.There’s recent precedent for these fears: During the 2022 Super Bowl, activists accused LA officials of trying to “disappear the poor from the streets” when city employees destroyed a camp near SoFi stadium where unhoused people had been living in advance of the big game.Los Angeles has also pledged to host a green games – as much as is possible for an event with a massive carbon footprint from spectators’ airplane travel to the city. The Los Angeles 2028 committee has pledged to improve further on the carbon reductions of the 2024 Paris Games, producing an additional 10% reduction in the games’ carbon footprint compared to Paris, according to asustainability planreleased this summer.The Paralympics are coming to LA. But has the US done enough to guarantee success?Read moreSome environmental activists are hoping the 2028 Olympics can be used as a “point of leverage” to get Los Angeles to act on its most pressing problems – such as the relativelack of tree canopyor other shadein many of the city’s lower-income neighborhoods, which Shade LA, a partnership between UCLA and different public agencies, aims to improve by the Olympics.How much change that will bring is far from clear. “What’s missing right now is a firm commitment from the city and Olympic organizers – a number, a budget, something we can leverage,” Marcos Trinidad, a senior director of forestry at TreePeople, an advocacy organization, toldthe Los Angeles Timesin August.Then, of course, there is Trump, whose intense enthusiasm forhosting the Olympicsnear the end of his second term is matched only by the volatility he brings to the planning process.From Trump’s sweepingtravel ban, to his public, personal battles with Los Angeles officials, to his choice to his administration’s recentattacks onfree speech, the president is creating many hurdles to a smoothly functioning event.“Even if Trump doesn’t do anything directly that would hurt the LA 28 effort, he has created a lot of enmity internationally, and a lot of revulsion,” Zimbalist said. “There are a lot of people who won’t come because they’re politically not willing to support the Trump government by spending money here. We’ve already seen tourism in the US go down appreciably. That’s another big threat.”But in the end, Durbin, the media expert, argued, Trump will probably do what he can to make the games a success: “I don’t think an individual of his type and his position is going to want to have his legacy tarnished by an absolutely abysmal Olympics.”Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Los AngelesOlympic GamesCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A revitalised West Ham earned a point at Everton, but deserved more after a fine second-half performance.It is a green shoot of hope, which did not look forthcoming before the break when Everton held a lead thanks to Michael Keane’s header. West Ham equalisedthrough Jarrod Bowen’s superb strikeand from then on were the most likely winners. It was not to be for Nuno but he knows this point and performance give him a platform to build on.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“I love it, it is my life,” Nuno said of coaching. “This is just a very small step forward for us. We are starting now with a lot of work in front of us, but we are delighted with the challenge.”After a couple of training sessions with his new charges, Nuno deployed his favoured 4-2-3-1 formation. The players were adapting to the new system as each second ticked by, offering intensity to impress their new coach, but were outplayed byEvertonin the early stages.If West Ham are at the design stage, Everton are becoming a well-oiled machine under David Moyes. This helped the hosts dominate early on, controlling possession and moving the ball across the pitch as they looked to find gaps. Beto and Iliman Ndiaye had chances but sent their efforts straight at Alphonse Areola while Everton were on top.There is plenty of individual quality at Nuno’s disposal and it is his job to maximise its potential and form a cohesive unit. Graham Potter paid the price for not consistently getting the best out of players but he could also point the finger at a disjointed recruitment policy that began long before his arrival. The former West Ham head coach will be irritated that he did not have Crysencio Summerville available for much of his tenure because the winger was the visitors’ best outlet, causing problems by driving at Jake O’Brien down Everton’s right that persisted throughout the night.View image in fullscreenMichael Keane heads the ball beyond the reach of Alphonse Areola.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/ShutterstockWest Ham were conservative, as Nuno demands. Everton pushed them back and an opener felt inevitable. It arrived through a perfect inswinging cross from the left by James Garner, which an unmarked Keane rose highest to head home over the goalkeeper, leaving Nuno frustrated by his side’s indiscipline. Moyes has added more flair and quality to his squad for this season but Keane is quickly becoming one of his most dependable players in both boxes, an impressive turnaround for someone who was previously maligned. It was, however, the last real threat of the night from Everton as they allowed West Ham back into the match.At this point, Nuno might have been wondering if he should have spent more time off practising the handpan and riding horses. Instead, he is trying to drag a struggling side out of the relegation zone. Unfortunately for Nuno, one thing he cannot remedy are the constant mistakes that have been made by those above the coaching and playing staff. There is growing discontent among the West Ham supporters, who chanted “sack the board”, “we want our club back” and more explicit things aimed at the owner, David Sullivan, and the hierarchy. “It’s our main priority that we come closer to our fans,” Nuno said. “We have to deliver so they can appreciate the work of the boys. It’s a nice moment for us moving forward.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Summerville almost levelled after capitalising on an error from O’Brien. The winger, aided by El Hadji Malick Diouf, terrorised the Everton full-back throughout the game. Diouf created the equaliser, swinging in a cross which Keane flicked straight to Bowen, who proved his talismanic status through a fine touch and sublime finish beyond Jordan Pickford. He kissed the badge in front of the away end and took the acclaim.West Ham were on top at that point and their momentum built, forcing Everton, who drifted out of the contest, into mistakes and Pickford into saves, but they could not find a winner. If it was not for some last-ditch blocks, West Ham might have secured only their second victory of the season, the first coming against Nuno at the City Ground. Either way, Nuno knows nothing compares with the joys and intensity of being aPremier Leaguehead coach.

Slot’s side conceded two in the first six games of last season’s title-winning season. The introduction of two new full backs, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, has been cited as a contributory factor as Liverpool adapt to the end of the Trent Alexander-Arnold/Andy Robertson era. But Slot insists the problem is collective, and identified Liverpool’s set-piece defending as in need of improvement after Crystal Palace scored from twoto beat the championson Saturday.It’s early, but every Premier League title contender already looks flawedRead moreTheLiverpoolhead coach said: “One of our strengths last season was keeping the other team away from our goal and normally that doesn’t start with your defenders. Look into more details – we’ve conceded four goals from set pieces this season. We’ve changed our full-backs – we’ve changed a bit more than our full-backs – but when I think about the goals we’ve conceded the first thing that comes to mind is not that the full-backs are a problem.“It’s always a team performance. Last season we hardly conceded because 11 players worked incredibly hard to stop the other team having a chance. They are working incredibly hard this season but set pieces are a game in themselves sometimes. We have to go back to that and we have to prove in the upcoming games and months that we don’t normally concede from set pieces. It’s something we definitely have to improve. I see teams in the Premier League that win games by set pieces and we lose games by set pieces.”Galatasaray, Liverpool’s opponents in theChampions Leagueon Tuesday, scored 24 set-piece goals out of a total of 91 last season, although that figure includes penalties. Slot, who left Federico Chiesa out of the travelling squad due to a “little niggle”, believes set-pieces are becoming increasingly decisive.He added: “More and more in football it is becoming a set-piece game. It is a style you see more and more, especially in the Premier League because you can do much more such as attack a goalkeeper or even touch a goalkeeper and it’s not a foul. I knowGalatasarayare strong at set pieces but we have been a force at set pieces last season. We won our last Champions League game with a set-piece from Virgil [van Dijk].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not quite five months since Tottenham last came north of the Arctic Circle and, for all that Thomas Frank insisted this is a “new situation”,that previous meeting with Bodø/Glimtin the semi-final of the Europa League can not but colour this one in the league phase of the Champions League.There was an odd echo, too, in the buildup. Back then, the Glimt full-back Fredrik Sjøvold was dismissive of Tottenham’s pressing, which clearly riled Ange Postecoglou.Arsenal’s late heroics at Newcastle and peerless Palace beat Liverpool – Football WeeklyRead moreFrank is not somebody who gets riled, but he seemed taken aback by a (non-critical) comment from the Bodø goalkeeper Nikita Haikin expressing surprise at how much focus Spurs place on long throws and set-plays. A third of goals come from set-plays, Frank pointed out; why would Spurs not try to use them? “Set pieces are extremely important.”Creativity, though, has been a problem for Tottenham as their flying start has yielded to a slightly more difficult phase. They lie fourth in the table, but are ninth in the Premier League for chance creation.“Last year,” said Frank, “most of the games, it was [Dejan] Kulusevski, [James] Maddison, Sonny [Heung-min] and Dom[inic Solanke] who played. Now we have more or less a new front four and they are doing very well. Maybe we are creating more chances, dominating a bit more. All the right signs are there.”It will be some time before Solanke is available. He sustained an ankle injury in the summer and has been restricted to two substitute appearances in the league this season. An injection during the last international break failed to resolve the problem so he will have what Frank referred to as “a small procedure” that is likely to keep him out for a few more weeks. Cristian Romero did not travel for precautionary reasons, while Randal Kolo Muani is just getting over a dead leg.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank dismissed any significance the artificial pitch may have.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersBodø’s artificial pitch, inevitably, has drawn a lot of the attention, but Frank was determined to play down its significance. “It’s the same in Denmark, when I was coach for Brøndby, we were facing Nordjylland at that time. It was also a different surface. It’s the same today. It’s fine. They’re good here, they’re very good at home.“There’s a lot of talk about the pitch. I rather want to praise the team, the Bodø team, and their coach, what they do. Because they do it quite consistently, home and away, the way they play.”Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreFrank turned down the opportunity to have his side train on the pitch. “If we have training here and we want to do a little bit of tactical work, with all due respect it would be a little bit more obvious what we would do. That’s the thing we like to keep for ourselves.“If we train here, for how long we are allowed, 45 minutes? Is that going to make a difference? I know the surface is different. If you really want to get used to it, you need to train here day in, day out as Bodø do.”Even at this short remove it is hard to fathom just how tense that game last season seemed at the time.Spurs led 3-1from the first leg, but, largely because they conceded seven minutes from time when apparently in complete control, there was a fear they could somehow mess it up.Tottenham’s history plus Angeball was a potent brew. Or rather the memory of Angeball, because Postecoglou had by then long since abandoned his ultra-attacking principles for something more orthodox and more effective. A scrappy game was settled by goals from Solanke and Pedro Porro in the space of six minutes midway through the second half. It was a functional way of winning, but it was the penultimate stage on the journeyto triumph in Bilbao, so it stands as part of a glorious narrative.For Frank, an awayChampions Leaguegame against the same opponents simultaneously matters less and will probably be judged more harshly, but no team is ever going to rebound from finishing 17th in the Premier League directly to the sunlit uplands.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurThomas FrankBodø/GlimtEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

That means the Israel men’s and women’s national teams would be excluded from the Nations League andMaccabi Tel Avivwould be removed from the Europa League this season.The World Cup, however, is a Fifa competition, for which Uefa organises the qualifying format and fixtures within Europe. This is done “in collaboration” with Fifa but only subject to the global governing body’s approval. Acting unilaterally to removeIsraelwould be a politically complicated decision, and one that appears to have been avoided. In the absence of a wider ban, however, Uefa would be in the unusual position of staging World Cup qualifiers for a country otherwise excluded.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.If Israel were blocked from Uefa’s competitions, the spotlight would spring back to Fifa. Last week a US state department spokesperson warned that it would “absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel’s national soccer team from the World Cup”. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, hasformed a close relationship with Donald Trumpin the buildup to the World Cup next year, which the US is co-hosting.Norway and Italy are due to face Israel in qualifying during the upcoming international break, which begins next Monday. Amnesty International in Norway last weekend called on the national football association to increase its pressure on Uefa, anda 24 hour general strikewas held in Italy last week in protest at the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.Asked last week about the prospect of Italy boycotting their fixture, Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on theUefaexco, said it “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. Israel are third in their qualifying group, level on points with second-placed Italy, having played a game more, with the runners-up granted a place in the World Cup playoffs.Gravina’s point was echoed by Norway’s FA president, Lise Klaveness, who feels Israel should be banned. “I work on the issue from a principled standpoint, but we will not boycott on our own,” Klaveness, a Uefa exco member, said on the Norwegian podcast Pop and Politics. “A boycott would only result in Israel going to the World Cup instead of us. In general, we are now working for Israel to be sanctioned.”View image in fullscreenMaccabi Tel Aviv are due to play their second Europa League game on Thursday.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersNorway are believed to be among the nations calling on Uefa to convene an extraordinary meeting of its exco this week to take a decision on the matter. It is understood the growing impetus behind a resolution is in part being driven by the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin. Any meeting is expected be held remotely and could be convened at short notice.Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote. Insiders suggest that if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with very few members of Uefa’s 19-strong exco expected to object.Uefa, even if it imposed a ban, would continue to be responsible for organising Israel’s World Cup qualifiers, including providing match officials, security and other staff for their “home” games in Hungary.Maccabi Tel Aviv are due to play Dinamo Zagreb in their secondEuropa Leaguetie on Thursday, and that game is expected to go ahead. It could, though, be Maccabi’s final involvement in the competition.

Players who have won a combined 58 trophies in their careers, including Champions League, La Liga and Premier League triumphs.Past their prime? Certainly. But over the hill? Hardly. Modric, at 40 years old, had started Milan’s first four league games, taking more touches (329) and creating more shooting opportunities (19, per fbref.com) than any teammate. De Bruyne, at 34, was the onlyNapoliplayer with more than one goal so far this season, having struck in wins over Sassuolo and Fiorentina.European football: Koundé and Lewandowski on the mark in Barcelona’s comeback winRead moreEven those numbers were reductive. If Modric’s shirt had quickly become the bestseller in Milan’s club shop, overtaking that of Rafael Leão, it was also because he said things fans yearned to hear. “Milan can’t be satisfied with mediocrity,” Modric insisted on signing his contract. “The club needs to set itself the biggest targets possible: winning titles and competing with the best teams in the world.”We might remind ourselves here that Milan finished eighth last season. They had changed manager since then, bringing back Massimiliano Allegri to replace Sérgio Conceição, but still, expectations were not high when their CEO George Furlani told a press conference in June that there was “no need for a revolution” of the playing squad. Perhaps Modric helped shift his thinking, too.By the time this summer’s transfer window shut, only nine of the 27 players who made up Milan’s squad at the start of last season had been retained. TheRossoneri’s new sporting director, Igli Tare, had completely reconstructed the roster, bidding farewell to first-teamers including Tijjani Reijnders, Theo Hernández and Malick Thiaw while adding the likes of Modric, Adrien Rabiot, Pervis Estupiñán, Ardon Jashari, Samuele Ricci and Christopher Nkunku.Yet it has been a reinvention of familiar faces, as much as the introduction of new ones, that has transformed this team. Alexis Saelemaekers, after a year on loan at Roma, has returned to start as right wing-back in Allegri’s 3-5-2. Christian Pulisic has been pushed forward into a second striker role.View image in fullscreenChristian Pulisic fires home to take his side 2-0 up in the 31st minute.Photograph: Claudio Villa/AC Milan/Getty ImagesAfter all the talk of Modric and De Bruyne, it was Saelemaekers and Pulisic instead who set the course of Sunday night’s game, combining for a third-minute goal. Receiving a pass from Estupiñán inside Milan’s own half, Pulisic ran away from the defender Luca Marianucci over the next 50 yards before squaring the ball for Saelemaekers to finish on the far side.Napoli had arrived at San Siro with four wins from their first four Serie A games, yet there were hints of vulnerability around the edges. A disappointing showing in the Champions Leagueagainst Manchester City– albeit defined by an early red card for Giovanni Di Lorenzo – was followed by a surprisingly wobbly 3-2 win at home to Pisa.Saelemaekers’s early goal allowed Milan to set the rules of engagement. Both these teams are happiest to stay compact and profit by punishing opponents who overstretch themselves. Milan were all too happy to be the ones who sat back and invited Napoli on to them.It was easy to foresee a snatched second goal on the counter. In fact, Milan were able to claim one in more mundane fashion, punishing slack defending in a moment when Napoli had plenty back to repel them. Strahinja Pavlovic was advanced far too easily down the left, before centring the ball to an unmarked Youssouf Fofana, who laid it off for Pulisic to fire home.Napoli were offered a way back into the game when Estupiñán gave away a penalty at the start of the second half, hauling back Di Lorenzo as he attacked the rebound from a Scott McTominay header. The former Brighton player was sent off following a VAR review. De Bruyne swept his spot-kick into the bottom corner to bring Napoli back into the game at 2-1. There was still half an hour left to play.And yet the champions could not make their player advantage count. Milan bunkered up and Napoli could not break them down. Their closest chances at an equaliser were a pair of long-range shots by David Neres in injury time.View image in fullscreenMassimiliano Allegri’s side are level on points with Napoli and Roma.Photograph: Spada/LaPresse/ShutterstockDid Antonio Conte get his substitutions wrong? He withdrew De Bruyne, McTominay and Rasmus Højlund all at once in the 73rd minute, and Matteo Politano soon afterwards.These were like-for-like changes, introducing capable players off the bench, but it was hard to shake the impression of a manager with his mind on Wednesday’s Champions League game against Sporting. Conte’s initial team selection had already raised eyebrows, the starting centre-back Sam Beukema rested at a time when two alternatives – Amir Rrahmani and Alessandro Buongiorno – were already out injured along with both of Napoli’s top two left-backs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was his head that nudged the first of Neres’s injury-time efforts on to the bar. He had the last touch of the game, too, hoofing the ball into touch after getting told off for shouting at the referee to check his watch.He led the celebrations, roaring at and embracing his teammates. As spellbinding as it is to watch him in possession –“EVERY TOUCH by Luka Modric”videos remain a popular choice on YouTube – there was something thrilling about this post-game version, too, still so evidently in love with his sport, with being part of a team, with winning.Victory took Milan top, finishing the weekend level with Napoli and Roma on 12 points. Is it too soon to consider them title contenders? Allegri said afterwards that his team “still need 64 points to qualify for the Champions League”, an idiosyncratically precise framing but also a reminder of how young this season is.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowCagliari 0-2 Inter, Como 1-1 Cremonese, Juventus 1-1 Atalanta, Lecce 2-2 Bologna, Milan 2-1 Napoli, Pisa 0-0 Fiorentina, Roma 2-0 Verona, Sassuolo 3-1 UdineseMondayParma v Torini (5.30pm BST), Genoa v Lazio (7.45pm)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Still, the early signs from his Milan are promising. Fikayo Tomori spoke before kick-off about how Allegri has restored defensive structure, stopping players from chasing the ball around the pitch and focusing them on not leaving gaps behind.A familiar Allegri formula: defend well and trust talented players to make things happen at the other end. Viral images of Leão, on as a late substitute, dribbling with six Napoli players chasing him, were a reminder that this team has scope to get more dangerous going forward. The Portuguese was making his first league appearance of the seasonafter a calf injury.For all the fascination with Milan’s retooled squad, their greatest upgrade this summer may simply have been to bring back Allegri, 14 years after he earned his firstSerie Atitle with them. He followed that up by replacing Conte at Juventus, where he went on to win another five.Between them, these two managers have claimed 11 of the past 15 Scudetti. It would hardly be a shock if one of them triumphed again this time around. Allegri this season is enjoying the same advantage that Conte enjoyed last term, leading a team that failed to qualify for Europe and can put all its focus into domestic success. Having Luka Modric in your team, on top of that, can hardly hurt.PosTeamPGDPts1AC Milan56122Napoli55123Roma54124Juventus54115Inter Milan5696Atalanta5697Cremonese5298Como5289Bologna50710Cagliari50711Udinese5-3712Sassuolo5-1613Torino4-7414Lazio40315Fiorentina5-3316Verona5-6317Genoa4-2218Parma4-4219Pisa5-3220Lecce5-62Explore more on these topicsSerie ASportblogMilanNapoliEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A series of bright displays have impressed so far but she had little to show for it from the first three games in terms of scoring. Her winner against Everton this weekend, therefore, would have come as a huge relief. It was an eye-catching performance from the 19-year-old who was at the heart of everything Brighton did in the 1-0 victory – a constant threat who was happy to drop deep to impact play, strong in her duels (she won the most) and a presence when Brighton needed to defend their own box. Her goal subjected Everton to a third straight defeat as Brian Sørensen continues to work out the best formula for his team.Sophie DowneyWSL roundup: Chelsea stay unbeaten as Agyemang helps Brighton to narrow winRead moreArsenal struggle to pick up momentumIt is only September, so it feels somewhat silly to be questioning Arsenal’s title challenger credentials, but four points dropped in their past two games is far from where Renee Slegers’s side would like to be. Particularly as champions Chelsea dropped just six points across their entire campaign last term. The draw against Manchester United could be somewhat forgiven as Marc Skinner’s side are organised and defensively robust, but the 1-1 draw against Aston Villa on Saturday was a more humbling point picked up. Arsenal dominated against the visiting team at the Emirates Stadium but just could not build on their early lead, which came courtesy of a Villa error. “We have more shots [than against Manchester United] at least, which of course we want at home,” said Slegers. “We always look at how many we have on target and of course it’s not enough. We had more possession and solutions today but we didn’t have enough urgency in and around the box today and when the game is 1-0 the opposition always believe they can get back in it.”Suzanne WrackMatch report:Arsenal 1-1 Aston VillaView image in fullscreenArsenal’s manager, Renée Slegers, leads a team huddle after their draw against Aston Villa.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesInexplicable red card hampers HammersWest Ham’s woes went from bad to worse against the champions, Chelsea, on Sunday, with a chaotic and disengaged defence partly responsible for Rehanne Skinner’s side going three goals down within 15 minutes. Desperate to regroup, they were dealt a further blow eight minutes later when Inès Belloumou inexplicably pulled Alyssa Thompson’s hair, eliciting a straight red card from the referee. It was a moment of madness that plunged the Hammers into deeper water; the east London side already sit bottom of the table without a win. That the scoreline ended at 4-0 is a testament to their ability to get their heads back in the game on the one hand, but Chelsea were also able to relax a little, their three goal cushion courtesy of Aggie Beever-Jones, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Erin Cuthbert, and then added to by Wieke Kaptein. This could be a long season for the Hammers.SWTaylor changes taking time to bed inLiverpool struggled to keep hold of the ball during their home defeat against Manchester United, particularly during the first half, and after an improved second half, Gareth Taylor’s team managed only 38.3% of the possession overall. That is something Taylor – who was appointed on 8 August – is trying to change as he tries to build a new style of play at the Merseyside club. “It doesn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Everyone wants to try and play in a possession-based team but trying to get it is really tough. Some of it, you have to give United a little bit of credit for, in the way they pressed. But certainly we needed to be better in that, definitely. There are learnings from this game, for sure, but [being] possession-based, that’s really hard, it takes time. The signs have been positive so far but we’ve got a lot of work to do.”Tom GarryMatch report:Liverpool 0-2 Manchester Unitedskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a lacklustre 2024-25 season, there would have been a few fears about how Martin Ho’s side might react to the recent and heavy Manchester City defeat. But they raced out of the blocks at the King Power Stadium with confidence to earn an important 2-1 victory. Two goals in six minutes were just rewards for the energy of their press that has become such a feature under Ho in these early weeks. Eveliina Summanen set the tempo from midfield, Olivia Holdt sparkled and stretched the defence, while the new striker Cathinka Tandberg continues to illustrate why the club were desperate to bring her in on deadline day.

However, she confidently struck twice from 12 yards to help her side to a 4-1 victory over London City on Sunday. The brace also saw her goal tally rise to three in four games. “It’s mentally challenging for her [Bunny] but it shows she’s a strong personality and has belief in herself,” Jeglertz said. “We believe in her by giving her the opportunity again so that’s very good for her. She’s now scored two and it will give her confidence.”Emillia HawkinsPosTeamPGDPts1Chelsea Women48122Man Utd Women410103Man City Women4794Tottenham Hotspur Women4095Arsenal Women4786Brighton & Hove Albion Women4377Everton Women4-138Leicester Women4-539London City Lionesses4-9310Aston Villa Women3-2211Liverpool FC Women3-6012West Ham Women4-120Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballChelsea WomenManchester United WomenManchester City WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenArsenal WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The “best season” of Ineos’s ownership of Nice correlated with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co being forcibly distanced from the club due to Uefa regulations. “They have beenso much better without our interference,” Ratcliffe admitted last season, as Niceachieved their highest league finish since 2017. With Nice and Manchester United no longer competing in the same European competition, Ineos regained operational control of the French club at the start of the summer and have only corroborated Ratcliffe’s previous assertion.Already out of the Champions League at the first hurdle having been outplayed by Benfica in the qualifiers at the start of August, Nice have lost three of their first six games in Ligue 1 as well as losing theirEuropa Leagueopener against Roma last Wednesday. “We can’t say that we’re swimming in joy and confidence,” the club’s manager, Franck Haise, said before their 1-1 draw against the newly promoted Paris FC on Sunday.Nice reach Champions League in the one season Jim Ratcliffe stays awayRead moreNice are swimming in troubled waters. Injuries have contributed to their substandard start. Although, when you are reliant on the 41-year-old Dante and the eternally injured Tanguy Ndombélé to make up the numbers, the problem is also in squad building. This is where Nice’s main issue lies. The sporting director, Florian Maurice, described the summer transfer window as “unpleasant”. From an accountancy perspective, the picture is rosy; they made €108m from player sales, the third-highest figure inLigue 1. But there was not been significant reinvestment and the signings they did make are not paying off.A third of Nice’s budget was spent on Isak Jansson, who looks ill-suited to the demands of Ligue 1 and was not exactly prolific at Rapid Vienna, either; Yehvann Diouf looks a shadow of the goalkeeper he was at Reims last season; Kevin Carlos is yet to score his first goal; and Salis Abdul Samed, who is trying to get his career back on track following an injury-hit spell at Sunderland last time around, is short of confidence.“We expect more,” Haise said last week. “That goes for other players, too; it isn’t just the signings.” But the new arrivals are failing to fill the voids, the largest of which was created by the departures of Evann Guessand and Gaëtan Laborde, Nice’s top two goalscorers last season. Between the ineffective Jansson, the struggling Carlos and Terem Moffi, whose prolific form forLorientin 2022 now looks to have been a flash in the pan, it is difficult to see where the goals are coming from.View image in fullscreenIsak Jansson has not exactly lit up Nice this season.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersIn search of solutions in the transfer window, Maurice turned to Manchester United but did not receive any help. “We envisaged things like asking them to sign a player and then loaning us back, but their priority was selling,” the Nice’s sporting director said. Nice have been treated with a level of ambivalence that would make theBlueCo-owned Strasbourg green with envy. “I don’t think that [the link between Chelsea and Strasbourg] is Manchester United’s model,” Maurice said. Between Nice and Strasbourg, the realities of multiclub ownership are starkly different.It wasn’t just movement of players that Nice sought over the summer – it was clarity. There has been a lack of communication from the owners about their continued commitment to the club, amid reports that the investment bank Lazard has been tasked with finding a buyer. The silence has been a source of frustration, as Haise admitted earlier this season. “Lots of us are waiting for the owners to speak,” said the manager, who conceded that he was“annoyed” by Ratcliffe’s disparaging comments about the clublast season. Ratcliffe made a rare appearance at the Allianz Riviera on Wednesday to watch Nice lose 2-1 against Roma in the Europa League, although he was not sitting alongside Maurice and the chief executive, Fabrice Bocquet, in the stands.Our lost teenage boys need mentors and role models. Football can helpRead moreRatcliffe’s controversial assertion that Nice’s standard of football is “not high enough for me to get excited” perhaps now has relevance, unlike last season when the comment was originally made. The untouchable Haise is cobbling together the elements as best as he can, although he says he is “no magician” and “can understand the concerns” of the fans.Their concerns are certainly warranted. Nice are 12th in the 18-team league after games against Toulouse,Auxerre, Le Havre, Nantes, Brest and Paris FC. “It is insufficient,” Haise said on Sunday. “Two wins, one draw and three losses against teams that don’t often play at the top of the table. We expect better, but it is our reality. We have to up our level. We know that the level of opponents will also increase.”In their next four games they playMonaco, Lyon, Lille and PSG, all of whom are in the top six. For a club that is questioning its long-term fate there are plenty of issues to address in the short term, but it may be decisions made in the recent past, by Ineos and the wider management at Nice, that leave their ambitions for European qualification for next season already in peril.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowNice 1-1 Paris FCAngers 0-2 BrestLille 0-1 LyonMetz 0-0 Le HavreRennes 0-0 LensLorient 3-1 MonacoToulouse 2-2 NantesPSG 2-0 AuxerreStrasbourg 1-2 MarseilleWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsAfterdefeat inLe Classique,PSG returned to winning ways and regained top spot in Ligue 1 thanks to a comfortable 2-0 win against Auxerre. However, it was yet another victory that came at a cost, with Vitinha and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia withdrawn before half-time. Both are now doubts to face Barcelona on Wednesday. Injuries are seemingly contagious atLe Campusthis season – no doubt symptomatic of an extended season and curtailed pre-season. Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué, João Neves, Fabián Ruiz and Marquinhos are also on the sidelines. A second-string PSG side can suffice in Ligue 1; it may be a different story in Barcelona.Adi Hütter has expressed “dissatisfaction” after every Monaco performance this season. The Austrian concedes that his annoyance is “paradoxical” given that, going into the weekend’s action, his team were top of Ligue 1. “It is not good enough,” he said after a 5-2 win against Metz last week. There was neither the performance nor the result on Saturday, when they lost 3-1 against Lorient. Thilo Kehrer was harshly sent off in the first half, hobbling a team already struggling with injuries. Every first-team midfielder (Lamine Camara, Denis Zakaria, Aleksandr Golovin, Aladji Bamba and Paul Pogba) is unavailable due to injury or lack of fitness. But the poor performances preceded those absences, and the concern before they face Manchester City on Wednesday is justified.PosTeamPGDPts1PSG68152Lyon65153Marseille67124Monaco64125Strasbourg62126Lille64107Lens63108Rennes6-199Brest60710Toulouse6-2711Paris FC6-3712Nice6-3713Lorient6-5714Auxerre6-4615Le Havre6-2516Nantes6-2517Angers6-3518Metz6-82This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Guardian Sport NetworkEuropean club footballNiceParis Saint-GermainAuxerreMonacoEuropa LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were available for the first set of Prem games last weekend, but could not take part in the two rounds of Prem Cup matches before that.Women’s Rugby World Cup writer awards: best player, best match – our verdictsRead moreAs a result, McCall believes that the England No 8 Tom Willis as well as the Scotland fly-half Fergus Burke – regulations apply to all internationals whose summer tours ended in mid-July – were not sufficiently prepared for the start of the club season, claiming they began the campaign cold. McCall pointed to how some clubs, such as Bath, arranged pre-season friendlies and fielded largely youth sides in the Prem Cup, but said it should not require loopholes to ensure players are battle-hardened.In the case of the British & Irish Lions, whose third Test against Australia was on 2 August, they are not available until the third round of the Prem season. Clubs can apply for dispensation, however, and Owen Farrell was allowed to start the season with Saracens having missed large spells with Racing 92 because of injury. It is understood he would have also been allowed to play in the Prem Cup.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje exceeded the 30-match limit for players last season.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesThe 10-week stand-down period was agreed in March and is designed to ensure sufficient rest periods after a campaign. Numerous players – including the England and Lions captain, Maro Itoje, and his Saracens teammate Ben Earl – exceeded the 30-match limit.“The RFU and Premiership Rugby dictate that you have to serve a 10-week period before your next game,” McCall said afterhis side’s 39-17 victory against Newcastlelast Friday. “For me, people therefore come into Premiership Rugby unprepared for the demands of the game.“Owen came off with some tightness. Ferg [Burke] was tight, but we couldn’t get him off. We need to look at that because if they had been able to play 20 or 30 minutes last weekend, you get ready for what a real match is like.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a huge privilege to be here and watch one of the best rugby occasions of all-time. Historic, special, incredible and many other words to describe an incredible tournament.“In my view and I have been involved in a few of these, we have been involved in the greatest Rugby World Cup of all-time. A tournament that delivered on every single level. It didn’t just raise the bar, it has gone stratospheric, broken records, changed perceptions and showcased the very best of our sport and our players.”Gilpin also added that he believed the men’s tournament could bring players’ personalities out more at their next World Cup, which is being held in Australia in 2027.“What stood out [during the 2025 tournament] the most was the power of personality,” he said. “The tournament has showed young people everywhere that in rugby you can be yourself. It’s a sport where individuality and diversity are celebrated, where old perceptions are now being challenged and overturned and a sport where everyone belongs.“A few weeks ago I sat here and said I thought the men’s game could learn a lot from this tournament, I think that is even clearer now. Greater accessibility and more personality creates more stars. That is what we need in our sport. It is the future of sport. This World Cup has proved that being yourself, being visible on social media, sharing opinions, engaging the fans and the media is not a distraction, it’s a performance-enabler because when players are happy they play their best rugby,”A record 5.8 million viewers tuned in on BBC One for the final, the most watched rugby game of the year in the UK, including the men’s Six Nations and the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia.The next women’s international competition is the Women’s Six Nations which kicks off on 11 April.

She seemed to be moving confidently towards one of the most impressive wins of her career.When it was time to close out victory against the world No 7 Jessica Pegula, however, Raducanu simply crumbled under pressure. After her positive start, Raducanu’s time in Beijing ended in a catastrophic loss as she failed to convert three match points before losing 3-6, 7-6 (9), 6-0 to Pegula in the third round.Raducanu spurns three match points in Korea defeat but GB roll on in BJK CupRead moreRaducanu’s front-running abilities have been a strength so far in her career, but this defeat is a second consecutive loss after holding multiple match points. Raducanu’s loss to the two-time grand slam champion Barbora Krejcikova 11 days ago in Seoul was eerily similar – the 22-year-old held two match points before rapidly falling away and losing 4-6, 7-6 (10), 6-1.She had burst into this match full of confidence, successfully disrupting Pegula’s clean, rhythmic shotmaking with her backhand slice, variation and defensive skills. When Pegula began to find her range and put Raducanu under significant pressure, the British No 1 showed her other improvements by serving precisely and striking her forehand brilliantly. She held off Pegula throughout an intense, high-quality second set before reaching match point at 6-5 in the tie-break.Having put herself in a winning position, Raducanu did not do much wrong on her match points. Pegula saved the first two with two astounding backhand down-the-line winners from defensive positions before injecting pace into a forehand to force a Raducanu error on the third. After leading 5-2 in the tie-break, Raducanu’s most significant error was a double fault at 5-4. Although she immediately recovered from it, Pegula clearly gained confidence from her opponent’s nerves.Closing out big matches is tough for all players. Everybody chokes at some point. The top players, however, are usually defined by how they react to these situations. The most concerning part of Raducanu’s performance was her lack of resilience as she fell away in the final set, her energy and intensity flatlining as Pegula eased to victory. Her response to squandering match points against Krejcikova in Seoul was identical.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu leaves the court after her match against Jessica Pegula at the China Open.Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty ImagesFor many players, the Asian swing signifies the final stretch of a long, arduous season, but this is a particularly meaningful tournament for Raducanu. This week marked Raducanu’s long-awaited tour-level debut in China, where her mother, Renee, is originally from. After nearly two months working with her new coach, Francisco Roig, Raducanu has clearly made improvements to her game but they will leave Beijing with the job of dissecting one of the toughest setbacks of her career.While Raducanu faltered, Sonay Kartal, the British No 3, continued her excellent form in Beijing by moving into the fourth round with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Maya Joint of Australia. Things had been difficult for Kartal after her run to the fourth round at Wimbledon, losing her subsequent three matches. However, after two positive matches in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, she has found an excellent run of form in Beijing and she is yet to drop a set.

A strike-rate of 47 on English soil is bettered only by Fred Trueman and Bob Willis among past greats.All this culminated in a player of the series performance during the 2023 Ashes, Woakes entering at 2-0 down and claiming 19 wickets to help to secure a draw.

None of this would have been possible without you.“To the fans, especially the ‘Barmy Army’, thank you for the passion, the cheers and the belief. To my coaches, teammates and everyone behind the scenes – both with England at Warwickshire, who helped me play for my country – your guidance and friendship has meant the world.”A one-club man to date, Woakes is in negotiations with Warwickshire over a new county contract. Having opted against surgery on his shoulder – something which gave him a slim chance of making the Ashes tour – he could yet appear in franchise T20 cricket this winter.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Such a close friendshipwith Rory McIlroymeans not only is sporting comparison inevitable but questions towards Lowry are routinely framed with the Northern Irishman in mind. What does Rory think, what would Rory say. Lowry takes it all in good spirit – the vast majority of the time – when he would be entitled to roll his eyes. That also applies to the rogue depiction of the hard-drinking Irishman who has a natural talent for his sport that removes a need for hard work. There are few more dedicated or serious performers than Lowry. He cares almost too much.McIlroy’s outstanding achievements in golf do not extend to what Lowry produced on Sunday. A stirring comeback from the USA had left Europe in serious danger of letting the Ryder Cup slip through a dozen pairs of hands. It was left to Lowryand a 6ft putt on the final green at Bethpage Blackto ensure at least a tie. The man American fans had called a Teletubby over the Ryder Cup’s earlier two days would enjoy the last, deafening laugh. “I still can’t believe it,” Lowry said on Monday morning.Ryder Cup 2025: Guardian writers select their standout momentsRead moreHad Lowry missed, Europe were staring at sporting disaster.His teammates were dropping like flies. If it was only natural to look at the negative, Lowry’s mindset was different. He had turned to his caddie, Darren Reynolds, earlier on the 18th hole. “I have a chance to do the coolest thing in my life here,” Lowry told his bag man. “I did it. And I’m very proud of myself.” On the green, Lowry thought of Martin Kaymer’s converted putt, in identical circumstances for Europe, at Medinah in 2012.Lowry has an uncanny knack of being at the epicentre of storied events. He was invited to the 2009 Irish Open as an amateur and won. When the Open Championship returned to Ireland a decade later, he prevailed again. Lowry’s latest moment in the sun came on the very day his brother’s wife was having a baby. The golfer’s father, Brendan, an All-Ireland football champion in 1982, looked on as the Bethpage putt dropped.Lowry’s celebration – so euphoric and so natural – was wonderfully endearing. He had to pause for air at the end. And to think, Shane once dreamed of following in Brendan’s sporting footsteps. He was instead destined to shine on a global stage.The plan did not involve it all coming down to Lowry of course. He was in match eight of 11 Sunday singles. Europe started the session needing only two points to retain the cup. Yet the very point of putting Lowry – plus Tyrrell Hatton and Robert MacIntyre – at the base of the draw was just in case their games were needed. “I didn’t envision myself going up the 18th needing a birdie to retain theRyder Cup,” Lowry admitted. “It was the worst two hours of my life. It was horrible.”Eagles, Donalds and bubbly: Ryder Cup 2025 – in picturesRead moreThere was also an element of redemption. Lowry had yearned to play in the Ryder Cup before receiving a wildcard pick for Whistling Straits in 2021. His debut, in partnership with McIlroy, involved a heavy defeat against Tony Finau and Harris English. Lowry lost in the singles against Patrick Cantlay as the USA inflicted a record defeat on Europe. Much is made of McIlroy’s tears in Wisconsin but Lowry was similarly distraught. “No matter how long I play, for the rest of my career I’ll want to be part of this team,” Lowry said at the time. Through a subsequent changing of the guard, Lowry has remained part of the European group who have won back-to-back cups.View image in fullscreenLowry is mobbed by fans as the celebrations get under way in earnest.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesLowry is hugely respected among his European teammates. He has influence and fuels camaraderie way beyond the golf course. He is a great storyteller, quick-witted and does a fine line in self-deprecation. The 38‑year‑old is fiercely loyal, not least towards McIlroy. Lowry is in fact central to everything that makes Europe so successful as a team; everything the USA cannot seem to get quite right.“I’m so proud of Shane,” McIlroy said. “I’m so grateful to have him in my life. Honestly, he put his arm around me on Saturday afternoon and he was a big reason we won that point. He has been immense this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What Shane did will stay with [him] for the rest of his career.”McIlroy’s assessment, as ever, is spot on. He was clearly tired during the fourball session on day two when Lowry stepped forward. It needn’t always be the Rory show. The big brother he never had helped out.“You think back to the Irish greats in the game, they have all holed putts to win the Ryder Cup and I got my moment,” Lowry added, in reference to Eamonn Darcy, Philip Walton, Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke. Lowry is proud of his heritage and his homeland.Thoughts will turn inevitably towards how Lowry might build on this. He has the ability to add to his solitary major success. In two years’ time, he will be back on Team Europe at Adare Manor. He is a future captain in waiting. But that big picture can wait. MacIntyre revealed he and Lowry planned to vanish into New York. It will prove impossible for either to remain invisible.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Titles may be lost in September but they are very rarely won. This past weekend, though, did feel like one where many of the prevailing narratives crystalised as Arsenaldug deepto win the sort of game they’ve become used to losing, Liverpool’s defensive shortcomingswere exposed as they lostfor the first time this campaign, Manchester Cityswept aside lesser oppositionin the manner of old and Chelseafell apart again.Liverpool have looked defensively shaky all season. Having been the team of control in the last campaign, making the unremarkable 2-0 win a trademark, they have become the side of the late winner, clinching games this season in the 88th, 94th, 100th, 83rd, 95th, 92nd and 85th minutes. That was never going to be sustainable, but the question was whether general performances would improve, or whether the late strikes would dry up.The 4-2-3-1 shape with Florian Wirtz playing centrally behind a striker was gone this weekend at Crystal Palace, with a return to the 4-3-3 of last season and Wirtz deployed on the left. That had seemed to add stability when it was used in the second half against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League, the Ryan Gravenberch – Alexis Mac Allister – Dominik Szoboszlai trio of last season returned to their positions. But it is not a quick fix; vulnerability has crept into Liverpool and Palace exposed it again and again, particularly before half-time. As so often under Arne Slot, Liverpool improved after the break, but it’s no exaggeration to say they could have been 3- or 4-0 down by then.The squad, as it did last season, still looks short of a defensive midfielder, but that does not explain why, even with the familiar three in the middle, Liverpool are so much more open than last year. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s significance, inverting from right-back, adding another degree of central security, has perhaps been generally underestimated. Five wins out of five at the beginning of the season, particularly when one of those games was at home toArsenaland one away to Newcastle, is a great start. But until Saturday, results had outstripped performances. If Liverpool are to retain their title, at least some of last season’s control needs to return.Arsenal have made a recent habit of failing to take opportunities but, after last week’s injury-time equaliser against Manchester City there came an injury-time winner against Newcastle tocut the gap at the top to two points. It wasn’t just about the result, though; it was also about overcoming the setback of VAR controversially overturning a penalty decision for them in the first half. Arsenal have over the past couple of seasons become a side with a tendency to get down on themselves, to react badly to misfortune or adversity; that happened to an extent at St James’ as early momentum was lost, but they still had enough to claim the win. Certainly the table looks – and the mood feels – very different now to how it would have done without the late goals in their last two games.A further three points back are Manchester City, who are at an uncertain stage of their development. They’ve lost twice already in the league and the low block they deployed in the draw at Arsenal waswithout precedentin Pep Guardiola’s time as management, but they have at least rediscovered the ability to sweep aside lesser opposition at home. Having beaten Manchester United comfortably – albeit with a more counterattacking approach than has been familiar – they followed up acomfortable winover 10-man Napoli with the sort of demolition of Burnley that used to be routine. Perhaps they were more reliant on an individual in Jérémy Doku than would once have been the case, but as they ran in late goals against opponents exhausted by an afternoon of chasing, it was possible to see something of the old swagger returning.Chelsea are just two points behind City but mired in self-doubt. Their only good league performance this season was in the 5-1 demolition of a compliant West Ham; otherwise they have seemed heavily reliant on Cole Palmer for creativity and, perhaps explicably given their injury issues, shaky at the back. There’s no real excuse in the fact that their two league defeats have come after having a man sent off; both red cards were for the denial of a goalscoring opportunity, one after a simple flick-on and the other after a player was caught in possession. Defensive shortcomings led to the red cards rather than being the result of them. Chelseamay be world championsbut at the moment they are miles off a domestic title challenge.All of the main contenders, in truth, look flawed: Liverpool too open, Arsenal still distrustful of their own abilities and overly reliant on set-plays and City are still integrating new players and adjusting to Guardiola’s new outlook. None of those three look far from clicking – the same cannot be said ofChelsea– but after this weekend, it’s probably Arsenal with the most reason to feel satisfied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Titled Endless Dungeon, the show will see the LA-based performer teaming up with local comedians including Tom Cardy, Demi Lardner and Jordan Raskopoulos to create an improvised game of D&D.Diehard fans of the tabletop role playing game will revel in “the absurdity and depth” of the show, Mulligan says. And for everyone else, there’s “absolutely wild hijinks”.D&D has been around since the 70s, previously considered either a nerdy pursuit for basement dwellers or a scapegoat for satanic panic, depending on who you speak to – but in recent years it has exploded in popularity. “Actual play” series – where hosts and guests record the entire, often lengthy process of gameplay for audiences – have burgeoned across podcasts, YouTube and Twitch, becoming a genre in their own right.View image in fullscreenFrom living rooms to arena tours: D&D is now a ‘spectator’ sport.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianCritical Role– the show which Mulligan will be helming for its fourth campaign – has a fanbase of millions and itsown Amazon Primespin-off. It has helped make Mulligan a tiny king of D&D: another one of his actual play shows, Dimension 20, recently toured around the world with sold-out dates atthe Hollywood Bowl and Madison Square Garden.“It feels crazy. It all just feels so crazy. And I hope it stays feeling crazy because it should,” Mulligan says, describing not only the insanity of playing a tabletop role playing game in front of 20,000 people, but also the general success of his career. “We stay bewildered out here. Bewildering gratitude … as long as I get to do this.”Notably, many of Mulligan’s tour venues have been traditionally used as sports arenas, including Melbourne’s Margaret Court Arena. Could it signal a shift into D&D becoming a spectator sport?“Sport’s a great analogy for it because nothing about watching a game of soccer means that you are not likely to play a game of soccer yourself, or vice versa,” Mulligan says. “They are really different pursuits, right? Getting a gaming group together is very hard, but you can watch actual play in your normal time where you want to decompress and relax and just watch a great story, or just laugh or something like that. You’re watching, effectively, a panel show where the episodes are hours long, of comedians playing a game.”View image in fullscreen‘Sport’s a great analogy for it’: Mulligan on how tabletop games like D&D have become thriving communitiesTouring these shows also means that fans are able to connect with their hobby in person – creating a thriving community. While big arena shows might seem less intimate than a living room game, you could see them as a scaling up of the same phenomenon. Mulligan even tells me how fans have found their own D&D groups from connecting with others attending live shows.“We make no bones about the fact that our show is an inclusive show and a welcoming one,” Mulligan says. “And we want people from identities that, especially in this weird global moment happening, who would have some reason to feel unwelcome in many places, to know that they are welcome at our show. We feel like the forces of oppression and discrimination are ascended in this moment.”View image in fullscreenD&D features fantastical characters – but it also offers audiences a chance to exorcise contemporary woes.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianPerhaps the appeal of D&D lies not just in its fantastical escapism, but in its ability to exorcise our contemporary woes. “To be in an arena of tens of thousands of people who all get to laugh at a libertarian crypto dragon, or all get to cheer as someone’s magical same-sex partner appears on screen? That fucking rules. And I think the live shows are people realising we are very much not alone.”Brennan Lee Mulligan’sEndless Dungeon live showwill tour to Melbourne on 13 October and Sydney on 15 October.

But why should Trump let facts get in the way?Moira DoneganRFK Jr is conducting a review of mifepristone, citing a deeply flawed study. The move could be devastating for womenMon 29 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 06.01 EDTShareRobert F Kennedy Jr’s health department is conducting a new review of mifepristone, the drug used in the majority of American abortions,claiming that a new studyfrom a conservative thinktank has raised concerns about its safety.Mifepristone, which was approved by the FDA 25 years ago this month, has repeatedly been proven safe and effective for use terminating pregnancies in both multiple medical trials and in widespread patient use over the past quarter of a century. Thereportcited by Kennedy, meanwhile, comes from the Ethics and Public Policy Center – a group that applies “the Jewish and Christian traditions” to modern law and pushes back “against the extreme progressive agenda while building a consensus for conservatives” – andwas not peer reviewed. The study has been heavily criticized bymedical expertsfor its methodology and lack of transparency regarding how it obtained and analyzed its data. The report appears to have dramatically inflated the rate of serious adverse health outcomes in patients who took mifepristone – in part byseemingly conflatingthe bleeding that occurs in the normal course of a medication abortion with hemorrhaging, and in part by relying on unclear terminology. The Ethics and Public Policy Center report classified “serious adverse events” as occurring in almost 11% of mifepristone patients. More reliable studies, subject to data transparency, peer review, and a more rigorously honest set of definitions, have found that such adverse health events happen in fewer than 0.5% of users. In ameta-analysisof more than 100 studies, the vast majority found that more than 99% of people who use mifepristone have no serious complications.Mifepristone is safe. But why let the facts get in the way of the Trump administration’s political agenda? The review of mifepristone marks the second time in less than a week that the Trump administration has marshalled false medical claims and junk science in an effort to constrain the freedoms of pregnant women and curtail their access to relief. On Monday, in a bizarre, rambling and frequentlynonsensical press conference, the president appeared alongside Kennedy Jr to claim, falsely, that Tylenol use during pregnancy can cause autism in the resulting children, and to instruct pregnant women to avoid the painkiller and instead “tough it out”.There is exactly one reason why the US has not yet seen a return to those bad old days of unsafe surgical abortions and mass female death: that reason is mifepristoneThe Trump administration has long been under pressure from the anti-abortion movement – which, not satisfied by the end of Roe v Wade (in a decision delivered to them by Trump’s appointees,hand-selectedfor the purpose), has continually pushed the administration to further limit access to abortion. Donald Trump has seemed unwilling to directly attack abortion, appearing to think that the issue is a political loser for him. But his administration has already curtailed access nationwide. His massive domestic spending billincluded a provisionbarring most abortion providers from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any services they provide – abortion related or not – for a year, a move that makes it dramatically more expensive for clinics to offer abortion services. As a result, clinics are alreadyshutting their doorsin Democratically-controlled states like California. In Wisconsin, where the battle for abortion legalization led to a fantastically expensive state supreme court race and massive voter mobilization, the state Planned Parenthood affiliate made the decision tostop providing abortionsin order to retain access to the Medicaid funding they need to stay open – even though that enormous political effort succeeded in re-legalizing abortion in the state.But that’s not enough for the anti-choice right. Three Republican-controlled states –Missouri, Idaho and Kansas– aresuing the FDA, seeking to reversechangesto mifepristone regulations that allowed the drug to be prescribed via telemedicine and sent through the mail, and to restore other restrictions on the drug. Texas, Florida and Louisiana areseeking to join and expand that lawsuitto further restrict mifepristone. The new regulations, which have been endorsed by leading health experts, have made mifepristone dramatically more accessible in the years since the Dobbs decision, as women living in states that ban abortion seek out ways to have the medication prescribed and mailed to them by physicians abroad or in Democratically controlled states.Kennedy’s move against mifepristone could restrict access even further. Compared with surgery, the pill is a more accessible, safer and less resource-intensive way for clinics to provide abortions. It does not require a surgical room or very much of a provider’s time; patients can take the pills and have their abortions in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. Getting rid of the abortion pill, or making it harder to access, would put even more strain on abortion providers who are already having a difficult time keeping their heads above water.Even more tragically, the move could be devastating for women’s health and lives. In the pre-Roe era, when abortion was illegal and mifepristone had not yet been invented, many women in need of abortions sought out surgical procedures on the black market. But surgery is much riskier than taking a pill, and many of these women experienced injuries and infections that killed or permanently maimed them. There is exactly one reason why the US has not yet seen a return to those bad old days of unsafe surgical abortions and mass female death: that reason is mifepristone. The drug saves women’s dreams and dignity by allowing them to control their own reproduction; it saves their lives by allowing them to avoid a dangerous surgery in an illegal market. Even in liberal states, abortion has become much harder to access than it was before Dobbs; that alone is an injury to women’s citizenship and status. With mifepristone under threat, it looks like theTrump administrationis threatening their lives, too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so tragicMon 29 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 12.44 EDTShareWatching the Kamala Harris presidential campaign unfold last year, I remember thinking,and writing, about how striking it was that she had been rehabilitated almost overnight into a political titan. Authoritative accounts of her before that moment portrayed a lo-fi vice-president, who, evenaccording to peoplewho had worked to get her there, had “not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country”. Another striking feature of her campaign was how it leaned into vibes and spectacle rather than substance, or building faith in Harris as a clean break from an unpopular and visibly deteriorating Joe Biden. Her new book, 107 Days, a memoir of the exact number of days she had to win the presidency, goes a long way in explaining why that was. In short, Harris – and those around her, including supportive media parties – got high on their own supply.This was not the intention, but 107 Days is a hilarious book. The kind of “you have to laugh or else you’ll cry” type of hilarity. As the second Trump administration unfolds in ever-more disastrous ways, Harris and the other timeline that was possible had she won take on a calamitous, mythical quality. Here she comes, alerting us to the fact that her defeat was no fateful tragedy, but a farce. There was no hidden, better version of Harris that was muzzled and limited by circumstance. There was only a woman with a formidable lack of self-awareness and a propensity to self-valorise.The book reveals a politician who is all about the machinery of politics, rather than one with conviction spurred by a sense of duty, or a coherent and specific set of values that differentiate her. The “not a thing that comes to mind” answer she gave whenasked during the campaignif there was anything she would have done differently to Biden was not caution, but the truth. There is no sign here that she would have liked to meaningfully diverge on Gaza, for example, other than to introduce more parity in the rhetoric of compassion. Or any indication that she would have liked to grasp the nettle on economic policy and make more of her accusation that Donald Trump’s economic agenda “works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers”.This dearth of a unique Harris agenda explains why she often seemed so vague, skittish and rambling. How does she receive the news she will be the candidate? By reminding herself (and us) that she had the best “contact book” and “name recognition”, as well as the “strongest case”. She tries to cloak her ambition, saying “knew she could” be president, but only because she “wanted to do the work. I have always been a protector.” It’s fine to have ambition to be the president of the United States! Every cardinal dreams of becoming pope, as Cardinal Bellini of Conclave said. Even he did himself, to his shame, when he lamented upon the discovery of his ambition: “To be this age and still not know yourself.”My abiding feeling reading was: oh God, this was all just as bad as it looked. The celebrity-packed campaign roster was not, in fact, panicked desperation, but the preference of the candidate and her team. They thought that such a range of characters would show that Harris was “welcoming everyone into the campaign” – as if the power of celebrity could do the unifying work of coalition-building, rather than her own programme and politicking. The immersion in the filmic, the celluloid ofUS politicsis so complete that there is a line about Jon Bon Jovi performing for her and it being a good omen, because he performed for a candidate who won in The West Wing. The media loved her. “And behold,” Harris quotes a Washington Post writer, praising her approach to Gaza, “she had her boat through the impossible strait.” Jon Favreau said Harris was “a sight to behold” at the Democratic convention.I lost count of the number of descriptions of crowds exploding, roaring, on fire. The audience applause to Harris’s Saturday Night Live appearance was some of the loudest ever heard. She replays her greatest hits, revealing a politician captured by the reverie of rapturous self-selecting crowds and buzzy studios, fatally unable to connect to thevoters outside the bubble, who had soured on the Democrats and were checking out, or voting for Trump.View image in fullscreenThe then US president, Joe Biden, attends a department of defense commander-in-chief farewell ceremony, in Fort Myer, with Kamala Harris.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersBiden pops up often, a self-involved and petty figure, snapping at her heels and distracting her. But she is loyal, she tells us – often. So loyal that she couldn’t disparage him in the way that people needed her to (“People hate Joe Biden!” she is told by a senior adviser). But not so loyal that she doesn’t more artfully disguise that she wants you to know the man was a real drag who mentioned her too late in his speeches, and then called her before her big debate with Trump to unsubtly threaten her if she bad-mouthed him. But what is most telling, and alarming, is what she reveals about the Democratic establishment, and therefore what hope there is of an awakening among its ranks. One that could pose a meaningful challenge to Trump now, and Trumpism in the future. The 107 days were short, but they were a concentration of a process in which the party and its candidate had to dig deep quickly to unearth the most compelling and defining vision for the American people. The result was to take no risks, offer continuity and scold dissenters as Trump enablers, but with style. It wasn’t enough, and will never be.The answer to the question “what went wrong” isn’t “we didn’t have enough time” to establish Harris. It was that Harris, even now, with all the time to reflect and be honest with herself, is a politician who invests too much in presentation, and entirely exculpates herself of failures because she was dealt a bad political hand. What can you say besides, “to be this age and still not know yourself”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just one year, and already close to crashing. The question is whether Labour’s leader, chancellor and cabinet can tug open enough parachutes to prevent calamity. But the next election is aeons away: only five years ago, Boris Johnson was king of the world, due for another 10 years in No 10. Things go faster, up and down, in this dizzying era. The local elections next May are approached with dread: for many in Labour there is expectation of a massive loss of seats, and the once unthinkable loss of the Senedd in Wales.Arriving here, graveyard humour echoed around halls and corridors. “Welcome to the walking dead,” one new MP murmured to me. The newbies are the most “frit”, many with tiny majorities, always at risk of just one term on the green benches. But Keir Starmer’ssudden assault on Faragismsent a bolt of electricity through glum delegates. His “battlefor the soul of the nation”has raised hope. (Battle and soul were lacking until now.) Gloves off, with Reform UK a terrifying 10 points ahead, he has started to throw off facing-both-ways caution. This marks a turning point, supporters hope. For the party that championed race discrimination laws, calling out a “racist” policy as “immoral” is compulsory, with vicious abuse on the rise again.Starmer hasamends to makefor his “island of strangers” speech. He apologised, but its effect, says Prof Rob Ford, was that it “increased the salience of immigration and decreased the Labour vote without gaining any voters back from Reform”. Fordwrites this weekthat Farage’s plan to abolish indefinite leave to remain and deport people working in the UK legally for years will backfire: polling finds it deeply unpopular. Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, should be wary of following Reform far down that path. Prof Sir John Curtice, an editor of the British Social Attitudes survey,has warned Starmerto stop chasing Reform voters: they’ve gone. Labour is losing many times more voters to the left than to Farage.Beyond self-interest, an authentic disgust spurs Starmer to confront the enemy at the gates. Rachel Reeves in today’s speech called Reform “the single greatest threatto our way of life and to the living standards of working people”. At last, here’s the clarion warning that Farage is a far greater threat than Oswald Mosley, who never came so close to power. Labour will keep sounding that klaxon from now on. Reeves will be summoning business to join this battle: those industry leaders who made the error of keeping their heads down in cowardice over Brexit have paid a heavy price in lost trade and GDP. They know a Reform government would sink the country, break its existing EU deals and make us a pariah for investment and everything else. They must speak up now. Labour needs wit and mockery too, against the faux-patriotism of pro-Trump, pro-Putin Farage. I first heard the migrants-eat-our-swans myth 30 years ago. The royal parks always exploded it.This spirit of alarm has the power to galvanise depressed Labour troops and maybe erstwhile voters. Perversely, Andy Burnham’s brash shadow coup may also help the Labour leadership. While his path to actual power looks tortuously near-impossible, his influence is felt around this conference. He says, mostly, what party members think, as his protege Lucy Powell’sincreasing leadin the deputy leadership polling shows. At his speech at the proportional representation rally on Sunday, I watched Burnham show them how to do it, thumping out popular tunes, daring the cabinet to follow him. My guess is that they will. He has given them a kicking and a reminder that a party at near-rock bottom (it could get worse) has little to lose but its nerve. On electoral reform, Burnham hammers out the clear and present danger that the next election can be won again on a small minority of votes: he calls for a national commission and a manifesto commitment to introduce proportion representation in the next parliament. Personally, I’d do it now, before it’s too late.But Burnham’s bad blunder on refusing to be “in hock to the bond markets” reveals a deep vulnerability. Liz Truss’s crash-test dummy demonstration showed where that can lead. Of course Labour people want Margaret Thatcher’s disastrous 1980s privatisations reversed, as he pledges, but where’s his money to buy energy and water companies, or reclaim the 2m council homes calamitously sold off? Plenty here may wish they had a different leader, but don’t relish behaving like the Tories: Starmer took over as the sixth prime minister in eight years. Given the extreme impatience of an electorate that seems to expect a Deliveroo government dispensing next-day Amazon parcels of shiny new public services, the chances are a new leader of any party would plummet in no time too, facing all the same intractables that Reeves will struggle with in her budget.Wise pollsters, such as YouGov’s Patrick English, say people only confront a straight choice as elections approach. Currently the left block, if willing to vote tactically, would beat the right block. A YouGov poll in Marchsuggested some Torieswould hold their noses and vote Labour if that was the only choice against Farage in their constituency. Ditto some Labour voters would vote Tory in seats where that was the only serious challenge to Reform.English was speaking at a Best for Britain fringe event that was filled with longing forLabourto break its Brexit omertà. Time to call “patriot” Farage out on the damage he did to Britain. The act of bravery in calling out Farage’s “racist” policy could lead Starmer to many more, as he finds the sky doesn’t fall in.(He could start by revoking the absurd ban on Palestine Action: criminal damage is not terrorism. Dozens of their alleged protesters were arrested outside the fence.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could – and must – act differentlySharon Graham is the general secretary of UniteMon 29 Sep 2025 11.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 12.45 EDTShareThe past two decades in the UK have been dominated by crisis. The 2008 financial crash changed everything, but aside from a bit of dinner party embarrassment, elites carried on as if nothing had happened. For workers, however, it was a different story. And so it almost doesn’t matter what Keir Starmer says in his speech to the Labour party conference on Tuesday. His government still has not grasped the real problems faced by ordinary British people, and that is why Labouris crashing in the polls.Between 1945 and 2008 in the UK, real increases in average wages werethe norm. But after the crash, they stopped rising. If wages had grown to this day as they did prior to 2008, the average worker would be £11,000 a year better off.As if falling wages weren’t bad enough, British people were then clobbered by austerity. Between 2010 and 2019, public services were butchered; the4% real terms cut in spendingwas unprecedented. The axe swung wildly, but perhaps nowhere felt its blade more than local government. The effectsof austerity are stillbeing felt to this day: councils havesold off£2.9bn of public assets in the past two years alone, including sports clubs and day centres.Then came Covid. When politicians took to the airwaves and implored essential workers to come to the aid of the country, they promised that things would be different on the other side – that they would be rewarded with more than banging pots. Nothing could have been further from the truth.Starmer should have conference in his hands – instead, power is slipping through his fingers | Frances RyanRead morePrices have soared while essential workers’wageshave stagnated. Food prices are up by 38% since 2021 and forecast to rise by another 6%. Household energy bills are 44% higher than they were duringwinter 2021 with the cap due to increase againnext week.But not everyone has suffered. Since 2021, Tesco has paid out £12.4bn to its shareholders, and Unite’s latest research shows that the top 200 energy companies recorded profits of more than £30bnin 2024.A Unite studyof 17,000 companies found that average profit margins have soared by 30% since pre-pandemic levels, as workers and communities pay the price of these profits by spending an ever-greater portion of their income on goods. No wonder people feel the system is rigged against them. Our politicians, meanwhile,argue about black holes and fiscal rules. The government’s focus on arbitrary fiscaltargets means it is constantly panicking over the latest economic news, rather than delivering a long-term plan for jobs and British industry. This has led to a string of terrible choices, such as trying to pitchpensionersanddisabled peopleagainst workers and their communities.Labour hasdoubled down on Liz Truss’s promise to give the bankers back their mega bonuses. Are any lessons being learned?Labour’s performance has been compounded by what the Resolution Foundation called the weakest spending review since George Osborne’s austerity years. Between 1966 and 2010, government spending on health and social care grew by an average of 4.2% each year. This year’s increase was only 2.8%. Other departments fared even worse.It doesn’t have to be this way. If politicians made different choices, they couldsupport our services and rescue our crumbling national infrastructure.They have done it before. After the second world war, the debt-to-GDP ratio was close to 250% – more than double what it is now. But Clement Attlee’s government chose massive public investment, created the NHS and rebuilt the country. Even in the 1950s, public investment as a share of national income stood at 7.3%. Now it is 2.7%,and well below the average for advanced OECD economies since the turn of the century.Our government isfiddling while others fully commit. Labour has put just over £50bn into theNational Wealth Fundand theBritish Business Bank. The equivalent institutions in Germany have €1tn (£870bn) in funding: its state investment fundKFWhas €580bn and the new ““special fund” has €500bn allocated for investment into the country’s defence and infrastructure.So long as growth remains anaemic, the only option other than economicderegulation is public investment. The government can restore our public services without hiking the taxes of everyday workers. Unite has looked atproposals from academic expertsthat together would raise more than £50bn a year. From taxing the wealth of the top 1% at an annual rate of 1%, to equalising capital gains tax with income tax rates and extending national insurance to apply to investment income, the government has options. This is what Starmer should be proposing in his speech to conference. But he will not. All these solutions require a departure from the failed economic norms of the last generation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I was pregnant, there was the shock of my baby’s first in utero kick. I’ll never forget the joy of a first smile that seemed like a reward for managing to keep a helpless being alive. Then there was the surprise, shared by both me and the baby, of their first rollover, the dribble that accompanied a first tooth and the renewed physical exertion that followed my little one’s first steps.It’s no accident the word “first” was used multiple times in the previous sentences. That’s because most milestones are associated with beginnings. But what about final milestones? Those moments where you are forced to step off a parenting pathway stone that has become so familiar that your foot has created its own groove? As my youngest child approaches the end of year 12, I feel as if life has hit fast-forward and is catapulting me through a rapid series of final moments.Of course, “last” milestones also happen in the earlier years of parenting, but they’re less noticeable and less celebrated simply because they usually can’t be predicted until they’re firmly in the rear-vision mirror.Reminiscing with old classmates taught me that some memories only scratch the surface of the truth | Vivienne PearsonRead moreIt’s common to only realise your bub has had their last breastfeed once they refuse the next offer. I was relieved when my youngest was able to climb up into the car by himself, but I didn’t know this was about to happen on the final of the thousands of times I’d lifted him in. There’s great poignancy when a child stops automatically reaching for your hand while walking, or no longer waves excitedly from the school bus window, but these final milestones are rarely announced ahead.The end of primary school was one final milestone I had anticipated. It was intensely bittersweet, with pride sitting alongside waves of nostalgia (enhanced by the emotive-music slideshows during the final assembly!).But, after primary school comes high school so, though life changes for now-adolescent kids and parents, there’s still a large school-shaped stone on life’s pathway.The end of high school is huge for everyone, but this time it’s my youngest child, so (as the young people say) it hits different.We noted the “last first” day when school started this year. The next final milestone was the last ever parent-teacher interview. Funnily enough, it was the best one ever, as my kid has reached the age where teachers know him, his strengths and his interests so well that the interviews became mutual-appreciation sessions, with teachers praising my son and me praising the teachers for their years of work and care.I won’t miss the school grounds as, thanks to Covid and floods as well as my kids’ stay-away vibe, I haven’t been physically present very often. However, during the year 12 graduation assembly last week, I was hyperconscious that this would be my last time inside the high school gates. And, yes, the emotive music-filled slideshow tracking the growth of my son’s cohort from tiny year 7s to towering year 12s did its emotional work well.Not all the final milestones will be tinged with sadness. I won’t shed a single tear about not having to make school lunches any more. Nor will I be the slightest bit sad about no longer having to reply to text messages when my son is unwell (though I do hope I brought a small smile to the office staff with my more creative responses, such as “Sorry he’s not at the swimming carnival. He’s nearly an adult and I need to pick my battles”).Final milestones means there will be new stepping stones on the path ahead. But the shape and texture of these pavers are not yet clear, as the transition from year 12 to the “real world” is full of uncertainty. Though the end of classes are celebrated with muck-up days, assemblies and parties, there’s still the hurdles of exams and, for those planning to head to university, Atars and offers.My son wants to do a gap year, but work and travel plans are still up in the air. I’m looking forward to a more me-time focused life, but I’ve already been disavowed of my naive notions that this next parenting stage is entirely stress-free.Because my son is the youngest of his cousins, the end of his schooling feels like an extended family milestone as well as a more personal one. I used to be bemused whenever speaking with someone who was unaware of when school holidays were but, to celebrate my absolute final school bell, I’m going to make “blissful ignorance of the school year” my top goal for 2026.Vivienne Pearsonis a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionAustralian educationFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Call me an interfering Sir Humphrey, but isn’t actually talking to colleagues the way to get things done?Mon 29 Sep 2025 08.18 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn these broken times, it’s not easy to spare a thought for the plight of the humble civil servant. But bear with me and open your heart. Last week, it emerged that the Cabinet Office has brought in new rules for civil servants about the types of meetings they can hold. Anything that constitutes a “networking meeting” now has to be held outside working hours. And if it’s a networking “event”,it has to be signed offby a senior civil servant.Alex Thomas, a programme director at the Institute for Government, said the new rules were “reasonably proportionate as most meetings take place after work or in lunchtimes anyway”, and that “reminding civil servants that they are primarily there to do their core jobs is not a bad thing”.In the grand scheme of things, this is not the most terrible thing ever. But I have sympathy for the backlash, which has been as muted and discreet as Sir Humphrey Appleby ofYes Ministerfame himself. As a civil services union source put it – one likes to think in sotto voce – this move “risks staff feeling under attack at a time when once again they are being asked to do more with less”. Can you picture Sir Humphrey’s tight smile at the end of these words?Of course, this is a storm in an office-issued plastic cup of cold tea consumed surreptitiously at a rescheduled hybrid Teams meeting. And, yes, you can understand – especially as memories ofPartygateand thewheely suitcases of boozeare still fresh – that anyone anywhere near government needs clarity about what constitutes professionalism and what needs to happen on and off the clock. However, this feels like yet another excuse to make working life even more proscriptive, rigid and rule-bound than it already is.It pains me to speak up in favour of “networking” – a horrible word that really simply means “talking to other people”. But it seems to me that, if anything, we need regulations forcing us all to get to know each other in greater depth, not lesser. When things are difficult and you feel stressed because of work, who do you turn to? Your colleagues. Why do people meet to network? They do it because they don’t have a chance to talk about the things that really matter inside sanctioned meetings. They do it because not every single part of us can fit within the confines of a working day, let alone the screen-based confines that now frame most people’s working days. They do it because they are human.Regulations that discourage people getting to know each other also overlook the great unspoken truth of working life: most official meetings are inefficient unless the people in them know each other well, ideally very well. The real work gets done outside the official meetings: the messy, slow and invisible business of persuading people of things one-to-one, canvassing support, building trust, forging alliances, swapping stories, all the seemingly pointless encounters that eventually and sometimes almost accidentally create some kind of meaning or progress. Of course, people have to conduct these encounters in a way that has boundaries in place. But it does seem rather offensive to the civil service that they need babying with these rules, like someone has to explain to them that they shouldn’t be getting completely wasted, talking rubbish and photocopying their arses. (“But I thought it was in the job description?”)View image in fullscreenNigel Hawthorne as Sir Humphrey (right) with Derek Fowlds and Paul Eddington in Yes Minister.Photograph: PAIt’s the feeling of being patronised, mistrusted and taken for granted that feels like an attack. The quietly disgruntled source speaks for many, including outside the civil service. After all, this is surely how most working people feel now: sick of “once again being asked to do more with less”. The Health and Safety Executive’s 2024 report found that79% of UK workersexperience stress regularly, and that 17.1m working days are lost annually to work-related stress, depression and anxiety. I’m sure those days are not all attributable to the civil service, although it would make a good reality TV documentary if they were. Forget Ferris Bueller. I want to see Sir Humphrey’s Day Off.On the other hand, maybe this move is exactly the rebrand “networking meetings” need. Everyone hates the idea of networking and most people will do anything to avoid it. But if networking is “banned” – cancelled, even? – perhaps this is the one way to make it cool and radical. Stick it to the man by networking hard outside office hours! Be a maverick and talk to your workmates about items that are not on the agenda! Ask about their hobbies! This is surely how revolutions begin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some were shot down. A few days later, another Russian drone overflew Romania en route to Ukraine. The Romanian air defence let it get away. Then, on 19 September, three Russian MiG-31 fightersintruded into Estonia’s airspace. Italian F-35s – in the area on a Nato mission – intercepted the Russians and saw them off.Although this is hardly the first timeRussiahas violated Nato’s airspace, the extent and the brazen nature of these latest provocations make them stand out. Incursions will end only when the intruders are shot down. Fortunately, shooting down an occasional Russian fighter jet, never mind drones, is very unlikely to lead to a broader escalation. It may even help cool down tensions by reinforcing the red lines.The cold war offers important lessons about handling such incidents. Although there is a perception in the public memory that the cold war outsourced fighting to what we now call the global south, with the two superpowers avoiding direct military clashes, this is in fact not the case. There were several incidents in the early 1950s that involved US aircraft being attacked by Soviet interceptors. Two of these incidents– in April 1950 and in June 1952 – occurred over the Baltic Sea. Around the same time, Soviet and American fighter pilots were engaged in the skies over Korea, with scores killed on both sides. And then, after the US developed the U-2 spy plane, the Soviets and their allies tried repeatedly to shoot down the intruders.The most famous of these episodes happened on 1 May 1960, when a U-2 piloted by Gary Powers was shot down over Sverdlovsk (today’s Ekaterinburg), deep inside the Soviet territory. The shootdown was a propaganda victory for the USSR, which went on to proudly exhibit the plane wreckageand the unlucky pilot(who safely catapulted from the plane). But there the matter ended. Not only was there no US retaliation for the shootdown, but Dwight D Eisenhower, the then US president, temporarily paused sending any more U-2s into the Soviet airspace since it was deemed too dangerous.The Soviets downed another U-2 over Cuba on 27 October 1962, a day remembered by cold war historians as “Black Saturday” for all the unfortunate events that could have led to nuclear war (though none of them did). While this particular incident can in retrospect be described as a reckless act, it was only reckless because it happened at the very height of the Cuban missile crisis, when the world seemed to stare right in the face of Armageddon. We are not in this situation.Other powers also on occasion brought down US or allied planes. Between 1962 and 1967, China shot down no less than five Republic of China (Taiwanese) U-2 planes. A very serious incident occurred on 15 April 1969, when the North Koreans attacked a US EC-121 reconnaissance plane, with the loss of 31 American lives – the deadliest such incident during the cold war for the US air force. On that sad occasion, the plane was well clear of North Korea’s airspace. But the US government kept its cool.Nor did the US resort to a military response on 1 September 1983, when the Soviets shot down acivilianairliner that accidentally overflew Soviet territory in the far east. That unfortunate incident caused the death of 269 passengers and crew, including one sitting US congressman.One could perhaps make the argument that there was no retaliation to all these incidents precisely because the Americans were inherently more cautious than the Soviets. They did not want to escalate tensions for fear of a nuclear war. In fact, both sides were cautious and understood that lethal incidents could happen but that, after a little posturing, it was just safer to tone things down. In the end, the ability and readiness of both sides to use lethal force against intruders served to deter the other and keep the cold war confrontation from spinning out of control.Nato must take these lessons to heart. Shooting down intruding Russian aircraft is not a step towards war. It is a prophylactic measure necessary for maintaining credibility in the face of the adversary’s provocations. Both sides engage in psychological operations intended to test the other’s resolve. If one side crosses implicit red lines in doing so, it must be taught a lesson. If it is not taught a timely lesson, it will have concluded that the red lines are fictional and can be crossed with impunity. That will only lead to new dangerous situations as the adversary pushes further and further.Protocols exist for handling the intrusion of enemy aircraft. They help sort out situations when the enemy accidentally – or otherwise – crosses into one’s airspace. Many of these protocols were in fact developed during the cold war as Moscow and Washington grappled with the risks of inadvertent escalation.And here’s another lesson from the cold war. Even at its height, the two sides found ways to talk to each. For example, a hotline was set up between Moscow and Washington after the Cuban missile crisis to help with direct communication between the Soviet and US leaders. There were also a number of backchannels for difficult negotiations.As the US begins its strategic retreat fromEurope, it is up to the Europeans to learn to talk to the Russians, including through military-to-military contacts. For every hour of fiery public proclamations (at which the Europeans are truly expert), there must be three hours of quiet behind-the-doors diplomacy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the intruders fail to respond, the only sensible response is to shoot them down. And we should be under no illusions that this is exactly what the Russians would do if our side sent fighter jets into their airspace. Why, that’s exactly what they did in the past.Such shootdowns may briefly lead to a flare-up of tensions. This happened, for instance, on 24 November 2015, when the Turkish military shot down a Russian strike bomber that intruded into its airspace. The Russians responded militantly at first and imposed sanctions on Turkey. But later, Vladimir Putin chose to forget all about it and embrace Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president. It helped that the latterexpressed regret. Both sides recognised that bringing tensions down served their respective interests. The Russians have subsequently abstained from military provocations against Turkey, which is unarguably a pointer to the Kremlin’s reluctant ability to internalise lessons.Putin will continue testing the boundaries of the permissible. He aims to humiliate Nato and further divide the west by exposing frictions between countries on the eastern flank that are directly threatened by his provocations and their more fortunate allies like the Italians, the French and the British, that, for now, can afford to take a more relaxed attitude. Yet they have stationed fighter aircraft in the area, and it is these aircraft that will be relied upon to teach Putin a lesson.Sergey Radchenko is Wilson E Schmidt distinguished professor at the Henry A Kissinger Center, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International StudiesExplore more on these topicsRussiaOpinionNatoVladimir PutinCold warEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

For the first time, my dream of becoming a writer seemed possibleMon 29 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 04.53 EDTShareIn 1984, towards the end of my time at university, I drafted a letter applying for a job as an advertising copywriter. I was a history student, so I showed it to a languid friend who was reading English. He read it while lying on a sofa one sunny morning. “Well,” he said, wafting it back to me, “there’s too many words in it.”I picked it up off the floor and read the opening: “Dear sir or madam, I wonder whether, by any chance, I might prevail on you …”“See what I mean?” said my friend, lighting himself a cigarette and tossing the packet over to me.I did see what he meant and, glancing over the letter again – and seeing things like “I realise that my application is bound to be something of a long shot” – I experienced successive waves of emotion. First, shame at my crassness; second, gratefulness to my friend for having vouchsafed to me the magic word – the key, no doubt, to his own elegancein English. The word was “cut”.I went back to my own room to set about it. Once decluttered, the letter immediately seemed like the work of a plausible individual. It wasn’t that I’d suddenly learned how to write; more that I’d learned how not to write. It was a revelation and the first time I realised that my dream of becoming an author might actually be realisable.As an undergraduate, I had occasionally sent articles speculatively to newspapers. They were always rejected, but sometimes with an encouraging reply – “Do keep us in mind, though” – that would have me dancing around the room. I was also perpetually fiddling with a story about a young man who shuttled by train back and forth between London and Yorkshire, leading two entirely discrete lives. It was a sort of northern kitchen sink drama, 30 years too late and overburdened with logistics. I even bored myself as I began a paragraph, “He walked through Camden to King’s Cross station …”, but in light of my conversation with my languid friend, this became, “At King’s Cross …”. By a simple cut, I’d performed a kind of sorcery: I’d levitated my protagonist.While doing clerical jobs in London after graduation, I scrawled stories during lunchtimes or on the tube. My route towards publication was a tortuous one, but the watchword “cut” glowed ever-brighter, and on Sunday evenings, I’d take my notebooks to a pub with a red pen in my pocket. I recall those evenings as rainy, and just as the rain seemed to be washing away the sordid misadventures of the previous week, so I was purging my erroneous prose. “Was it tiredness that was afflicting him?” would make way for, “He was, he supposed, tired”, and if the new version was slightly cryptic, so much the better.Before submitting my pieces, I typed them on a gigantic Imperial typewriter, a machine intolerant of second thoughts. Yes, there was Tipp-ex, which I always applied at first too thinly, leaving the superfluous word showing incriminatingly through, then too thickly, so that it dribbled down, taking out some perfectly good word on the line below. A breakthrough came in about 1990, when I bought an Amstrad computer with word processing, so that I could play with words much as other people were starting to play video games; and just as Pac-Man ate little dots, so my cursor ate words. I should have eliminated even more than I did, as I realised in 1999 when looking at the proofs of my first novel. But there’d have been no novel at all without the intervention of my friend.I’ve often wondered whether it was key that he’d been to a private school, which I hadn’t. A private education inculcates confidence, and you need confidence to edit yourself, in that you must believe something worthwhile will survive the process. My friend, who’s still languid and still a friend, wouldn’t mind my bringing that up, but what I really want to say to him is a word I’m not sure I said at the time: “Thanks.”Andrew Martin is a writer.

This would be as disastrous for jobs as for the climateMon 29 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 09.46 EDTShareThere is something rather old-fashioned about the way Germany views its car industry. When the prime minister of Bavaria, Markus Söder,calls the carthe destiny of Germany and the heart of its economy, and says that “without the car, collapse is imminent”, the vehicle he seems to be describing is one with a combustion engine, running on fossil fuels or their derivatives. This nostalgic attachment to the heavy-duty, polluting industries of the 20th century is now colliding with the urgent realities of the climate crisis.Earlier this month, heads of European automotive companies gathered in the Berlaymont building, the headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels, for a meeting with its president, Ursula von der Leyen. German car manufacturers came with two demands: toreverse the EU banon the manufacture of new cars with CO2-emitting combustion engines that is due to come into force in 2035, and toloosen the annual quotasthey have to meet for sales of electric vehicles between now and 2035.The results of the meeting were not immediately clear. Some media reports suggested that the EU could allow hybrid cars to continue being sold after 2035. An actual decision is expected byDecember, but some dilution of the ban looks likely. The commission would “carefully assess all input received”, including “refinements” such as a continued role for some plug-in hybrid vehicles, a spokesperson told me.The car industry’s campaign against the 2035 deadline is just one example of the backlash against EUgreen initiativesand legislation. Challenges from industry and agriculture have already led to the scrapping of apesticides reduction law, the postponement ofanti-deforestation regulationand the cancellation of specific reporting requirements for sectors that are most at risk of harming the environment.Ultimately, the EU should not cave in to the German car industry. A reversal would be disastrous not only for climate goals and the environment, but for all parties involved, the manufacturers included. The German car industry accounts forabout 5% of the country’s GDPbutis already struggling against its global competitors, and lagging behind by nearly a decade on the required pivot to electric vehicles. Delaying the switch to zero-emissions driving will only make it less competitive.The carmakers had done some heavy lobbying in the run-up to the Brussels meeting. Ola Kallänius, the head of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association and Mercedes-Benz, wrotean imperious open letter. Meeting vehicle carbon dioxide targets for 2030 and 2035, he wrote, “is, in today’s world, simply no longer feasible”. Targets should be done away with altogether, he argued.The real problem, however, is that the German car industry sat back while its rivals in electric car production, Tesla and Chinese companies, aided by massive state subsidies, built the kind of expertise and reputation that is still absent inGermany.There is some support for the car industry in the German media. Interviews with the head of the German automotive association and favourable opinion pieces in newspapers have appeared. However, this deference will not do the industry or the country any good.The German automobile sector employs about 770,000 people, excluding suppliers. Central to their lobbying strategy is the argument that unwanted regulation will lead to job losses. But car manufacturers are already letting people go: 50,000 jobs disappeared last year, more than in any other sector in Germany. Continuing to make combustion-engine models would not staunch job losses in the long run, or even postpone them. The rationale is obvious: these are businesses interested in profits; they are not a public good. The families who own major stakes in Volkswagen and BMW – the Piëchs and the Porsches, the Klattens and the Quandts – are among the wealthiest people in Germany.View image in fullscreenA Greenpeace protest in Berlin over Germany’s demand for exemptions to EU-wide legislation banning the sale of new combustion engine cars by 2035.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesThe outsized role the car industry plays in Germany’s economy and its national identity means these companies get a disproportionate amount of space in which to air their demands. A few days before the Brussels meeting, the chancellor, Friedrich Merz,showed upat the annual international automotive exhibition in Munich. He stood in front of a microphone in a brightly lit hall, using the industry’s argot to signal to the company bosses that hewas hearing them: “We do not want a restriction on a single solution, we want competition of the best ideas and the best technologies.” But what Merz was arguing for would thwart the evolution that is required if the German car industry is to have a future at all.“The future is electric,” von der Leyensaid inher state of the union address two days before meeting the car manufacturers. This is not just an empty slogan. In August 2025, registration of new electric vehicles in Germanywent up by 46%year-on-year. The industry itself is not united on the topic. On the day of Merz’s speech, anopen lettersigned by 150 companies in the EV sector called on the commission president to “hold firm” on the 2035 ban on new combustion engines. Gernot Döllner, head of German carmaker Audi, called the renewed questioning of the phase-out “counterproductive”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May, the European Commissionloosened its ruleon the proportion of climate-neutral vehicles in any new fleet, extending manufacturers’ deadlines to meet their targets by two years. This appears to have saved many companies from having to pay painful fines – with the exception of Mercedes-Benz, which is likely to be the only EU carmaker tomiss its emission targets. This is the company headed by Kallänius, who so strongly argued against the targets.The 2015 diesel scandal – in which companies such as Volkswagenmanipulated softwareto make their cars seem cleaner – has shown what the industry is capable of. Yet even when it was misleading the German government and harming the “Made in Germany” brand in the process, it did not fear any backlash. Indeed, the manufacturers are granted millions of euros in subsidies for research every year, on things such as driverless cars: BMW alone reported receivingat least €36mfrom Germany and the EU in 2024.Sticking to the 2035 plan and switching to cleaner technology is especially important, given the wider green backsliding. Citizens and businesses alike need stability and predictability in these economically turbulent times. But this will only come from recognising the urgent need to modernise – not from ripping up regulations and turning back the clock.Tania Roettger is a journalist based in BerlinThis article was amended on 29 September 2025 to remove a potentially misleading reference to cleaner “fuels” in the final paragraphExplore more on these topicsAutomotive industryOpinionGermanyClimate crisisEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Now, in a spectacular production, its first performers are bringing it back. But would Bausch have approved?Chris WiegandMon 29 Sep 2025 11.43 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 13.24 EDTShareTheatres are haunted houses: on any stage, the ghosts of past performances can rise. At the opera house in Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, you can imagine the decades-ago premieres of Pina Bausch’s first potenttanztheatershows, which left audiences either enraptured or slamming the exit door. An original cast member may still appear in revivals today, giving a tantalising link to the history of a company now packed with dancers who joined after the German choreographer’sdeath in 2009. But tonight a full house in Wuppertal is watching Bausch’s classic Kontakthof delivered by a cast of nine, all of whom created it here almost 50 years ago. And they are accompanied by ethereal archive footage of the production from 1978, blown up to a dizzying scale.It is uncanny and moving to see them enter, in monochrome outfits, their steps mirroring those from the black and white film projected on an enormous gauze screen. It engulfs the performers so the images of their younger selves, at a height of several metres, loom over them.Kontakthofwas first staged with 20 dancers and those who have not returned for this iteration – some of them deceased – remain frozen in time in film, accompanying tonight’s cast who have more than doubled in age since.I walked in like Joan Crawford wearing red lipstick and fur coat. Pina gave me a smileA scene with two performers in 1978 is recreated with just one, the missing member’s absence keenly felt. At times, the older dancers seem to partner their young selves, bringing shades ofStephen Sondheim’s Follies. How does it feel to live in these bodies, half a century on? A sequence combining orgasmic cries from then and now gives one answer. Later, in a round of confessions, the cast assess their personalities. Meryl Tankard tells the audience she wishes she’d had children, she misses her mum and she is shy. Plus: “Resourceful, resilient, reliable.”View image in fullscreen‘I was quite shocked’ … another recreated moment.Photograph: Ursula KaufmannShe’s not wrong. Kontakthof: Echoes of 78, conceived and directed by Tankard, is a spectacular feat, not just in technical execution but in how the concept deepens the themes of the original. When we meet at the opera house, Tankard – born in Australia in 1955 – lists her initial worries. “The whole fear at the beginning was Pina and how dare I touch her work. But I just felt I was going right back and actually finding the essence of it.” Her voice wavers. “Ithinkshe would like it.”Bausch herself had a notion that the original cast might return to the piece in later age. More than most of her works, Kontakthof has been expressly staged with performers’ ages in mind: in 2000 it was put on with a new cast ofover-65s; eight years later it was done with teenagers (documented in the filmDancing Dreams).View image in fullscreen‘You should be grateful that you have been asked to give’ … Pina Bausch.Photograph: Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/AlamyIts themes are eternal: cruelty, control, loneliness, seduction and the quest for pleasure, accompanied by airy reverie and surreal humour. “For me, she choreographed vulnerability,” says Tankard, remembering how Bausch would give dancers cues to open up and create autobiographical material. “She hardly ever directed how you did it. If she liked it, that’s exactly what she wanted you to replicate. She always said: ‘A lot of people can’t repeat that spontaneity.’ I realised how important this vulnerability was. It was not so much the action but the fear.”Tankard joined Bausch’s company in 1978. “It was my third year in the Australian Ballet.Anne Woolliamshad taken over and she said to me: ‘You should choreograph.’ I used to design huge cakes, knit complicated jumpers, anything creative … I did feel a bit frustrated. I guess she saw that.” Tankard created a piece, Birds Behind Bars, which won prize money that she spent on travel to Europe. Acquaintances kept recommending that she watch Bausch’s work and she was handed the number of a fellow Australian in the company, Josephine Ann Endicott, who took her to a rehearsal in Wuppertal.“There were all these intellectual German actors sitting there,” she says, adopting a serious pose. “I walk in wearing a South American skunk coat like Joan Crawford, and red lipstick. Pina gave me this little smile, and said I could join the rehearsal.” That day’s improv was to show six ways of being surprised. “I remember my little sequence. She was going: ‘Schneller! Schneller! Schneller!’ … I stayed the whole day, then she said she would audition me. We did a ballet class, three hours, with Rite of Spring movements. At 11.30pm, she says, ‘OK, I’ll take you.’”At 11.30pm, she says, ‘OK, I’ll take you’Extricated from her ballet contract, Tankard returned to Wuppertal. It had been five years since Bausch took over at the opera house, breaking new ground with her dance-theatre. “They were still booing,” says Tankard. “Scheiße, get out of town, you know?” Tankard turned up “with two suitcases full of vintage clothes. I had all these 40s dresses – I used to wear cocktail hats, smoke Sobranies.” Rolf Borzik, Bausch’s partner and designer, saw she loved clothes. “He would say, go to the market, buy some dresses, we’ll put them in the show.” She sees Echoes as a posthumous creative collaboration with Borzik who filmed more than 20 tapes of footage that she edited and who died in 1980.View image in fullscreenHomage … Meryl Tankard.Photograph: Régis LansacTankard, who graduated from the Australian Film and Television School in 2010, pursued the project after a movie she had written stalled in development. Borzik’s footage is kept in the vast archives of the Pina Bausch Foundation, overseen by the choreographer’s son, Salomon Bausch. “We always wanted the archive to be something productive, something living,” he says. “I couldn’t imagine a better way to do this than this project.” Echoes makes a fascinating companion piece to Boris Charmatz’s treatment of another 1978 classic, Café Müller, which he presented six times in a row, interspersed with the cast’s personal memories of Bausch, in aphenomenal new productionat the Avignon festival in 2024. (Charmatz has since left his post as artistic director of the company.)View image in fullscreen‘Overwhelming’ … Taylor Drury in Kontakthof in 2022.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhy did Borzik document Kontakthof in so much detail? “He was curious – taking pictures, filming, drawing, it’s part of who he was,” says Salomon Bausch. “For rehearsal purposes, they used videos a lot.” Those original materials are still essential for revivals. Taylor Drury, who joined the company in 2020, says that after veteran company members have passed on precise insights and instructions (“their body knowledge”), today’s casts look at the original performance videos for inspiration.Watching Echoes was “really trippy” for Drury. “We’d been performing Kontakthof and then to be in the audience in the same theatre with the same set, seeing the original cast members paired with the videos we have referenced as source material … It was overwhelming.” Drury says there is a “plethora of history and knowledge” around Kontakthof. For her generation, the task is “carrying forward the legacy, staying true to it, while also finding ourselves in the work”.View image in fullscreenLess to prove now  … Josephine Ann Endicott and Meryl Tankard with their younger selves.Photograph: Evangelos RodoulisOnce they had settled on the idea for Echoes, “we thought we shouldn’t wait too long,” says Salomon Bausch. “People don’t get younger!” Some cast members were still active in professional dance, such as Endicott who has restaged several pieces, including Kontakthof. Lutz Förster, who temporarily ran the company after Bausch’s death, danced on and off in Kontakthof for almost 20 years. Others spent a much shorter time in the company and moved on from dance. Echoes – which has a series of international tour dates – is a significant commitment for its cast who are mostly in their 70s. Tankard hadn’t danced on stage for years. But rehearsals proved a triumph for muscle memory. The dancers discovered a different attitude to the material – Elisabeth Clarke says it feels lighter as she has less to prove now.Kontakthof has some horrifying sequences, yet started out exploring tenderness. Bausch could take a caress and turn it into aggression, says Tankard. “I was quite shocked by how much physical violence there was in Kontakthof.” At three hours, it was gruelling to perform. “I said to Pina when I left [in 1984], I just can’t give you any more, I’m sorry. Emotionally, physically, everything … She said, ‘You should be grateful that you have been asked to give.’”Back home in Australia: “I couldn’t get an agent. They said, ‘Oh, you’re not an actor, you’re a dancer … you’re too weird, you don’t fit into a box.’” The shyness she mentions in Echoes was another hindrance. “I think that came from the ballet or from being a Catholic, probably. You’re told to be humble. But nowadays if you don’t get out there and sell yourself, forget it.” She reflects on how dancers today hop across the work of many choreographers: “You get so little time to just find the movement from within, or to be involved emotionally and connected.”Tankard realised, upon their reunion, how little she had got to know her co-stars first time round. “We’ve had time to really value each other.” They all had their fears but the show is notable for its camaraderie. Someone told her after seeing Echoes: who’d have thought Kontakthof, with all its battling characters, would now be about friendship? Tankard smiles as she reflects on those haunting projections towering over the cast. “Our younger selves, I think, gave us a bit of confidence.”Kontakthof: Echoes of 78is on tour and at Sadler’s Wells, London, in April.

We’d got a deal with Mercury. They had committed to an album, but then suddenly changed all their top people and we got dumped. I remember thinking: “Bastards.”No one would answer the phone to us. We felt invisible and rejected. That’s what the lyrics to That’s Not My Name are all about: “They call me Stacey / They call me Her / They call me Jane / That’s not my name.”We were trying to regroup and lick our wounds by throwing parties. We lived in Islington Mill Studios in Salford, a rundown cotton mill where students would create their textile designs. We only had three songs – That’s Not My Name, Shut Up and Let Me Go and Great DJ – so we’d perform on stage, DJ CDs badly and pump out music. I’d jump on the drums with a loop pedal, Katie would throw on my Strat, we’d art punk it out and it felt amazing.It went into the stratosphere: two-year-olds and grandmas were singing along to itThere was a girl living at the mill who said: “I love what you’re doing. Can I put a record out?” She had this little label called Switchflicker, so we went halves on the £2,000 it cost to print 500 vinyl records of That’s Not My Name and Great DJ as a double A-side.She helped us get it into the Piccadilly Records shop in Manchester by putting it on the shelf illegally. She was also part of the lesbian club scene, who she started inviting to our parties saying: “They’ve got this great song, That’s Not My Name …” Our parties at the mill went from 20 friends to 40, 60, 80 …One of the copies got to John Kennedy on XFM. I remember Mark Radcliffe saying “Strike a light!” when he played it on BBC Radio 6. We were also on Myspace, thinking “Someone from Australia just liked us” which seemed outrageous at the time. We were still doing our parties one Friday a month, but the mood had changed because they were increasingly full of industry people – labels and publishers who wanted to sign us – who didn’t have a laugh and cheer along. Three weeks later, we were at the Sanderson hotel in London, negotiating a deal with Sony.Katie and I have always written together in our own bubble. We produce and write everything ourselves, in our home studio. We’ve been writing for 22 years now. We never dreamed a song would send us around the world six times.Katie White,songwriter/musicianI’m a working-class girl from near Wigan. I grew up listening to the Spice Girls and all the 90s boy/girl bands. I didn’t really finish school and ended up at the mill, which was a crash course in appreciating other people’s cultures. There would be people talking about Andy Warhol, Talking Heads, Gossip and Le Tigre. My vocal delivery to That’s Not My Name is somewhere between the Spice Girls and Le Tigre, with all this energy, performance and expression.It was quite an irregular song for us. It probably went though five or six incarnations before it became That’s Not My Name. It started off as a beat, then kept morphing. Eventually, we’d changed the verses so many times, it had turned into a completely different song.It didn’t really sit in the indie nu-wave/nu-rave scene at the time. NME grabbed hold of us for a while, but then they didn’t know what to do with us because two-year-olds and grandmas were singing along to That’s Not My Name as well. It went into the stratosphere, but has stayed in its own lane. It’s an evergreen song, like My Sharona. You can’t really tell what decade it’s from.‘The fandom was rock’n’roll. Sophie Ellis-Bextor loved our rap song!’’ How we made BalamoryRead moreIt’s constantly used all around the world. It was in a big Starbucks commercial. It’s been featured in lots of films. It went viral on TikTok three years ago. We get asked to write for other artists because they want us to write that sort of song. It’s definitely given us the ability to continue making the music we want.We’ve been a couple all along. We never talked about it at the time because we felt it was distracting. There weren’t many duos around and we were quite private. Now we have a little girl who’s nearly five. For the first two or three years, we were flying three or four times a week. We literally toured the first album nonstop for four years. Normally, you’d have somebody at home and have to put the brakes on at some point. But we kept saying, “Yes, we’ll tour South America!” and “Yes, we’ll go to Japan again”.

All his buildings had a certain postmodernist swagger, but one of his most conspicuous (ironically, in view of its function) was the headquarters of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, on the site of the former Vauxhall pleasure gardens.Completed in 1994, MI6 showed Farrell, who has died aged 87, in his postmodern pomp, energetically juggling historicist motifs to conjure a flamboyant, flesh-coloured fortress, replete with ziggurats and crenellations, dominating its Thames-side locale. Deyan Sudjic described MI6 as “an epitaph for the architecture of the 80s”, and its styling that which “could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple or a piece of clanking art-deco machinery”. Others were less complimentary: “Ceaușescu Towers”, pronounced one critic.Visitors to his penthouse would be greeted by giant model biplanes and ornamental pools containing koi carpFamously, in a case of art imitating life, the MI6 building featured in several James Bond films as home of the fictional 00 section, assailed by assorted villains and eventually reduced to rubble in the2015 epic Spectre.Farrell would have doubtless relished this cinematic conjunction of architecture and popular culture.

Augmenting the trio of Londongrands projetswas Alban Gate (1987), which replaced an outmoded 1960s office block on London Wall with a heroically scaled tower connecting the City and the Barbican. Wrapped in horizontal bands of glass and sugar pink granite, it formed a candy-striped counterpoint to the Barbican’s more effacing modernist milieu.Farrell also designed the nerve centre for TV-am (1983), remodelling a former car showroom on the edge of a canal in Camden Town to house the brave new dawn of British breakfast television, topping it off with perky finials in the form of giant yellow and blue egg cups. Long after the demise of TV-am, one even turned up on the Antiques Roadshow.Originally in partnership with Nicholas Grimshaw before setting up his own practice in 1980, Farrell’s rise coincided with the emergence of postmodernism, catalysed by the polemics ofarchitectural theorist Charles Jencks. His three-year collaboration with Jencks on what was to become theCosmic Housewas pivotal. Farrell was first approached by Jencks in 1978 to remodel a Victorian townhouse in London’s Holland Park and over time the project became a built manifesto and poster child for postmodernism, festooned in layers of metaphor and symbolism, both arcane and whimsical. Now Grade I listed, it was the first house from the postwar era to achieve this distinction.View image in fullscreenPerky finials … Farrell’s TV-am studios in London.Photograph: Richard BryantSome detractors saw Farrell’s conspicuously decorative buildings as mere fripperies but, beneath his genial exterior, he was always intensely serious, striving to make architecture more communicative and uplifting, at a time when modernism seemed to have finally run its course. It proved a successful formula and by the early 90s, his practice had rapidly expanded from modest atelier to international operation, with offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai to capitalise on the architectural and economic liberalisation precipitated by China’s building boom.Farrell first visited Hong Kong in 1964 on a travelling scholarship and China was always close to his heart. The practice’s initial foray into east Asia came as a result of winning an international competition for Hong Kong’s Peak Tower in 1997. Variously likened to a wok, boat and cupped hands, the tower’s crescent-shaped profile quickly became a local landmark, even featuring for a time on Hong Kong’s $20 banknote. Subsequent projects in the region included the 442m-high KK100 skyscraper in Shenzhen (2012), at the time the tallest building to be designed by a British architect.He was also perhaps the only architect to have a train named after him – the “Sir Terry Farrell”, a Class 222 locomotive unit, operating on the east coast mainline between King’s Cross and Hull, in recognition of Farrell designing The Deep, Hull’s giant aquarium, which opened in 2002.View image in fullscreenFarrell in his flat above his former aircraft factory office.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverFarrell’s London office occupied a former aircraft factory just off Edgware Road, which had turned out Spitfires during the war. Its art deco styling was a curiously apt synthesis of ornament and industry, and for more than 20 years, Farrell lived above the shop in an airy and richly decorated penthouse, where visitors would be greeted by ornamental pools containing koi carp and giant model biplanes suspended from steel roof trusses.Towards the end of his career, Farrell was drawn back to Newcastle, where he grew up and studied architecture. Familiar with the city’s layers of history and topographic drama, he added to it with the Centre for Life and masterplans for the University and Quayside (he was also a talented urban designer). Latterly, he helped to fund theFarrell Centre, set in Newcastle’s Victorian Claremont Buildings, which were remodelled by two local practices.Spies, eggcups and penthouses: Sir Terry Farrell’s best buildings – in picturesRead moreHis idea was that every city should have an “urban room”, where people could learn more about the forces shaping architecture and urban design. The project typified Farrell’s belief in the importance of connecting directly with the public. For him, architecture was not simply about the creation of monuments – though over time, he had his fair share of those – but how it was part of wider popular and social culture.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureTerry FarrellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the time she died aged 39 in 2006, taken by ovarian cancer, she’d left behind a body of ultra-simple, mega-bold, hyper-colourful painting that functions as a testament to a life lived honestly, independently and very, very hornily.The earlier works here are stranger and more enigmatic than what comes later. Murni paints hybrid figures, half-plant, half-human, part-animal, part-woman. Branches grow out of bare bums, heads poke out of scale-covered fish bodies, long limbs loop and distend, bodies twist and undulate.There is endless symbolism here. High heels, mermaids, fish, mirrors, eyes, clocks. It’s heavily surreal, a sort of ultra-feminine comic book take onGiorgio de Chirico.Everywhere you look there are cocks throbbing and piercing and eruptingShe wasn’t working in total isolation. One wall in the opening gallery is dedicated to the small circle of artists she was part of, includingMondo(an Italian who had relocated to Bali),MokohandTotol. They also took a simple, bold approach to surreal mythical painting, but with different results. Totol’s monochrome beasties wear military hats in an outwardly political move; Mokoh’s creatures are notably more traditional and Balinese; and Mondo’s approach is way closer to classical portraiture. All different, but with so much shared intention that it’s easy to see why this group was so attracted to each other.Murni’s later work stands apart though. The paintings are now infinitely more brazen, a total embrace of desire and sexuality. A pig in a bra puts on lipstick. High heels – sexily feminine and absolutely lethal – kick and stomp. Vaginas are worshipped by kneeling figures or penetrated by tentacles; breasts are bound by wristwatches; couples hump and writhe; everywhere you look there are cocks throbbing and piercing and erupting. They pop out of cups, wrap around women’s bodies, nudge at orifices. It’s all desire, totally unbound, totally free.View image in fullscreenA total embrace of sexuality … Eye Meets Eye by I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih.Photograph: Courtesy Gajah Gallery & The Estate of I Gusti Ayu Kadek MurniasihBut those wristwatches and clock faces haunt the work, an awareness of impending mortality. Time is short, death is coming. And what better way to spend what little time you have left than bonking?The exhibition doesn’t do a particularly good job of placing Murni within the wider context of Indonesian art. You don’t come away with any sense of how different – or similar – her work was to the dominant forms of art of her time, or Indonesian art history, which leaves you floundering as a viewer. Context matters, especially when introducing an unfamiliar artist.But it’s also an intentional move. Murni explicitly rejected her circumstances. She wasn’t interested in the norms of Balinese society, in going to temple, dressing traditionally, being subservient. She lived her life, and she lived it on her terms. And that’s how the work is presented – as the visual output of a singular, independent, defiant woman. This isn’t aboutBalior tradition, it’s about sex, dreams, desire and, most of all, it’s about Murni.I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih: Feels Strangely Good, Ya? is at Nottingham Contemporary until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designBalireviewsShareReuse this content"

Bacchae reveals the virtues and vices of creating a new play from oldMichael BillingtonMon 29 Sep 2025 09.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 09.41 EDTShareHow on earth do we stage Greek tragedy today? Broadly speaking, there are three possible approaches: re-creation, updating and rewriting. All three have been tried at the National Theatre across 30 productions, starting with Philoctetes in 1964 and leading toNima Taleghani’s new Bacchae. Having seen virtually all of these, and visited the excellent exhibition about them in the Olivier’s Wolfson Gallery, I should be able to decide which is the best method. Yet, in all honesty, I find the National’s approach to the Greeks a strange mixture of hit and myth.Re-creating the past is, of course, impossible: as Edgar Allan Poe once remarked, reproducing an Attic tragedy for a modern audience is “the idea of a pedant and nothing beyond”. But, even if we are not living in Athens in the fifth century BC, we can adopt the staging techniques then used. The most zealous attempt to do so came from Peter Hall who, in his 1981 production of Aeschylus’s The Oresteia, had an all-male cast entirely in masks. Masks were employed in ancient Athens because the occasion was a religious ritual. One actor played many roles and facial features had to be exaggerated in a vast space; what was once a practical necessity now seemed an artistic barrier. But that doesn’t invalidate the attempt to imaginatively recreate the past.View image in fullscreenTragedy unlocked … Christopher Eccleston (Creon) and Jodie Whittaker as Antigone at the Olivier theatre, directed by Polly Findlay in 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn his 1980 Berlin production of The Oresteia, the great German director Peter Stein made you feel, as you watched Clytemnestra standing over the bodies of her husband and his lover with a sword dripping blood, that you were tapping into a collective historical memory. The more common approach in the UK is to retain the text but update the setting and this has been tried, mostly with great success, at the National.Katie Mitchell set Euripides’sIphigenia at Aulisin a dilapidated, requisitioned mansion (2004) and hisWomen of Troyin the bleak offices of a war-scarred ferry terminal (2007). Polly Findlay’sAntigone(2012) began with the whirring sound of a helicopter; as everyone cheered the capture of an enemy of the state, one was reminded of the White House situation room during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. In Carrie Cracknell’sMedea(2014), our first sight of Helen McCrory’s stunning heroine was of a woman in singlet and dungarees emerging from a bathroom, cleaning her teeth. It is striking how often at the National it has been female directors, going back toAnnie Castledinewith Women of Troy in 1995, who have found the key to unlocking Greek tragedy.View image in fullscreenBleak office politics … Kate Duchene (Hecuba) in Women of Troy by Euripides, directed by Katie Mitchell at the Lyttelton theatre in 2007.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut there is a third category of plays that are inspired by Greek tragedy – and here the results are decidedly mixed. The most ambitious was Edward Bond’s The Woman (1977), which used Greek myth to show the exiled Trojan women delivering from Athenian occupation the island on which they were shipwrecked. My memory is of a terrific play which put female realpolitik before male posturing as the key to physical survival. Less successful, in my estimation, were Kae Tempest’sParadise(2021), which relocated Philoctetes to a modern refugee camp and regendered the leading roles, and Simon Stone’sPhaedra(2023), which was a muddled, scenically overblown attempt to show the classic protagonist as a charismatic politician in thrall to the son of her dead lover.Which brings us to the present version ofBacchae, which demonstrates the virtues and vices of creating a new play out of an old myth. On the plus side, there is the way Taleghani individualises the chorus members and suggests that a reconciliation of state power and personal freedom is still a possibility. But the writing is often crude, Taleghani ticks off too many hot topics and, when it comes to dramatic storytelling, he is no match for Euripides. (To take just one example, Agave’s realisation that the decapitated head she is clutching is that of her son, Pentheus, seems anti-climactic after she has earlier, and noisily, dismembered his messenger.)There is no doubting the exuberance of Indhu Rubasingham’s production but, looking at this work along with that of Tempest and Stone, I find myself wishing that instead of rewriting the Greeks – or indeed any past masterpieces – we could grapple with them in all their baffling, multiayered complexity.Bacchae is at theOlivier theatre, National Theatre, London, until 1 November. The Greeks: Radical Reinvention is at theWolfson Gallery, London, until February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatrePolly FindlayKatie MitchellCarrie CracknellHelen McCroryEuripidesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve been driven mad by this book,” she said. “I know that if somebody else made it, I’d be furious. It’s very personal material for everyone. It’s very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private.”Fennell said her first adolescent experience of the novel inspired her approach to the sex-charged retelling of Catherine Earnshaw and orphan Heathcliff’s relationship, set on the moors of 18th-century Yorkshire. “It’s an emotional response to something. It’s primal, sexual,” she said.Fennell added: “[It is] an act of extreme masochism to try and make a film of something that means this much to you. There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it.” Working on it has been “a kind of masochistic exercise”, she said, “because I love it so much, and it can’t love me back, and I have to live with that”.The production hasreceived backlash for the castingof Margot Robbie as Catherine and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff, with critics calling for a Black actor to play the latter character, described in the book as having dark hair, dark eyes and dark skin.Fennell explained her decisions, recalling the moment she “wanted to scream” when she saw Elordi with sideburns on the Saltburn set, as he reminded her of Dirk Bogarde and “looked exactly like the illustration of Heathcliff on the first book that I read”.View image in fullscreen‘A godlike power’ … Margot Robbie (Cathy) in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: YouTubeRobbie, she continued, is “not like anyone I’ve ever met and I think that’s what I felt like with Cathy”. Describing the wily protagonist as a “sadist” who “likes to pinch you”, Fennell added that Robbie is “the type of person who, like Cathy, could get away with anything. I think honestly she could commit a killing spree and nobody would mind.”“It needed somebody like Margot … somebody who has a power, an otherworldly power, a godlike power, that means people lose their minds.”Kharmel Cochrane, the film’s casting director, previously defended the choices, saying there is “no need to be accurate” as the source material is “just a book”.Fennell also confirmed that, as with many other adaptations, the film will only focus on the first half of the book and not continue the story after Cathy’s death. She added that “an enormous amount of dialogue is verbatim” because “I couldn’t better it, and who could?”For the sceptics, Fennell said that part of the novel’s enduring power is that “no one is in agreement about any element of it”, and she added: “I can’t make something for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmerald FennellWuthering HeightsFilm adaptationsEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordinewsShareReuse this content"

Many words have already been written about the good in Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film – some say “masterpiece” – includinga five-star review in the Guardian. The electrifying pace of the action; that instant-classic car chase sequence and Benicio del Toro’s heroically chill Sensei Sergio, have all been justly praised. So let’s take this as read.But if a film is worth seeing, then it’s worth taking seriously, and in this case that involves asking: dear, revered PTA, what is up with you and Black women? We know Anderson is careful and deliberate in his introduction of a racial dimension to this story. We know this because in the original 1990 novel, Vineland by Thomas Pynchon, the character corresponding to Perfidia Beverly Hills (played by Teyana Taylor), is white, with “fluorescent” blue eyes. Her daughter (played by mixed-race Chase Infiniti) is also therefore white, and while the race of the character corresponding to the other prominent Black woman in the film – Deandra, played by Regina Hall – is not specified, she is usually presumed to be white.Sometimes film-makers go the other way with books about American history, and that’s tricky too. When Sofia Coppola adapted The Beguiled into a 2017 film starring Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst, she meticulouslyexcised all the Black and mixed-race female characters from Thomas P Cullinan’s civil war-set novel, so that this southern belle soft-life fantasia needn’t be troubled by the brutal realities of the 19th-century slave economy.In this context, there’s lots to celebrate about Anderson’s approach. The actors themselves all deliver commanding, compelling performances and, though she’s underused, it’s always a treat to see Regina Hall demonstrate her phenomenal range (For more of this,see her in 2018’s Support the Girls). There is also something undeniably timely (probably too late, actually) about the at-once farcical and terrifying spectacle of a paramilitary border force harassing teenagers at a high-school dance and raiding the “little Latino Harriet Tubman situation” going on at Sensei Sergio’s place.It would be fair to say that Anderson has boldly stepped up to a moment in American history which requires artists to be bold. Sadly, it seems – with regard to the intersection of race and gender, at least – he’s bitten off more than he can chew. This begins with the character of Perfidia, who is hyper-sexualised way beyond the normal horniness that firework-lighting in the company of late-eraLeonardo DiCapriomight arouse. This is a woman who prioritises getting off over getting away from an imminently exploding bomb. When she abandons her family, the given reason is that she resents having to compete for her man’s attention with a newborn baby. Her own baby.View image in fullscreenCompelling … Regina Hall (Deandra) in One Battle After Another.Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/AlamySurely a more plausible explanation would have been that her commitment to the cause made it necessary to put the revolution first? Ie, the same reasoning male ideologues have been using to justify neglecting their families for time immemorial? But no, Anderson went for extreme horniness instead. This is a choice. Just like it was a choice to name another of his Black female revolutionary characters “Junglepussy” – inspired by the performer’s real stage name, a sexualised spin on the old racist slur “jungle bunny”. Or to have Perfidia express her principled defiance of the fascistic state with the phrase “this pussy don’t pop for you”. (Note to white male screenwriters: not every Black woman talks like Cardi B. And even Cardi B doesn’t sound like a Cardi B record all the time.)These are choices which indicate that Anderson is unaware of theracist Jezebel trope, which originated during the endemic sexual exploitation of chattel slavery and has been perpetuated by American pop culture in various guises ever since. Either that, or he’s expressing a Tarantino-esque overconfidence in his ability to radically repurpose derogatory language and imagery which is not – and has never been – directed at him.‘I’m a hustler, a grinder’: Teyana Taylor on music, motherhood and One Battle After AnotherRead moreAlso Tarantino-esque, and not in a good way, is the film’s fetishised depiction of interracial relationships. The most overtly icky of these is the one between Perfidia and Colonel Lockjaw, a white supremacist grotesque played by Sean Penn as a collection of lascivious tics in military gear. There’s a scene in which Lockjaw sidles up to Bob (DiCaprio) and whispers: “Do you like Black girls? I love them.” This is intended to demonstrate the character’s repellence, but would be much more effective as such, if we hadn’t just seen lovable Bob describe his attraction to Perfidia in pretty much the same terms, moments earlier. Or Avon Barksdale from The Wire (aka actor Wood Harris) fondly describing his girlfriend Alana Haim as “an ordinary, working white girl”. In the OBAA worldview, all interracial relationships are apparently founded on a race kink, with the possibility of genuine connection only ever a happy after-thought. (Yes, PTA is in a relationship with a Black or mixed-race woman, Maya Rudolph, and no, such personal circumstances do not absolve a film-maker from the need to consider the points I’m raising.)Sorry to complicate your enjoyment of your new favourite film. I know pointing this out risks upsetting those Letterboxd loyalists who can brook no challenge whatsoever to their favourite film-maker. To them I say: please don’t worry yourselves unduly about Anderson’s feelings. He’s a big boy. I promise you; he can take it. And also, I’d refer you again to the film’s title, which is really another way of expressing that old revolutionary’s credo about being in it for the long haul, accepting that the necessary change likely won’t happen in our lifetimes, but we’ve got to keep at it, all the same: The revolution continues, one battle after another. Maybe we’ll get it right next time.This article was amended on 29 September 2025 to clarify that name of the One Battle After Another character Junglepussy is the same as the performer’s own stage name.Explore more on these topicsFilmPaul Thomas AndersonRaceLeonardo DiCaprioAction and adventure filmsThrillersWomencommentShareReuse this content"

This makes perfect sense. He co-created it, co-wrote it, stars as its lead, convinced the great and good of Hollywood to be in it with him and directed it with such a vaulting sense of ambition that, when itwon more Emmysthan any other comedy in history a few weeks ago, nobody even flinched. The Studio is the show that has cemented Rogen’s status as a comic visionary.However, if I might offer a small footnote here: Platonic is pretty great, too.True, Platonic will almost certainly go down as Rogen’s other show. It’s far less striving than The Studio. It’s not full of dazzling one-take scenes, nor is it jam-packed with A-list guest stars. It has far less to say about the state of anything at all. But Platonic’s second season is wrapping up, so now is the time to state that, pound for pound, it may actually qualify as his most enjoyable show.If you’ve yet to see it, Platonic is a sitcom about two people (Rogen as Will andRose Byrneas Sylvia), who have to navigate the difficulties that come with being old friends with someone of the opposite sex. There’s a bracing lack of sexual or romantic undercurrent to their friendship, but that doesn’t stop their romantic partners from occasionally becoming suspicious of their motives. The bigger problem is the co-dependency that has formed between them over the years, which intermittently rears up and forces them to act like petulant teenagers when they’re together.View image in fullscreenA bracing lack of sexual undercurrent … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Paul Sarkis/Apple TV+If that sounds low stakes, that’s really the intention. Once the premise has been established (which takes an episode and a half), Platonic simply becomes an opportunity for Rogen and Byrne to hang out and be as charismatic as possible. And it turns out that is spectacularly charismatic. Rogen, to some degree, plays a version ofSeth Rogenwe have seen onscreen before. He’s juvenile, unambitious and trapped in a state of arrested development. This is something he has always been good at. Rose Byrne, on the other hand, is an absolute revelation.When Byrne is onscreen, it’s difficult to look at anything else. As the more mature of the partnership – she is married with children, while Rogen is not – you’d expect her to be the straight woman, but in reality she is an explosion of heightened reaction shots. In every scene, her face spirals through a spectrum of microexpressions, landing on the least-expected choice. Her timing is pin sharp. She has the broad physicality of a silent movie star. I recently found myself watching28 Weeks Later, and found myself bored to tears by her staid performance, but to see her so effortlessly outshine comic performers of the highest calibre in Platonic is to wish that she had always done this sort of thing.This goes double for the current season. Overall, it’s a little more fractured than the first – a plot about Rogen’s new fiancee runs out of steam after a handful of episodes, and gets replaced by more generic sitcommy fare – but Rogen and (especially) Byrne sell the hell out of it. You want to be in their company for ever.In a perfect world, Platonic would run for years and be as popular as Friends. That’s not likely to be the case, though. By all accounts, The Studio is not just the bigger show, but the project that requires the most of Rogen. As that grows, there will be less room for this in his life. And, knowing how television works, the longer Platonic stays on the air, the harder it will be to resist throwing an element of Ross and Rachel-style will they, won’t they into the mix.View image in fullscreenSells the hell out of it … Rose Byrne in Platonic.Photograph: Paul Sarkis/Apple TV+This would be terrible. The tension from Platonic comes from those around Rogen and Byrne, and their conspiracies about a romance. The first season revolved around Byrne’s husband’s insecurities about the pair, and the best parts of the second mirror that from the perspective of Rogen’s fiancee. But Rogen and Byrne remain an impenetrably oblivious bubble. The instant there is so much as a lingering glance between the pair, the show will be dead. Platonic is not a “will they, won’t they”. It is a “please don’t”.If Platonic were to end now, there are ostensibly plenty of other shows with which to soak up the loss. It falls neatly among Apple’s stable of low-effort comedies about nice people being nice to each other. Ted Lasso is a little like that.Shrinkingis a little like that.Stickis a little like that. But Platonic is too twitchy and restless to be categorised like that. For all their chemistry, the two leads are spiky and prone to self-sabotage – one episode is purely about Byrne having to parent after ingesting ketamine – which puts it a peg above the competitors.Still, right now the conversation is all about The Studio. And, again, this makes sense. As a piece of television, The Studio is more impressive than Platonic. But Platonic is so much easier to love. Let’s hope there continues to be room for both of them.Platonic is on Apple TV+. The finale airs on 1 October.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSeth RogenRose ByrneTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Such beliefs are legally protected, and I wouldn’t want to see any of them threatened with loss of work, or violence, or death, because of them.”She adds: “However, Emma and Dan [Radcliffe] in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right – nay, obligation – to critique me and my views in public.”Watson, along with Harry Potter co-stars Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, has previously taken issue with the author’s gender critical beliefs. She responded to Rowling’s essay about the need for single-sex spaces due to the threat of violence against women by tweeting in 2020: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.” And Watsonpointedly said “I’m here for all of the witches”in a speech at the 2022 Bafta film awards.In her post, Rowling says she has “repeatedly declined invitations” to comment on Watson’s views, as she “didn’t want her to be hounded as the result of anything I said”, and describes a note she was given from Watson, following her 2022 Baftas remarks. “This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family’s safety. Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”Rowling added: “Like other people who’ve never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she’s ignorant of how ignorant she is … I wasn’t a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous. I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women’s rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.”Rowling hadearlier indicatedthat she was unprepared to forgive Watson and Radcliffe for having “cosied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights”.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmma WatsonJK RowlingHarry Potter (Film)Harry Potter (Books)TransgenderScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

The figure rose to 72% for workers with disabilities.It comes after a flurry of high-profile cases, including allegations againstGregg Wallace. The cases fuelled several attempts to improve behaviour in the sector, including aculture reviewat the BBC and the creation of an independent standards body.However, the union’s survey of the creative industry workforce revealed that serious issues still persist, with many of those who encountered toxic behaviour not reporting it.More than seven in 10 also said behaviours that would be considered toxic and inappropriate in public life were often tolerated within the creative industries, despite efforts to tackle it.It increased to eight in 10 in the world of unscripted television, a sector that has been under financial stress as broadcasters have funnelled more money towards high-end drama. Insiders say freelance workers, already struggling for work, still feel nervous about putting their heads above the parapet.Overall, 61% of creative workers said they had personally witnessed or experienced bullying or harassment in the workplace. More than 5,500 creative industry workers in non-performing roles were surveyed, from theatre to film and TV to fashion.Big television production companies have made serious efforts to improve behaviour in an industry reliant on freelance workers. Anonymous hotlines and protections for whistleblowers have been introduced, alongside the industry-wideCreative Industries Independent Standards Authority (CIISA).However, many figures across the industry fear the issue is unresolvable because of the power imbalance between on-screen “talent”, senior staff and the freelance workforce. Only 55% of those who experienced bullying or harassment had reported the incident – and of those who did, 42% said the response was insufficient.Meanwhile, there have been concerns about the long-term funding from some of the industry’s big players for CIISA. Some industry figures also have concerns about the body’s ability to investigate claims, given it has no legal powers.Philippa Childs, the head of Bectu, said the ongoing issues experienced by people in the creative industry were “driving skilled workers out of the sector and leading to untold misery and exploitation”.“Recent scandals are just the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Behind these statistics are thousands of stories of often young freelance workers who live in fear because of the power and impunity of powerful men in the industry.“We welcome recent initiatives to clean up the sector, but the voluntary funding commitments from employers while welcome are far from universal, and are indicative of the lack of seriousness with which many still view this issue.”Some freelance workers are demanding stronger bullying protections in contracts and clearer processes for complaints. Some say they still do not know what to do if they are subjected to poor behaviour.Nandy said: “Everyone has the right to feel safe, respected and protected in their workplace, whether that’s on stage, on set or behind the scenes. The figures reported in this survey are deeply concerning, and it’s vital that victims feel supported and empowered to speak out. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour must always be treated with the utmost seriousness.“I expect the sector to take robust action to tackle these issues, including through strong, cross-industry backing for the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority.”The government recently changed the law tostop non-disclosure agreements from being used to silence employeeswho have suffered harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Bectu says that change needs to be enforced in practice, given the pressure many workers face.Jen Smith, the chief executive of CIISA, said long-term funding was still required to properly establish an independent body to provide “safe, confidential advice and a trusted route to report concerns”.“CIISA receives no statutory funding and, in order to do our work unfettered, long-term financial commitment from industry is required,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSexual harassmentTelevision industryTelevisionFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

His family moved to Newcastle and he grew up on what he described as “the edge of the edge” of the city, “on a building site next to the fields”, in a council estate called the Grange.He stayed in the city, graduating with a degree in architecture from the Newcastle University School in 1961, before crossing the Atlantic to attend the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia where he obtained a master’s degree in urban planning.Farrell would come back to the UK, working briefly with the architects department of the Greater London Council, by which he was unimpressed. He told the Observer: “It was astonishing, leaderless and rudderless; people just invented their own solutions.”View image in fullscreenThe Deep aquarium in Hull.Photograph: Vincent Lowe/AlamyIt was away from the public sector that Farrell would flourish.In 1965 he moved to London, forming a partnership with Grimshaw. Dubbed the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership, they also shared a studio with experimental British architecture collective Archigram.Grimshaw would go on to design the Eden Project in Cornwall, while Farrell was often described as the “less assertive” of the pair. “For 15 years I tagged along in Nick’s wake,” he once said.Despite his modesty, Farrell’s buildings were often bold and loud.The MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall, which opened in 1994, is perhaps Farrell’s best-known building. Once described by the architecture criticRowan Moore as a “flesh-coloured ziggurat”of a building, it was typical of “the big, imposing buildings for powerful institutions” that Farrell specialised in.Other Farrell buildings include Embankment Place and the Home Office headquarters in London as well as The Deep in Hull, andAlban Gate– the “shoulder-padded office block” that defined the “big bang architecture” in the City of London.View image in fullscreenFarrell pictured in 2023.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverHe also worked in east Asia, designing Beijing railway station and Guangzhou South railway station in China. He also created the 442-metreKK100 tower in Shenzhen– the world’s tallest building by a British architect.Sir Nicholas Grimshaw obituaryRead more“Terry was frequently called a maverick and a nonconformist, which he relished,” his studio continued in its social media post. “He was an architect who was never quite part of the ‘club’. He will be remembered as the UK’s leading architect planner whose enduring commitment to urbanism has helped shape government policy on key built-environment issues.”He was 84 when theFarrell Centre, part of Newcastle University, opened. It includes a gallery and an “urban room” – a place where “local people can go to learn about the past, present and future of where they live”, something that was important to Farrell, who invested £1m of his own money in the project.Farrell campaigned for conservation but was also keen on buildings being adapted. “Conservation is a mind thing rather than a designation,” he said in 2023, when the Farrell Centre was opened. “A cardboard house,’’ he added, if people are motivated to take care of it, “lasts for ever.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureTerry FarrellnewsShareReuse this content"

It asks that rap music in particular should not be used to unfairly implicate individuals in criminal charges and should only be used where directly linked to an alleged crime.Campaigners want to see expert witnesses on this form of music in criminal prosecutions be independent, as opposed to police officers who are part of the prosecution case, along with procedural safeguards against stereotyping.Dr Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, an associate professor of law at London School of Economics and a leading authority in this area, shared research data with the Guardian looking at court of appeal cases involving rap and drill used as part of prosecution evidence between 2005 and 2025. Between 2005 and 2018, there were 20 cases, but between 2019 and the first part of 2025, there were 33 cases, more than a threefold increase in the yearly rate.Owusu-Bempah said her data was “the tip of the iceberg” because many cases where rap and drill lyrics are used as part of a prosecution case in a criminal trial do not reach the court of appeal, even if there has been a miscarriage of justice.View image in fullscreenAdemola Adedeji and Ty’rone Horton.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianCrimes where these lyrics and videos were used as part of the evidence include murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of a firearm. About half of the cases involve joint enterprise and many involve gang membership. Where ethnicity was specified in the data Owusu-Bempah gathered, the individuals were overwhelmingly black and male and in their teens or early 20s. While some of the appeals were allowed, many were dismissed.At an event on Wednesday evening supported by Clifford Chance solicitors, speakers includingAdemola Adedeji, one of the “Manchester 10”, whose conviction was quashed in January after police misidentified him in a drill video, called for changes in the law. He was imprisoned for 1,181 days. Adedeji told the Guardian that although he was overjoyed to have had his conviction overturned it was not possible to simply pick up on life where it left off when he was wrongfully convicted.‘I need to get out there’: wrongfully identified in drill music video and jailed, he now wants to study lawRead more“I was just 17 when I was convicted,” said Adedeji. “I had a place at university to study law. If the jury hadn’t convicted me I would have finished my degree by now. Instead, I’m struggling to get back on track with going to university. These things are much harder after you’ve come out of prison.”Ty’rone Haughton, a poet who also attended the event, said he believed that stereotyping played a key role in many of these prosecutions.“We all use iambic pentameter, as Shakespeare did. I’m a poet and people feel less threatened by the word ‘poet’ than ‘rapper’, but all of my stuff is inspired by rap.“If prosecutions are looking at the words of rap music, why aren’t they also looking at other genres of music too like rock and heavy metal? And what about the words politicians sometimes use? The lexicon has shifted but that doesn’t mean that rap is a form of criminal morse code. It is just people expressing themselves.”Owusu-Bempah said: “In the majority of court of appeal cases I looked at, the appeals were against sentence with music treated as an aggravating factor. Drill started becoming really popular in 2018 and 2019 and that’s when we started seeing a big increase in cases. Drill music is not gang music.”Crown Prosecution Service sources said that after a review of the issue, CPS will launch a consultation on future guidance relating to this issue in the coming weeks. The sources added that drill or rap music evidence is only used when it is important and relevant to a case.Explore more on these topicsDrillRapnewsShareReuse this content"

Bright says the exhibition’s broad scope allows the many generations of artisans who have worked at Cosprop to reminisce on the productions that inspired them to enter the world of costume design.“Most of the girls in the workroom remember [‘90s BBC series] The House of Eliott, whereas the 50-year-olds sort of remember A Room With a View as their key thing,” he says. “It’s quite nice seeing the different generations relating to different aspects.”Costume Couture highlights a key element of Cosprop’s mission: It makes clothes, not costumes. The distinction is clear for Lodwick. “Cosprop don’t do Bridgerton – Bridgerton is costume. The metaphorical volume has been turned up, the colours, the shapes, the styles, they really have nothing to do with the Regency period,” he says.“Cosprop anchors itself in clothing that is accurate to the time and place, which is why you can look at something like A Room With a View, made 40 years ago, and it hasn’t dated, because it’s authentic 1906 clothing they’re wearing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For most dramas, it’s best to be rooted in reality.”Many of the techniques employed by Cosprop’s staff are no longer in common practice outside the couture ateliers of fashion houses such as Chanel and Dior. Bright says it’s important to keep these techniques alive in an era dominated by cheap machine work “because the past is always what we build the future on – it’s good to have a string that takes us through from the past to the future”, he says.He provides an example of a lavish, beaded mermaid’s dress on display from his film, The Underwater Film. “It embodies all the old craft, but in a slightly new way. I always think it’s important to use the past to tell us more about what we could or should be doing in the future.View image in fullscreenJohn Bright’s quest is to give people ‘a view of another time that isn’t our own’.Photograph: © Paul BulleyLodwick says “a lot of those skills – from alterations to making to millinery – have been lost, and so this one costume house is keeping all those skills alive, so that no matter what project is presented to them, they will apply those [period accurate] techniques, whether it’s Elizabeth or Game of Thrones or Peaky Blinders”.Princess Leia’s Star Wars gold bikini fetches $175,000 at auctionRead moreThe relative historical accuracy of these garments – made using period-accurate materials and techniques – makes it easy to forget that the clothes in Costume Couture aren’t “old”, they just look old. Bright has a large archive of historical clothing; where possible, his employees investigate the structure and design of these clothes up close, giving them first-hand understanding of how to construct recreations so close to the real thing that “you can’t tell what’s original,” says Lodwick.While period dramas are hardly in vogue in the way they may have been in the 1980s and 90s, Lodwick says that there will always be demand for Cosprop’s work. “There will always be ebb and flow – audience taste always changes. There can be a backlash to costume dramas, but as we speak, they’re making a new Pride and Prejudice, they’re making a new Sense and Sensibility, they’re making a new Age of Innocence,” he says. “Perhaps in turbulent times, we kind of need those dramas to take us back to a time where we thought it was all better.”Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsCostume & cultureLondonTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The radical psychiatrist made clear the influence of unacknowledged baggage, the conscious or unconscious laying of traps for the other speaker, and helped us see more clearly the pitfalls of even our most routine conversations. In an era like ours, where global relations can contain as much psychodrama as private ones, Laing’s Zen-like exchanges have more than just individual pertinence.The contrast between Laing’s absurdist, tragicomic sensibility and Steven Pinker’s crisp reasonableness is obvious. But there is more common ground than we might at first think. Pinker illustrates his arguments with piquant little dialogues, some of them worthy of Laing (“You hang up first”. “No, you hang up first.” “Okay.” “She hung up on me!”); this book is as lively an exposition of cognitive science as you are likely to find.The central theme is simply expressed: all acts of communication occur against a background of intricate, recursive assumptions (I know x; you know that I know x; I know that you know that I know x; you know that I know that you know … ad infinitum). What Pinker calls “common knowledge” is both what makes intelligible exchange possible and what complicates it. Communication is not a neat trading of information packages. It is the product of long histories of assumption and symbol; we need to deploy reason in order to arrive at outcomes that are good for everyone involved, and to resist the seductive but potentially suicidal narratives that promise benefit for ourselves alone.Pinker discusses the famous “prisoner’s dilemma”, in which two criminals being interrogated separately have to decide whether or not to betray each other in order to minimise their sentences. If both refuse to help the police they get a light sentence. If one implicates the other, he or she may go free, while their partner suffers an even worse fate: an enticing possibility. But if each prisoner gambles on that strategy – betraying their friend – then it fails and they’re both jailed for a long time. What this shows is that finding the least unfavourable outcome for all may require parking individual interests.As Pinker says, this is a pattern that applies to a very wide range of choices – and precisely because of this, it can be tempting to use it as a universal grid for choosing. It is a model in which there is always an optimal answer, where the choices can be set out diagrammatically to show plainly what is best for everyone. But this works only if both parties have some sort of knowledge of the other – or, to put it more realistically, perhaps, have some sort of trust that the other will respond in an intelligible way. When parties in a conflict stand on the precipice of destruction, this trust transforms into a dangerous gamble that each knows the other well enough to predict they’ll back down (partly, in an absurdly ironic twist, because that’s what they would do in the other’s place). It is why the so-called “madman” strategy in international relations (when a leader behaves in such an unpredictable way that no one could possibly guess how they would respond in a crisis) is so powerful a tool for intimidating others.All this highlights the centrality of “common knowledge” in making sense of another’s acts and words (Pinker is very good on the role of our ability to read physical indicators of thought and attitude). Common knowledge is at work in a whole range of habits that may seem pretty obscure or arbitrary, but which consolidate the mutual trust intrinsic to social cooperation, from myth and ritual to social convention. And this is also why, to cite Pinker’s neat formulation, “rational argument should be really more like a dance than a war”. It is – or can be – a ritual deployment of allusion, shared expectations and cultural performance in which reasonableness is framed and animated by other factors.Pinker directs his strongest polemic at those who deliberately seek to suppress or limit common knowledge in order to protect what is thought to be a vulnerable or fragile social consensus. He argues that the problem with “the cancelling instinct” is that it muddles fact and value, and, through defending what is “right” via legal or social silencing, reinforces the dangerous inference that claims about what is true are always veiled bids for power. But he is not a free-speech absolutist, and makes a careful case for “quarantined topics” where we might agree that unrestrained communication is disproportionately harmful – as with, for example, the manifestos of mass shooters. He does not quite spell it out, but he seems to be saying that this “quarantining” must itself be a matter of shared cultural discernment rather than inquisitorial processes (whether in the courts or online).Overall, then, a lucid, measured discussion of what we need to understand about our communications with each other. Pinker shares with a good many other secular philosophers at the moment a tone of deeply exasperated rationality – a default conviction that there really are ultimately reasonable positions about which sane people cannot sanely disagree, and a despairing acknowledgment that this seems an increasingly unpopular idea. He struggles a bit to give weight to aspects of our moral lives that aren’t always amenable to reason (he is predictably dismissive about religion, for example), yet he does ultimately take this dimension seriously, conceding the legitimacy of social markers of solidarity, without which the mutual trust he is exploring would not survive.This is not a book for anyone in search of metaphysical analysis of the “linguistic animal” (to use the philosopher Charles Taylor’s term). But it enlightens and provokes; to pick up his own metaphor, it is worth dancing with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

First off, the film is beautifully shot, from the opening scene, which tracks back from a hallucinatory landscape until we see the source of a strange sound: a riffled deck of cards in a desperado’s hands. And its central conceit – a little girl (Emily Katherine Ford) whose touch is fatal – flowers into an intriguing metaphor for the consequences of the white man’s burden.Except here the girl is, initially, a black woman’s burden. Formerly enslaved Sarah (DeWanda Wise) runs a homestead on the edge of an Arizona town in a plague-stricken time. The already on-edge locals shun her and her daughter, even though she keeps her child’s apparently deadly hands gloved. Increasingly ground down, Sarah enlists mentally shattered doctor Bender (Guy Pearce) – who ethers himself to sleep every night after his own family tragedy – to escort them across the wilderness to see a preacher to exorcise this dark force. A sour rationalist, he scoffs at her scheme – but he’s happy to take her money.Crowley keeps the focus on the old west’s outcast and marginalised – with Sarah and Bender joined by loquacious farmhand Edward (Jack Alcott); Bender calls him a “simpleton”, but we’d now recognise him as autistic. So their trek is less a strident Searchers-style moral crusade than a procession of oddball encounters reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch’s 1995 western Dead Man (the influence is a little too obvious when, like that film’s William Blake, they take up with a literary-named guide).The film is never far from a spasm of extreme violence, though – for which Crowley, who also co-wrote, often assigns white responsibility. Sometimes he insists on this a little too bluntly, but he develops the idea into something richly suggestive as the exact nature of the girl becomes unignorable. Brought into the world thanks to an act of white original sin, she seems to represent some satanic principle at work in the brutality and death all around. Perhaps Bender’s steadfast scepticism, refusing to acknowledge evil, is a form of self-protection from the notion of his own complicity. Pearce hits the notes of defensive self-denial sharply in the climactic scenes, with Bill Pullman’s leering preacher in an enticing moral conflagration that tiptoes into Cormac McCarthy territory.Devil in the Dust is on digital platforms from 3 October and on DVD from 13 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsGuy PearceScience fiction and fantasy filmsPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, director Luke Sparke angles downwards in his intro from a massacre in an office high-rise overlooking a devastated skyline, towards the ground zero of the action: the bottom of a crater where stricken civilian Mark (Jamie Costa) is pinned under a boulder.After freeing himself just before a rockfall that seals him into a tunnel, Mark encounters Kate (Emalia) also scrabbling around in the dark. Displaying a striking level of panic and a nasty leg wound, she insists – at gunpoint – that he take the rear as they look for a way out. Not only does this petty thief’s looking-after-number-one attitude augur an imminent sticky end for her, the chittering they hear in the dark all around suggests the means is close at hand.Sparke shows some camera chops in conducting this crawlspace nightmare in a series of long takes, sometimes pulling back for poignant, Zippo-lit distance from the spelunkers. But the scenario, as written by Tom Evans, gives the film painfully little room for manoeuvre; there’s lots of tedious wrangling over resources such as light and phone signals, and all-too-obvious false dawns for exit possibilities. When Mark and Kate aren’t scrabbling around, they swap contrived character revelations that feel as if they were invented on the spot to pass the time. And there’s little sense of how the critters – chitinous escapers from Starship Troopers – act behaviourally, or how they fit into the bigger apocalyptic picture.One thing you have to admit is that the film is paced nicely for the experience of two people trapped in a tunnel; it’s both somehow agonisingly underwritten and, with the antic camera and incessant score, strangely overblown. At least the lead actors get a good workout: as an evident graduate of theShelley Duvallschool of panicky acting, Emalia displays a full overadrenalised palette, from hyperventilation to stressed-out severity to throat-tightening meltdown.Scurry is on digital platforms from 6 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Partners in life and in art, the couple build much of their practice around their community in Walthamstow, eastLondon. Their previous project involved setting up an artist-run bank, selling their own currency notes and using the proceeds to buy back £1.2m of debt owned by ordinary local people. This latest film charts an even more ambitious undertaking: to equip the houses on their street with solar panels, transforming the neighbourhood into a power station.Much of the film was shot by Edelstyn during lockdown, when the couple’s master plan first took shape. Zoom meetings with energy experts and collaborators are punctuated with mundane everyday worries, like dirty dishes piling up in the sink. For activists, it seems, life and work are never truly separated. The lo-fi, handheld cinematography, through which Powell and Edelstyn often directly address the viewer, lends a moving intimacy to their momentous endeavours. From sleeping on the roof for a fundraising challenge to planting a thousand sunflowers, their approach prioritises collective action as much as visual impact.Powell and Edelstyn do not shy away from showing some of the lower points of their campaign, though perhaps it would have been informative to learn about their various financial hurdles and organisational missteps in more detail. Still, the film is a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when we simply talk to our neighbours, and it is heartwarming to see different people, from diverse backgrounds but bound by shared economic struggles, come together to make green energy a reality. On this beautiful street, no one is a stranger.Power Station is in UK cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLondonSolar powerArtEnergyRenewable energyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Because this one is, a bit. It’s placid, indifferent, certainly resigned. There are so many elements going into this multi-genre performance, but the result is less than the sum of its parts. The basis is a production originally made for Manchester international festival in 2017,a film and scoreby the late Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (best known for Arrival, Sicario and The Theory of Everything), with text adapted from the 1930 sci-fi novel of the same name by Olaf Stapledon.The narration is coolly voiced by Tilda Swinton, describing the last humans, two billion years from now. They have evolved way beyond current Homo sapiens, communicate only by telepathy and create a few select offspring, each 20 years in gestation. But obliteration is coming. The new element of the production is three dancers (Fukiko Takase, Kelvin Kilonzo and Aoi Nakamura) from choreographer Adrienne Hart’sNeon Dance. Their place is less certain: advanced creatures – with costume props like a glove that extends a hand into a spear – but also fragile humans fiddling while Rome burns.View image in fullscreenHighly evolved humans … Last and First Men.Photograph: Miles HartThe four elements don’t synthesise. What works very well is the film and the score, played by live string quintet. Dense chords simmer into life and fade to silence, like a fissure opening up in a rock revealing a deep well of sound inside. On screen, in black and white, huge hulking structures come into view against greyscale clouds. They are spomeniks, monuments built in the former Yugoslavia in the 20th century. With their great carved curves framing the sky, some look like Oscar Niemeyer’s futuristic architecture, others like ancient standing stones. They are looming, powerful, mesmerising too.Whereas the dance feels the opposite of monolithic, in a way that must be intentional (and there’s only so much you can do with three dancers) but operates as a distraction. Against all that concrete solidity, presence and heft, their bodies are quiet, unimposing; individuals attending to their own small concerns, moving along their own rhythmic paths, busy typing on laptops while the sun explodes. (There’s social commentary there, but like the text, it’s not galvanising). In the end, it’s hard to compute all the inputs, and the dance and text can’t compete with the awe-inspiring scale of the visuals and sound.Explore more on these topicsDanceScience fiction booksScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Two men, old acquaintances, spend a day waiting for someone named Godot – a man? God? Absolution? Nothing? – who never arrives. Instead, they encounter a strange, imperious man and his enslaved companion, then a boy who assures: tomorrow, Godot will come. The next day the same, almost.Samuel Beckett’s modernist masterpiece, one of the most influential and widely performed plays in the English language, disorients the viewer by disassembling theater down to its essentials: performance and interpretation, which even the most seasoned Godot veterans arestill debating. The play’s nonsensical ramblings, existentialist themes and lack of clear meaning have absorbed the absurd realities of places ravaged by prolonged, costly waiting – war-torn Sarajevo, post-Katrina New Orleans, or US prisons – as well asBroadway, subject to increasingly ludicrous demands of celebrity, money and buzz to survive.Art review – James Corden is the cheer-worthy standout of Broadway revivalRead moreThe latest starry revivals in a remarkablystarry yearon Broadway pairsKeanu Reevesand Alex Winter – AKA Bill & Ted, the excellent slacker duo of cinema – withJamie Lloyd, the rare director to achieve layperson name recognition for his ascetic takes on the canon. Among them:Romeo & Julietin deconstructed monochrome,The Seagullbefore a wood-chipped wall,A Doll’s Housewithout a house,Sunset Boulevarddissected via grayscale camera and, most recently, an acclaimed take onEvitathat turned the balcony scene into afree outdoor concert. Waiting for Godot, already a stripped-down text, presents an especially provocative challenge for Lloyd, who tends to strip shows of period markers, staging, color and props in favor of tour-de-force performances and imagination.One does not have to wait long to see Lloyd’s conceit for the notoriously impenetrable play; the curtain rises at the HudsonTheatreto reveal the two shabbily dressed men – Reeves as Estragon (“Gogo”) and Winter as Vladimir (“Didi”) – perched on the substantial lip of what looks like a spotless marble tube, a gleaming funnel of attention into the backstage abyss. (Scenic and costume design by Soutra Gilmour.) What is seemingly the world’s most pristine drainage pipe, which contains all of the waiting for Godot, alternately mesmerized and repulsed me for the show’s two hours; staring at it too long could make one dizzy or, in moments of lighting designer Jon Clark’s intense LEDs, burn your eyes – perhaps the point, if not always an enjoyable one. To be transfixed by either a single shape or an optical illusion – who’s to say? – and barraged by highly stylized nonsense does feel absurd.The show goes on: how did Broadway achieve a record-breaking season?Read moreLloyd’s take on Beckett is an especially disorienting, purgatorial one – at one point, Gogo and Didi approach a literal blinding light at the end of the tunnel, only to turn back. But it is more coolly strange than spiritually disquieting, seeming to strain for provocation without need. The introduction of the mysterious Pozzo (Brandon J Dirden) and the enslaved Lucky (Michael Patrick Thornton) throw a wrench into the duo’s day and into the show’s polished limbo. Dirden, who is Black, plays Pozzo with more than a dash of Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio’s unforgettably sadistic and dandyish plantation owner from Django Unchained. Thornton, who is white and uses a wheelchair, appears without Lucky’s standard rope or Pozzo’s whip – the production forgoes almost all props – but bound with a gimp mask. The racial inversion of the invoked history of US enslavement suggests the arbitrariness of human cruelty. But though Thornton turns Lucky’s famously impermeable monologue – an erudite-seeming rambling on the command to “think!” – into a spellbinding swirl, there’s a ghoulish, overdone quality to their intrusions that tip the show into uncomfortable sensory overwhelm.Luckily, there’s Bill & Ted to save the day. The reunion of Winter and Reeves provides a shiny, pleasing lacquer of nostalgia over the proceedings, their comedic chemistry still unmatched and irreproducible. The two longtime friends lend lines such as “together again at last …” a jolt of delight, with a couple extra-textual treats to boot. (Within the echoey void designed by Ben and Max Ringham, you can almost hear a faint “dude …”) It’s Bill & Ted gone philosophical, Winter the crotchety, cerebral stick in the mud and Reeves the stilted follower; watching them together, allowed to indulge in the play’s opportunities for slapstick, bandying about the tube with occasional chest bumps, you might find yourself believing in something.That, or when Winter, the more expressive of the two actors, delivers the play’s final monologue, a treatise on life’s meaning and meaninglessness whose words wash over but whose import sticks. Face alit in faux moonlight, features tightened in consternation, framed by the tube to who knows where, Winter seems to be glimpsing the void in this absurd world. I glimpsed it, too, at least for a minute – and then it is back to that enjoyable, frustrating, confounding nothing.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayKeanu ReevesSamuel BeckettJamie LloydTheatreUS theaterreviewsShareReuse this content"

Facebook mums clink plastic cups of frozen cocktails. Dads sneak their teenage daughters to the front of the heaving queue for the women’s toilets, which a girl with large hoop earrings has taken it upon herself to run like the navy (“Go! No time for wiping!”). A man desperately tries to keep up with his drunk-on-a-mission missus by hanging on to her belt loops, while a group of lads with photorealistic tattoos argue over whether to load up on pints or head in to secure a premium standing position. In every direction, best friends of all generations doggedly traverse a packed-out Wembley Stadium, each clutching two pints and a Twix to their chest. Others lean in for group selfies beneath the gigantic digital sign proclaiming “Oasis Live ’25”.The air is a tangle of Glaswegian accents, Rochdale accents, Cardiff accents, East End accents and Scouse accents as strangers genially befriend each other; the horizon a jumble of jeans-and-shoes, jorts, and bucket hats of all designs. There are people in original 1994 Definitely Maybe tour shirts, and people who weren’t even born whenCreation Recordsdissolved; Gen X ravers who now manage sales teams, and millennials repping the H&M Pacha collection. There are sober twentysomethings, retired pillheads and, judging by the (small) number of people walking sideways, active ketamine enthusiasts. This is, in short, the most accurate cross-section of the British general public you will ever experience outside of a motorway service station.This weekend marked the final UK dates of Oasis’s sold-out reunion tour, which began in Cardiff on 4 July and is due to end in Sao Paulo on 23 November. “Did you miss us?” Liam, chewing gum, rhetorically asks the first of two 90,000-strong crowds. Then the band promptly launch into “(What’s The Story) Morning Glory?” and £8 pints go up in the air.The scenes have been essentially the same around the world. Fans in Mexico City held up hand-drawn banners saying “Oasis saved me” and “R kid can I have your tambourine”. Fans in Dublin wore little round glasses over Irish flag balaclavas. Despite their relative lack of popularity in the US previously, Oasis fever has been as strong there as anywhere else. A Varietyreview, titled “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend”, describes a nostalgic and star-studded Rose Bowl Stadium crowd (which included Leonardo DiCaprio and Kamala Harris) trying and failing to do Man City’s Poznań dance.Anotherdescribes coffee shops and bars in Pasadena packed to the rafters with British paraphernalia, dovetailing with a summer in which Anglophilia has been strangely prevalent – be it through Bonnie Blue, that American TikTok lad who’s obsessed with being a “charva”, or the omnipresent jingle of “nothing beats a Jet2Holiday”.Everyone is here. It’s the most accurate cross-section of the British general public you will meet outside of a motorway service stationIt’s easy to write Oasis off as a “damaging pop cultural force” at home, where their image is invariably wrapped up with Cool Britannia messaging, the false promise of New Labour, and the simplicity of Euro 96 and that Walkers campaign where they shoved fivers into packets of crisps. As the band runs through a two-hour bangers-only setlist, however, it’s clear that A) no one cares, and B) that argument over-intellectualises something that is actually pretty simple: Oasis are responsible for a sizeable chunk of the most timeless songs in rock history.You don’t need to be from the UK to understand them, but their blend of bravado and tenderness articulates a fundamental experience of being British. Working-class egos are often demonised in the media, but in Oasis’s lyrics they run free: stifled ambitions are turned into supernovas. They have made an art form of our tendency to romanticise the banal and the abject in order to imagine lives much larger than the ones afforded to us (“You could wait for a lifetime / To spend your days in the sunshine …”). And, like Premier League footballers, we admire them because they made it happen.View image in fullscreenMore Oasis fans in Cardiff.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianAt Wembley, the Gallaghers, men of few words (on stage, anyway), communicate mostly through brief affirmations (“Nice one”) and “fucking come on then” hand gestures, and nod to broader goings-on through homage. Noel dedicates Half the World Away to the Irish and Little By Little to “the mandem”, and an image of the late boxing legend Ricky Hatton fills the screen at the end of Live Forever. Lads with shotta bags hug and climb on each other’s shoulders. Girls twirl each other. Men arrange themselves in circles and do that dance where they bend their knees, poke their arses back and point their index fingers one hand at a time. Primary school kids to the retired all throw their arms in the air alike, outstretched like Jesus on the cross, and the whole stadium erupts into a cry of “Why, why, why,why” as Champagne Supernova closes the set.The Sunday papers prepare to print Tony Blair’s face on their front pages as he makes his utterly unwanted return to geopolitics. Meanwhile, the closest anyone has felt to national peace in decades comes courtesy of some fiftysomething blokes from Longsight and Burnage playing songs about cigarettes, alcohol, and brief glimpses of glory.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a good question to ask about an opera whose two main characters spend much of the evening being unhappy. But the answer, in Martin Constantine’s well judged new production for English Touring Opera, is - plenty. With witty sets and costumes by April Dalton, Constantine’s production neatly transports the setting from rural Italian village to English coastal town, but with no loss of the music’s sparkle, affability or poignancy.The setting offers Constantine the use of almost every available cliche of the rundown English seaside resort – there are donkey rides, a fish and chip van, a pair of lifeguards, a solitary fisherman in sou’wester and oilskins, as well as a theatre that has seen better days. Though it stops short of theDonald McGillworld of double entendre postcards, that’s maybe because there’s a contemporary point being made here too. A conman from outside arrives in town to play the pivotal role in this opera, and Dr Dulcamara’s snake-oil elixir has a delicate whiff of Farage, never overstated, about it.View image in fullscreenScarcely misses a beat … the lively ensemble in The Elixir of LovePhotograph: Richard Hubert SmithSung in English, in the late Amanda Holden’s deft and vivid translation, and with a reduced orchestra impressively conducted by Alice Farnham, this is a show that scarcely misses a beat. Donizetti’s pre-Wagnerian use of the Tristan and Isolde legend as an echo of Nemorino and Adina’s quest for love is cleverly embodied. Ensembles and stage business are notably well marshalled at several points, and the costumes are often surreal – one character dresses as a fish, another as a 99 ice-cream cone. Nemorino’s tendency to climb up onto the van roof remains a bit of mystery.Tamsanqa Tylor Lamani captures Nemorino’s optimism and pathos. He really makes one care about his quest for love. His is, though, a notably small-voiced tenor, and his nasal sound is stretched by the opera’s most famous aria, Una furtiva lagrima. Natasha Page’s Adina has an impressive range of vocal colours and she sings with increasing conviction as the evening goes on. Though the two are a winning pair of lovers, the dominant stage and vocal presence is Emyr Wyn Jones as Dulcamara, who commands the show whenever he gets the chance, and for whom bigger things surely beckon. Timothy Nelson gives Nemorino’s rival Belcore plenty of testosterone, while singing the role with refinement; and Rosie Lomas is a bright-voiced Gianetta.Touring until 22 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaEnglish Touring OperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

All you need to know about global power games, the artist explains, is right thereMon 29 Sep 2025 07.39 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 08.06 EDTShareIn her bright Glasgow studio, artist Tanoa Sasraku is showing me her collection of paperweights produced by oil companies. “I find them so alluring, almost like perfume bottles or snow globes, but so grotesque,” she explains as we handle the etched and sculpted objects, which each have a precious drop of crude oil at their centre. “They have these shiny, dazzling exteriors, but when you get close you see the death mulch inside. All presentations of power are fragile; they collapse once you get close enough.”Sasraku’s paperweights form the centrepiece ofMorale Patch, her forthcoming solo exhibition at the ICA in London: a poetic interrogation of the role of oil in geopolitics and national identity. Drawn from oil-producing nations around the world, the tacky paperweights embody both the seductive allure of extraction and the pomposity and fragility of its resulting wealth and power. Like an absurd game of Battleships, they are displayed on a grid of velvet-lined jewellery boards forming a map of worldwide oil production – and subsequent conflict. “I was thinking about oil alliances and clashes between nations and this stalemate that has occurred. When you map them out, you get the sense that if one warhead went off, it would all collapse.”I got into bidding wars for paperweights on eBayThe work in Morale Patch is ostensibly an about-turn for the 29-year-old, Plymouth-born artist known for tactile works using pigment drawn from soil andmaterials soaked in the ocean. But it initially stemmed from her perennial preoccupation: the narrative power of organic materials, in this case crude oil. “It’s death matter: the product of marine bodies and prehistoric plants pressurised under the ground,” Sasraku says, “but it unleashes as a life force; it explodes out of the ground and powers human development.” She visited sites of oil production in Scotland, where she relocated from London in 2024, but wanted to get her hands on the crude material. Oddly, it was most easily sourced in the tiny amounts within paperweights commissioned by oil companies as corporate gifts.View image in fullscreen‘I was thinking of politicians playing war games in their offices’ … a detail of Shell, a custom-made paperweight.Photograph: Courtesy the artistShe became obsessed with collecting as many as possible. “I felt like I had to collect the world’s source of them,” she laughs. “It became part of my daily practice to type in keywords on eBay and get into bidding wars.” She describes one particularly fierce but sadly unsuccessful contest over a paperweight produced to commemorate a Kylie Minogue concert in Aberdeen in the early 1990s – “such a weird mix of pop culture and Scottish industry.”Sasraku also got her own paperweights made for the show, using a Highlands-based company that produces corporate ones (“They may have made some in my collection”). Some of these take the form of military coffins with flags draped over them, their precious cargo not dead bodies but pen ink.Wall-based works in the show also allude to flags – fragile things made from soaked, stacked newsprint held together with bulldog clips. “The whole show is made from office ephemera,” she says. “I was thinking about politicians playing war games in their offices, toying with the lives of others.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re fed this logic’ … Tanoa Sasraku.Photograph: Belinda LawleyIn both its found objects and fabricated work, Morale Patch plays with a particularly gaudy design sensibility inspired by Sasraku’s repulsion and fascination with 1980s Americana. “The sentiments from that time about ambition, greed and masculinity have really defined where we are now in geopolitics,” she explains. “Look at Donald Trump. He’s got huge power-suited shoulders and uses language like a jock from an 80s film.”Symbols of American ambition are dotted around her studio, where art materials are stored alongside cheerleaders’ pom-poms and aspirational vintage adverts. The same theme is present in an ongoing series based on patterns for men’s clothing, equally inspired by the exaggerated shapes of power suits and the work of Sasraku’s late father, the celebrated Ghanaian fashion designerKofi Ansah.Making this work has been a process of interrogating her relationship with the “dominant culture” of America. As a child, her consumption of US TV was reflected in “my vernacular, my clothing, even food that seemed appealing”. She remembers finding out about 9/11 via footage of Michael Jackson watching the news, “this clash of the ultimate American icon, and the event that changed the course of western history.” As a teenager, she yearned for the perceived glamour of an American life, but in 2025 that has changed. “My interest in America has remained but my desire tobeAmerican has really shifted.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s very much been taken into consideration,” she says.It goes without saying that the imagery and ideas in Morale Patchare particularly charged right now, but the process of making the work has been cathartic for its artist. “Specifically with Britain, Israel, America, Russia and Ukraine, we’re fed this logic as to why certain countries are aligned as allies,” Sasraku concludes. “If you think about where the oil is, what mineral resources are required to maintain these relationships, they’re revealed as very flimsy.“That’s been useful to understand, particularly in this moment, when there’s so much obscene violence being co-signed by the UK.

Trouble was, he couldn’t stop. We take the tour of his Marfa creationsOliver WainwrightMon 29 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 29 Sep 2025 16.41 EDTShareAcolossal cliff of green-tinted glass stretches along the side of a railway line, like a minty glacier greeting arriving trains. The glazing shimmers strangely in the light, its surface variously matt and gloss, wrapping offices and atriums together inside a changeable crystal skin. There’s a reason it looks unlike a typical office block – and it’s not just the Swiss precision.Completed in 2000 in collaboration with local architect Hans Zwimpfer, the facade ofPeter Merian Hausin Basel is the largest, and yet perhaps least known, work ofDonald Judd, one of the 20th century’s most important minimalist artists. If you have ever pondered a polished aluminium box in an art museum, or encountered a gnomic stack of coloured acrylic rectangles projecting from a wall, they were probably by him. But few realise that Judd’s prolific output extended to building-sized commissions – or that, before his life was cut short in 1994 at the age of 65, he was busy setting upan office dedicated to architecture.He wrongly used cement mortar on the perimeter wall. A chunk of it recently collapsedAlmost 6,000 miles west of Basel’s glass monolith, in the tiny town of Marfa in the Texas desert, Judd’s architecture office has now been opened to the public, following a $3.3m, seven-year restoration, led byHouston architect Troy Schaum. Housed in an innocuous 1900s brick grocery store on the main street, it provides a fascinating window into the artist’s working process as he shifted to a larger scale – and the headaches that came with it. It reveals his struggle to move from a pristine universe of pure form, blissfully free from users, into the pragmatic world of planning permissions, clients, and the need to keep the rain out. “Design has to work,” as he put it. “Art does not.”View image in fullscreenHe hated most architects … Judd with Jeff Kopie in his Marfa architecture office in 1993.Photograph: © Laura Wilson. Courtesy Judd Foundation Archives, Marfa,Texas.Architects have long lusted after the sense of rigour and clarity embodied in Judd’s austere sculptures, wishing they could emulate his pared-back surfaces in their own work. His pieces – made by professional fabricators – are milled to millimetric precision and stripped of extraneous detail, celebrating the inherent qualities of industrially produced materials, be it steel, aluminium, plywood or plexiglass.For his part, Judd hated most architects.He railedagainst their misunderstanding of materials, their shallow fakery, and slammed their work as being “derivative of art”. Yet, when it came to trying to realise buildings himself, he would learn that the quest for pure autonomy of form, and his trademark flawlessness, wasn’t so easy. It might be a relief for architects to find that, when it comes to gutter details, the master of minimalism wasn’t infallible.The architecture office is the latest building to join a vast constellation of Judd spaces in Marfa, open to pre-booked tours, including a sprawling series of studios, installed spaces and his family home, where visitors can immerse themselves in Judd’s creative world – exactly as he left it. He moved to Marfa in 1971, primarily to escape the New York art scene, choosing this former ranching town because it was one of the least populated places he could find. It helped that property was cheap and plentiful, and so he began buying up vacant hangars, banks and stores to install his work, leaving a portfolio of 22 sites by the time of his death – along with millions of dollars of debt.“Once Don started, he was doomed,” says his son, Flavin Judd, who serves as artistic director of the Judd Foundation, of which his sister, Rainer, is president. “It’s like being a heroin addict. You have to keep buying the next one and the next one.”View image in fullscreenGlass monolith … the Peter Merian Haus in Basel.Photograph: lauravr/ShutterstockJudd was often infuriated by how museums handled and displayed his art, concluding that the only solution was to do it himself. “The space surrounding my work is crucial to it,”he wrote in 1977. “Somewhere there has to be a place where the installation is well done and permanent.” Thanks to the efforts of Flavin, Rainer and a $70m endowment (built from a sale of Judd’s artwork in 2006, which raised $28m), these spaces are immaculately preserved. Sometimes eerily so. The 13,000 books in his library, housed in a former military hangar, remain untouched, the uncomfortable-looking plywood chairs un-sat-on. For all his austerity, Judd’s own favoured reading chair, it is pleasing to discover, was a comfy, worn leather recliner.The architecture office was heavily damaged by a fire during restoration, and the reconstruction has left it more spotless than ever – complete with recycled denim insulation, a new shading canopy and a clever passive cooling system to mitigate the desert heat. The interior has been staged just as Judd left it, his rows of pencils and French curve-rulers preciously arranged like sacred relics.One wall is devoted to technical drawings of the Basel office block, in full swing when he died, while a series of Judd-designed tables display sketches and models of other projects. There are someprototype porcelain bowls, which couldn’t go into production because porcelain didn’t work in the flat, sharp-edged planes that Judd demanded. There arehis plywood chairs, which retail for $9,000, and some prototype glass bottles designed to interlock – although, once again, the glass wouldn’t quite bend to Judd’s will.Jumping up a scale, there is a model of his unrealised masterplan for a waterfront site in Cleveland, commissioned in 1986 by the Progressive Insurance Company, which shows the artist’s obsession with proportion and repetition. A series of identical rectangular courtyard blocks march in a regimented row, one for an art museum, one for a hotel, one for a health club, and one – incongruously – for a rock’n’roll hall of fame. It’s not hard to see why it didn’t get built: the client’s favourite architect was Frank Gehry, and Judd’s contribution looks more like a bleak business park than a place of waterfront leisure.View image in fullscreenEx-grocery store … Judd’s Marfa office is now open for tours.Photograph: Matthew Millman/Judd FoundationNearby is a site model of the Kunsthaus in Bregenz, Austria, which was supposed to be a collaboration withthe Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. Fifteen years Judd’s junior, Zumthor had written to his minimalist idol in rapturous tones in 1990, asking the artist’s opinion of his design for the art museum. But when the client then commissioned Judd to design the museum’s offices, across from the gallery, Zumthor was incensed. “He should not be working as an architect,” he fumed in a letter to the director, suggesting Judd be commissioned to produce an outdoor artwork instead. The museum planned to relocate Judd’s building –a curious barrel-vaulted shed– to another site, but he died before it could progress.Maddeningly, Judd’s design isn’t on display here, presumably because there wasn’t a drawing of it on his desk the day he died. A folder of documents marked “Bregenz” lies temptingly on the table, but it may never be touched, not even by a guide. The sense of frustration recurs throughout, with just the odd fragment of each project on show, and no explanatory text or photos to show if the buildings were ever built. This is taking minimalism to absurd lengths.“It is what it is,” says Flavin. “Our approach is to show, not tell.” That might make sense for Judd’s installed spaces, where a pure, unmediated encounter with the work was what the artist intended. But in the case of his architecture, it seems perverse not to even show it, or provide any context. As with the other buildings in Marfa, visitors are taken through the space by a (well-informed) guide, but you’ll have to Google the projects, or make an appointment in the archive, to find out what they looked like. “This was one of his textile designs,” the guide tells me, gesturing to some folded sheets of paper. What lies inside the folds, we will never know.View image in fullscreen‘Our approach is to show, not tell’ … inside the Marfa architecture office.Photograph: Matthew Millman/Judd Foundation/ John Chamberlain Art /Fairweather & Fairweather /Artists Rights Society (ARS), New YorkAway from the office, a visceral experience of Judd’s architecture can thankfully be had in the many buildings he adapted around town, pioneering adaptive reuse long before it was fashionable. From military hangars to former hotels, his approach was to strip structures back to their bones and sometimes “correct” them with additions, often creating symmetry or hinting at a pure geometric form. The courtyard layout of his home and studio – known asThe Block– recalls the Korean palaces he saw when he was stationed as an army engineer in Seoul, a symmetrical, ceremonial compound, with a high perimeter wall of adobe mud bricks.Atthe Chinati foundation, a contemporary art centre that Judd created at a former military base, he added two huge barrel-vaulted metal roofs to a pair of artillery sheds. It was partly to fix the leaking flat concrete roofs, but the chief intention was clearly to give the buildings a majestic presence in the landscape, their great semicircular profiles visible on the horizon.Garden of unearthly delights: inside the eerie underground lair for ‘master of mobiles’ Alexander CalderRead moreIn both cases, Judd’s priority of form over function has left a legacy of costly maintenance issues, which Schaum is busy fixing. The artist’s decision to use cement mortar with the adobe bricks, instead of the vernacular mud-based kind, has left his perimeter wall with critical structural issues. A whole chunk of it recently collapsed. To be faithful to Judd’s intention, it will be rebuilt in the same way, but with hidden steel rods. Similarly, Judd’s desire to make his barrel-vaulted roofs sit seamlessly on the walls below has led to years of leaks in the artillery sheds. Asthe architectural historian Julian Rose writes, the roof junction was “a three-dimensional nightmare, almost impossible to seal”.Together, it’s enough to keep the Judd and Chinati foundations busy for a while. “It’s like maintaining the Golden Gate Bridge,” says Schaum. “Once it’s completed, you start back at the other end. You think of Judd’s legacy as permanent and inevitable. But working out here in the desert, you realise how precarious it actually is.”Visitor infoThis article was amended on 29 September 2025 to include the information that Peter Merian Haus in Basel was a collaboration between Donald Judd and the local architect Hans Zwimpfer.Explore more on these topicsArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has a short season and, when it’s freshly picked, it’s so sweet that you can chomp it right off the cob. I reserve some to eat straight from the grill slathered with butter, then dabbed with a wedge of lime rolled in chilli powder to recreate a favourite Kenyan street food snack from my childhood. I find the combination of hot chilli with naturally sweet corn an irresistible one, so both of today’s recipes have a jolt of something fiery.Charred sweetcorn, prawn and green chilli spaghetti (pictured top)Green chilli adds essential heat to the sweet prawns and corn – I like to use jalapeños here for their fragrant heat.

Slice the kernels off the cobs with a sharp knife and reserve the cobs.Put a large saucepan of water on to boil for the pasta and add a tablespoon of salt and the reserved cobs – they will add flavour to the pasta. Boil the pasta for eight to 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water and discarding the cobs.Meanwhile, pour the olive oil into a frying pan and put it on a low heat. Add the garlic, chilli and lemon zest, and leave to gently infuse for a couple of minutes. Add the prawns, turn up the heat and cook for three to four minutes. Add the drained spaghetti, corn and a splash of pasta water, and toss vigorously. Season with salt and pepper, if required, and serve at once.Sweetcorn, gochujang and cheddar croquetasView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogul’s sweetcorn, gochujang and cheddar croquetas.Croquetas are basically deep-fried balls of bechamel and my undisputed favourite snack in tapas bars.
