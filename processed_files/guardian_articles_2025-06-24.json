And how will it stay sparkly?Translucent bridge to form centrepiece of national memorial to Elizabeth IIOliver WainwrightTue 24 Jun 2025 10.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.52 EDTShareIs a £46m glass tiara the right way to remember the UK’s late queen? The Elizabeth II memorial selection committee certainly think so, in their choice of a glitzy glass bridge designed byNorman Fosterfor her permanent memorial in St James’s Park, announced on Tuesday.As architects go, the 90-year-old Foster is perhaps the closest we have to a national treasure, so he might seem like a fitting choice – an establishment figure and safe pair of hands, who knew the queen personally. It could be an apt final project for the architect lord, although he shows no signs of slowing down.Foster might have done well to take a closer look at the history of the tiara in questionHis personal connection might have clinched the deal. Lord Foster of Thames Bank, whoquit his seatin the House of Lords in 2010 in order to retain his non-dom tax status, says he met the queen on both formal and informal occasions, and it was this dual acquaintance that informed his design.“She was wonderfully formal when the occasion demanded,” he recalls, “and warmly informal when she engaged with people and individuals.” His project attempts to “combine the formal and the informal”, riffing off a similar duality found in the landscape design of St James’s Park, laid out by John Nash in the 1820s.In reaching for a suitably regal metaphor to embody the late monarch, Foster landed on her wedding tiara. He has accordingly conjured an ethereal vision of a bridge with a cast glass balustrade, shimmering above the lake. This translucent glass crossing, he says, will be “symbolic of Her Majesty as a unifying force, bringing together nations, countries, the Commonwealth, charities and the armed forces”.View image in fullscreenGlass act … how the bridge will look.Photograph: Foster + Partners/PASo far, the images give off the vibes of a temporary Swarovski-sponsored installation, and it’s hard to imagine how the Royal Parks’ maintenance team will keep it looking quite so sparkly. The vision recalls Foster’s “blade of light” idea for the Millennium Bridge, which ended up being a good deal more chunky (and wobbly) than the dashing sketch promised.Foster might have done well to take a closer look at the history of the tiara in question. It was originally designed in 1919 for Queen Mary, Elizabeth’s grandmother, a great lover of jewels, who had the headpiece made in the fashionableRussian kokoshnikstyle, using diamonds from an old necklace gifted to her by her grandmother-in-law, Queen Victoria. It was a model of recycling, which has been passed down the generations ever since – used by the Queen Mother, Elizabeth, Princess Anne, and most recently Princess Beatrice.Not so Foster’s bridge. His project, which also includes a series of gardens, will see a perfectly good crossing needlessly destroyed. The existingBlue Bridgewas built in 1957, to the designs of the Ministry of Works’ youngest ever chief architect, Eric Bedford, who went on to design the startlingly futuristic Post Office Tower (now BT Tower) in Fitzrovia. As it happens, Bedford also played a key role in Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, designing a series of interlocking steel arches on the Mall, topped with lions and adorned with metalwork crowns and fan motifs, that were illuminated by night.In our age of rapid global heating, when the carbon emissions of construction are closely counted by the kilo and architects strive to reuse as much existing fabric as possible, this wasteful act of demolition seems like a strange way to memorialise anyone. In selecting blocks of solid cast glass for his new bridge, Foster has chosen one of the most carbon-intensive materials available, given the furnaces must be heated to over 1,000C. Memorialising more than just the queen, this costly tiara will be an apt bookend to an age of excessive consumption.Explore more on these topicsNorman FosterArchitectureHeritageLondonQueen Elizabeth IIParks and green spacesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

O wondrous day. One of which dreams are made. Especially if you’ve been taking large quantities of hallucinogenics. The day forever named Daniel Hannan Day. We will never see his like again. With any luck. The Man with a brain the size of a Higgs Boson particle. You know it must be there somewhere but only the Large Hadron Collider can conjure it into existence for a nanosecond.Yet in that fleeting moment, Dan can achieve great things. Can share the marvels he has seen. For Dan’s unique ability is to be wrong about almost everything, all the time. Failing is his niche talent and his fans applaud his every disaster. Triumph and recognition are his alone. For Dan has long since been rewarded for being the dimmest man alive with a peerage. Living proof that even halfwits and liabilities need not be excluded from the upper chamber. And where Dan leads, Toby Young and others follow.To recap. Back in 2016, Dan was a Tory MEP. A confirmed Eurosceptic and bewilderingly considered by many to be the intellectual backbone of the Vote Leave campaign. Gravitas borne out of unbearable levitas. And two days before the referendum, Dan decided to share his genius for prophesy inan article he wrotefor the Reaction.life website. This was the chronicle of Dan’s idiocy foretold.“It’s 24 June, 2025, and Britain is marking its annual Independence Day celebration,” wrote Dan. “As the fireworks stream through the summer sky, still not quite dark, we wonder why it took us so long to leave. The years that followed the 2016 referendum didn’t just reinvigorate our economy, our democracy and our liberty. They improved relations with our neighbours.”Today we have reached that day. It is indeed 24 June 2025. And weirdly, Dan does not seem at all keen to be reminded of his morphine dreams from nine years ago. Surely this should be a day of celebration for him? Where is the column in the Daily Telegraph in which he once more shares his genius? Where is the pullout guide in the Daily Mail to all the street and firework parties taking place around the country? All hail the majesty of Dan Hannan Day.But it’s really not fair that Dan should be so cruelly overlooked by his erstwhile backers on today of all days. Why all the long faces? Why do heads turn away when Dan’s name is mentioned? Are we no longer allowed to enjoy the triumph ofBrexitand the people who delivered such treasures to Britain? Whatever happened to punching the air at a self-inflicted 4% hit to GDP? It’s almost as if the leavers are ashamed of what they have done.Back to the gospel according to St Dan. How else did he imagine the Britain of today? Agriculture and fishing booming. Cows with smiling faces, safe in the knowledge they would never hear moos with a French accent. Millions of cod swimming back into British coastal waters, desperate to be turned into fish fingers by Captain Birds Eye.It got better. Not only was the UK the foremost knowledge-based economy in the world, but Hoxton had superseded Silicon Valley as the global centre for tech. Not forgetting more traditional industries. Steel and ceramics would rise from their sick beds and become competitive again. Meanwhile the EU was withering and dying, choking on its own bureaucracy as Jean-Claude Juncker was voted back in for his second term as president of the European Federation.Imagine writing such trash. It’s bad enough having to go back and read it again. The delusions became ever more tragic and grandiose. Hard not to worry about Dan’s sanity. The trading arrangements with the EU were easily agreed, Dan fantasised. Not least because the EU was so intimidated by our show of strength. Tariff-free borders remained and EU nationals were given leave to remain.On and on it went. Birmingham and Leeds would become financial capitals of the world as Frankfurt, Milan and Paris stagnated. The UK would become the centre of world shipping. Shale oil and gas would come on tap and energy prices would hit record lows. Universities would flourish as the UK headed a new 22-state bloc to rival the EU. Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands would have already followed our example and left the EU.You can only wonder what Dan’s predictions for 24 June 2034 might look like. Dear Diary, for nine years the Middle East has been at peace, with Israel and Iran now inseparable allies. Crimea has become Europe’s most fashionable summer resort after President Putin voluntarily handed it back to Ukraine. Meanwhile, the UK has become the largest economy in the world and has threatened to pull out of Nato unless the US increases its defence spending to 8%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reality is that, having just been blindsided by Donald Trump’s decision to bomb Iran and the fragile ceasefire already broken, Keir Starmer found himself off to deal with yet another war at the Nato conference. This involved further Donald wrangling. Trying to persuade the US not to give away large chunks of Ukraine to Russia. Good luck with that.All of which left the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden, to give a statement on the government’s national security strategy to the Commons. And who better than Pat. The cadaver in human form. The man with the slightly sinister air of someone happy to sign death warrants over breakfast.The world was a very dangerous place, he began. All the more dangerous for having him in it. It was the government’s policy to reach defence spending of 5% by 2035, with 1.5% coming from already existing internet and energy projects that had originally been assigned to other departments and would now be commandeered by defence. Not that he put it in those terms. But that appeared to be the gist of it.Everything else was on a need-to-know basis. All Pat could supply were some broad ideas. He would make us safe at home. And abroad. That was it. If he said anymore then our enemies would know what we were doing and the whole purpose of the strategy would be compromised. Thank you and good night.

Here’s what experts recommend to keep your ears healthySarah PhillipsTue 24 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.22 EDTShareHearing loss can make life difficult and lead to social isolation. But with extremely loud devices in our pockets, and earbuds in near-constant use, we are at more risk than ever. How can you take care of your ears to avoid problems?Looking after your ears is for life, not just old age“People tend to think it’s a bit of fun if someone mishears,” says Kevin Munro, a professor of audiology and director of the Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness at the University of Manchester. From a young age it became apparent that Munro could not hear in his right ear, and in recent years he has experienced hearing loss in his left ear and started wearing a hearing aid – “so I have skin in the game”, he says. “Most of us don’t have hearing loss when we are young, but we all need to understand the importance of being able to communicate well and not have hearing difficulty. I think that could get rid of some of the stigma that is associated with hearing loss.”That said, hearing does get worse as you get olderHearing loss affects42% of people over the age of 50, increasing to 71% of people over 70, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. “For the majority of people, it is a gradual change over their lifetime,” says Munro. “What happens is they’ll get to the stage where they think everyone is mumbling. So they’re blaming everyone else. And then the people they live with say, ‘Why have you got the television so loud? And why am I always having to repeat myself?’ That’s the time to sit up and take notice, because it is affecting all the people you love and spend time with.”Be careful about exposure to noiseOne billion young people areat risk from avoidable hearing loss, says Dr Siobhán Brennan, Munro’s colleague at the University of Manchester, a lead clinical scientist at Sheffield teaching hospitals and chair of theBritish Society of Audiology. This is because “devices are so much better than they used to be in terms of the quality of the sound”, she says. “Back in the 1980s, when we had cassette players, there was a limit to how much you would turn up the volume, because it would be distorted and horrible. These days you can go louder and louder, and the quality is great. So we are finding an increase worldwide in noise-induced hearing loss.“When I started my career,” says Munro, “we knew one of the biggest risk factors for hearing loss was damage from noise – but that was usually occupational noise, when there were lots of factories in heavy industry. The concern nowadays is recreational noise and young people listening to music on headphones.”Wear earplugs“Loud noise is one of the most predominant causes of hearing loss in young people,” says Renee Almeida, the adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust in London. All of us need to take care when exposed to soundsover 85 decibels (dB): for reference, a lawnmower is 90-95 dB; a concert or club around 110-120 dB.“The louder it gets, the less time you have to be exposed for to ensure damage.” So it’s best to avoid loud noise altogether. This might mean not standing next to the speakers at gigs. “Everyone has left a concert with some ringing in the ears for a few days,” says Almeida. This, she explains, is because “the stapedius muscle in the inner ear contracts in order to protect the cochlea – the part of the inner ear essential for hearing. The muscle ends up in spasm, which is why we end up with temporary tinnitus.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by models; gilaxia/Getty ImagesWhen Brennan – who previously trained as a sound engineer – goes to see live music, she always wears earplugs: “It is important that ear protection fits correctly. They come in different sizes, and you can get custom-made earplugs.” Munro recommends musician’s earplugs, which he used himself at a recent Bruce Springsteen gig. “The ones that have been designed for musicians have a filter in them and it just turns everything down, like lowering the volume on your television a little bit without distorting it.”Don’t overdo it with your headphones“The problem is that everybody has these really loud gadgets in their pockets and the world is a noisy place,” says Dr Jay Jindal, an audiologist and the owner ofPlanet Audiology, which has clinics in London, Surrey and Kent. “You could be sensible about how loud it is in your ear in a quiet environment, but as soon as you go into a noisy environment, you inevitably put the volume high without realising that it could be too high for your ears. I spend my life telling people the 50/50 rule – which means that you listen to 50% of the volume on your headphones for 50 minutes, and that seems to be a safe limit for most things.” The World Health Organization (WHO)advises 60% for 60 minutes.Get your hearing testedView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by models; Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images“One of the things that we really notice in audiology,” says Brennan, “is that people are unaware of the hearing loss they may have – and are missing things without realising. It takes people on average about 10 years between developing hearing difficulties and seeking help.”There are lots of places to take a hearing test, Brennan says, such as theWHO appor theRoyal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) site. “There are three-minute tests that you can do. You don’t need a soundproof room; you can do it at home using your own device. They will say either everything’s fine, or there may be evidence here of a hearing loss.” That’s when you should see a doctor for a more thorough investigation.See a doctor if you’re worried“If you went to bed all right, and you wake up and one ear is completely deaf or there is severe hearing loss, you should go to your GP or to a hospital,” says Munro. “If there is inflammation in your inner ear, then getting steroids into your body as soon as you can is the best way of trying to reduce that.” Otherwise, there is a risk of permanent damage.“Some people have ear infections more frequently than others,” says Brennan. “If you are getting them repeatedly, there could be an underlying reason. Go along to your GP, who may refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist.”Don’t use cotton buds“Taking good care of the ears is not using cotton buds,” saysAlmeida. “Leave the ears to maintain their natural oil.” This can help avoid ear infections, “because dry skin can easily break, and even a fingernail can cause irritation and infection.” Almeida advocates drying the ears after a shower or swim, “when the ears are a bit wet, and nobody really likes that sensation – so get a piece of toilet paper or muslin on your little finger and give it a good wipe.” Only go as far in as the finger can go. It is normal for it to come out a bit yellow, she says. “Beyond that, leave it for nature.”Accept that wax has a purpose“Wax in itself is not a bad thing,” says Brennan. “It is a protective mechanism. It keeps the ears healthy, generally speaking, and it does migrate out by itself. It is one of those phenomena that has a bad reputation, because sometimes it gets stuck.”“Having wax in the ear doesn’t mean that your ear is unhealthy or unhygienic,” adds Jindal. “Research suggests that wax has an enzyme which can kill bacteria and viruses going into the ear, and it moisturises the skin as well. So wax is actually a more helpful thing than not.”Never remove wax at home“Syringing is basically banned in the UK, because it can cause a lot of problems in the ears,” says Jindal. Almeida explains: “You can apply too much pressure or too little pressure, hoping that the water is going to pass the wax and flush it out, so it is hit and miss. That’s why it is dangerous, because you might have an infection and you don’t know about it until it is too late, or you can cause a perforation of the eardrum with the pressure. Microsuction is much more gentle and guided; you can stop at any time.”Brennan notes that there is availability from the NHS for wax removal: “There are some audiology or ear, nose and throat departments that will offer it. And there are still some GP surgeries that offer it. However, it is certainly not as widespread as it used to be.” Outside the NHS, there is now not much regulation around who can carry out wax removal, so it is worth asking your GP for advice on where to get it done, the experts say.If you need a hearing aid, get one“Having a hearing aid, you are more likely to be in tune with what is going on in the world,” says Almeida. Hearing aids that are available on the NHS are “amazing”, she says – “I am very proud to say that.” The technology has improved a great deal, with even AI and “invisible” models on the market now. They are a lot less prone to problems like whistling, says Brennan.The experts: neurologists on 17 simple ways to look after your brainRead moreMunro says: “Remember, you need good hearing to be able to communicate well, and hearing aids can address this. If you don’t hear well, you’re not able to stay socially connected to others. And if you’re not socially connected and you can’t have good-quality social interactions, this leads to isolation: you get anxious, you get withdrawn, you can be depressed, and that is not good for your health at all. For healthy ageing, you want to be able to remain socially connected.”Be careful with ear dropsIf your ear feels blocked, olive oil-based ear drops are an option. “For some people, they work well,” Brennan says. “But use them in moderation and according to what it says on the packet. Speaking to a GP is a good start because if your ear feels blocked, it may not be wax; it could be an infection, which you’re going to want to approach in a different way.”There are times when oil does more harm than good, says Jindal. “Oil can close the pores of the skin, so the skin stops breathing, and if you already have an existing problem with the skin, then it doesn’t go in your favour.”Consider earplugs for swimming“Swimming in a pool is OK for most people,” says Jindal. “If they have ear-related issues, they will benefit from wearing earplugs. There are some over-the-counter earplugs, which are quite cheap. Or they can go to their nearest audiologist and get customised swim plugs made.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by models; SolStock/Getty ImagesFor people prone to ear problems, swimming in open water can be more problematic than doing pool lengths, because “the water is more contaminated rather than regulated”.Treat tinnitus“Tinnitus is ringing or buzzing,” says Almeida. “It is described as a perception of sound, when no external sound is around. Very rarely, it can be caused by changes in blood flow or muscle contractions, but it is ultimately generated by the brain’s auditory system. Hearing loss and tinnitus go hand in hand because by lacking hearing, the brain then notices the tinnitus.” It can be related to problems with the jaw, teeth or tense muscles around the neck, Almeida adds. “The treatment options depend on what we find. If there is a hearing loss, hearing aids are always going to be the first port of call.” A visit to the dentist might also be an idea.Dehydration may be a factor: “People say, ‘When I wake up, the tinnitus is very loud, and the moment I have a glass of water, it’s fine.’ The ears are filled with liquid, and the whole body dehydrates at nighttime.”Brennan adds that there’s some evidence to suggestcognitive behavioural therapy is effectivefor reducing the impact of tinnitus.Remember that hearing affects your balance“Your ear controls your hearing and your balance,” says Munro. “So if something goes wrong with your ear, it might also affect your balance. As we get older, the balance organ in our ear will not work as well as it used to. Your inner ear, where your cochlea is for your hearing and your semicircular canals for your balance, relies on a really good blood supply – but it is where the blood vessels are the smallest in the body, which is why people might end up with a vestibular problem.”During flights, have a drink or blow your noseIf your ears feel blocked or painful when on an aeroplane, “swallowing something helps, because that creates positive pressure inside the ear”, says Jindal. “Sipping a glass of water or juice, or sucking a sweet, may be helpful. There is a special balloon you can blow up with your nose rather than your mouth, which seems to help. And blowing the nose in general is a good thing.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe expertsDeafness and hearing lossHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a journalist, I’ve tested all kinds of camping and adventure kit over the years, so I know the brands and models that don’t buckle under pressure.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I looked for easy assembly and a comfy seat.’Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianI’ve tested dozens of camping chairs over the years, and I know which models will last for years of sunny holidays and muddy festivals – and which are likely to fold up like a pack of cards after a few uses. Here, I tested 10 – some of which I’ve owned for years, so I can also vouch for their long-term durability, and some models that were newer to me. My daughter gave me a hand trying out mini chairs for kids, and I’ve included her firm favourite here. I’d also never tried a heated camping chair before – turns out they’re extremely luxurious!I took each chair with me on camping trips and nights away in my camper van, and looked for easy assembly and a comfy seat – I tested each one with adults weighing 65 and 90kg. My daughter, who is 20 months old and weighs 13kg, gave her seal of approval to my top kids’ camping chair. I assembled each folding camping chair in my garden and aimed to leave them out in the rain, to see how they withstood water and how quickly they dried. I also carried each model to see how portable they were and compared the designs for weight and size when folded.

It boasts a sturdy steel frame and a comfy seat and backrest, but is still foldable and easy to carry.Why we love itIt’s hard to pick the perfect camping chair when there are all kinds of ways to enjoy the outdoors, but I think Vango’s Kraken 2 is up there. This behemoth of a seat feels like a comfy hug, with a luxuriously padded seat atop the robust frame that supports up to 180kg. The angle is quite upright – if you don’t want to get lost in a squishy camping chair but still want lots of comfy padding, this is a nice choice.Set up is blissfully simple (the Kraken just folds open, so no Ikea-style confusion here), and there are handy plastic armrests, although no cup holders. The steel legs feel sturdy and strong and don’t sink even when you perch on soft or uneven surfaces. This chair isn’t that compact when folded, but it’s still easy to stick in the shed or pop in the car for a weekend of camping, and its portable carry case makes it simple to sling over your shoulder.It’s a shame that …it’snot super compact, and the armrests aren’t padded.Weight:4.8kgMaximum weight limit:180kgBest budget camping chair:Mountain Warehouse folding chairView image in fullscreen£14.99 at Mountain Warehouse£14.99 at AmazonA simple structure meets a jazzy design in Mountain Warehouse’s folding chair, which is good fun for festivals, taking to the beach, or standing out at your next campsite.Why we love itAvailable in three prints (I think the gingham looks rather smart), this chair has a fuss-free folding design and weighs an incredibly portable 2.3kg. It also includes a carry bag so you can stick it on your shoulder when you’re on the go.It might be on the flimsy side for big or tall campers, but at less than £20, this is a bit of a bargain. If you want a simple but versatile camping chair that’s compact enough for older children to use and carry, it’s worth investing in a few.It’s a shame that …it feels cheaper and less durable than more expensive models.Weight:2.3kgMaximum weight limit:100kgThe best camping mattresses and sleeping mats for every type of adventure, testedRead moreBestcamping chair for two:Kelty Low loveseatView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£114.95 at WildBounds£130 at Ellis BrighamA sofa you can take outdoors? Sign us up. Kelty’s Low loveseat is a compact and easy-to-carry size when folded, but once set up, it’s a sturdy and comfortable two-seater chair perfect for sharing. I’ve had one in the back of my van for years now and even gave my camping-mad friends one as a wedding present.Why we love itI wasn’t sure I saw the point of two-person camping chairs – until I tried Kelty’s Low loveseat. Now it has come with me on several camping trips and been trotted out for barbecues for years – and it’s still looking great. There’s plenty of room for two people (you don’t need to be a couple to use it – as Kelty attests, there’s room for two people and a dog), and it also supports just one if you’re camping solo.The padded polyester fabric is comfortable to lean against, dries quickly and doesn’t show dirt, and like the alloy steel frame, looks and feels as if it is of long-lasting quality. Wide feet make this loveseat sturdy, and it doesn’t sink – I’ve used it on the beach with no problems. It folds up in seconds and fits easily into a carry case, too. The loveseat is low to the ground, though, making it nigh-on impossible to get up from it without looking rather ungainly – not ideal if you have reduced mobility.It’s a shame that …this loveseat sits low to the ground, so it’s not suitable for campers with limited mobility.Weight:6.97kgMaximum weight limit:181kgBest lightweightcamping chair/best camping chair for kids:Helinox Chair OneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£89.95 at Helinox£100 at Ellis BrighamHelinox Chair One MiniView image in fullscreen£79.95 at HelinoxThis is a double recommendation, as my favourite lightweight chair for wild campers also comes in a mini version that’s brilliant for children. The adult Helinox One weighs 965g and packs down small enough to fit inside a small rucksack, but it can still support up to 145kg, and it’s very comfy. The Mini version is lovely for little kids, but can actually hold up to 90kg.Why we love itThe Helinox One chair may be compact, but has a strong and solid polyester seat and aluminium poles. It’s also surprisingly comfortable, despite being so low to the ground, hugging your back nicely and supporting most of your body, even if you’re tall. It’s a cinch to set up, too: the frame clips together and the seat cover stretches on top. I take my Chair One on wild camps, and when packed away, it fits in the water bottle pocket of my rucksack. Sitting elevated from the ground makes even a back-to-basics backpacking trip much more comfortable, so it’s worth the added weight.Mesh panels keep air moving to avoid that sweaty, sticky feeling on hot days. I couldn’t resist trying out the Helinox Chair One Mini, designed for children aged two to six, and I loved it: my daughter is obsessed with having a smaller version of my chair, it’s quick to assemble and it’s compact enough that she’ll be able to carry it herself when she’s bigger.It’s a shame that …you’re low to the ground, and the adult version has limited padding – both the child and adult chairs are pricey, too.Weight:965g/486gMaximum weight limit:145kg/90kgBest heavy-duty camping chair:Coleman deck chairView image in fullscreen£36.99 at UK Camping and LeisureThere’s a huge variety of folding chairs on the market, but Coleman keeps things simple and effective with this director’s chair-style deck chair. It has a solid steel frame and a tough polyester seat, but at 4.7kg isn’t too heavy to carry.Why we love itColeman’s deck chair is a simple design, but one that really shines when it comes to durability. I’ve had this chair for years, and it’s been on dozens of camping trips and festival forays with me. It also doubles up as an extra seat in the garden that I can fold away and stick in the shed when not in use. Well, that’s what I should do – instead, I abuse it in the winter by leaving it outside. It doesn’t seem to matter, though: the legs are still in good condition and the fabric just needs a wipe with a sponge each year to look good.While it’s not too heavy and there’s a built-in handle, this chair is awkward to carry over long distances. But if you’re car camping or on a budget, it’s a sturdy and affordable choice. I tested out the steel version – it’s also availablewith an aluminium framethat shaves off some weight at 2.6kg. There’sa version with a side table, too, which would be good for taking to sporting events or for holding drinks around the campfire.It’s a shame that …it’s not lightweight or very portable.Weight:4.7kgMaximum weight limit:135kgskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This lightweight camping chair is small and packable when collapsed, but it feels far more like a proper chair than most teeny-tiny camping stools once assembled. It’s not as quick and intuitive to assemble as some of the chairs with collapsible poles I tested – here, the poles need a bit of fiddling to get in the right places, and then it requires two hands and some effort to pull the seat material tightly over them.Once assembled, however, this chair is very comfy indeed, with the perfect angle for relaxing and a deep bucket-style seat. The fabric is thin and lightweight, so it dries quickly and won’t overheat. This does also mean there’s no padding to speak of, though, so while this chair is comfy enough for camping, it’s not as relaxing to chill out in as more padded options and is less useful as an all-rounder for the garden. This barely there chair folds down quickly into its carry case, so it’s great for walking longer distances or slinging over your shoulder if you’re off to a gig or a festival. If you’d like a comfy camping chair that doesn’t place you too low to the ground, this is a lightweight choice.It’s a shame that …it requires a wrestle to assemble.Weight:1.76kgMaximum weight limit:136kgThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianVango RadiateGrande DLXView image in fullscreen£109.99 at B&Q£79.99 at AmazonBest for:a heated camping chairI’d actually never tried a heated camping seat before this group test – surely they were just gimmicks? I should have known better, as I’m obsessed with the heated seats in my car. The Vango Radiate is just as nice, switching on to warm your core quickly on chilly days.And of course, you don’t need to turn the heat on if it’s not cold – on a balmy summer’s day, this is just a regular (but very comfy and soft) camping chair. I liked the movable pillow, and there are seven settings for your back, so if you like to really lounge or sit bolt upright, you’re covered. However, while this chair folds flat and multiple chairs would stack neatly together, it’s not compact or very lightweight.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s large and bulky.Weight:7.4kgMaximum weight limit:180kgTrespass oversized moon chairView image in fullscreen£44.99 from Trespass£44.99 at AmazonBest for:a padded chairEver heard of a moon chair? These round, cushioned designs are as comfy and inviting as they look. They translate well as camping chairs, and my top pick is Trespass’s oversized moon. A durable steel frame takes up to 120kg, and a thick, padded circular cushion is lovely for lounging around in.This is a versatile pick, too – the good-looking moon chair is also brilliant for chilling out in the garden all summer long. It does feel flimsier than some of the more robust camping chairs, though, and the feet are best on solid ground, as they’d sink on softer stuff.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s flimsier than most folding camping chairs.Weight:5.3kgMaximum weight limit:120kgTrail Recliner camping chairView image in fullscreen£59.49 at B&Q£69.99 at TrailBest for:a reclining chairAh, luxury – a reclining chair is perfect for campers who want to take it easy and soak in some sunshine. This rather smart chair is lined with soft, spongy material that feels delightfully comfy, and it reclines to seven positions for that perfect nap setup. It sits you high off the ground, too, so it’s easy to get in and out of.The polyester seat material is water-resistant and quick to dry if it does get drenched. The frame is made with aluminium but still feels solid and sturdy, and at 4.75kg, it’s not too heavy to carry. It’s a bit awkward when folded, though – it’s best for sticking in bigger car boots or camper vans for long summer holidays (or just getting out in the back garden for a snooze).It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not easy to transport.Weight:4.75kgMaximum weight limit:150kgHi-Gear inflatable pod chairView image in fullscreen£28 from Millets£35 at Go OutdoorsBest for:an inflatable chairRemember when the ultimate in teenage bedroom furniture was an inflatable bubble chair? Get a slice of that 90s nostalgia for your camping setup with Hi-Gear’s inflatable Pod chair. OK, so it’s not practical for more adventurous camping (or indeed, for camping anywhere but on grass and other forgiving surfaces), but it’s great fun, and surprisingly comfortable for lounging around on.You’ll needa pumpto inflate the Pod, which isn’t included, but it holds its shape well once inflated. Deflating the Pod and rolling it up into a slim tube makes it easy to pack away, and at 1.4kg, it doesn’t add much weight to your camping setup. Great for kids at festivals or in the garden – they’ll love sitting on (and playing with) these squashy chairs.It didn’t make the final cut because …it has limited uses – and it’s notreallya camping chair.Weight:1.4kgMaximum weight limit:150kgWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianWhat are the keyfeatures to look for?If you’re going for week-long summer camping trips with a big car boot, large comfortable chairs will be your best bet. But if you’re heading on a wild camping adventure, portable, lightweight camping seats will be easier to take with you. You’ll also find double sofa-style chairs for two, mini chairs for kids and even super-squishy reclining chairs available for anyone after a bit of luxury.Whatever model you pick, check that your new camping chair is sturdy, foldable and easy to store when not in use. A chair made with water-resistant material, such as ripstop polyester, will be more weatherproof, and solid aluminium or steel legs tend to last. Many portable camping chairs tend to be low to the ground – if you’d find that a struggle to get in and out of, shop for a model that’s as tall as the chairs you find comfortable at home.The best tents for camping: 10 expert picks for every outdoor adventureRead moreHow lightweight should my new camping chair be?If you want to carry a chair for any reasonable distance, I’d recommend choosing a model weighing less than 2kg. Think about how compact your lightweight camping chair is, too – if you’re planning ultralight wild camping expeditions, you’ll need a model that packs down and fits neatly into a rucksack. If you’re shopping for a model that’ll go in the car or a camper van, you can choose a heavier chair – but check that it will fit in your car boot when folded.How to look after and repair a camping chairTo keep your camping chair in trail-ready shape, and to help it last as long as possible to avoid buying a new one before you need to, wipe it down after each trip – mud and mildew are silent assassins. Store it dry, preferably indoors, and never force a jammed fold; that’s how frames bend. For minor rips,a patch kit or upholstery tapework wonders. Just clean and dry the area first. Loose bolts?

Is this a sensible safeguard – or simple snobbery?Jonathan JonesTue 24 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 12.38 EDTShareIt’s that time of year again. As the crowds grow, historic Italian cities and museums become the setting for a You’ve Been Framed-style sequence of absurdist moments. Last year it wasa young woman embracing a (replica) Giambologna statuein the streets of Florence. This year the Uffizi gallery, guardian of Florentine art, has been defiled as a man posed for a photo in front of a portrait of Ferdinando de’ Medici. While imitating the hand-on-hip, baton-wielding pose of this scion of the soon-to-be-extinct Medici family,he slipped and put his hand through the canvas. This comes shortly after an incident in a Verona museum, wherea tourist sat on an artwork in the form of a crystal chair, also for a photo, and shattered it.View image in fullscreenA barbarian horde? … A tourist damages a painting at the Uffizi gallery, Florence, in images taken from an exclusive video by TG1.Photograph: Independent Photo Agency Srl/AlamyThe Uffizi’s director says it will now take action against the swarm of visitors “coming to museums to make memes or take selfies for social media … We will set very precise limits, preventing behaviour that is not compatible with the sense of our institutions and respect for cultural heritage.” But is it really fair to see everyone who takes a selfie with a painting, or shares their travels on social media, as part of a barbarian horde intent on destroying civilisation? If so, the battle is lost.Judging how other people experience art in museums is a dubious activity. Just because someone adopts a silly pose for a selfie does not mean they are an idiot the rest of the time – they might be an overexcited PhD student doing a thesis on the last days of the Medici. Hypothetically.Last year, I spent a long time in front of one of the Uffizi’s greatest treasures, The Birth of Venus by Botticelli, and the whole time people were taking selfies with it. They did so responsibly and politely: taking turns, not hogging. And none objected to my getting in the way so I could stare at Venus’s pearly skin or the waves that are spurts of sperm.1:10Palazzo Maffei releases CCTV footage of tourists breaking crystal-covered chair – videoAnd while I don’t do selfies, I snap away on my phone – I’ve got scores of Uffizi pics, and I was told off for taking photos last year in the church of Santo Spirito. To the custodian, I was a tourist idiot, never mind that most of my snaps were of architectural details of this Brunelleschi masterpiece.It would be pure snobbery to assume anyone is failing to appreciate art simply because their enjoyment includes, or is even dominated by, one of the most common ways 21st-century people structure all their experiences. There were plenty of old-style cultural tourists, in the 19th and 20th centuries, who trudged from one landmark to another clutching Baedeker guidebooks but not feeling very much about what they saw. Who’s to say today’s phone-clutching Botticelli fans don’t appreciate more? The history of tourism is a history of fads, absurdities and ignorance, yet it is also a culturally uplifting experience. One thing’s for sure: the guy who the Uffizi now hopes will be prosecuted won’t forget that portrait of Fernando de’ Medici in a hurry.As a child, I believed the replica of David outside the Palazzo Vecchio was the real thing. So what? Millions of people visit Italy. We see art in between pizzas and ice cream, misunderstand a lot of what we see, must look to locals like morons. But locals too can get confused by the sheer cultural overload – last year in Florence, a charming bar owner informed me that Michelangelo’s painting of God creating Adam was in the nearby Brancacci Chapel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its shadow, generations of visitors come and go and the city adeptly changes to accommodate them, without ever losing its heart. Once every tourist ate Eggs Florentine, but now you would be laughed at for ordering it. Everything must change so that everything can stay the same. The occasional selfie disaster won’t spoil the incredible Italian art legacy. It’s just another twist in the grand tour, the most ridiculous and sublime experience many of us will ever have.Explore more on these topicsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So how does one start cooking? We asked the expertsMadeleine AggelerTue 24 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 12.01 EDTShareFood is more than just nutrition: it can be joyful, social and exciting. But the act of preparing it can feel awfully daunting.Many beginner cooks suffer from a fear of failure, a lack of foundational knowledge and a poor understanding of how long it actually takes to prepare a dish, says Sam Nasserian, founder and CEO of Cozymeal, a culinary services company. But “once people learn the basics and try a few recipes, they’re surprised by how easy and fun cooking can be”, he says.And there are lots of benefits to cooking at home. Namely: it tends to behealthierandcheaperthan eating out or ordering in. So how does one start cooking? We asked experts.What equipment do you need to start cooking?Not as much as you think. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the elaborate cooking gadgets out there, but experts agree you really only need a few key tools and ingredients to prepare most dishes.Caroline Chambers, author of a book and Substack both called What to Cook When You Don’t Feel Like Cooking, says you can go far with just “a chef’s knife, a cutting board, a good nonstick pan, a few rimmed baking sheets, and a few silicone spatulas”.Nasserian also suggests a medium-sized oven-safe skillet, a small lidded saucepan, measuring cups and spoons, a colander and some storage containers for leftovers.You don’t have to go for the fanciest, most expensive gear either, says Sohla El-Waylly, author of the cookbook Start Here. When it comes to a knife, for example, “you just need a sharp knife that you feel comfortable sharpening”, she says. “That might be the cheapest knife you pick up from Walmart.” Then, if you feel inspired later, you can level up.Quality can make a big difference when it comes to basic spices and pantry staples, though. El-Waylly recommends stocking up on good kosher salt, like Diamond Crystal – “It’s very fluffy, light and forgiving when you first start cooking,” she says – and fresh black pepper that you crack yourself, either with a knife or a pepper mill.“I know it sounds boring, but it’s the basics where you can really screw yourself up right off the bat,” El-Waylly says.Other useful ingredients she recommends keeping on hand are olive oil, a neutral oil (like canola oil or avocado oil) for high temperature cooking, a couple of vinegars, bags of rice and some beans.What are some basic cooking skills to master?There is a popular idea that cooking is intuitive. It might be for some, but intuition usually only comes after lots of practice.“Cooking is a learned skill, just like riding a bike or learning to read,” says Chambers. “If your mother or some other authority figure in your life didn’t teach you the fundamentals, how should you be expected to have acquired them?”The first thing Chambers recommends is enrolling in or watching a knife skills class (there are free ones online). “Knife skills are the fundamental skill in cooking, and if you don’t have a basic knowledge of them, you’re always going to feel frustrated and slow in the kitchen,” she says.More from How to start:How to start meditatingHow to start weightliftingHow to start budgetingHow to start runningNasserian is keen on knife skills too, including learning asafe knife grip. Another important step is developing good cooking habits, like setting up ingredients before you turn on the stove – also known as “mise en place”.Properly seasoning food is where a lot of beginners slip up, Nassierian says, especially by “under-seasoning early and over-salting later”.“You season throughout the cooking process, not just at the end,” says El-Waylly. “Every time you add something to the pan, add some salt.”Tasting the food as you cook is essential. This doesn’t only help with seasoning, but also with learning how flavors develop, says El-Waylly.“When you’re working with spices and you taste something early on, you might feel like the spices taste like themselves and don’t come together,” she says. “But when you taste as it’s cooking, you’ll notice flavors blending and harmonizing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She says hertiny tomato pastaandtaco saladrecipes are especially popular among novice cooks.Easy as 1,2,3: chefs on the 50 most simple, delicious three-ingredient recipesRead moreNasserian also recommends trying recipes that will teach you core cooking skills: a one-potlentil soupcan teach you how to time sauteing and simmering; sheet pan chicken with vegetables, chopping and roasting; a three-eggomelet, heat control; and a vegetable stir-fry, knife work and sauce rations.“Rotate through them for a couple of weeks, and you’ll have the confidence to tackle almost any recipe,” Nasserin says.What are common cooking mistakes to avoid?When you first try anything, you will inevitably make mistakes. But there are easy cooking gaffes to avoid.Don’t overcrowd pans, says Nasserian (this canpreventbrowning and make ingredients soggy rather than crispy). And if you want to sear meat, make sure the skillet is hot enough before you drop it in (as in,very,very hot).Toxic truth? The cookware craze redefining ‘ceramic’ and ‘nontoxic’Read moreMost of all, experts suggest starting off small and not biting off more than you can chew.“TikTok makes it look really fun to cook an eight-part dinner party,” says Chambers. “And it is fun! If you know how to cook.”El-Waylly says it’s important to be realistic about timing. “A lot of recipes will have a cook time of 45 minutes,” she says. “But if you’re starting out, give yourself three hours.”And if you’re fretting about having people over for a meal, don’t worry – the pros do it too.“I still get nervous every time I cook for somebody. I don’t think that ever goes away, and that’s fine,” says El-Waylly. “It means you care.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” Trump said in his address from the White House.While the DIA report was only an initial assessment, one of the people said if the intelligence on the ground was already finding within days that Fordow in particular was not destroyed, later assessments could suggest even less damage might have been inflicted.Long regarded as the most well-protected of Iran’s nuclear sites, the uranium-enrichment facilities at Fordow are buried beneath the Zagros mountains. Reports have suggested that the site was constructed beneath 45-90 metres (145-300ft) of bedrock, largely limestone and dolomite.The White House disputed the intelligence assessment, which was first reported by CNN. “The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran’s nuclear program,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.The US vice-president, JD Vance, admitted on Sunday that Washington did not know where Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranian was, saying: “we are going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel”.Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Monday thatthe IAEA could no longer account for Iran’s stockpile of 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity.The Guardianrevealed last Wednesdaythat top political appointees at the Pentagon had been briefed at the start of Trump’s second term that the 30,000lb “bunker buster” GBU-57 bombs meant to be used on Fordow would not completely destroy the facility.Why is Iran’s nuclear programme so essential to its identity?Read moreIn that briefing, in January, officials were told by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency at the Pentagon that developed the GBU-57 that the bombs would not penetrate deep enough underground and only a tactical nuclear weapon would wipe out Fordow.The US strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities involved B2 bombers dropping 12 GBU-57s on Fordow and two GBU-57s on Natanz. A US navy submarine then launched roughly 30 Tomahawk missiles on Isfahan, US defense officials said at a news conference Sunday.Defense secretary Pete Hegsethrepeated Trump’s claimat the news conference that the sites had been “obliterated”, but the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Dan Caine, who helped oversee the operation, was more measured in his remarks.Caine said that all three of the nuclear sites had “sustained severe damage and destruction” but cautioned that the final battle-damage assessment for the military operation was still to come.Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationDonald TrumpPete HegsethUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump issued a blunt instruction, writing: “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!”LiveIsrael 'never had a better friend than Trump in the White House', says NetanyahuAfter a phone conversation with Netanyahu, Trump returned to the platform to announce: “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave’ to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!”Minutes later, explosions were reported by Iranian media around Tehran and in the north of the country.The US website Axios reported that Netanyahu had told Trump that he could not cancel the strike entirely, and that ultimately “it was decided to significantly scale back the strike, cancel the attack on a large number of targets and strike only one target”. Haaretz reported that the single target was an Iranian radar installation.Iran denied having broken the truce or launched missiles that Israel claimed to have intercepted mid-morning on Tuesday. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered immediate retaliation on Tehran.Trump’s allies in Washington were quick to take a victory lap. Congressman Earl Carter of Savannah, Georgia sent a letter to the nominating committee for the Nobel peace prize, saying Trump’s “leadership at this moment exemplifies the very ideals that the Nobel peace prize seeks to recognise”.And leaders of the isolationist faction of Trump’s Maga coalition gave strong backing to the US president on Tuesday, including administration officials wary of foreign interventions, and conservative media pundits who had been openly critical of the US decision to launch strikes against Iranian nuclear sites at the weekend.“We are seeing a foreign policy doctrine develop that will change the country (and the world) for the better,” wrote JD Vance, the US vice-president, usually a fierce critic of US military interventions in overseas wars. “1) clearly define an American interest; 2) negotiate aggressively to achieve that interest; 3) use overwhelming force if necessary.”“It turns out you can just do what you said you would do,” he added. “No mission creep. No protracted, ill defined ‘nation building’ BS. Just very proud of the president and the whole team this morning.”View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers and rescue workers carry a body from a residential building destroyed by an Iranian missile strike that killed several people, in Beersheba.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APTrump had used social media to announce the ceasefirejust after 5am GMT on Tuesday, asking the warring parties not to violate it. Both sides carried out an intense exchange of fire before signalling their acceptance.Iranian state media suggested the ceasefire had been “imposed on the enemy” after “four waves of attacks on Israeli-occupied territories”. The Israeli authorities confirmed Iran had fired 20 missiles, and that five Israelis had been killed and more than 22 wounded in the southern city of Beersheba.Ninety minutes after Trump’s announcement, Israel – whichbegan the war with a surprise attack on 13 June– also acknowledged the truce and claimed victory.In the hours before the declaration of a ceasefire, Israel carried out some of its most intense airstrikes on Tehran yet, residents said.The Isna news agency said that 16 Iranians had been killed in the north of the country, while Israel claimed to have struck missile launchers in western Iran and struck dozens of targets in Tehran in the early hours of Tuesday morning.Netanyahu’s office claimed to have killed hundreds of militants in the Basij, a volunteer force used to suppress internal dissent, and targeted an Iranian nuclear scientist, bringing the toll of assassinations of Iranian scientists to at least 15.Iranian state media named the scientist killed overnight as Mohammad Reza Seddighi Saber, saying he had been targeted at his parents’ residence in Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh in northern Iran. His 17-year-old son was reported to have been killed in a strike on the family home in Tehran several days ago, state television said.An Iranian social media user in Tehran wrote that the Israeli strikes on the capital city were “intense” in the run-up to the announced ceasefire.“The bombardment tonight in Tehran was extremely intense. For a full hour the explosions wouldn’t stop. We are a completely defenseless people,” the user wrote.View image in fullscreenA woman in Hafte-Tir Square in central Tehran on Monday.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAAfter the Israeli government officially accepted the ceasefire, the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said it was also time to endIsrael’s war in Gaza. “It’s time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war. Israel needs to start rebuilding,” Lapid said on X. An estimated 56,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over 20 months of Israeli bombardment.The ceasefire was announced after an Iranian missile launch against aUS base in Qatar, in reprisal for American participation in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday. Iran said it had given advance warning of the missiles to Qatar and there were no reported injuries, suggesting its response was carefully coordinated to allow Tehran and Washington an off-ramp.Trump advisers privately said they believed Iran would accept the US president’s olive branch in order to avoid continued strikes by Israel, and because they had inflicted symbolic retaliation.Why is Iran’s nuclear programme so essential to its identity?Read moreUS congressional leaders were set to receive their first classified briefings on the strikes on Tuesday but they were later postponed with little explanation from the Trump administration.“This last-minute postponement is outrageous, evasive, and derelict,” said the leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat.“What is the administration so afraid of? Why won’t they engage with Congress on the critical details: the results of the recent strike, the scope and trajectory of this conflict, the administration’s long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and the potential risks facing American citizens and our service members?”Top Democrats have sharply criticised Trump for launching the strikes without consulting or informing congressional leadership before they took place. A number of them have claimed the strikes violated the War Powers Act, a 1973 law that restricts the US president’s ability to order military action without congressional support.“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” said the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican.“I’m persuaded by that argument. They think it’s a violation of the article II powers of the commander-in-chief. I think that’s right.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The bombing intensified to a level I’ve never experienced before. People ran into the streets, terrified and panicking,” said Mariam, 39, from the village of Kordan, about 30 miles (50km) north-west of the capital. Like everyone quoted in this article, she chose to use a pseudonym.When residents ventured out in the streets after the sun rose on Tuesday, their first question was what kind of country the bombers had left in their wake.“There’s a silence now, like a pause in breath before something worse,” Mariam said. “We live in a nightmare that won’t end. I’m scared, and I don’t know what tomorrow will bring. I don’t know if the war will really end.”Most of the Iranians the Guardian talked to were pessimistic, fearing the regime would use the war as a pretext for rolling back some of the liberties carved out by thefemale-led resistance of the past few years.“We had neutralised the ideology of these people. They were culturally and in everyday life bent to our will,” said Shirin, a middle-aged Tehrani woman. She was referring to the fact that before the war the regime’s enforcers had for the most part given up making women who did not want to wear the hijab.The regime had largely retreated from the private sphere of ordinary Iranians. Shirin was worried it would now return with a vengeance. “They now can become as powerful as they were 10 years ago,” she said.In the course of the war, Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, made direct appeals to the Iranian people to rise up against their rulers. Such appeals mostly fell flat, however, even among ardent opponents of Iran’s theocratic establishment.For many Iranians, they were just two more angry old men telling them what to do.“I do not trust Trump. He changes his mind every few seconds. We Iranians deserve better than people like him, Khamenei and Netanyahu who are deciding our fates,” said Nazanin, 28, a Tehrani movie producer. “The whole time we were screaming that we didn’t ask for this war.“Today they’re going to parade on the streets and all the people you will see in the victory parade are just pro-regime hardliners. Now we will suffer the consequences because a wounded regime will pounce on us like prey.”The authorities staged a “victory celebration” in the capital’sEnghelab, or Revolution Square, on Tuesday night. Posters and online propaganda drew in part on Persian folklore, and the image of Arash Kamangir or Arash the Archer, a mythic hero who shot an arrow with superhuman strength. Where it landed marked the border with a hostile neighbour.Most Tehranis also predicted the regime would try to galvanise support through the special significance given to the holy month of Muharram, which begins on Sunday, with its climax falling on its tenth day, Ashura, which in Shia Islam is a day of remembrance and celebration of martyrdom.“The regime is expected to intensify its repression in various areas, including stricter enforcement of mandatory hijab, following the ceasefire,” Mahdi, 42, from Tehran, said. “During the month of Muharram, the government will likely emphasise the culture of martyrdom even more.”“The regime will use it for its political gains and power,” he said.Saeed, 23, a student leader and activist, pointed to Tuesday’s festivities and the air of triumphalism the authorities were trying to spread.“The Islamic Republic is already acting like it won the war, like the whole thing was just a performance for Khamenei, Netanyahu, and Trump to inflate their egos,” he he said.Unlike most people the Guardian spoke to, he did at least see a possible upside for ordinary people. “The ceasefire gave us a bit of hope but also a lot to think about,” he said. “The Islamic Republic’s shallow propaganda about ‘security’ has collapsed. The idea that they’ve always used as an excuse to suppress us is now broken.“One possible gain from all this might be the space to build a real third way, something beyond just Islamic Republic loyalists or monarchists, or regime change activists who ignored us when we needed support most.“Maybe we can create movements that actually care about us, and about Iran as a whole without having to choose between fascism and Islamo-fascism. But I also know from history that it will be hard.”Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She had read the news of a ceasefire before sleeping, but did not believe it.“I never thought there would be a ceasefire,” said Sardinas, a 27-year-old psychologist, while watching rescue workers comb through rubble and flattened cars. “But I hope there will be one because we are in danger every day here.”Sardinas, like many Israelis, was weary after nearly two weeks of war withIran.Unlike the Gaza war, which has killed more than 56,000 people in the territory, ordinary Israelis could not afford to ignore the conflict with Iran. Tehran’s ballistic missiles could not be batted away like the rockets Hamas fired from nearby Gaza.Scenes like that of the struck building in Beersheba, which had its top two floors crumpled, while shredded clothes and broken appliances hung off the sheared-open back wall of the structure, were rare in Israel.“I told all my family and friends that I would always feel safe here, this was true until this war. I don’t know if I would have moved to Israel if I knew this war would happen,” said Sardinas, who emigrated from Argentina about three years ago.As she spoke, it was still unclear if the ceasefire announced by the US president, Donald Trump, at 1am local time, to begin “in approximately six hours” would hold.Israel had launched its most intense barrage of strikes in the hours before the ceasefire took effect, hitting sites belonging to internal security forces and killing hundreds of Iranian security personnel.Iran let off five waves of missiles before the truce and Israel accused it of shooting three missiles three hours after the deadline – a claim Iran denied.Trump quickly reigned in the Israelis and warned them not to respond to the Iranian missiles,letting off an expletive in front of reportersin a clear sign of impatience with both countries.After announcing their commitment to the ceasefire, both Iranian and Israeli officials claimed victory.“The enemy was left with no option but to retreat, express regret and unilaterally bring its aggression to a halt,” the Iranian supreme national security council said in a statement.“This is a great success for the people of Israel and its fighters, who removed two existential threats to our country, and ensured the eternity of Israel,” an Israeli government statement said.‘A pause before something worse’: Iranians wary of what future holdsRead moreIn Israel, there was a palpable sense of victory – and relief that the fighting was over.“I want to be safe. For 10 years Iran has said they want to kill us. If what the president of the US says is true, that we’ve gotten rid of the atomic bombs, then this war is finished,” said Gil Cohen, a 51-year-old who lives near the struck building.Israel started the war with Iran by launching hundreds of airstrikes across the country without warning on 13 June, in what it said was a pre-emptive operation meant to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded by shooting off a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel, kicking off 12 days of tit-for-tat fighting.Iran has long insisted that its nuclear programme was meant purely for civilian purposes. US intelligence assessments put it two to three years away from obtaining a nuclear bomb – an estimate with which Israel and Trump disagreed.In total, 29 people were killed and hundreds more wounded by Iranian attacks in Israel. At least 430 people were killed and more than 3,500 wounded by Israeli strikes in Iran, according to official sources, though the real number is suspected to be higher. Hundreds of thousands of people were also displaced within Iran by the attacks.To Sardinas, that toll was justified. She said Israel was “doing the world’s dirty work” by setting back Iran’s nuclear programme.“Of course the war was worth it, it’s not worth it to stop nuclear weapons? Someone needed to do it. We are attacking them first to prevent their attacks,” she said.Another passerby pushing his two daughters in a stroller said he thought a ceasefire had come too soon, as he was sceptical that enough damage had been done to Iran.Amnesty International said the 12 days of fighting had had devastating effects on civilians in both countries, as attacks struck non-military targets on both sides.“Both Israeli and Iranian authorities have time and again demonstrated their utter disregard for international human rights and humanitarian law, committing grave international crimes with impunity,” Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement on 18 June.The rights body later condemned Israel’s strike on the Evin prison in Tehran on Monday, which held hundreds of prisoners, including defenders of human rights.What happens after the ceasefire remains uncertain. Western leaders have urged a return to US and Iranian negotiations, and Israeli defence officials have indicated that their military gains could translate to a nuclear deal that was more favourable to them.Iranian officials have not yet made a comment on their stance on negotiations.After the initial Israeli attack on Iran, the country’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he felt negotiations with the US had been a ploy to catch the country off-guard and he accused Israel and the US of “blowing up” diplomacy.“The war should definitely stop, the best option for everybody is a ceasefire. I don’t want anything to do with this war,” said an Israeli soldier supervising relief work, confessing he had been sending memes to his friends about being forced to fight in “world war three” after Israel began attacking Iran.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then there are few countries as multifaceted as Qatar, or few conflicts quite as tangled as the Iran-Israel war.It seemsMonday’s heavily signalled Iranian attackon Qatar’s 60-acre Al Udeid airbase, the largest US military facility in the Middle East, may even have become the opening to resume diplomacy. The attack, which caused no casualties, cleared the ground for Donald Trump and Qatar to work together to secure the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran. It once again highlights Qatar’s role as professional mediator – a bespoke service this tiny but massively wealthy country makes available from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Gaza.Ever since Israel launched its attack on Iran 12 days ago,Qatarhas been at the forefront of the countries denouncing it, saying it considered the assault “a blatant violation of Iran’s sovereignty and security, as well as a clear breach of international law”.But Qatar also, free of charge, houses the vast Al Udeid airbase used by the US, one of the protagonists in the war againstIran. Over the years it is estimated Qatar has spent $8bn on the infrastructure of the base, an investment that buys it American goodwill despite the state’s politics being very different from Trump’s “America first”.Iran’s relations with Qatar have also been on a steady upward curve, especially since Iran acted as a friend of Qatar when the state was being boycotted by its Gulf allies.Iran’s Monday night missile salvo was a symbolic, almost courteous, attack on the US airbase in response toAmerican strikes on its nuclear facilities.Trump afterwards thanked Iran for giving advance warning and time for the airbase to be cleared.Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi, Qatar’s foreign minister, issued a “strong condemnation” of the attack, and told the Iranian ambassador, Ali Salehabadi, that Qatar had a right to respond, yet at the same time Qatar’s deputy foreign minister, Majed al-Ansari, balanced a condemnation of Iran’s actions by pointing out that Qatar had been one of the first countries to warn against the dangers of Israeli escalation in the region.For its part, Iran’s supreme national security council said it “remains committed to maintaining and continuing warm and historic relations” with Qatar. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, insisted Tehran would not allow US and Israeli “criminal aggressions and malign policies” to create divisions between it and “brotherly” regional states. Rarely has such an intrusion of another country’s sovereignty been accompanied by so much regret.Indeed almost as soon as the near performative bombs were fended off by Qatar’s air defences, Qatar’s emir was being called by Trump to see if he could have the conversation required with the Iranians to secure their agreement to a ceasefire. Iran’s position since the conflict started has been that the onus lies with Israel to stop striking, but if Trump delivered an Israeli ceasefire Tehran would respond, Qatar was told.Qatar’s value to the region as the one country that can talk to America’s greatest enemies – whether the Taliban, Hamas or Iran – came good again.Qatar has also worked the White House well, not justby providing Trump with a converted new Air Force One, but by being trusted by Democrats and Republicans alike.Its value was underscored by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, in his recent interview with Tucker Carlson. Witkoff showered praise on Qatar, saying “they’re criticised for not being well motivated. It’s preposterous. They are well motivated. They’re good, decent people. What they want is a mediation that’s effective, that gets to a peace goal. And why? Because they’re a small nation and they want to be acknowledged as a peacemaker.”Asked if they were Iran’s agents, Witkoff responded “Look, they’re a Muslim nation. In the past, they’ve had some views that are a little bit more radical, but it’s moderated quite a bit. They pay for every dollar of the airbase. They don’t have their hand out for a thing. There is nothing that the United States has to fund with regard to that airbase. That’s pretty unusual.”Explore more on these topicsQatarIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But military planners say there needs to be a “substrategic” capability that could be employed on the battlefield to deter an attack by Russia on aNatocountry.The F-35As will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk and will join Nato’s dual capable aircraft (DCA) programme – part of the alliance’s longstanding strategy to deter adversaries with a shared, US-led nuclear umbrella.Armed by America: how Europe’s militaries depend on the US – a visual analysisRead moreSimilar arrangements have existed since the cold war in Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Turkey. In each case, the nuclear weapons belong to the US and remain under the control of the US president, because they cannot be sold or given to another country under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Officials said the UK would remain compliant with that international agreement.The Ministry of Defence has a longstanding policy of not commenting on where nuclear weapons are deployed, though there are vaults at RAF Marham, where British tactical weapons were previously stored, though their readiness is unclear.Old storage vaults for nuclear weapons exist at nearby RAF Lakenheath, which is used by the US air force. They are in the process of being upgraded in programmes funded by the US taxpayer, though the American facility is 20 miles away.The B61-12 is designed to have four different explosive yields, of 0.3 kilotons (kt), 1.5kt, 10kt and 50kt, according to the Federation of American Scientists. By comparison, the Hiroshima bomb that killed anywhere between 70,000 and 140,000 people had an explosive yield of 15kt.Officials said the new jets will support more than 20,000 jobs and over 100 UK suppliers, though the jets are manufactured by US defence firm Lockheed Martin.Ministers have also emphasised the cost benefit of switching from the F-35B which costs roughly £100m, to the F-35A model, which they claim will deliver savings of up to 25% per aircraft. The purchase is part of a longstanding plan to acquire up to 138 F-35s in total.Starmer added: “Supporting 100 businesses across the country and more than 20,000 jobs, these F35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies.”Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, welcomed the move as “a robust British contribution to the alliance”.The decision follows warnings in this year’s strategic defence review about rising global instability and renewed nuclear threats. The defence secretary, John Healey, said the announcement reflected a “Nato-first” strategy and used defence as a “growth engine” for the UK economy.The government has warned in a newly published security strategy that Britain needs toprepare for the possibility of being attackedon its own soil. Russia’s military buildup and Iran’s increasing attacks on dissidents abroad mean the country could soon find itself involved in a domestic war, the review said.“For the first time in many years, we have to actively prepare for the possibility of the UK homeland coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario,” the review said.The warning echoed the recent comments from Rutte that, without a big increase in defence spending, British people “better learn to speak Russian”. Starmer, who is at theNato summit in The Hague, has promised to meet Nato’s target of spending 5% of gross domestic product on defence by 2035.The security review goes into fuller detail about the threats that the country is dealing with both at home and abroad, naming Russia as the principal among them,given the Kremlin’s frequent cyber-attacksand attempts at sabotage.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNuclear weaponsMilitaryKeir StarmerNatoUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

As Labour heavy-hitters waded into the row, there were fears inside government that the number would rise and scupper Starmer’s changes to benefits.The mayor of London,Sadiq Khan, was among those urging the prime minister to drop his plans, warning they would “destroy the financial safety net” for millions of people.While cabinet ministers were deployed to win over Labour rebels, some whips and government aides were accused by MPs of threatening deselection and suggesting a defeat could blow up the government. No 10 denied the claims.The Labour rebels, including senior committee chairs, have tabled an amendment that calls for the government to pause the legislation and bring forward the promised £1bn to get more people into work first. If ministers do not agree, they will try to vote the bill down.Widespread Labour dissent over welfare bill is sign things are going very badly for StarmerRead moreThe scale of the rebellion appeared to take Downing Street, and even some of the Labour backbenchers, by surprise, amid concerns that thousands of vulnerable people could be plunged into poverty as a result of losing their disability benefits.Starmer, however, said on Tuesday that he would press ahead with the overhaul, insisting there was a “clear moral case” for change.Speaking on his way to the Nato summit in The Hague, the prime minister defended the plans to tighten the eligibility criteria for personal independence payment (Pip).“There is a clear moral case, which is: the current system doesn’t help those who want to get into work,” he said.“It traps people. I think it’s 1,000 people a day going on to Pip. The additions to Pip each year are the equivalent of a city the size of Leicester. That is not a system that can be left unreformed.”Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, spent much of Tuesday locked in talks with MPs as she sought to win over opponents. Cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Jonathan Reynolds and Wes Streeting were also understood to have been deployed to try to convince anxious backbenchers.On Tuesday night a rebel said that just one Labour backbencher had withdrawn their name, despite the attempts by cabinet ministers and whips to persuade MPs to fall in line, while 16 more had added theirs.Another said that the amendment had more supporters who had decided not to sign, meaning the scale of opposition could be even larger.The size of the rebellion is enough to threaten Starmer’s working majority of 165 and defeat the government’s plans if opposition MPs side with the rebels. No 10 could opt to pull the bill rather than face defeat.Vicky Foxcroft, a former government whip who resigned over the welfare plans, has signed the amendment, along with the former cabinet minister Louise Haigh. More frontbenchers, who would then have to stand down, are expected to join the rebellion.On Tuesday evening Kemi Badenoch offered Conservative support to help the government pass its welfare bill in exchange for three commitments from Starmer.Badenoch ​t​old Sky News: “I’m just making it very clear to Keir Starmer that if he will make commitments at the ​dispatch box to meet our conditions, which are to reduce the welfare budget, to get people into work and not to have tax rises, then we can support his bill.“The bill is a bit of a mess. It needs some work. It looks like it’s been rushed for Rachel [Reeves] to fix other problems that they’ve got. But our welfare budget is far too high, and we really need to bring it down.”With the government unlikely to bow to Tory pressure to make commitments, particularly on tax rises, it appeared that she was giving the opposition political cover to vote against or abstain on the bill.The rebel amendment, led by the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, raises concerns the proposals could push up to 250,000 people – including 50,000 children – into poverty.It also criticises the government for failing to publish the Office for Budget Responsibility’s impact assessment before the vote, and for pursuing changes without adequate consultation with disabled people.The proposed legislation would make it harder to qualify for Pip by requiring claimants to meet a higher threshold in their assessments. It also includes plans to halve the health top-up in universal credit for new claimants from 2026 and phase out the work capability assessment.Khan urged ministers to look again at the hardship the changes would force on vulnerable and disabled people. He said the additional employment and training support should be brought in as soon as possible, and proper transitional protections put in place before cuts.“I have always said that more must be done to support people to go from relying on benefits to getting back into work,” he said.“It’s vital for a healthy and prosperous London. What we can’t do is take away the vital safety net that so many vulnerable and disabled Londoners rely upon.”Asked if concessions would be offered to rebels, a No 10 spokesperson said: “We’ll talk to them over the next week but the government believes this is a good package of reforms. We hope that colleagues will engage positively over the next few days.”The Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, said on Tuesday morning it would be a “very serious thing” for Labour MPs to effectively vote down the legislation at its first major outing in the Commons.Disabilitycharities have criticised the changes, warning they will disproportionately affect people with mental health conditions, women with fluctuating illnesses and unpaid carers.Experts warned that up to1.2 million people with disabilitiesare expected to lose thousands of pounds a year under Kendall’s plans to save £5bn a year by overhauling the welfare system, including by cutting Pip.Anextra 250,000 peoplewill fall into relative poverty by 2029-30, according to the government’s own impact assessment.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityWelfareKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Participants completed a questionnaire that asked for personal, social, demographic, health and lifestyle information.Health information included lifetime diagnoses for disorders including autoimmune and psychiatric conditions. Six autoimmune conditions were included in the study: rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’ disease (thyroid hormone disorder), inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.The mental health conditions the researchers were interested in were self-reported diagnoses of affective disorders, defined as depression, bipolar or anxiety disorder.In total, 37,808 people reported autoimmune conditions and 1,525,347 did not. The lifetime prevalence of any diagnosed affective disorder was significantly higher among those with an autoimmune disorder than it was among the general population: 29% against 18%.Similar associations emerged for depression and anxiety: 25.5% compared with just over 15% for depression, and just over 21% compared with 12.5% for anxiety. The prevalence of current depression and anxiety was also higher among people with autoimmune conditions.While the prevalence of bipolar disorder was much lower, it was still significantly higher among those with autoimmune disorders than among the general population: just under 1% compared with 0.5%.The prevalence of affective disorders was also significantly and consistently higher among women with autoimmune disorders than it was among men with the same physical health conditions: 32% compared with 21%.The reasons for this are unclear. But the researchers, whose findings were published in theBMJ Mental Healthjournal, said theories suggest that sex hormones, chromosomal factors, and differences in circulating antibodies may partly explain the differences.Overall, the risk for mental health conditions was nearly double in people with autoimmune conditions – between 87% and 97% higher. It remained high even after adjusting for potentially influential factors, including age, household income and parental psychiatric history.The study was limited by a lack of available information on the time or duration of illness, making it impossible to determine whether autoimmune conditions preceded, co-occurred with or followed affective disorders.No direct measurements of inflammation were made either, making it impossible to establish the presence, nature, timing or severity of inflammation.The researchers concluded: “Although the observational design of this study does not allow for direct inference of causal mechanisms, this analysis of a large national dataset suggests that chronic exposure to systemic inflammation may be linked to a greater risk for affective disorder.“Future studies should seek to determine whether putative biological, psychological, and social factors – for example, chronic pain, fatigue, sleep or circadian disruptions and social isolation – may represent potentially modifiable mechanisms linking autoimmune conditions and affective disorders.”They added that it could be worth regularly screening people diagnosed with autoimmune diseases for mental health conditions, especially women, to provide them with tailored support early on.Explore more on these topicsMental healthBipolar disorderDepressionAnxietyOsteoarthritisThyroid disordersMultiple sclerosisnewsShareReuse this content"

It said “many media outlets, individuals and other community stakeholders initially understood [the letter] to be a statement of the board”.Its code of conduct required deputies not to misrepresent the position of the board and not to bring the institution into disrepute, it added.The investigative panel unanimously found the 36 signatories to be in breach of the code.After considering the panel’s findings, the board’s executive body decided to send a “notice of criticism” to 31 of the 36 signatories.But five deputies have been suspended from the board for two years and, where applicable, removed from elected positions. In three cases, the suspension may be reduced to six months “by way of apology to affected parties”, the board said.Michael Wegier, its chief executive, said: “We are a democratic organisation that welcomes debate, diversity and free speech. Managing diversity of opinion within our organisation depends on our code of conduct.“That code ensures deputies do not create misunderstandings about the position of the board or its members, do not bring the institution into disrepute, and treat one another and the institution with respect.”The letter,published by the Financial Times on 16 Apriland signed by about one in eight of the board’s elected representatives, said: “The inclination to avert our eyes is strong, as what is happening is unbearable, but our Jewish values compel us to stand up and to speak out.”It added: “We know in our hearts we cannot turn a blind eye or remain silent at [the] renewed loss of life and livelihoods, with hopes dwindling for a peaceful reconciliation and the return of the hostages.“This most extremist of Israeli governments is openly encouraging violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, strangling the Palestinian economy and building more new settlements than ever … Israel’s soul is being ripped out and we, members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, fear for the future of the Israel we love and have such close ties to.”The signatories said: “We stand against the war … it is our duty, as Jews, to speak out.”The board launched its investigation after receiving an unspecified number of complaints about the letter.Many of the complaints reportedly came from members of the United Synagogue, the largest communal denomination in the UK. Most of the letter’s signatories belong to Reform, Liberal or Masorti communities.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warReligionIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

That’s obscene’Read moreThe authorities in Venice have upped security across the city, particularly in the Jewish neighbourhood.The 200 or so wedding guests, who may also include Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian and Leonardo DiCaprio, will arrive in Venice on Tuesday and Wednesday. An estimated 95 private planes are reported to be landing at the city’s airport.No precise dates or details have been confirmed, although it is believed the celebrations will begin on Thursday, with the couple exchanging vows on Friday in San Giorgio Maggiore basilica on the Venetian island of the same name. The big party is expected to be held on Saturday.Activists said that instead of trying to stop the wedding, they will organise a “no Bezos, no war” march.“We feel as if we scored a victory,” said one activist, who asked not to be named. “The crocodile initiative would have given a bad impression of the city – this is why the venue was changed even if the authorities might try to claim it was because of the war.”View image in fullscreenSan Giorgio Maggiore, where Bezos and Sánchez are expected to exchange vows on Friday.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersThe campaign group emerged soon after Venice’s millionaire mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, confirmed in March that thecouple would be getting married in the city.

TV set viewing has remained relatively stable with the average amount of daily viewing just a little longer in 2015 at three hours and 23 minutes.Chart showing mobile phone usage is high from morning until late eveningUK ministers ‘too scared of Donald Trump’ to back levy on TV streaming giantsRead moreThe research, which is published by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), assesses that over-15s spend on average 7.5 hours a day engaged in screen-based activities – including using mobiles, laptops, tablets, games consoles and watching TV – up from 6.5 hours a decade ago.The survey’s findings also highlight the “always on” nature of mobile consumption.TV set viewing shows peak viewing in evenings, while computer use aligns with the traditional 9-5 workday. However, mobile phone usage remains consistently high from morning until bedtime, suggesting that handsets are now the most constant media companion.Chart showing social media and messaging accounts for half of time spent on mobile phones“This data marks a milestone in the evolution of media consumption,” said Dan Flynn, the deputy research director at the IPA, which has been running the TouchPoints survey since 2005. “It’s a clear signal of how embedded mobile phones have become in our daily lives. Always on, always within reach and increasingly central to how we consume content, connect and unwind.”The survey shows the dramatic shift in the habits of younger people, with research by media regulator Ofcom last year finding thatless than half of young people watch any live television in an average week.Younger generations have been increasingly drawn to watching streaming platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Netflix on mobile, as well as scrolling social media platforms including Instagram and Facebook, rather than choosing to sit down in front of traditional TV.The latest TouchPoints survey, which polled 6,416 people over 15, found that the youngest cohort aged up to 24 now spends four hours 49 minutes on their mobile phones, almost 50% more time than the overall average. This demographic also spends just one hour 49 minutes watching traditional TV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the IPA study notes, TV creates positive feelings, mobile the opposite.”The survey found that browsing social media and sending messages accounted for the biggest proportion of time spent on mobiles, at 49%. This was followed by radio and audio services, at 20%, and watching TV and video at 15%.Explore more on these topicsDigital mediaTelevision industryTV streamingnewsShareReuse this content"

The numbers creep up year after year, fuelled by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.But scientists have also identified at least 16 “tipping points” – thresholds where a tiny shift could cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with potentially devastating effects. These shifts can interact with each other and create feedback loops that heat the planet further or disrupt weather patterns, with unknown but potentially catastrophic consequences for life on Earth. It is possible some tipping points may already have been passed.Dr Genevieve Guenther, an American climate communications specialist, is the founding director of End Climate Silence, which studies the representation of global heating in the media and public discourse. Last year, she published The Language of Climate Politics: Fossil Fuel Propaganda and How to Fight It, which was described by Bill McKibben as “a gift to the world”. In the run-up to theGlobal Tipping Points conferencein July, Guenther talks to the Guardian about the need to discuss catastrophic risks when communicating about the climate crisis.View image in fullscreenThe future of her son and all children motivates Dr Genevieve Guenther to protect the planet from further global heating.Photograph: Laila Annmarie Stevens/The GuardianThe climate crisis is pushing globally important ecosystems – ice sheets, coral reefs, ocean circulation and the Amazon rainforest – towards the point of no return.Why is it important to talk about tipping points?We need to correct a false narrative that the climate threat is under control. These enormous risks are potentially catastrophic. They would undo the connections between human and ecological systems that form the basis of all of our civilisation.How have attitudes changed towards these dangers?There was a constructive wave of global climate alarm in the wake of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on 1.5C in 2018. That was the first time scientists made it clear that the difference between 1.5C and 2C would be catastrophic for millions of people and that in order to halt global heating at a relatively safe level, we would need to start zeroing out our emissions almost immediately. Until then, I don’t think policymakers realised the timeline was that short. This prompted a flurry of activism – Greta Thunberg and Indigenous and youth activists – and a surge of media attention. All of this converged to make almost everybody feel that climate change was a terrifying and pressing problem. This prompted new pledges, new corporate sustainability targets, and new policies being passed by government.This led to a backlash by those in the climate movement who prefer to cultivate optimism. Their preferred solution was to drive capitalist investment into renewable technologies so fossil fuels could be beaten out of the marketplace. This group believed climate fear might drive away investors, so they started to argue it was counterproductive to talk about worst-case scenarios. Some commentators even argued we had averted the direst predictions and were now on a more reassuring trajectory of global warming of a little under 3C by 2100.View image in fullscreenThere is a misconception that wealthier places, such as the UK, Europe (including Italy, pictured) and the US will not be affected by the climate crisis but this is wrong, says Guenther.Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty ImagesBut it is bananas to feel reassured by that because 3C would be a totally catastrophic outcome for humanity. Even at the current level of about 1.5C, the impacts of warming are emerging on the worst side of the range of possible outcomes and there is growing concern of tipping points for the main Atlantic Ocean circulation (Amoc), Antarctic sea ice, corals and rainforests.If the risk of a plane crashing was as high as therisk of the Amoc collapsing, none of us would ever fly because they would not let the plane take off. And the idea that our little spaceship, our planet, is under the risk of essentially crashing and we’re still continuing business as usual is mindblowing. I think part of the problem is that people feel distant from the dangers and don’t realise the children we have in our homes today are threatened with a chaotic, disastrous, unliveable future. Talking about the risks of catastrophe is a very useful way to overcome this kind of false distance.In your book, you write that it’s appropriate to be scared and the more you know, the more likely you are to be worried, as is evident from the statements of scientists andthe United Nationssecretarygeneral,António Guterres. Why?Some people at the centre of the media, policymaking and even research claim that climate change isn’t going to be that bad for those who live in the wealthy developed world – the UK, Europe and the United States. When you hear these messages, you are lulled into a kind of complacency and it seems reasonable to think that we can continue to live as we do now without putting ourselves, our families, our communities under threat within decades. What my book is designed to do is wake people up and raise the salience and support for phasing out fossil fuels.[It] is written for people who are already concerned about the climate crisis and are willing to entertain a level of anxiety. But the discourse of catastrophe would not be something I would recommend for people who are disengaged from the climate problem. I think that talking about catastrophe with those people can actually backfire because it’ll just either overwhelm them or make them entrench their positions. It can be too threatening.View image in fullscreenThe Donnie Creek wildfire burns in British Columbia, Canada, in 2023.Photograph: Noah Berger/APA recent Yale studyfound that a degree of climate anxietywas not necessarilybadbecause itcould stir people to collective action. Do youagree?It depends. I talk about three different kinds of doomerism. One is the despair that arises from misunderstanding the science and thinking we’re absolutely on the path to collapse within 20 or 30 years, no matter what we do. That is not true.Second, there’s a kind of nihilistic position taken by people who suggest they are the only ones who can look at the harsh truth. I have disdain for that position.Finally, there’s the doomerism that comes from political frustration, from believing that people who have power are just happy to burn the world down. And that to me is the most reasonable kind of doomerism. To address that kind of doomerism, you need to say: “Yes, this is scary as hell. But we must have courage and turn our fear into action by talking about climate change with others, by calling our elected officials on a regular basis, by demanding our workplaces put their money where their mouth is.”You need to acknowledge people’s feelings, meet them where they are and show how they can assuage their fear by cultivating their bravery and collective action.The most eye-opening part of your book was about the assumptions of the Nobelprize winner William Nordhaus that we’ll probably only face a very low percentage of GDP loss by the end of the century. This surely depends on ignoring tipping points?The only way Nordhaus can get the result that he does is if he fails to price the risk of catastrophe and leaves out a goodly chunk of the costs of global heating. In his models, he does not account for climate damages to labour productivity, buildings, infrastructure, transportation, non-coastal real estate, insurance, communication, government services and other sectors. But the most shocking thing he leaves out of his models is the risk that global heating could set off catastrophes, whether they are physical tipping points or wars from societal responses. That is why the percentage of global damages that he estimates is so ridiculously lowballed.The idea that climate change will just take off only a small margin of economic growth is not founded on anything empirical. It’s just a kind of quasi-religious faith in the power of capitalism to decouple itself from the planet on which it exists. That’s absurd and it’s unscientific.Some economists suggest wealth can provide almost unlimited protection from catastrophe because it is better to be in a steel and concrete building in a storm than it is to be in a wooden shack. How true is that?There’s no evidence that these protections are unlimited, though there are economists who suggest we can always substitute technologies or human-made products for ecosystems or even other planets like Mars for Earth itself. This goes back to an economic growth theorist named Robert Solow, who claims technological innovation can increase human productivity indefinitely. He stressed that it was just a theory, but the economists advising Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s took this as gospel and argued it was possible to ignore environmental externalities – the costs of our economic system, including our greenhouse gas pollution – because you could protect yourself as long as you kept increasing your wealth.View image in fullscreenFloods due to heavy rains at Porto Alegre airport left a plane stranded on the runway in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, last year.Photograph: Diego Vara/ReutersExcept when it comes to the climate crisis?Yes, the whole spectacle of our planet heating up this quickly should call all of those economic assumptions into question. But because climate change is affecting the poor first and worst, this is used as evidence that poverty is the problem. This is a misrepresentation of reality because the poor are not the only ones who are affected by the climate crisis. This is a slow-moving but accelerating crisis that will root and spread. And it could change for the worst quite dramatically as we hit tipping points.The difference between gradual warming and tipping points is similar to the difference between chronic, manageable ailments and acute, life-threatening diseases, isn’t it?Yes. When people downplay the effects of climate change, they often represent the problem as a case of planetary diabetes – as if it were a kind of illness that you can bumble along with, but still have a relatively good quality of life as long as you use your technologies, your insulin, whatever, to sustain your health. But this is not how climate scientists represent climate change. Dr Joelle Gergis, one of the lead authors on the latest IPCC report, prefers to represent climate change as a cancer – a disease that takes hold and grows and metastasises until the day when it is no longer curable and becomes terminal. You could also think of that as a tipping point.This is a fight for life. And like all fights, you need a tremendous amount of bravery to take it on. Before I started working on climate change, I didn’t think of myself as a fighter, but I became one because I felt I have a responsibility to preserve the world for my son and children everywhere. That kind of fierce protectiveness is part of the way that I love. We can draw on that to have more strength than our enemies because I don’t think they’re motivated by love. I believe love is an infinite resource and the power of it is greater than that of greed or hate. If it weren’t, we wouldn’t be here.Tipping points: on the edge? – a series on our futureView image in fullscreenComposite: Getty/Guardian DesignTipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects.

But NEF said it made little sense, either in terms of economics or security.“Increasing military budgets at the same time as cutting green and social spending, risks fuelling a public backlash, widening inequality and eroding trust in democratic institutions,” NEF said in its analysis. “Asking citizens to tighten their belts while defence budgets and arms investors’ profits surge undermines the very social resilience that security depends on.”The UK on Mondaycommitted to raising its target from 3% of GDP spent on defence to 5% by 2035after weeks of diplomatic pressure. The Common Wealth thinktank found that an increase in military spending to 3.5% of GDP would cost the UK an extra £32bn annually.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Elsa and Anna drew an audience of zealous young cosplayers. Can Hercules bring in his own sword-and-sandal stans? His zero-to-hero journey was certainly winning in the 1997 animated film, with Gerald Scarfe’s sharp-lined designs and James Woods’ deliciously wicked Hades. But lightning does not strike twice with this stage version, although it is a sturdy enough Disney vehicle, with strong songs and plenty of splash.There is a briskness to its drama, under the direction of Casey Nicholaw, and a pounding out of the material – Songs! Lights! Action! – that makes it seem like a conveyor-belt musical. The characters are not so much divine as 2D, although the sound and optics are always eye-popping, the swivelling set designs intent on moving heaven and earth. Gregg Barnes and Sky Switser’s costumes are heavenly, too, and camp as hell: gold dresses, white Spanx and Hercules in a mesh vest and miniskirt-style toga by the end.View image in fullscreenSongs! Lights! Action! … Hercules, designed by Dane Laffrey.Photograph: Johan PerssonLuke Brady is an incredible singer, as Hercules navigates his journey between godliness and humanness with sidekick Phil (Trevor Dion Nicholas). But the title character is rather generic, a Hunkules who is earnest for too long despite shades of Joey from Friends (why not lean in to that?). The cast around Brady is just as strong vocally, but breezy in their dialogue. The animated film’s Hades was a fabulous creation, his head permanently licked by flames from his underworld. Here, Stephen Carlile looks and sounds like a pantomime baddie, complete with corny jokes. You want to boo him every time he delivers his lines.The big booming songs – including seven new numbers written by Alan Menken (music) and David Zippel (lyrics) – come to sound samey and a little soupy, such as the new addition, Today’s Gonna Be My Day. They are delivered as briskly as the action by an American-accented cast. Go the Distance is a lovely solo by Hercules but you do not feel quite enough emotion from it. The upbeat numbers work better, especially the reprises of Gospel Truth by the five muses, all powerhouse singers. So there is astolidity to the story, as if an ancient tablet of stone has taken the place of a flesh and blood heart.View image in fullscreenChemistry … Luke Brady as Hercules and Mae Ann Jorolan as Meg.Photograph: Matt CrockettThe first half culminates in an NFL style parade, full of military motifs and twirling batons, all taking us outside the story’s ancient world and into unimaginative, bland entertainment, with stock choreography (by Nicholaw and Tanisha Scott). But in the second halfKwame Kwei-Armahand Robert Horn’s book gets funnier, Hercules turns goofier and his love story with Meg (Mae Ann Jorolan, cool cat to Brady’s golden retriever) grows in chemistry. Not everything rights itself, however. The monsters that Hercules meets are certainly big but seem oddly cuddly as if the production is afraid of frightening its younger audience.Perhaps this musical shows the film’s age: this feels like old-school Disney, its hero not quite self-mocking enough (compare him with the brilliantly self-parodying Maui from Moana) and the earnestness heaped heavy. In the programme, Zippel acknowledges the animated Hercules’s mix of heart and wit. “Everything comes with a wink,” he says.

This catch-up with passengers makes for a fun hour of unintentional comedyLucy ManganTue 24 Jun 2025 09.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 14.58 EDTShareWith the latest instalments of the documentary anthology series Trainwreck, Netflix appears to be trying to grant us a brief summer pause from its usual run of true crime horror. Previous episodes included the Woodstock 99 riots and Astroworld festival crowd crush, in which 10 people died, including a nine-year-old child. Now, it has pivoted in tone.Last week it gave us Mayor of Mayhem, the tale of Rob “I am not a crack addict” Ford, the crack-addicted mayor of Toronto and his very un-Canadian way of doing municipal business. In coming weeks, there will be accounts ofthe balloon boy’s story, a private investigation agency run by soccer moms, and “the greatest shitpost ever made”. Whether this tonal change comes as a relief from having your hopes for humanity further ground down, or feels as psychologically jarring (should such disparate subjects as child death and municipal confusion be yoked together in the same anthology series?), will vary.Meanwhile, here is Poop Cruise, which tells the 2013 story of theTriumph cruise ship, whose engine room caught firehalfway across the Gulf of Mexico. The ship’s power was cut off, stranding more than 4,200 passengers and staff for five long, hot and increasingly fetid days, after the toilet flushes malfunctioned.The story is told partly through archive news footage, of which there is plenty, because as one reporter puts it: “Sometimes there are those scenarios that come along and just grab everyone’s attention.” A 13-storey, 272m-long cruise ship – “a skyscraper on its side” – filling with shit is one of them. It is joined by eye- and olfactory-witness testimonies from the likes of Larry and his daughter Rebekah, there to escape the stresses of her parents’ recent divorce; Devin, on board with his fiancee and his in-laws-to-be; cruise director Jan; bartender Hannah; chef Abhi; and, most gloriously, Ashley, a bride, and Kalin and Jayme, her two bachelorettes. None of them appear to have come to terms with the experience one jot in the intervening 12 years.People had to poo in bags, you see. Jan had to get on the public address system and explain to thousands of disbelieving passengers that “number ones” could be done in the shower but “number twos” must be done in the red biohazard bags being distributed, then placed in corridors for collection by unnamed staff, none of whom chose to appear in this documentary. Ashley starts necking Imodium; Devin promises himself he will not crap in a bag while on a cruise with his future father-in-law; Abhi, the chef, notes that the unworking loos filled with poos layered with toilet paper look “like a lasagne”.Every guest is appalled and fantastically humourless about the experience, even at this distance. You cannot help but wonder at cultural divides and how differently the British might have approached – or at least recalled – such events, at least in the early days. For us, surely, it would be a story for the ages. You could dine out on it for ever, so to speak. But, Ashley, Kalin (“This can’t be real!”) and Jayme (“No way. Not happening”) seem absolutely traumatised, haunted still by the memory. It’s fascinating.To be fair, when we reach the point where tugboats finally arrive to tow the ship to shore, causing it to list sharply, and the backed-up sewage to start running across every floor and down the walls, the comedy does fade slightly. In retrospect, it was also a mistake to open up a free bar on day two. Not that Jan needs retrospective. “I was definitely against the idea.” Jan is English and northern. Always listen to Jan.The only happy American on show is Frank Spagnoletti, a maritime lawyer sitting at home in Houston watching the debacle unfold. “Obviously, my antenna was piqued.” I shan’t give away what the fates have in store for him. I shall say only – check your tickets’ small print every time, folks. There is some raw work pulled at the contractual font sometimes, and no mistake.Unlike the unfortunates aboard the Triumph, we viewers are in and out of the situation in under an hour and feel like we have had quite a lot of fun in the process. If anyone wants to write the sitcom or the film, I would give either one my full attention. Also, some primeval part of my brain hisses, an international reality show based on it. I think there’s a real opportunity to build some national pride here. Channel 4, it’s over to you.Trainwreck: Poop Cruise is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, as now – it’s not you, it’s himTue 24 Jun 2025 09.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 14.54 EDTShareUntil it finally opens, there remains much speculation over precisely which artefacts will occupy Donald Trump’s eventualpresidential library. My current view is that you could do a lot worse than fill it with all the volumes of text that have been written in the cause of “understanding” him. These increasingly read like the most futile female-targeted self-help books of the 1990s. You Have to Understand He is Very Transactional. Take Him Seriously But Not Literally. Guys, please – no more. We all urgently need rescuing from the Mind, Body & Statecraft section of the bookshop.As I say, so many gazillions of words have been expended on this cause that Trump reminds me a lot of the men of the 1990s – indeed, he was one. Back then, he had emerged from a decade of valiantly avoiding contracting STIs in 1980s Manhattan – a battle he would later describe as “my personal Vietnam”. For much of the 1990s, the rest of mankind – certainly womankind – felt that personal victories of their own must be just around the corner. It definitely helped that the economy was booming and history had ended. But it was a time when people believed you could change everything through self-control/hard work/the right roadmap. In fact, speaking of roads, one of the biggest nonfiction titles of the 90s in the US was M Scott Peck’sThe Road Less Travelled, a hymn to personal growth that was treated by many as the key to all mythologies.The vast, mostly female contingent of self-help-book buyers of this era seemed convinced that men were desperately trying to communicate with them, and that true harmony/a happy ending was possible if they simplylearned how to decodethe messages contained in totally inscrutable behaviour like not calling them back, not appearing to care about what they wanted, or stating they were going to put tariffs on all non-US goods. One of those I might have misremembered. But the general gist was: what could it all mean? Once you had deciphered it, men would love you, and you could then set about managing them into their perfect final form. (This may also be what the rest of the G7 leaders thought once Trump got bored with the conference last weekand left.)Then along came an episode of Sex and the City – the absolute classic show about turn-of-the-millennium guys and the women who loved ’em – in which Miranda related to the girls (and one man) how her most recentdate had gone. They’d had a nice evening, he’d told her he wasn’t going to bomb Iran, but then he had. What could it all mean? No, hang on – I’m in a muddle – that was a different episode of something. Let’s try it again. They’d had a nice evening, he’d kissed her, she asked him upstairs, but he said he had an early meeting so he didn’t come up. What could it all mean? Something really positive, think the girls. “It means he likes you but he wants to take it slow,” is one of their verdicts. Men can be “afraid of having their feelings hurt”. Or “freaked out by their own feelings”. He could have been stressed out, on deadline, or have a migraine. The only man at the table is eventually asked for his opinion, which he parts with almost reluctantly. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it for you,” he says. “He’s just not that into you.”Trump and Netanyahu aim to remake the Middle East with bombs. Iran shows why that will always fail | Sina ToossiRead moreWell now. That last line of dialogue promptly became a real-life meme. Then the meme became a book, when two of Sex and the City’s writers ended up writing an entire self-help tome using it as the title. And then the bookbecame a movie, which continued to disseminate its essential message: stop wasting time parsing really obvious behaviour into whatever you want it –need it– to mean. Plus, by this point, among other things, it was the Bush years, 9/11 had happened, and people had learned that two of M Scott Peck’s children wouldn’t talk to him and he’dcheated on his wifemultiple times throughout their marriage. So, in many ways, everyone was waking up.Watching the events of the past fortnight – in which any number of people have been blindsided, crushed, humiliated, whatevered by Trump – felt like it was past time for a similar awakening for politicians and the analysts who love to comment on ’em. (Hi! I’m here twice a week, etc.) Instead, it feels like Keir Starmer could spend the Nato summit stuck drinking cosmopolitans with his little gang of world leaders, going: “I think I’ve worked out what Donald’s trying to tell me – and it’s incredibly positive! He’s just COMPLEX, like all quality men!” “I don’t think he wants to do any of these bad things, he’s just left with no choice.” “Yes,” the perfectly coiffed Emmanuel Macron might agree as he took another sip. “He rang andtold youhis B-2s were on the way to bomb Iran a whole hour before other people found out – you have a really special relationship!”Ladies, gentlemen, presidents, prime ministers – can I stop you? He Just Wants it to be About Him. Everything being always about him is the position of maximum control and maximum attention. The end. Maybe someone could get a book out of it – God knows I’ve just got 900 words out of it – but honestly, save yourself time, money and emotion and wake up. He is not REMOTELY into you.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionIranHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

More than any candidate, he sensed the war-weariness of Americans after the fiascos in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and especially the dismay of military veterans, 60% of whom voted for him over Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump’s maverick, anti-interventionist “America First” narrative also resonated strongly with those in the Maga movement who have never served in the military, particularly blue-collar workers.Now, Trump, once an unsparing critic of military misadventures, has bombed the nuclear enrichment installations of Iran, a country that hadn’t attacked the US, wasn’t preparing to and didn’t even threaten war. Since the bombing, Trump has gone further: he has ruminated aboutregime changein Iran. His transformation has startled many of his Maga acolytes who share Tucker Carlson’s view that Trump risks being dragged into Israel’s fight with Iran and becoming embroiled in his own forever war. The fragile truce agreed to by Iran and Israel may ease their worries if it holds, but Trump might be drawn to regime change again if fighting resumes.I spent five years in Iran’s notorious Evin prison but when Israel bombed it I felt horror and fear | Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeRead morePerhaps Trump floated regime change to scare Iran’s leaders into dismantling their entire enrichment operation, something Tehran rejected from the outset of the negotiations with Washington. The president may believe that the risk of losing power will force Iran’s leadership, which is already under military pressure fromIsrael, to relent.But Trump doesn’t need to go down this path. Having hit Iran’s enrichment installations – though it isnow evidentthat they weren’t obliterated, contrary to his boast immediately after the strike – the president could declare victory. He could tell Israel’s strongest American supporters that he delivered on his pledge to protect it and then turn to reassuring Maga’s stars, such as Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, that he remains a foe of forever wars. He won’t get Iran to sign a no-enrichment deal, but so what? He could claim that, contrary to the malicious mainstream media’s claims, he did in fact demolish Iran’s enrichment capabilities.Taking this path would make sense. Despite his tough-guy persona, Trump has an instinctive aversion to needless wars that could turn into quagmires. The recent strike onIranwas risk-free: Iran lacked the air defenses needed to down the B-2 stealth bombers, so there was no chance of American pilots being killed or captured. And Tehran does not have the means to strike the American homeland in return. Even its ineffectual, face-saving missile salvoes against the US military base in Qatar were preceded by a warning – proof that Iran doesn’t want to do anything that might push Trump to join Israel’s war.Iran has, in effect, provided Trump an opportunity to forget about regime change. He’d be foolish not to take itIran has, in effect, provided Trump an opportunity to forget about regime change. He’d be foolish not to take it. Moving forward with the idea will create problems – politically at home, militarily in Iran.On the domestic political front, the Carlson-Bannon wing of Maga will soon look past Trump’s attack on Iran, which JD Vance and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have already said doesn’t presage something bigger. But a war of regime change will be the equivalent of a bombshell. It will create a canyon-sized rift in Trump’s base between the unconditional supporters of Israel and those who think that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks to drag the US into his war because he believes that the destruction of the Iranian political system can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Trump has nothing to gain from such an outcome.The military and strategic hazards of a regime change war are even worse, and one of them stems from the sheer size of Iran. It has nearly 92 million people and a land area of 636,371 sq miles (1,648,193 sq km). By contrast, Iraq’s population is less than half as large, and its territory is less than a third the size. Moreover, the Iranian army and ancillary forces, more thanhalf a millionactive-duty soldiers, won’t go quietly into the night. They will have the advantage of fighting an invader on home ground and on many fronts across a vast area. Though many Iranians dislike the existing political order, it is hardly certain that they will welcome an invader rather than rallying as nationalists to defend their homeland.Moreover, a military intervention in amulti-ethniccountry like Iran could precipitate prolonged disorder and bloodletting. Persians comprise only 60% of the country’s population. Azerbaijanis account for 16%, Kurds for another 10%, and there are numerous smaller nationalities. The relationship between the Iranian state and minority ethnic groups, especially the Kurds, has featured periods oftension, even violence. The expectation of a regime collapse could trigger rebellions and, in response, repression by the state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the idea that a country’s political order can be revamped through airpower alone is anillusion. Regime change zealots could say, bombs away, stability be damned, upheaval will achieve the goal. The problem, however, is that the US can’t insulate itself from the resulting shock waves.Iran exports1.3 million-plusbarrels of oil a day and overlooks the strait of Hormuz, the conduit for 20% of global oil exports. Iran also adjoins seven countries and shares maritime borders with six others. The latter are all closely aligned with the US, which hasbases or a military presenceon their territories. Shia Muslims, who make up 90% of Iran’s population, comprise between55% and 70%of Bahrain’s population. Shia Muslims constitute only 10-12% of Saudi Arabia’s population but are concentrated in its oil-richeastern province, where they account for25-30%of its denizens. An American intervention in Iran won’t necessarily produce solidarity protests in these underdog Shia communities, but they could, and the Gulf monarchies may struggle to contain the consequences.Given these sobering realities, it would be naive to believe that the US could take a wrecking ball to the Iranian state and walk away unaffected. Here’s hoping that Trump comes to understand this and won’t revert to dreams of regime change if the truce collapses. For now at least, Trump’s recent disavowal of regime change on the ground that it would produce chaos is welcome news. We must hope that the mercurial president doesn’t change his mind, as he does so often.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionIranIsraelIran's nuclear programmeDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But Farage knows better than Labour that headlines matterTue 24 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.04 EDTShareIn a political landscape where the traditional left struggles to even mention the working class, let alone articulate a compelling vision for them, Nigel Farage and Reform UK are playing a shrewd hand. This week they will add to their political momentum with a bold, headline-grabbing policy: theBritannia Card– a commitment to tax the rich to put money in the pockets of the poor. This isn’t just policy; it’s political theatre, designed to resonate deeply with an electorate hungry for tangible change, mixed with an idea of British patriotism.Reform’s proposal is deceptively simple: anyone seeking to live in the UK must make an “entry contribution” of £250,000. This substantial sum, the policy pledges, would then be directly redistributed to the lowest 10% of earners, making 2.5 million people between £600 and £1,000 better off a year, depending on uptake.This policy capitalises on a surging public appetite for wealth redistribution. Polls indicate thatmore than three-quarters of Britons, and69% of Reform voters, believe the rich should be taxed more. The sheer simplicity of taxing new arrivals and directly putting that money into the hands of struggling families creates an easily digestible and highly memorable message. It also tackles a pervasive public cynicism: a distrust of politicians’ ability to handle tax revenues. By hypothecating – ring-fencing – these funds directly for the poorest full-time workers, Reform bypasses the common fear that taxes disappear into a black hole of government spending.This populist appeal is not unique to Farage. Across the Atlantic, New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has gained significant traction with a similar approach:taxing the wealthy to fund free childcare. The lesson is clear: politicians who offer transparent, direct benefits, funded by those perceived to be able to afford it most, capture the public imagination.Of course, Farage is (annoyingly) a master of political manoeuvring, and the Britannia Card is no exception. While it promises to enrich the poor, it simultaneously offers a subtle tax break to the wealthiest. The proposal would be a significant boon to the global super-rich, because all their overseas income and assets would be exempt from UK taxation for a decade.Labourhas been quick to point out that this could lead to a net decrease in tax income overall. But in the age of soundbites, such nuanced economic arguments often fall on deaf ears. The headline is what matters, and the headline here is “money from the rich, for the poor”.Labour, meanwhile, seems to have retreated from the very ground that should be its natural habitat. Its reluctance to champion the working class, coupled with plans such as cutting personal independence payments (Pip), is a critical misstep. Governments get re-elected when people feel materially better off. The Biden administration’s experience in the US is a stark reminder of this. The Labour leadership has wedded itself to a flawed assumption that aggregate economic growth, if it even materialises, will translate into a felt improvement for the working and middle classes. Labour’s plans for increased investment, while needed, will take years to bear fruit. What is it offering to those struggling today?When I worked directly with progressive governments globally, we found that “solidarity taxes” – similar in narrative to what Reform is proposing – can be highly effective. Uruguay’s tax on the richest during Covid, designed to support the poorest, proved popular due to its transparency and the clear way in which it was communicated. Similar taxes were implemented in Germany during reunification and Japan in the aftermath of the second world war. The key is clarity and directness of purpose.Any government serious about addressing inequality should focus on taxing wealth. The latest Sunday Times rich list shockingly revealed that just50 families now possessmore wealth than the bottom 50% of the UK population. Much of this wealth, unlike income from work, cannot be solely attributed to “hard graft”, but is down to asset inflation. Crucially, the longstanding myth that millionaires will simply flee the country if taxed more heavily is being debunked. The Tax Justice Network – with Patriotic Millionaires UK and Tax Justice UK – hasrecently shownthat supposed “millionaire exoduses” are vastly exaggerated, and that tax is a minor factor in migration decisions for the tiny percentage of wealthy individuals who do move.Labour’s current attempts to address wealth inequality, such as changes to inheritance tax for farmland and VAT on private schools, feel piecemeal. Rumours of a reversal on its non-dom tax policies suggest it remains susceptible to elite lobbying, further undermining its progressive credentials. Instead of dancing around the issue, Labour could, for instance,boldly proposea modest 2% annual tax on wealth exceeding £10m, to raise a significant £24bn annually. The crucial step then would be to articulate clearly how this new revenue would be used – perhaps to address the cost-of-living crisis by boosting social security.Perhaps the most potent lesson Labour can learn from Reform isn’t about the specifics of the Britannia Card, but about the art of communication. While Rachel Reeves often speaks in a convoluted beige, Farage paints in bright, clear colours. He understands that political messaging, particularly on economic issues, needs to be immediate, impactful and easily understood. The very naming of the policy is a masterstroke of patriotic populism.The name also reminds us that we are in dangerous territory. The coupling of anti-immigration rhetoric with populist economic policies is a potent combination. Labour’s true test lies not in outmanoeuvring Farage on his own turf, but in offering a courageous and convincing alternative: a clear, compelling narrative of shared prosperity, funded by those who can most afford it, for the benefit of all.Faiza Shaheen is a distinguished policy fellow at London School of Economics, and the incoming executive director of Tax Justice UKExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionNigel FarageReform UKTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

This is not how to avert a famineJames Elder is Unicef’s global spokespersonTue 24 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTFirst published on Fri 20 Jun 2025 07.38 EDTShareAbed Al Rahman, just a boy, carried the weight of his family’s hunger as he stepped into the streets ofGazain search of bread. He had his father’s money, but when he saw the tide of people pushing towards a food distribution site in Rafah, hunger pulled him into their flow.Almost immediately, the site descended into chaos. Gunfire. Drones. Then in a flash, shrapnel from a tank shell ripped through his little body. When I met him at a hospital in Khan Younis – where painkillers, like food, are scarce – the 13-year-old was in agony. “I have shrapnel inside my body that they couldn’t remove,” he told me. “I am in real pain; since 6am I have been asking for a painkiller.” As he recounted the chaos, his father’s composure shattered, and tears rolled down his face. Was he going to lose his son simply because Abed Al Rahman wanted his family to eat?Abed Al Rahman had been trying to get food from a new private and militarised distribution site in Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is funnelling aid through a handful of southern sites guarded by private contractors and Israeli soldiers. With so few distribution points, those who can make the trek are forced to travel long, dangerous distances – risking their lives for grossly inadequate amounts of supplies.In the first week of the GHF’s operation, there werefive mass-casualty eventsin the vicinity of distribution sites as desperate civilians were met by gun and tank fire. Children have been killed. The UN’s aid chief,Tom Fletcher, saidthe sites made “starvation a bargaining chip” and were “a fig leaf for further violence and displacement”. A system that bypasses the UN has, in fact, bypassed humanity. Indeed, politicised aid distribution is unsafe for everyone involved – last week, the GHF said eight of its local team members and volunteers had been killed.And while it’s critical that there is a focus on this lethal lack of aid for Palestinians, the daily killing and maiming of children has become an afterthought. This is my fifth mission to Gaza since the horrors of 7 October, and in all that time almost nothing has been done to stop the world’s deadliest conflict for children in recent memory. There have been more than50,000 childrenreported killed or injured in 20 months. Fifty thousand.On the same morning I met Abed Al Rahman, I spoke with 24-year-old Sheima, also hospitalised. She, too, went to one of the GHF distribution sites. Different day, same story: her family was denied humanitarian aid for months. Consumed by hunger, her father too sick to travel, Sheima reached a site. Again, gunfire. Boxes of food thrown to the dirt. “I saw dead bodies on the ground,” she told me. “People stepping over them, just trying to get some food.” In the mayhem, Sheima became entangled in wire – her leg and arm torn open as she tried to flee. She didn’t get any food. “Even though I almost died, I would go again,” she said. “I’m the eldest in my family – we need food to survive. I wish to die with a full stomach, not from starvation.”These raw testimonials reinforce two critical questions. First, when UN and international non-governmental organisations warehouses outside Gaza are jam-packed with lifesaving supplies, why is there still a lethal lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza? And second, will these few sites run by private contractors solve the crisis?On the first point, after a total blockade on all supplies going into Gaza from early March until 19 May, Unicef and the World Food Programme are now permitted to bring in limited quantities of only a few selected items. Meanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classificationwarned last monththat all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza are facing life-threatening food insecurity. Lack of access to clean water has been pushed to lethal levels.Amid incessant bombardments, drastic aid restrictions and mass displacement of the civilian population, the risk of famine is not just possible, but increasingly likely for families in Gaza. From the end of the ceasefire to May this year, malnutrition admissions among children aged under fivesurged by nearly 150%, with a steep rise in severe cases. This isn’t just a trend – it’s an urgent warning.And to the second question, can the GHF prevent famine? The reality is, far too little aid is being distributed from far too few distribution points, all amid concerns that families travelling from northern Gaza to reach sites in the south will not be allowed to return.This is not how you avert famine. Before the collapse of the most recent ceasefire, the UN operated a highly effective aid delivery system in Gaza. And during the ceasefire, we were delivering assistance from more than 400 distribution points across the territory. Access to food, safe water, medicines and shelter skyrocketed. Unicef even went door-to-door to reach malnourished children.Unicef continues to call for a ceasefire, protection of children, the release of hostages and full aid access. We know what it takes to deliver for children in emergencies – it is the same in every crisis and every conflict since the second world war. Children need nutritious food at scale, safety, clean water and dignity. Not security operators. Not indiscriminate fire. Not chaos.There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We delivered aid at scale during the ceasefire, and we can do it again. We just need to be allowed to do our jobs.Abed Al Rahman died of his injuries on 17 June 2025, after this article was written.James Elder is Unicef’s global spokespersonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What I’m more sceptical about is the ‘No amount of alcohol is safe for you’ messaging ...Tue 24 Jun 2025 10.08 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.04 EDTShareYou’re going to want to sit down with a big glass of water for this one, because I’m afraid I have some bad news. Here we go: alcohol is not terribly good for you. Shocker, right? You’ve probably never heard anything like this before in your life. No doubt, you’ve been choking down a glass of pinot with dinner whenever you can stomach it because you thought it was good for your cholesterol. Instead, it is elevating your risk of cancer.If public health experts have their way, the fact that alcohol is carcinogenic is going to be very hard for British drinkers to ignore. Dozens of medical and health organisationsrecently wrote to Keir Starmerurging the prime minister to force companies to include “bold and unambiguous” labels on booze bottles, warning that alcohol causes cancer.Currently only abouta quarter of countriesrequire any sort of health warnings on alcohol and these are generally vague and in small print. However, there are growing calls for more aggressive messaging. In 2016, South Korea mandated a number ofwarning labelsfor alcohol, including one that specified links to liver cancer. (Manufacturers can choose which label to use, and don’t need to use the one linked to cancer.) In 2023, meanwhile,Ireland signed a law(which comes into effect next year) that made it the first country to mandate warning labels specifying a direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.The US has been mulling a similar move: Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general under Joe Biden,called for alcohol warningsin areportpublished in January. Might Donald Trump’s current nominee for surgeon general, Casey Means (a wellness influencer who doesn’t have an active medical licence), carry out these recommendations? Possibly. She’s beenoutspokenabout the harms of alcohol, albeit in an idiosyncratic way. “When I’m off my healthy habits, and drinking regularly, it feels like the mystical realm is harder for me to access,” Meanswrote in an old blog postabout her dry January efforts.“I so eagerly want to thin that veil between me and the spiritual dimension,” she added, “so for me, I think alcohol needs to take a lesser role in my life.” Warning: alcohol may give you cancer and also throw your chakras out of balance.While it may be a little paternalistic, I think putting more explicit warning labels on alcohol is a sensible move. Yes, we all know that alcohol is bad for us, but knowing something in the abstract is very different from being reminded about specific risks at the point of consumption. And while few people labour under the delusion that alcohol is a health product, there is evidence that a lot of peopledon’t understandthe risks involved with even relatively small amounts. There are certainly a lot of things I wish I had known about alcohol early on in my drinking life, including the fact that you might not necessarily haveany symptoms of liver damageuntil you are in serious trouble. I am not fully retired from drinking now but, like a lot of people,I’m “sober curious”.All that said, I am sceptical about the efficacy of the “No amount of alcohol is safe for you” messaging put out by the World Health Organization in 2023. Messaging that absolutist can be easy to ignore or can be used to justify binge-drinking. After all, if no amount of alcohol is good for you, then what’s the point of stopping at one?Some expertshave also argued that the “Every drop is evil” messaging lacks nuance and cherrypicks data. “The data do not justify sweeping statements about the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on human health,”two researchers fromthe Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health said in an opinion piece last year.In 2018,David Spiegelhalter, a British expert in the public understanding of risk, similarly noted that the public should be given more detail on thedegreeto which low-level alcohol use actually increases your risk of cancer. He added: “Claiming there is no ‘safe’ level [for drinking] does not seem an argument for abstention. There is no safe level of driving, but government do not recommend that people avoid driving. Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.” He’s quite right about that last bit, I’m afraid: recent research shows that life comes with a 100% risk of death. A sobering statistic if ever there was one.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAlcoholOpinionHealthHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

But in a society where pay has stagnated, support for more strikes is waningTue 24 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 10.53 EDTShare“Because you’re worth it,” goes the ad. But knowing who is worth what is even harder to determine than it was half a century ago. So as doctorsvote in a strike ballot, how will the public weigh up their just reward?Some 50,000 resident doctors – formerly known as junior doctors – are deciding whether to walk out again in England. Their year-and-a-half-long series of strikes ended with Wes Streeting agreeing a 22.3% pay rise over two years. Now their seniors, hospital consultants, are about to vote on striking toreclaim the 26%the British Medical Association (BMA) says their pay has fallen by since 2008.The public backed striking doctors last year despite the1.3m healthcare appointments lost, which cost the NHS £1.5bn. Beyond pay, that was a protest against a government that had stripped the NHS bare: public satisfaction with the health service was at a peak in 2010 but by last year it hadfallen to its lowestsince records began. There was a strong sense among staff and the public that this was about defending the state of the service.Would doctors get that public backing now? YouGov finds48% opposedto further strike action, with 39% of voters in favour. Times have changed: the NHS wasthe big gainerin this month’s spending review, with extra funding designed to cut waiting times and increase GP appointments, though it is still under intense strain. Senior medics, including the former president of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Clare Gerada, wrote aletter to the Guardianimploring doctors not to strike again. “The NHS is at a more perilous state than at any time in our careers,” they wrote. “A doctors’ strike would further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver, and play into the hands of those who don’t believe in an NHS that is publicly funded and based on need not want.” Streeting has just awarded resident doctors an average pay rise of5.4%, more than the rest of the NHS.Here’s the issue: despite last year’s good post-strike rise, the BMA says resident doctors’ pay has fallen by 23% in real terms since 2008, and they intend to get it back,as do theteachers, whose pay has fallen behind like all the public sector. This is a poorer country, with growth practically stagnant, battered like the rest by world events but uniquely stricken by Brexit too. Public and private sector pay hasfallen over the past few years, despite a slight uptick recently. This people know instinctively from how far their money doesn’t go: had pay kept growing at pre-financial crash rates, public pay would be 56% higher and the private sector would be 40% better off. These stark figures underlie deep social discontent and distrust of government. No wonder unions strive to bring back better times, calling the doctors’ pay offer “derisory” and “insulting”.Well, is it? Full Fact’s reliable analysis shows foundation year doctors get a£38,831 basic salarywhile the most qualified resident doctors – 48% of them – get £73,992: the salient fact is many of these doctors will become consultants whose earningsescalate to more than £100,000 a year.Is that a lot or not? What you think depends on what you earn, but very few understand where they stand on the scale. Keep focusing here on a string of numbers, because they are the way we live now. Median pay is£37,430, with half earning more and half earning less. When aggregated across a year, the minimum wagehas just risento £25,396.80. To enterthe top 10%of earners you must have a salary of more than £65,000. Estimates vary, but about£180,000 is the thresholdfor entering the top 1%.It may be no comfort to public sector employees that theprime minister’s salaryhas sharply fallen behind. His £172,153 pay, not quite within the top 1%, should be £305,770 had it kept up with inflation since 2009. Using the PM’s pay as a comparator – as anti-public-sector rightwingers do to castigate any public servants earning more – makes little sense: someheadteachersrunning multi-academy trusts can reach £300,000, as can CEOs of large city councils.Are those sums a lot? They are peanuts compared with private sector high-flyers. The opaquely funded TaxPayers’ Alliance has a “public sector rich list” that fails to make comparisons with private top pay. Six-figure earners in the public sphere, running a large school or hospital, have a far more complex task than company CEOs earning millions for single-performance indicators: the bottom line and the share price. New research from the High Pay Centre, funded by the Aberdeen Financial Fairness Trust, just reported that the median FTSE 100 CEO pay is 78 times greater than their median employee’s pay.Tesco’s CEOon £9.23m makes 431 times more than a median Tesco worker. It’s been six years since revealing these pay ratiosbecame mandatoryfor large listed companies, but high hopes have been dashed becauseit has changed nothing: exposing gigantic inequality has not shamed boardrooms into reconsidering their values on pay.“Fair pay” is a slippery concept. Fair pay agreements for every sector are government policy, starting experimentally with social care, for employers and unions to agree legally binding minimum rates and conditions affordable in their industry. They reflect the old wages councils devised by Winston Churchill to protect “sweated labour”, which were later abolished by Margaret Thatcher. When she disempowered unions, workers’ pay fell while the top pay, off the leash, shot up stratospherically, where it remains.In the light of all that grotesque distortion of worth, doctors and other valued public servants deserve high rewards. But in the everyday world where growth and pay have long stagnated, people seeing resident doctors’ significant pay rise last July may resent them striking again, this time against anNHSat last struggling to its feet.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionNHSEnglandHealthIndustrial actionWes StreetingPaycommentShareReuse this content"

Or perhaps not. Within hours, he had attacked both Israel and Iran forbreaking the dealhe took credit for, though there seemed to be a precarious peace. But the volatility of events owes much to the unpredictability of Mr Trump’s own rhetoric and actions. The Middle East crisis will continue to overshadow the Nato summit in The Hague, intended toshore up support for Ukraine.It is just over two weeks since Mr Trump told Israel’s prime minister not to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, hoping for a deal with Tehran. Benjamin Netanyahu ignored him – and within hours,as Fox News celebratedthe Israeli offensive, the president sought to associate himself with it. He demanded Iran’s unconditional surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; then, last Thursday, said he would take two weeks to decide whether to strike.That appears to have been deliberate misdirection: the US military bombed nuclear facilities only days later. But even among administration officials, allies and Pentagon staff, there was reportedly confusion over what he envisaged. Senior administration figures suggested that the US was solely targeting the nuclear programme, hours before Mr Trump again mooted regime change. Then, on Monday, he announced a “complete and total ceasefire”. That its termsremain mysteriousdoes not inspire confidence in its durability. Within hours, a visibly angry president was lashing out at both Israel and Iran for breaking the truce, telling reporters: “They don’t know what the fuck they are doing.”Pot, meet kettle. Mr Trump is a creature of impulse, eager for quick results and lavish praise, reacting to the latest talking head and the last person to speak to him – among them, on Tuesday,Vladimir Putin, though the US president said he had declined Moscow’s help with Iran. He also posted that it was his “great honour” to make it possible for China to still buy oil from Iran. His focus on Moscow and Beijing is one constant in what one might generously describe as his foreign policy. But even the knowns – support for Israel, a desire to keep inflation down and avoid foreign quagmires, the longing fora Nobel peace prize– are buffeted by events and the president’s magnetic attraction to whatever looks like it might bring glory.Mr Netanyahu shares Mr Trump’s focus on how decisions affect personal political interests; there are reports hemay call a snap electionwhile riding high from the offensive against Iran. He has been consistent in his enmity towards Tehran and in maintaining that it cannot be dealt with through negotiation. He is keen to keep international attention away from Gaza, where the carnage continues, and may seek to tempt Mr Trump into further action. The whereabouts of Iran’s enriched uranium is unknown, and it surely has greater reason to desire a nuclear deterrent.Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” was that adversaries might back down if they believed that the US president was truly crazy. International relations scholars disagree over the value of such stratagems. But Nixon’s play had at least been gamed out, was persistently pursued, and had clear goals. Mr Trump’s illegal attack onIranwas a reckless gamble, which history will judge. Monday’s ceasefire declaration was welcome. Diplomacy, not war, is needed. But the Trump approach remains chaotic. And as the president’s intentions and messages proliferate, the risks multiply.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But these over-hasty cuts will increase poverty, not employmentTue 24 Jun 2025 14.09 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 18.21 EDTShareThe outcome of the standoff between the government and more than 100 of its own backbenchers regardingnext week’s benefit reform voteis uncertain. Either the prime minister’s team will persuade enough MPs to pass the bill, or they won’t. A third option is some kind of compromise. But whatever happens next, thecampaign behind the “reasoned amendment”that could scupper the cuts, if the rebels hold their nerve, has dealt a blow to the authority of Downing Street and the Treasury. The MPs, including a group of select committee chairs, are right to resist the predicted damage to their constituencies and condemn the lack of consultation.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, continues to promote her disability benefits bill with a barrage of statistics. Headline figures such as the £20bn rise in the disability benefit bill since the pandemic, and the fact that employment has not bounced back as in other countries, are undoubtedly concerning. Something has gone wrong with a system in which one in 10 working-age adults relies on sickness or disability payments. It is right to be troubled by the rise inyoung adultson benefits due to mental illnesses.But the government’s critics do not deny any of this. There is broad acceptance that thesystem’s rising costsare problematic – if far from the national emergency that is portrayed by those opposed to welfare spending on principle. After an extremely rocky start, universal credit is now bedded in. But other Conservative changes have been revealed as fundamentally flawed. One problem was the policy of holding down the standard rate of unemployment benefit, which fell so farbelow an adequate standard of livingthat people who might not have claimed the health top-up were incentivised to do so. Another issue is the removal of financial support from people preparing for work. This appears to have had theunintended consequenceof disincentivising recovery.Raising the standard rate, as Labour intends, isan important steptowards a more balanced system. Investment in employment support, and the “right to try” a job, are constructive approaches to the rise in long-term sickness. But other measures in this over-hasty bill seem certain to bring immiseration to parts of the country that are least equipped to manage it. The government’s own impact assessment says the bill will push 250,000 more people into poverty – a disgraceful statistic in a starkly unequal country.Higher thresholds for personal independence payments, which are expected to save £5bn and reduce claims by around 800,000 by 2030, are causing panic in vulnerable households. Among the latest warnings is one from charities thatdisabled women will lose outdue to their higher personal care needs, including coping with menstruation, not being taken into account. Yet so far, the only concession from ministers has been an extension in the transition period for those losing benefits.No wonder thatLabourMPs have had enough. Some of those who entered parliament less than a year ago must wonder what on earth they are doing. The “reasoned amendment” may be an arcane piece of parliamentary terminology. But what could be more reasonable than raising the alarm about a policy that is predicted to cause rising poverty, before ministers or MPs have had sight of three separate reviews of the context and consequences?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Truth is I’ve thought the same way myself. India scored five centuries, their fielders dropped six catches, and missed two other opportunities besides. Their best bowler took an important wicket off what turned out to be a no-ball; Chris Woakes, the man leading England’s attack managed one wicket in the match; Josh Tongue, their big strapping quick, only dismissed one member of the opposition’s top six, and that was when he had already scored a hundred runs, and Shoaib Bashir gave up the large part of 200 runs. Oh, and England put the opposition in, and conceded the best part of 500.And at the end of it all, they won. And this time the No 11 didn’t even have to bat. It was a match which they might well have lost. Maybe they should have. But it was also a match which any number of England sides before them wouldn’t even have tried to win. In the first 142 years of Test cricket England scored over 300 runs in the fourth innings to win a Test exactly three times, and in the past six years of Test cricket England have scored over 300 runs in the fourth innings to win a Test exactly three times, once whenBen Stokes scored his 135 here to beat Australia, and now twice when he’s been captain.England stun India in first Test after Duckett inspires remarkable final-day chaseRead moreFor Stokes, the odds are just the numbers in between the evens. Englandnever even admitted the possibilitythat this game might be heading any other way. People sometimes ask what a player needs to do to get dropped from this squad. Maybe the answer is that they’d need to talk about whether they ought to play for a draw in a team meeting. On Monday night the players, and coaches, recoiled from the mere idea that they might have to consider it. They carried that ringing sense of conviction into the day’s play.Long passages of the morning seemed to be taking place in a dream. Headingley had been wrapped in a cloud, and the city around the ground was lost from view, the lights were on, so it was bright enough despite the gloomy mood, and while it drizzled all through the morning no one seemed to think it was wet enough to stop the game. In the middle, England’s openers made the enormously difficult job of batting in such difficult conditions seem so uncannily easy that the first three hours of play passed like one of those Norwegian slow TV shows that consist of a live feed from the driver’s carriage on the 9.15am from Oslo to Bergen.By the time everyone snapped out of it, roundabout the moment Shardul Thakur took two wickets in two balls in the mid-afternoon, England needed only another 118 runs, and had enough batting to come that the odd wobbles they suffered along the way barely raised the spectators’ heart rates. It was, by England’s standards, one of the more humdrum stunning victories, a quotidian bit of fourth-innings-delivery work. They made the improbable seem inevitable. When it was done, and Jamie Smith had belted the winning runs out over midwicket, all the criticism that came their way over the first four days seemed a bit beside the point.View image in fullscreenJamie Smith and Joe Root after victory was complete.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAEven so, you just know that there will be no end of people who want to tell Stokes “I told you so”. Their play in this game was a refined version of the way this team used to go about it; more cautious, for sure, and more willing to allow that there are moments in every match when batters need to dig in against a team bowling as well as India did at points in this fourth innings.But English cricket still seems to be full of people trying to wrap their heads around it, who say they arestaggered by his big decisions, who want to castigate his batters for getting caught on the boundary trying to hit a second six, like Smith did in the first innings, or give Stokes stick for getting caught playing a reverse sweep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Improving side will hope to prove they are more than a one-woman teamByWim ConingsTue 24 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 19.10 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewThe year started with a big surprise and shake-up of the national team setup with the longtime coach Ives Serneels sacked after 14 years in the post. He had taken Belgium to Euro 2025 but the playoff wins against Greece and Ukraine were unconvincing and made the Belgian FA wonder if the team was still improving under him.The answer was no and in came Elísabet Gunnarsdóttir and under her the team finished third in an extremely tough Nations League group made up of Spain, England and Portugal. She moved to a 5-4-1 out of possession and is trying to make Belgium a team that thrives on quick transitions. In the striker Tessa Wullaert and the right wing-back Jill Janssens Belgium have two fast players who are good at running in behind the defence.In attack the 5-4-1 switches to a rather adventurous 3-4-3 with the left wing-back Davina Philtjens joining midfield, Janssens joining the attack and Hannah Eurlings leaving her inverted position in midfield to become a left-winger.During the short international breaks, Gunnarsdóttir and her team have focused on what happens in both penalty areas and at set pieces. There is still work to be done in possession, though. “In the weeks before Euro 2025, all the focus will be on our buildup play,” she said. “We still have to improve a lot there.”During the Nations League campaign, Belgium often panicked slightly when they had the ball, especially when building from the back. However, they picked up six out of a possible nine points from their final three games against England, Spain and Portugal, includinga notable winagainst the reigning European champions. That helped increase the interest around the team and in May, against Spain, a record crowd of 8,054 showed up.Three players – Saar Janssen, Laura De Neve and Féli Delacauw – will all miss the tournament with serious knee injuries and Sari Kees, normally a rock in defence, has had her own injury problems but made the final squad.The most recent friendly, against France, ended with a rather chastening 5-0 defeat. “The first half was the most disappointing 45 minutes we have played since I took over,” Gunnarsdóttir said. “I take full responsibility. I had my team train a full week on specific patterns in possession that I would like to see against Italy [their first game at Euro 2025], but in doing so I failed to prepare them for this friendly.”BelgiumThe coachElísabet Gunnarsdóttiris enjoying her first months at the helm of a national team after a remarkable 14-year-spell in charge of the Swedish side Kristianstads. The 48-year-old Icelandic coach has lived so long in Sweden that she now considers it home: she is a fluent Swedish speaker and has gained citizenship.She took a year out in 2024 to look after her mother, who had suffered a stroke, and decided to take the Belgium job after a long walk on the beach. Part of the reason? Her dog had run off and straight into the arms of a Belgian couple – as good a sign as any that she should take the job. Gunnarsdóttir is a tactically impressive coach who puts a lot of emphasis on set pieces.Star playerFew countries will have such a standout player as Belgium. The 32-year-old Inter strikerTessa Wullaertis the country’s record scorer, having found the net 92 times and is not slowing down: recently scoring against Spain, England (twice) and Portugal (twice). She normally has two defenders marking her but if she feels she is not getting involved enough she will drop deeper into midfield and start play from there. Any team that can keep her out of the game will either draw or beat Belgium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Attendances are low and, as an example, ballgirls or boys are often not present at games so the players have to go and get the ball themselves.

Only six of the 23 players selected for the Euros play at home.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandReaching the knockout phase.

Everyone wants to play with the best. Hopefully … we’ll see.” Barcelona’s sporting director, Deco, told the Catalan radio station RAC1 in May that the club like Rashford.Rashford added on the podcast: “It’s difficult to put into words what [Lamine Yamal] is doing because he’s not supposed to be doing that at 16 or 17. I don’t think we’ve seen that before. Spain is nice, and it’s not too far from home.”Rashford, who spent the second half of this season on loan at Aston Villa, is one of United’s highest paid players, earning around £370,000 a week. While United would ideally want a loan fee they may be forced to accept a deal that involves Barça paying a proportion of his salary.Jadon Sancho, another of United’s wingers, is being monitored by Fenerbahce.

You go from despising people to having coffee’: Dan Sheehan on Lions magicIrish hooker on forging alliances with sworn enemies and the challenge of getting ‘four different nations connected’Robert Kitsonin PerthTue 24 Jun 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.01 EDTShareThe best way to sum up the unique dynamic of a British & Irish Lions tour is to consult a player experiencing it for the first time. “It’s mad how fast you can go from despising people to hanging around to go for a coffee with them,” says Ireland’s straight-talking hooker Dan Sheehan, admitting he had not been expecting to bond instantly with his new English mate Ellis Genge. “He’s definitely someone that surprises you that he’s not a dickhead.”Welcome to the psychological maze that is the first week of a Lions tour on the other side of the world. Dealing with jet lag is the easy part. Even for top players like the 26-year-old Sheehan, a probable Test starter, the need to rub shoulders – often literally – with previously sworn enemies and forging unlikely alliances is a challenge in itself. “Genge would be a good one. He’s obviously a passionate, animated player for England and someone who we would consider, in an Irish jersey, as a talisman and someone we’d need to target.Beale picks out Lions’ ‘danger man’ Russell as biggest threat to AustraliaRead more“But that’s been one of the most enjoyable parts, just getting to know new people. We’ve got on very well. It’s probably just that rugby blokes are good blokes. You can turn on the hatred when you want it. [But] our team social after the admin day in Dublin broke the ice. There’s no awkward moments any more, you get past the small chat. You’re going to get to understand people’s stories and what’s behind them. And he [Genge] is a funny bloke off the pitch. I think everyone loves his energy and humour. You can see the passion he brings to meetings. He’s very real and says it how it is.”The next performance-enhancing trick is to find a roommate who – how to put this politely? – snores less loudly than Pierre Schoeman. “I’m with Sione Tuipulotu now so I’m happier,” confides a relieved Sheehan. “Pierre was snoring his head off … I was just pretending I was sleeping in the morning! I had a good sleep last night with Sione.”Along with a few bonding beers – “All the forced fun can be a bit tedious at times; sometimes you just need to break it down” – the other prerequisite is understanding that a Lions tour develops at 100mph. Making a good early impression is crucial, regardless of what Sheehan might have done this year for Ireland andLeinstersince returning from injury. “Sometimes it is tricky jumping between green, blue and now red. I suppose it’s just about being present. Hopefully I’ll get a chance this week to show why I was picked, put my best step forward and do what’s best for the team. Sometimes if you haven’t played yet you feel like a bit of an impostor.”View image in fullscreenEllis Genge (left) watches his newfound friend Dan Sheehan head a football as the Lions train in Perth.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockMost would argue that, on the contrary, Sheehan is the real deal: a mobile yet forceful forward precision-engineered for the modern game who has scored 15 tries in his 32 Tests. Simon Easterby, the Lions forwards coach, reckons the Leinster hooker could also do a job in the back row, or in midfield where Ben Earl has operated at times for England. There is a part of Sheehan that likes the idea. “I’d like to back my skill set and what I can do but, in an international setup, would I be good enough? I have no idea. I would like to think I could give it a lash.”Either way he is looking to follow in the footsteps of Keith Wood and Shane Byrne as an Irish Test Lions hooker, though he must be the first to have spent part of his childhood in Romania. Sheehan’s father was working in beer sales for Heineken and the family – Dan is one of four siblings – spent three years in the country. The kids were enrolled at an American school in Bucharest, playing everything from baseball and basketball to volleyball and badminton. “That definitely impacted my skill set,” suggests Sheehan, who is also a single-figure handicapper at golf. “My parents were big on just giving anything a go.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be a shame if I constricted that into a traditional tight-five hooker style of play.” He also has a keen sense of what the head coach, Andy Farrell, will want to see against Western Force on Saturday following last week’s unscheduleddefeat by Argentina in Dublin.“It’s definitely about getting the four different nations connected. Test rugby is so detailed, every inch of the game we play today is so hyper-detailed that it’s tricky to do in two weeks. You probably saw that in Dublin. There’s so much talent in the room and how we get it on to the pitch is the main challenge of the tour. Hopefully we’ll now see an improvement every Saturday and Wednesday.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Rugby unionLeinsterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I want to thank the crowd for getting me through some really sticky moments,” the former US Open champion said in her on-court interview. “It really meant a lot to me and I’m really proud of how I fought back after losing the first set. I’m very, very happy to come through that.“It was tough, it was up and down, but from the middle of the second set I think I found another gear and another level.”Earlier, Harriet Dart had two match points on serve but slipped to an agonising defeat to the reigning Wimbledon champion, Barbora Krejcikova. After two suspensions of play in the opening set due to wet weather, Dart moved to the verge of one of the greatest wins of her career.But Krejcikova, whodefeated Jasmine Paoliniin last year’s Wimbledon final, survived a first-round shock by hitting back to progress 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-5 in two hours and 40 minutes.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Harriet Dart let two match points slip against Barbora Krejcikova.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe second seed will face another Briton in round two following Jodie Burrage’s 6-3, 6-2 win over Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima.Dart did little to hide her frustration at failing to capitalise on the pair of match-clinching opportunities againstthe 2021 French Open champion, letting out a piercing scream as the following game slipped away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After leading England Under-21s to theirfirst European titlein a generation in 2023, the former Everton midfielder finds himself back in the semi-finals on ­Wednesday evening having spentalmost six months in interim charge of the senior side.“I was actually thinking about this the other day and how fast things have moved,” said Carsley as ­England prepare to face the Netherlands. “I definitely need a bit of reflection time, but it’s been so exciting. It put us backwards a little bit in terms of coming back to the 21s, in terms of the amount of monitoring that we would have been doing with the players, missing out on the three camps, which obviously I’ve done with the senior team.Elliot Anderson finishes off Spain as England Under-21s reach Euros’ last fourRead more“But I wouldn’t have changed it. It was such a privilege to do. But again, I feel like I’m in a really good position now as well to potentially take the team into another final, which they fully deserve to be part of.”It is no secret that Carsley feels much more comfortable away from the media spotlight but he seemed at home in the national stadium in Slovakia’s capital discussing ­England’s chances of emulating Dave Sexton’s sides of 1982 and 1984 by winning successive titles at this level.The team’s progress during this tournament has improved Carsley’s reputation given they arrived in Slovakia without their first-choice striker Liam Delap and the key ­midfielders Adam Wharton and Jobe Bellingham, not to mention seven members of Thomas Tuchel’s most recent senior squad who were eligible.With only Harvey Elliott and the impressive Toulouse centre-back Charlie Cresswell ­remaining from the triumph in Georgia, this group does not have the same quality as the one from two years ago yet defeated the pre-tournament favourites, Spain, in the quarter-finals thanks to their best performance so far.“The skill of a coach is making sure you get the best out of the players that you’ve got in front of you, not trying to make them something that they’re not,” Carsley said. “I think we’ve done quite well in that.“We’ve tried to put them in positions where they can be really ­effective, whether that be with or without the ball.“Ideally, and I’ve spoken to the players about it, you want to coach a team where you’re watching the team play and you’re enjoying watching them. And that Spain game and the second half of the Germany game, you’re on the side, enjoying watching the players play and expressing themselves.“You want foreign journalists to speak about our players the way that we sometimes speak about their players in terms of their technical ability or the way that they can take the ball. I think we’re definitely changing that perception of English players.”Bournemouth’s Alex Scott is one of those who have stepped up having won the European title at under-19 level three years ago and he is hoping to draw on the experience of scoring the winning goal in that semi-final against Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have not reached the final since and will be without three key players owing to suspension, including the captain Ruben van Bommel, son of the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich enforcer Mark, who was sent off against Portugal in the previous round.But Carsley is wary of a squad, managed by Michael Reiziger, that includes several of the AZ team who won the Uefa Youth League in 2023, beating Real Madrid and Barcelona on the way. The temperature at kick-off is expected to exceed 35C.Carsley insisted that fear of failure from the spot is a thing of the past thanks to the influence of Gareth Southgateduring his spell as England’s senior manager. “It’s definitely something Gareth really pushed,” Carsley said. “We speak a lot about routine, almost like a golf swing where you would address the ball, take your time, think about your shot, the breathing; there’s a lot more that goes into it. But taking a penalty in a shootout is a totally different mentality. Because of the walk, you have that much thinking time to think about what you are going to do. If you change your mind, make sure you are clear and focused.”Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21sLee CarsleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Monaco, Nantes and Paris FC will face no further action.Although Lyon can still appeal against the ruling, the decision to relegate a club that won seven consecutive titles between 2001-02 and 2007-08, and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League as recently as 2020, will send shockwaves through French football.The club’s president John Textor told L’Équipe last week he was confident the club’s financial position had been resolved, having said in November there was “no chance” the club would be relegated.Textor is in the process of selling his shares in Crystal Palace, who are at risk of being denied their place in the Europa League next season as Lyon have also qualified after finishing sixth inLigue 1.A sale to Woody Johnson, owner of the NFL’s New York Jets, has been agreed but the Premier League is yet to ratify the deal and Johnson must yet pass the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test.After receiving the provisional relegation last year, Lyon sold the likes of Saïd Benrahma, Anthony Lopes and Maxence Caqueret in January, and this summer they have alreadysold Rayan Cherkito Manchester City.Explore more on these topicsLyonEuropean club footballLigue 1newsShareReuse this content"

Agreed at its AGM this month, the EFL is understood to have removed the Scottish ProfessionalFootball Leagueand Irish Football League from the list of competitions clubs are prohibited from investing in.The EFL has concerns about potential integrity issues raised by multi-club ownership, but given it is increasingly widespread it has opted to align its rules with other competitions, including the Premier League.Middlesbrough appoint Rob Edwards as head coach on three-year dealRead moreThe need for greater alignment was highlighted when Leeds’s majority owner, 49er Enterprises, entered exclusive negotiations about buying Rangers ina deal completedlast month. 49ers Enterprises paid £75m for 51% of Rangers in a transaction that would have been delayed hadLeeds not been promotedto the Premier League.The EFL declined to confirm whether it would have blocked the investment had Leeds remained in the Championship. EFL sources acknowledged the Leeds/Rangers issue, but said the changes were not made to address that situation.Under the regulations that will come into operation this coming season, owners and directors are prohibited from having interests in more than one club in the EFL, Premier League, National League, Southern League, Isthmian League and Northern Premier League. An interest is defined as holding shares in two clubs or exerting any managerial or administrative influence.In the Premier League, the Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, paid £10m for a 29% stake in Hearts this month, and Bournemouth’s owner, Bill Foley, paid £6m for 25% of Hibs last year.IFL clubs are likely to benefit from more investment offers after the rule change, with EFL sides eager to increase their options for parking European Union players. Since Brexit, EU players moving to the United Kingdom require work permits issued by the Home Office under the governing body endorsement (GBE) points-based criteria.The GBE system requires players to secure 15 points to pass, with those lacking a significant number of international appearances or not playing in one of Europe’s top five leagues often missing out.Explore more on these topicsFootball LeagueFinancesFootball politicsBusinessRangersLeeds UnitedShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have spent more than $1bn on an Albanian island that will be a luxury resort – once the unexploded ordnance has been removedByMarzio MianTue 24 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareOn Sazan, a small island off the coast ofAlbania, the landscape is Jurassic. Ferns, giant lavender, plumbago, rosemary, broom and laurels grow on the mountain at its centre. The view from the top, with its dramatic sunsets, is dizzyingly beautiful.Albanians call SazanIshulli i Trumpëve– Trump Island. Until now mostly untrammelled by development, it is on the verge of becoming a mecca for ultra-luxury tourism, another addition to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s real-estate portfolio. Speaking on theLex Fridman podcastin July 2024, Trump could barely conceal her excitement: “I’m working with my husband, we have this 1,400-acre island in the Mediterranean and we’re bringing in the best architects and the best brands,” she said. “It’s going to be extraordinary.”When I reached Kushner by phone the same month, I detected brimming enthusiasm for Sazan, which he seemed to regard as something of a treasure. He said he plans “to create the ideal resort that I’d want to be at with my family and with my friends”.Before I visited the island, I marvelled at the thought of traversing its roughly 40 miles of trails, climbing its mountains covered in rainforest and exploring its deep waterways with names such as the Bay of Paradise, Hell’s Gorge, Devil’s Gulf and Admiral’s Beach. I wanted to see it before the phrase “I’m going to Sazan” becomes the prerogative of the rich.When I got there, on a clear day in July 2024, I found that the island doesn’t lend itself to getting lost: it is covered in signs depicting skull and crossbones, warning of landmines. My guide, Arbër Celaj, a lieutenant commander in the Albanian navy, stopped me from venturing too far. He did not want to get a dressing down from his superiors.Map of Sazan in the Adriatic between Albania and ItalySazan lies between the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea, strategically positioned at the entrance to the bay of Vlorë, in the strait of Otranto that separates Italy from Albania. But as Celaj explained, “Sazan’s climate is not Mediterranean – it’s subtropical. You can see from the vegetation. The biodiversity is crazy.” Indeed, the brush seemed to have emerged from Spielberg’s computer, giving rise to a jungle of colossal ash trees, hornbeams, maritime pines and holm oaks.Unable to stray off the beaten path, I made do with glimpses of carpets of rare ferns and valleys of tall grass sloping down to turquoise waters. It was like standing at the dawn of time, watching the landscape be created. Kushner was also speechless when he first saw it in 2021, he told me: “I was just very surprised that something like that existed in the middle of the Mediterranean and hadn’t been developed.” Preliminaryapproval from the Albanian governmentfor Kushner’s project came on 30 December 2024.I last spoke to Kushner and his associate Asher Abehsera, the CEO and cofounder with Kushner of Affinity Global Development, in July 2024. Jonathan Gasthalter, the spokesperson for Affinity Partners, a Miami-based firm belonging to Kushner managing $4.6bn in assets, did not respond to multiple emails and text messages asking for comment from Kushner or Abehsera on updates to the real-estate project.Implausibly, Sazan’s environment owes a lot to communism. During its communist era, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was known as Europe’s North Korea and Sazan became a symbol of extreme isolation: an inaccessible military fortress that dictator Enver Hoxha, who feared the country would fall prey to a superpower, imagined could help defend them against an attack from Nato or members of the Warsaw Pact.For decades, soldiers stationed on the island waited for such an attack, scanning the horizon, listening for the submarine that sooner or later would emerge from the depths of the Adriatic. There was a military base on the island, with living quarters, a theatre, a school and a hospital. By the 1970s, about 150 military families lived on the island without contact with the mainland. “But they were privileged. They had food, clothing, education, appliances,” Celaj told me. The waiting only ended with the fall of the regime in 1991.Walking along a trail with my guide, we came across several bomb shelters and tunnels designed to store supplies and ammunition or act as hideouts in the event of a guerrilla war against the imperial invaders. Celaj told me there are about 10 miles of tunnels, now mostly inhabited by bats, vipers and wild rabbits. There are about 3,600 bunkers on Sazan, armoured concrete mushrooms emerging from the vegetation or perched on mountaintops like lookouts against phantom American aircraft carriers or Soviet frigates. Some will be preserved and integrated into the new real-estate project, according to Kushner.View image in fullscreenA derelict building on Sazan Island.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyI asked my guide about the signs warning of landmines. “Actually, they’re not exactly landmines,” he said. “This place is full of unexploded ordnance, there are still many areas that need to be cleared.” He pointed to a ravine on the eastern coast, where Affinity Partners wants to develop a significant part of the real-estate project that will span the entire surface of the island. “The [unexploded ordnance are] remnants of the 1990s,” Celaj went on, “when criminals attacked the island right under the noses of the military, looting the weapons and ammunition depots.” The enemy had come in the end, but in small makeshift vessels and speaking the same language as the soldiers.These days, the island is controlled by Albanian armed forces. It is patrolled by three sailors, who walk back and forth between the rusty and ramshackle docks on the gulf of San Nicolo (the port where Affinity will build the main marina for the yachts, according to Abehsera).Albania has risen to the top of some of the most prestigioustravel rankingsin recent years, largely thanks to the prime minister, Edi Rama, who has turned the country into an economic tiger of the Balkans.I asked Rama if he worried about any political complications relating to the new real-estate project. He told me his country “can’t afford not to exploit a gift like Sazan”, adding: “We need luxury tourism like a desert needs water.” He isn’t afraid of courting controversy, either, especially “if it helps draw attention and bring investment”.Rama has been “a great partner” and is very forward thinking, according to Kushner. “The government’s clearly seen that it can be something,” he told me during our conversation in July 2024. “They’re building an airport right there [in the Vlöre area].”Albania isn’t Kushner’s only target: he is also interested in Serbia, where Affinity Partners plans to turn the former defence ministry building in Belgrade into a luxury hotel. Affinity’s business broker in the region is the former US ambassador Richard Grenell, who served as Trump’s special envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations between 2019 and 2021. According to theNew York Times, while Grenell was special envoy, he pushed a related plan that Serbia and the US jointly redevelop the former defence ministry. He has since joined forces with Kushner on the new development deal, and is now a partner in Affinity. (Kushner told me it was Grenell who first suggested he invest in Albania.)View image in fullscreenThe bay of Vlorë on the mainland of Albania, opposite Sazan Island.Photograph: Nikos/AlamySerbia’s president, the opportunisticAleksandar Vučić, saw in Grenell and Kushner a chance to get close to Trump should he win reelection, according to theFinancial Times. Vučić is, in fact, playing a dangerous game: as well as cosying up to Trump’s acolytes, he has refused to impose sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. In May 2024, herolled out the red carpetfor Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose government has made major investments in new infrastructure in Serbia, Reuters reported. All the while, Vučić continues to express his desire tojoin the EUbut refuses to meet Brussels’ main condition: recognising the borders and independence of Kosovo.When I spoke to Rama, the Albanian premier, I asked what role American investment played in geopolitics. He replied that it was just business, but didn’t deny it could advance a broader political strategy. “We must keep Serbia in the western sphere and get it out from under Moscow’s thumb,” he said. In an interview with the Financial Times in July 2024,Grenell, too, said investments like the real-estate deal to take over the former defence ministry are meant tobring Serbia closerto the US.Kushner, who served as a senior adviser to Trump from 2017 to 2021, denied using his position to advance any plans to develop Sazan when we spoke in July 2024. “I never met Prime Minister Rama when I was in government,” Kushner told me. “But even if I had, it’s not a conflict of interest. People who serve in government, they build different relationships.” He claimed that interest in Serbia and Albania “is going up tremendously” as a result of his company’s real-estate deals.Negotiations with Affinity about the sale of Sazan were kept secret. Residents and parliamentarians were not aware of the $1.4bn deal until it was published in the papers.Mirela Kumbaro, Albania’s minister for tourism and the environment, defended Rama’s decision to strike a deal with Kushner’s company, which was heavily criticised by the opposition. “We can’t compete with Italy, Croatia and Greece in the mass tourism industry. We don’t have enough infrastructure or experience,” she told me. “We have to focus on quality. On value over volume. More profits and fewer problems.”Nearly 12 million foreign visitors travelled to Albania in 2024, a 15% increase on the previous year, according to local media. That’s “too many for us, and too much pollution”, Kumbaro said. “Sazan is the way to go. The ideal recipe: nature and luxury tourism.” She was enthusiastic about the project, explaining that Affinity is working closely with the government agency in charge of strategic investments, meaning those that exceed €15m.The trade-off is substantial: zero taxes during the construction phase and the state takes care of all infrastructure, including water, electricity and sewage, according to Kumbaro. Everything else – the sun, the sea, the monk seals and the subtropical jungle – is already there.View image in fullscreenAbandoned barracks on a hilltop overlooking the blue waters of Sazan Island.Photograph: Adnan Beci/AFP/Getty ImagesThat is precisely what worries environmentalists such as Olsi Nika, a marine biologist and the director of the NGO EcoAlbania. “This area is in theKaraburun-Sazan maritime national park. It means the beaches and waters within 2km (1.25 miles) of the shore are protected. What will large public works, the building of docks, yacht traffic and sewage run-off do to the place?”Abehsera, from Affinity, told me the company had hired the global sustainable development firm Arup as a consultant on the project. “Their practice is principally focused on really accentuating and respecting the local ecology and the environment,” he said.Kushner, too, had an answer at the ready. “When people announce a development, everyone gets scared,” he said in July 2024. “Everybody assumes the worst. But once they see the plans we have, the way we’re designing it, the way we’re being faithful and considerate of the environment around us, I think that people will be very, very pleased. And again, with developments, you never make everyone happy.”When I met Abehsera for lunch in Vlöre in August 2024, he gave me a preview of the plans for the island’s development. The hotel, he said, would be a “jewel on the Mediterranean”, the answer to people who ask, “What have I not seen yet?” The design of the hotel would not “impose” on nature; the buildings would be “sculpted or even scalloped by nature”. It will feel “more like you’re nestled in a beautiful tree”.I was having difficulty following. I asked him whether the island would remain accessible to normal people, to locals who want to make use of its beaches. “I think everyone should have the opportunity to visit the island,” he told me.View image in fullscreenA warning sign on a tree on Sazan Island.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesKushner was more sceptical. “We’re creating a very high-end luxury product,” he told me. “One of the most compelling points about the island is just the ability to have privacy … But I also think there are certain aspects of the island we can build out that will give people the opportunity to come visit and enjoy some of the food and the trails.”I thought back to my afternoon with Celaj. He’d told me that until a few years ago, soldiers on patrol would sometimes report seeing a little grey donkey among the wild fig trees in a clearing or in Hell’s Gorge. Then it would just disappear. I wondered if it was just a legend, or if the grey donkey died along with the mystery of the island, the last bastion of wilderness in the Mediterranean, conquered, in the end, without a single shot being fired.

He waseventually returned to the USthis month after the government secured a federal indictment accusing him of being a co-conspirator in a people-smuggling ring.Melgar-Salmeron, 31, a married father of four who lives inVirginia, is believed by relatives to be in custody in a high-security prison after he was deported despite the government having given the appeals court an “express assurance” that it would not schedule a deportation flight for him until the following day while his case was heard.In the event, Melgar-Salmeron left on a flight forEl Salvador28 minutes after the order was issued. A court filing for the government blamed “a confluence of administrative errors”.In addition to ordering the government to facilitate his return, Tuesday’s order also gave officials a week to file a “supplemental declaration from an individual with personal knowledge, addressing … the current physical location and custodial status of Petitioner; and … what steps the government will take, and when, to facilitate his return to the United States”.The court denied an application by Melgar-Salmeron’s lawyers for the appointment of a special master for the case, saying that the government counsel who had given assurance that he would not be removed “took reasonable and diligent steps to ensure removal would not occur in violation of that assurance”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also served two years in jail for illegal possession of an unregistered sawn-off shotgun before he was placed in immigration detention, according to the New York Times.His is one of four cases, along with that of Ábrego-García, of people being removed in breach of court orders.Also among the four isDaniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan, who was deported along with about 240 other men from Venezuela and taken to the Cecot facility after US authorities declared them to be members of Tren de Aragua. A Maryland court later ruled that he had been improperly removed in violation of an earlier settlement forbidding his removal while his immigration case was pending.The fourth case is that of a Guatemalan immigrant identified only as “OCG”, who was deported to Mexico, despite claiming to have been raped and kidnapped in that country.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpEl SalvadorLaw (US)VirginiaKilmar Ábrego GarcíanewsShareReuse this content"

Measles vaccination rates have fallen in 100 of 204 countries, while coverage for at least one dose against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, polio or tuberculosis has declined in 21 of 36 high-income countries – including France, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.The reversal, further exacerbated by the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, has left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases and death, the authors of the study led by the University of Washington in Seattle said.“Despite the monumental efforts of the past 50 years, progress has been far from universal,” said senior study author Dr Jonathan Mosser from the Institute forHealthMetrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “Large numbers of children remain under- and un-vaccinated.“Routine childhood vaccinations are among the most powerful and cost-effective public health interventions available, but persistent global inequalities, challenges from the Covid pandemic, and the growth of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy have all contributed to faltering immunisation progress.“These trends increase the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, polio and diphtheria, underscoring the critical need for targeted improvements to ensure that all children can benefit from lifesaving immunisations.”US experts fear all vaccines at risk as Trump officials target mRNA jabsRead moreThe findings should be taken as a clear warning that global immunisation targets for 2030 will not be met without urgent action to turn things around, researchers said.Vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks pose a growing global risk. Increasing numbers of wild-type polio cases have been reported in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and there is a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea, where less than half of the population is immunised.In 2024, there was a nearly tenfold increase in measles infections recorded in Europe. The measles outbreak in the US reached more than 1,000 confirmed cases in 30 states in May 2025, surpassing the total number of cases in 2024.The new analysis provides updated and extended global, regional and national estimates of annual routine childhood vaccination coverage from 1980 to 2023 in 204 countries and territories, using more than 1,000 data sources.The past 50 years has seen huge progress, the study shows, with a 75% drop in the number of unvaccinated zero-dose children worldwide from 58.8 million in 1980 to 14.7 million in 2019.However, this long-term progress masks recent challenges and substantial disparities. Since 2010, coverage gains slowed and, in some areas of the world, reversed.Cuts to UK’s global vaccination funding would risk avoidable child deaths, experts warnRead moreFor example, 21 of 36 high-income countries experienced declines in coverage for at least one of the recommended vaccines – including a 12% decline in first-dose measles vaccination in Argentina, and 8% and 6% declines in third-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination in Finland and Austria respectively.Persistent health inequalities and the enduring effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are key factors, but vaccine misinformation and hesitancy is the biggest new factor behind the stalling of progress.Lead author Dr Emily Haeuser, of the University of Washington, called for more concerted efforts to tackle vaccine misinformation and hesitancy.“Successful vaccination programmes are built on understanding and responding to people’s beliefs, concerns and expectations,” she said.Helen Bedford, professor of children’s health at University College London, who was not involved with the study, said the reasons for declining vaccine uptake were “numerous and complex”.Action was necessary to tackle increasing social inequity, and misinformation about vaccine safety and necessity, as well as improving public confidence in vaccination programmes, she said.“Vaccination remains one of our most powerful tools for protecting child health, but its continued success depends on sustained investment, equity, and public trust.”Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It is possible to meet our carbon budgets for 2030 and 2050, provided we take steps forward [on policy]. It’s very important that our country steps up to deliver our commitments.”Ed Miliband says Labour will ‘win fight’ against UK net zero criticsRead moreThe longstanding net zero target,put in place by the Conservative prime minister Theresa May in 2019, has come under sustained attack in recent weeksfrom Tory leader Kemi Badenochand from the Reform party.Badenoch has repeatedly called net zero “impossible” and earlier this month called for the repeal of the windfall tax on oil and gas production in the North Sea.Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, has called the target “net stupid zero” and told the Guardianhe believed Labour would quietly back down on the issue.Forster said the CCC had found that reaching net zero would not destroy the UK’s economy, contrary to some claims. “We think it will be beneficial to our economy – not instantly, but by the seventh carbon budget [from 2038] the economy will be receiving significant benefits, and we expect that to continue [to 2050],” he said, referring to previous research ahead of the assessment report published on Wednesday.Chart showing past and future emissions reductions targets by sectorThe optimistic tone of this year’s CCC progress report also stood in stark contrast to recent years, which have tended to find that government policy was way off track.A series of decisions taken by Labour in the past year, includinglifting the ban on onshore windfarmsand boosting offshore wind, have brought the UK closer to the policy framework needed to reach net zero. Some policies of the previous government are also paying offin higher uptake of heat pumpsand electric vehicles, though these are still not happening fast enough, the CCC warned.The biggest gap identified by the CCC concerns the pricing of energy. The UK’s high electricity costs are mostly owing to reliance on volatile global gas prices, but bills are made yet steeper by levies that support renewable energy and other low-carbon efforts. These disproportionately affect electricity bills, rather than gas bills, helping to make electricity artificially more expensive compared with gas.This is problematic, as switching from gas to electricity for heating, transport, industry and other purposes is vital to meeting climate targets. It also counteracts the impact of renewable energy, which should be bringing bills down.But the options for shifting the costs are unpalatable: the levies could be added to general taxation, which would mean the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, increasing the tax take; or they could be shifted to gas bills, which could disadvantage vulnerable people if social protections were not built into the system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This could mean sharing more of the costs with gas bills.Tackling Britain’s eye-watering energy costs wasa centrepiece of the government’s industrial strategy earlier this week, which promised to cut the levies faced by thousands of energy-intensive companies from 2027 to help improve economic growth.In further good news, the CCC found that tree planting had surged, particularly in Scotland, to levels not seen since the 1990s. This is not yet enough – tree planting must recover to the levels last seen in the 1970s – to meet the government’s targets, but is a marked improvement on recent trends.The government is also facing a key test of its net zero plans: in response to legal action brought by Friends of the Earth, ministers must publish this October a comprehensive national plan showing how they intend to meet the net zero targets.Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “[That plan must be] designed in a way that’s fair, so that we can bring everyone along with us in building a better future. That means ensuring polluters – not hard-working people and the most marginalised in our society – are the ones picking up the tab for climate action.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEnergyLabourShareReuse this content"

Their loss threatens to unravel ecosystems across the globe.“We face a bird extinction crisis unprecedented in modern times,” said Kerry Stewart, lead author of the research from the University of Reading, who described the headline finding of the paper as a “shocking statistic”. It is triple the number of birds that went extinct in the previous 500 years.The paper, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution,examined data from nearly 10,000 birds (almost all of those known to exist) and used IUCN data to predict extinction risk. Habitat loss – driven mainly by the expansion and intensification of agriculture – emerged as the most significant driver of species extinction.View image in fullscreenGreat bustards – reintroduced in Britain after being hunted to national extinction in the 19th century – were among those at risk, the report found.Photograph: Mike Lane/AlamyBut even if habitat loss, hunting and climate breakdown stopped today, about 250 species could still die out, as they are already teetering on the brink of extinction. Local conservation efforts may feel small but they are essential to save a species from going extinct, the researchers found. “Many birds are already so threatened that reducing human impacts alone won’t save them. These species need special recovery programmes, like breeding projects and habitat restoration, to survive,” said Stewart.Conservation success stories show it is possible to bring species back from the brink of extinction.By 1987, theCalifornia condor – North America’s largest bird – had gone extinctin the wild. There were about 22 birds in captivity, which were then bred and released; now there is a population of350 in the wild.View image in fullscreenConservation efforts have restored bittern populations in the UK, with 280 males recorded last year.Photograph: Ben Andrew/PAIn the UK, the bittern – a shy-reed-dwelling bird – went extinct as a breeding bird in the 1870s because its wetland habitat had been drained for farming. Now, thanks to habitat restoration, their population is at its highest inmore than 200 years, with more than 280 booming male bitterns recorded last year.Prof Manuela González-Suárez, senior author of the study at the University of Reading, said: “Stopping threats is not enough. As many as 250-350 species will require complementary conservation measures … to survive the next century.”Bringing back the birds: the ‘ghost woodlands’ transforming England’s barren sheep fellsRead moreThe latestState of the World’s Birds reportfound nearly half of the planet’s bird species are in decline. Habitat loss, logging, invasive species, exploitation of natural resources and climate breakdown were highlighted as the main threats.“There is no magic bullet for solving the extinction crisis,” said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International, who was not involved in the research. “Protected areas can play a key role, while abating threats from agriculture, logging, fisheries, hunting and other sources is essential. However, some species require targeted recovery efforts, involving interventions like captive breeding and release, translocation, or supplementary feeding, to overcome barriers to recovery.“This paper adds to a growing body of evidence showing that actions across the whole framework will be necessary to stop human actions from driving species extinct.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionEndangered speciesClimate crisisAnimalsWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The resulting physiological stress and sleep disturbance leads to 66,000 early deaths a year and many cases of heart disease, diabetes and depression.Thereport, from the European Environment Agency (EEA), focuses on noise from cars, trains and aeroplanes and found that 20% of the population of the European Economic Area (EEA) were affected. Separateresearch, using a slightly lower threshold for dangerous noise pollution, found that 40% of the UK population were exposed to harmful transport noise.Seventeen million people endure particularly high noise pollution – “long-term, high-annoyance” – and almost 5 million suffer “severe” sleep disturbance. Fifteen million children live in areas of harmful noise. The harm to health from noise is greater than that from higher-profile risks including secondhand tobacco smoke or lead exposure, and incurs an economic cost of almost €100bn (£86bn) a year, the analysis found.The damage to health is likely to be an underestimate, the researchers said. Using the World Health Organization’s stricter threshold for risky noise pollution gives an estimate of 150 million people across Europe exposed. The EU’s target to cut the number of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30% by 2030 will not be met without further action, the researchers said.“Noise pollution impacts our health by keeping our bodies in a constant state of fight or flight, even if we don’t consciously realise it,” said Dr Eulalia Peris at the EEA. “This can lead to harmful physiological responses such as inflammation and oxidative stress, and over time, this increases the risk of various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, obesity, cognitive impairment in children and mental health problems.”“Noise pollution is not only an annoyance,” added Peris, who has been affected herself. “My God, yes. I’m very aware of the impacts of noise pollution, and I’m very sensitive to it. It limits your life.”The report is based on data reported by EEA countries on transport noise, which is the most widespread and significant type of noise pollution. Other kinds, such as loud neighbours and music from bars, are also likely to damage health but are difficult to measure because of their intermittency.The report found 92 million people across Europe were harmed by road transport noise, 18 million by railway noise and 2.6 million by aircraft noise. Published research on the health impact of noise pollution was used to estimate an annual toll of 66,000 premature deaths, 50,000 cases of cardiovascular diseases and 22,000 cases of type 2 diabetes.The number of people in Europe affected by noise fell by only 3% between 2017 and 2022, but the researchers said numerous measures could be taken. Cutting speed limits for vehicles in urban areas and boosting the use of low-noise tyres would cut road traffic noise, they said, as would promoting public transport, walking and cycling.The increasing number of electric cars will reduce noise less than might be expected, the researchers said, because only at lower speeds are engines the key source of noise; at higher speeds, noise from the contact between tyres and the road becomes dominant. Traffic noise is also dominated by a small number of very loud vehicles.Railway noise could be cut by better maintenance of trains and track, and aircraft noise could be reduced by optimising landing and takeoff patterns and encouraging the introduction of quieter planes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One reason for this is that transport noise pollution is chronic, unlike air pollution which has peaks that lead to health alerts and raise awareness.“However, long-term impacts of noise on our health and environment are widespread and significant,” she said. “Children are also particularly vulnerable to the effects of noise, and it’s a problem all countries need to address urgently.”This article was amended on 24 June 2025. An earlier version said that the key source of noise at lower speeds is from contact between tyres and the road and not from a vehicle’s engine; in fact, it is the other way around.Explore more on these topicsPollutionEuropeRoad transportRail transport (UK news)Rail transport (World news)Air transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The rule prohibits road building and logging on all national forest land without roads, accounting for about 59m acres (24m hectares) of US national forest land.Rollins shared the news at a gathering of the Western Governors’ Association in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where hundreds had gathered outside toprotestagainst congressional efforts to sell off large swaths of public lands. There, the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, spoke of a new “era of abundance” on public lands, describingDonald Trump’s efforts to extract more natural resources for domestic manufacturing.“President Trump is removing absurd obstacles to commonsense management of our natural resources by rescinding the overly restrictive roadless rule,” said Rollins. “This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests. It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land.”Republican lawmakers from western states celebrated the announcement while environmental groups expressed dismay.On social media, the Republican representative for Alaska, Nick Begich, said: “Alaska’s forests are one of our state’s greatest natural assets and the ‘Roadless Rule’ has long stifled responsible forest management, blocked access to critical resources, and halted economic opportunity.”Logging is quietly ravaging US forests. Trump is taking an axe to protectionsRead moreThe Republican congresswoman Harriet Hageman of Wyoming also posted on social media, writing: “This outdated policy has long hindered effective forest management.”Meanwhile, the Sierra Club’s forest campaign manager, Alex Craven, said in astatement: “Once again, the Trump administration is ignoring the voices of millions of Americans to pursue a corporate giveaway for his billionaire buddies. Stripping our national forests of roadless rule protections will put close to 60m acres of wildlands across the country on the chopping block. That means polluting our clean air and drinking water sources to pad the bottom lines of timber and mining companies – all while pursuing the same kind of mismanagement that increases wildfire severity.”In its announcement, the US Department of Agriculture cited concerns about increasing wildfire risk as reasoning for constructing roads through national forest land: “Nearly 60% of forest service land in Utah is restricted from road development and is unable to be properly managed for fire risk. In Montana, it is 58%, and in Alaska’s Tongass national forest, the largest in the country, 92% is impacted.”Journalist Ben Goldfarb, author of the book Crossings: How Road Ecology Is Shaping the Future of Our Planet, questioned that logic on social media, writing: the “vast majority of firesoccurnear roads. They’re worsening risk”.The decision also aligns with Trump’s executive order “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation”, the USDA said, to “get rid of overcomplicated, burdensome barriers that hamper American business and innovation”.During the latter part of Trump’s first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS domestic policyTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those setting up tents may find it even trickier than usual, with winds strengthening during the day.“Thursday evening will see those winds taper off and make for a pleasant evening with some sunshine and cloud helping to keep things warm,” the Met Office’s spokesperson said.More gusty winds are likely on Friday – the day the main music acts begin – but there should be some sunny spells and temperatures of about 23C.There is less certainty over the weekend, although high pressure could lead to longer, drier spells and thunderstorms.“It’s also likely that there will be very warm, humid air pushing in from the south at times, potentially bringing brief hot spells and even the risk of isolated thunderstorms,” the Met Office spokesperson added.In the late 1990s and 2000s, Glastonbury became synonymous with heavy rain and muddy fields, though for some time now has avoided the chaotic scenes witnessed in years such as 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2007.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As part of the records management review process they were destroyed as they were outside of the retention period.”Kate Flannery, the secretary of theOrgreave Truth and Justice Campaign(OTJC), which has led calls for an official inquiry for a decade, said: “This is extremely disturbing news. We are now understandably worried about how many other police forces may have recently destroyed or intend to destroy important information that would be very relevant in an Orgreave inquiry or investigation.”The violence at the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire on 18 June 1984, when striking miners werecharged by police on horsebackand hit over the head by officers carrying truncheons and short shields, is remembered as the landmark confrontation of the bitter 1984-85 strike. About 8,000 miners assembled for a mass picket of the plant called by the National Union of Mineworkers, and were met by 4,500 police officers from forces nationwide, led by South Yorkshire police.A criminal prosecution of 95 miners for the offence of riot collapsed a year later after the miners’ barristersrepeatedly accused police officers of lyingand malpractice, including that an officer’s signature on a police statement had been forged.The OTJC has always pointed to the connection with the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, in which subsequent inquests found 97 peoplehad been unlawfully killedat the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest as a result of gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The force hadmounted a false narrativeto blame Liverpool supporters after the disaster, which bereaved families fought for decades to overturn.In 2016, when Yvette Cooper, now home secretary, was chair of the home affairs select committee, Northumbria police’s then chief constable, Steve Ashman, confirmed to her that the force held documents relating to the Orgreave operation. They included a superintendent’s report on an incident in which a constable was shown on television news hitting a miner with his truncheon.Northumbria police sent four units, 92 officers in total, to South Yorkshire, Ashman said, and the superintendent had outlined “the management and logistics” associated with their work, including a timetable of the day at Orgreave starting at 4.50am.One of the OTJC’s key aims has long been to see police planning documents to see if the violent policing was predetermined or a response to initial stone-throwing by miners, as the police alleged at the time.Diviney said: “As a historian, I’m mortified that Northumbria police would destroy evidence that is of vital importance to an inquiry. I’m saddened for the miners and their families who have waited too long for truth and justice.“It illustrates inherent problems with the police being custodians of their own evidence. And it’s another reason to hurry up with an inquiry.”A Northumbria police spokesperson said: “We can confirm two boxes containing data in relation to the miners’ strike were disposed of in April 2024 following a formal review, retain or disposal process in line with force policy and the Data Protection Act 2018.”Labour has promised an Orgreave inquiry since the 2017 general election, and pledged in its 2024 manifesto to “ensure, through an investigation or inquiry, that the truth about the events at Orgreave comes to light”.Cooper wrote to the OTJC this month before the 41st anniversary of the Orgreave events, saying she was continuing to consider “the scope and format of an investigation or inquiry”, and that “my officials are working at pace”.Explore more on these topicsThe miners' strike 1984-85PoliceNorthumberlandEnglandPolitics pastNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Everything is on the table. We are considering, we are talking with the relevant parties.”Zhang said the company had taken 2% of the UK electric vehicle market since the company launched in 75 showrooms in the UK in September, and the curiosity of British drivers was translating into sales – including what he claimed was a “super” hybrid car with capacity for 90 miles on drive-generated energy.“The UK market is quite open. 40% of customers say they are willing to consider Chinese brands,” he said.Chinese manufacturers are intensifying their export efforts in the UK and in the EU in the face of prohibitive tariffs imposed by Donald Trump in the US.Geely Auto has invested more than£3bn in the British sports car maker Lotus, and another Chinese EV battery firm, EVE Energy, is intalks to invest more than £1bnto build a giant new factory on the outskirts ofCoventry.They are also investing in factories in the EU to avoid tariffs imposed on EV imports by Brussels last summer.Rival Chinese firm BYD is building its first assembly plant in the EU in Hungary, and Omoda has sealed a joint venture plant with Spanish carmaker Ebro, south of Barcelona.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it is still four times the tariff rate on car imports from the UK that applied before Trump’s “liberation day” in April.A 10% tariff on general imports from the UK still applies, as does a 25% tariff on UK steel. Reynolds has said he is “fighting” to get these eliminated.“I’m fighting quite hard to make sure we are included [in a steel tariff exemption],” he said. “I believe it’s possible [to strike a deal] on the reciprocal tariffs, the so-called 10%, so there’s still a lot of work going on on that.”Sherard Cowper-Coles, chair of the China-Britain business council and a former diplomat, told the conference that the UK was stepping up its engagement withChinaand Chinese investors were actively looking for opportunities in the UK “because of Trump”.He claimed that the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, would “visit China in the middle of next month to prepare for a visit by the prime minister” and that Reynolds would go to the joint economic and trade commission in September.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryChinaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsManufacturing sectorAsia PacificEuropeInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

In the closing days of the campaign, groups supporting Cuomo have pumped millions of dollars into attacking Mamdani through TV ads and mailouts, portraying Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as a “dangerous choice for mayor”.Money has been one of Cuomo’s biggest assets in the primary, which he entered in March this year. Fix the City, an organization supporting Cuomo’s bid, has raised about $20m – the most raised by any Super Pac in New York City history, theNew York Times reported– including $5m from the billionaire former mayor Michael Bloomberg.Other backers includedonors typically known for donating to Republicans, including John B Hess, the billionaire oil company CEO; Ken Langone, the billionaire Home Depot co-founder, andBill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager and Donald Trump supporter.It’s an atypical list of supporters for a Democratic candidate, and one that has drawn attention from Cuomo’s rivals.“Our city is under attack by an authoritarian Trump administration. And it is under an attack that is now being echoed by Trump’s allies right here in New York City,” Mamdani said during a debate in early June.“We deserve to have a mayor who is not funded by the same billionaires that put Donald Trump in DC. We deserve to have a mayor who will actually fight back.”Cuomo’s response to criticism has been to largely try to stay out of the spotlight. Mamdani has held rallies attended by thousands of people, but Cuomo has kept his campaigning small and private, likethe intimate event at a trade union in Maywhere he pledged to raise the minimum wage to $20/hr in the next two years.Instead, Cuomo appears to be relying more on name recognition, his lengthy record of government experience, and those ads. His campaign and supporting groups repeat similar messages: Cuomo “delivered as governor”, and will bring crime down and build affordable housing.“We’re not talkers, we are doers. We get the job done. And we’re going to build 500,000 units of affordable housing. If anybody has any question whether or not we can do it, I have got a bridge to show you,”Cuomo saidin May, before referencing the Mario Cuomo bridge – a structure named after Cuomo’s late father and a former governor. Cuomo signed the bill to name the bridge himself.For all Cuomo has attempted to sell voters on his record, his past has sometimes proved to be a drawback, with rivals seeking to profile the allegations that led to himresigning as governorin 2021. An investigation by the New York’s attorney general found that Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women, most of whom worked for him, and reported that the governor retaliated against some of those women after they made complaints.“Mr Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace. I have never cut Medicaid. I have never stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA [the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, buses and trains],” Mamdani said during the final primary debate.“I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records, and I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr Cuomo.”Cuomoclaimedthe complaints were “all political” in the final debate.While Cuomo definitely has the support of the wealthy, that’s not his only reason to be confident ahead of Tuesday’s election. He hasbeen endorsedby a slew of labor unions and New York elected officials, and continues to lead Mamdani in the polls, including among key voting groups. On Wednesday a Maristpollfound that 48% of Black voters and 40% of Jewish voters back Cuomo, compared to 11% and 20% for Mamdani. Support from both communities hasprovedcrucialin previous New York City primaries.“When he was governor he looked out for New York. He was for the people of New York, compared to Eric Adams,” Yvonne Telesford, a 71-year-old from Brooklyn who voted early for Cuomo, told the Guardian.Telesford is a registered Democrat, but said she had voted for Republicans in the past, including Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor, and Ronald Reagan.“I always look and listen and see what the candidates have to offer, and then I come up with my decision,” she said. “And one thing I have to say, I think Andrew Cuomo will stand up to our president now.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkAndrew CuomoUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They also maintain that no criminal conspiracy exists.Throughout the trial, Combs’s lawyers conducted extensive cross-examinations of many of the prosecution’s witnesses, often highlighting inconsistencies in their accounts.This week, the last witness called to the stand by the government was Joseph Cerciello, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations.He testified about travel, hotel, payment and phone records related to the investigation into Combs.The jury were alsoshown several minutes of sexually explicit videorelated to the case.If the schedule proceeds as planned, the jury could start deliberating before the end of the week.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

The WHO’s local office, which did not assign blame, said six children and five health workers were among the dead and that there were “dozens of injuries”.The RSF and Sudan’s armed forces have beenfighting since April 2023, when a power struggle broke out into open warfare in the capital, Khartoum. Tens of thousands of people have been killed andmore than 12 million displaced, 4 million of them to outside the country. More than 20 million are in need of food aid and areas of the country arein famine.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a post on X: “We cannot say this louder: attacks on health must stop everywhere!”The RSF said in astatementon its website that the armed forces were responsible for Saturday’s attack. “The Rapid Support Forces strongly condemn and denounce the barbaric aggression … This attack constitutes a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva conventions, which explicitly prohibit the targeting of health facilities and personnel,” it said.The news site Darfur 24cited the West Kordofan Emergency Response Rooms, part of a network of Sudanese grassroots humanitarian groups, as saying the attack was an airstrike carried out using a Sudanese military plane. Emergency Lawyers, a group that documents abuses by both sides in the war, said the hospital was hit by a military drone.Nabil Abdallah, a spokesperson for Sudan’s military, said the allegations were false. “Sudanese armed forces do not violate international law and do not target civilians, but target the places of militia gatherings everywhere as legitimate targets, against facilities used by the militia for military purposes,” Abdallah said.“These are lies and propaganda aimed at blaming false charges [on] the Sudanese state and its armed forces and [are] part of the regional and international conspiracy against Sudan.”The United Nations’ children’s agency, Unicef, said in anX post: “The attacks do not only kill and injure but also severely impede the communities’ ability to receive life-saving services. We urge the government and all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law. The attacks and violence must end now.”In January,70 people were killedin an attack on what was then the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher, in the Darfur region. The attack was blamed on the RSF.In March, Sudan’s armed forcesrecaptured the presidential palaceas they asserted control over Khartoum. Meanwhile, the RSF consolidated their dominance over the western region of Darfur, where their predecessors, the Janjaweed Arab militias, were accused of committing genocide against non-Arab tribes in 2004.Earlier this month, a UN aid convoy came under attack, withfive people killed, as it tried to bring supplies to El Fasher, which has been under siege by the RSF for more than a year.Virginia Gamba, the UN secretary general’s special adviser on the prevention of genocide,told the UN Human Rights Councilon Monday: “Both parties have committed serious human rights violations.”She said: “RSF and allied armed Arab militias continue to conduct ethnically motivated attacks against the Zaghawa, Masalit and Fur groups. The risk of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan remains very high.”Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He noted, however, that the administration’s policies frequently shift.Line graph shows fall and rise of interest rates from 2020 to 2025, with it peaking at 5.4% in 2023 and 2024, and hovering at 4.4% in 2025 alongside a label that says “no cut”“Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain,” Powell told the US House of Representatives financial services committee. “The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined.“Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.”Powell, whom Trump appointed as Fed chair during his first stint in the White House, stressed he was open to the prospect of the inflationary impact of tariffs being less severe than expected. “We aren’t commenting on tariffs,” he stressed.At its latest two-day policy meeting last week, the Fedkept rates on hold, but its officials signaled thy might make two cuts this year. They lifted their projections for inflation and downgraded their estimates for growth.The “obligation” of the central bank’s policymakers is to “keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem”, Powell told Congress on Tuesday.He added: “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyFederal ReserveDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsUS politicsJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

As a new exhibition revisits that pivotal moment, the artists remember the prejudice they faced – and what they have achieved sinceKadish MorrisTue 24 Jun 2025 12.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 16.08 EDTShareIt is November 1985 and in a corridor of London’sICA, a pivotal moment in British art history is about to take place. Curated by Lubaina Himid, The Thin Black Line displays work by 11 Black and Asian women artists, hung on the walls of the museum’s narrow walkway – to signify just how they’ve been marginalised. Their work – which explores social, cultural, political, feminist and aesthetic issues – comes as a shock to the stuffy art establishment.Critics dismiss it, or deride the works as “angry”. And yet this show, placing Black women artists firmly at the centre of contemporary British art history, will come to be seen as a turning point, paving the way for future winners of the Turner prize (Himid and Veronica Ryan) and Venice Golden Lion (Sonia Boyce).I didn’t know what to paint for the show. Then Cherry Groce was shot during a police raid on her Brixton homeForty years on, the ICA is revisiting the show with ​​Connecting Thin Black Lines 1985–2025, building on its legacy with new and old works from the original artists, and new contributors. Here, some of them reflect on the original exhibition, the reaction it received, and how the art world has changed.Sutapa Biswas:The 1980s were a charged time politically, socially and economically.I arrived at art college in 1981 with a great degree of understanding about the histories of the empire and how it impacted my parents. They were born in what was called British India. They experienced partition and genocide and were displaced. It was a complex time in the UK, too. In my community in west London, the Southall Youth Movement, an antiracist group, had burned down the Hambrough Tavern where skinhead bands played.Marlene Smith:I was a student, studying for my BA at Bradford School of Art. By the time I joinedthe BLK Art Group,an association of young Black artists, I was already thinking about my identity in relation to feminism. I was not the only Black person studying, but I was one of few. I was certainly the only person trying to make work with political overtones.View image in fullscreen‘The rhetoric was so racist in Britain’ … Sutapa Biswas’s Housewives with Steak-Knives.Photograph: © Sutapa Biswas. All rights reserved, DACS/Artimage 2020. Photo: Andy KeateJennifer Comrie:I was living through a really interesting time: the Troubles, the miners’ strike, Thatcherism, apartheid in South Africa. My work reflected this.Artfor me has always been a wayto garner a better understanding of myself and the world around me.Ingrid Pollard:I was doing various jobs, and signing on for benefits. I was a cleaner. I was a gardener for the council. There weren’t any rosy aspirations to be an artist. I had been doing screen-printing in an evening class and then a job came up in this feminist print shop in London, which I got, much to my surprise. There was a dark room there, so I started doing photography.Sutapa:One day on my university course, I was confronted by a painting by Turner titledThe Slave Ship. My tutor was talking about the expressionistic nature of the brushmarks. I was sitting there thinking: “What about what’s in the water?” That moment, coupled with what I heard in another lecture, made me think: “We’re talking about class and gender – but we’re not talking about race.”Marlene:My painting tutor didn’t like what I was doing. He was not at all convinced that art could, or should, be political. So when Lubaina showed up and stood in front of my work and had a conversation with me, it was totally transformative.Jennifer:When Lubaina came in to my studio by chance and looked at my work, she was intrigued and asked if I would be interested in showing it. Initially I was unsure. I did not realise how pivotal this chance meeting would be.View image in fullscreenSweet spot … Ice Cream Van, by Chila Kumari Burman, whose work featured in the original show.Photograph: Rob HarrisSutapa:I found out Lubaina was doing a talk and went along. I introduced myself and said: “I’m a student at the University of Leeds. I’d love to interview you.” When I submitted my dissertation, I invited Lubaina to do a talk at the university. There, she saw my paintingHousewives with Steak-Knivesand the video work Kali. “I’m organising this exhibition,” she said. “I would love to include your work.”Marlene:The show was coming up, but I had no idea what to make. ThenCherry Grocewas shot [during a police raid on her Brixton home]. So I made Good Housekeeping – a larger than life painting of a woman leaning against a doorway. Behind her outstretched arm is a framed photograph of my sister’s birthday party. Above that image, painted on the wall, are the words: “My mother opens the door at 7am. She is not bulletproof.” I was thinking about Cherry Groce as a middle-aged single mum.Sutapa:The rhetoric was so racist in Britain. So I began to think about performance as strategic intervention. That’s what emerged in Kali. But it also has a presence in Housewives with Steak-Knives. It’s not a static piece, settled against the wall. It sits forward and looks as if it’s going to fall on top of you.Jennifer:Coming to Terms Through Conflict, a work I put in the show, questions identity: northern, Jamaican, British, Black, Christian, etc. Untitled continued this journey. Its broken stitching is intentional, representing a refusal to be contained or defined by social constraints – church, family, anyone. It’s a visual declaration of freedom.Marlene:Jenny had this beautiful singing voice. I remember her singing as we were installing. Even when I think of it now, it chokes me up. I remember Sutapa climbing up and writing the words for my work in black paint.Ingrid:It was fun installing it all. We thought we were being slightly naughty, because it was a well-known gallery. It was only later that I understood the ramifications, the politics of what Lubaina was trying to organise.Helen Cammock[involved in new show]:I was 15 when that exhibition was at the ICA. I wasn’t interested in art then. It wasn’t on my radar until 2005, when I did a photography BA. I had bought some books that contained Ingrid’s work.Postcards Home[her photography book about England and the Caribbean] was on my desk while I wrote my dissertation. The images moved me. I was sad. I was angry. I found beauty.View image in fullscreenA still from There’s a Hole in the Sky Part I by Helen Cammock.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Kate MacGarry, London.Marlene:The response to The Thin Black Line,in terms of art criticism, was pretty appalling. The critics came to it very defensively, rather than looking at what the work had to say. Sutapa and I wrote a piece forSpare Ribmagazine, talking about the lack of useful critique around Black artists.Sutapa:The reviews were reduced to questions of identity and that became a platform for white guilt. But the real issue was avoiding the language ofourpractice, in the way that you might talk about the language of David Hockney’s work or Helen Chadwick’s. We weren’t being afforded the same level criteria. They weren’t dealing with the aesthetics of our practice.Helen:It’s not a new thing. It happens now. This notion that you’re angry. That you’re didactic. It’s a marginal experience and people aren’t interested in it. The whole framing of the show undermined the quality of its ideas, of its potential to shake people’s ways of thinking and seeing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you examine the YBAs, there was a synergy with what had happened earlier with the Black Arts Movement; it’s striking that they seemed to be using our methods of DIY. However, they were not including the Black artists in their projects.Ingrid:There was never a time, after, when I wasn’t making art. I wasn’t ill. I didn’t have children. I was teaching as a way of keeping a regular income. I didn’t have to deal with the aspirations of a gallery representing me. Those things were very alien.Marlene:In 2011, Tate did a show looking back at The Thin Black Line. And then Graves Gallery stumbled across work by the BLK Art Group and did a show. So that felt like something was happening. Over the last 10 years, it feels like there’s been a resurgence of interest in the Black Arts Movement because, despite its significance, it has not made it into discussions of art history.Amber Akaunu [involved in new show]:I studied art and art history at Liverpool Hope University from 2015 to 2018. I didn’t really learn about Black art history. I feel a bit of pain when I find out about things I didn’t know. I started a magazine with another artist in the course called Rooted.We just felt there was a big gap in knowledge.View image in fullscreenHorsing around … Sutapa Biswas’s Birdsong, which is in the new show.Photograph: © Sutapa Biswas. All Rights Reserved. DACS 2025.Sutapa:After the show, I continued to work. I showed with Vito Acconci, Tania Bruguera, Doris Salcedo and Louise Bourgeois at Iniva in London. In 2004 I had a show there that was not nominated for the Turner. Where is my retrospective at the Tate? Where isClaudette Johnson’s? I have not received accolades for my recent exhibitions at the Baltic and Kettle’s Yard.Ingrid:Getting recognition came after a long period of work, 20 to 30 years. I was surprised to be nominated for the Turner. It raises your public profile. The media had ignored me and a lot of artists for 40 years.Marlene:I had a solo show called Ah, Sugar in2024. At the opening, Lubaina introduced me to the curators from the ICA and said that this new exhibition, Connecting Thin Black Lines, would be coming up. It was a surprise, exciting.Helen:I was looking at the complete lineup. Their voices weren’t heard before – and now they are being heard more loudly than ever.Amber:Lubaina hosted a lunch for some of the artists who were going to be in this new show. I just sat there and soaked everything in. It was shocking – but touching – to hear their stories. A lot of these artists have gained so much success, but you can still hear the hurt. I related so much. Some 30 to 40 years on, I’m having similar experiences. I remember curating an exhibition over four days, and showing some work for Black History Month, and we weren’t paid for it.Ingrid:A lot of the young students I speak to are still complaining: lack of recognition, opportunities. Things change, but they remain the same. My advice is you need a gang. You can’t do it on your own. It takes a village to make an artist.Helen:It happened to be a really monumental experience for me being in a show called Carte de Visite with Claudette Johnson and Ingrid Pollard in 2015. I think it encapsulated what’s happening now, the interconnectedness across generations.Marlene:It was a real privilege for me to exhibit with them in the first place. And it’s a real privilege to be reunited. It’s always nerve-wracking when you make new work. There’s a bit of an echo between the piece I’ve made this time and the 1985 piece. This piece is probably more gentle.Amber:The film I’m showing is about motherhood and friendship. It’s a documentary style that that explores my childhood being raised by a single mum in Toxteth, Liverpool.Jennifer:It’s incredible to see the works being recognised again after 40 years. It genuinely feels like a few moments ago we were setting up the works in the ICA’s corridor.Ingrid:I’m hoping the exhibition annoys a lot of people in the art world. When they had an opportunity to engage with these artists, they didn’t take it. So it’s like: “See what you missed out on, mate.”Connecting Thin Black Lines 1985-2025is at the ICA, London, until 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsExhibitionsArtPaintingICABlack British cultureBritish identity and societyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sprints are delighted to be riding the wave of the “Irish renaissance”, as the Dublin band’s frontwoman Karla Chubb wryly refers to it. “We’re definitely in a good time for being Irish internationally,” nods drummer Jack Callan, before swiftly puncturing this optimistic sentiment. “I’m just waiting for it all to crash and burn now, like someone’s going to ruin it.” Chubb zeroes in on the worst-case scenario: “Paul Mescal’s going to do something terrible!”Mercifully, at the time of writing at least, Mescal remains secure in his position as the internet’s most-wanted boyfriend – not that Sprints need to cling to their countryman’s coattails. Since forming in 2019, the band – which also features Sam McCann on bass and guitarist Zac Stephenson – have risen through rock’s ranks by gigging relentlessly with their cathartically boisterous, brutally candid post-punk. In 2023 they supported Suede on tour, finding a champion in Brett Anderson, who tended to linger side of stage during their sets. (McCann would often turn to suddenly see “a menacing black silhouette” standing there. “Like Slenderman,” says Callan.) The following year, their blistering, brooding, hook-riddled debut album, Letter to Self – which doubled as an unflinching, aphorism-strewn account of Chubb’s mental health and ADHD struggles – reached the UK Top 20. In January it was shortlisted for an RTÉ Choice music prize, Ireland’s biggest music award.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David WillisNow, ahead of their most high-profile Glastonbury slot yet, the band are preparing to step things up again. Letter to Self’s forthcoming sequel, All That Is Over, leans harder into certain existing influences – Bauhaus, PJ Harvey – to arrive at a sound Chubb is semi-jokingly calling “gothic cowboy”, while expanding into less autobiographical territory by drawing on novels (Prophet Song,The Bee Sting, the works ofOctavia Butler) and video games (Fallout). Not quite “end of the world” stuff, explains Chubb over coffee with her bandmates in the bar of their London hotel on a sunny June day. “But otherworldly. A lot of it is escapism – even though we’re escaping from one dystopian world to another.”The album was shaped by a contradiction: things really began to take off for Sprints just as the news cycle started to get significantly darker. “We’ve built this beautiful, liberal, queer, creative bubble, and would be on tour playing these amazing shows … then you’d pick up your phone and be like, ‘What the fuck is happening?’ Like in Gaza, or the forest fires in LA. We’re doing the most artistically true and honest thing, and it’s set against this backdrop of the world feeling like it’s gonna end at any moment.”Music helps Chubb make sense of it all, she says. That is what the band’s latest single, Descartes, is about, with its core lyric – “I speak so therefore I understand” – riffing on the philosopher’s first principle to capture the clarity and catharsis provided by songwriting. The track also reiterates the band’s commitment to using their voice. Like many Irish acts – including Fontaines DC (whom they are due to support on tour this summer) and Kneecap – Sprints are politically outspoken. Chubb feels she bears the brunt of the pushback from this, and much more besides. Over the last year, she has been confronted with “articles about my weight” alongside “open letters from idiot men criticising my political stance – calling me arrogant because I had the audacity to use my platform on stage to speak about Palestine”.Some of Chubb’s anecdotes about the mansplaining she has endured are amusingly ludicrous – such as the one about the punter at a recent Dublin show who deigned to give her advice about the band’s guitar parts before telling her his son “could have done a better job”. In the early days of Sprints, Chubb felt pressure to perform solos “to prove that I could play the guitar, because people were automatically going to assume that I didn’t.” Today, she cares far less about the opinions of random blokes: “With this album, I don’t really give a fuck.”Yet other instances of misogyny are harder to shake off. Last year, Chubbmade headlineswhen she spoke about being groped by a gig-goer while on stage in Belfast (it happened during a Munich show too). At first, she wasn’t even shocked, but then “I started to talk about it and the guys were like, ‘What the fuck?’ So I thought, ‘OK, this is something I’m allowed to be upset by.’ When I decided to speak publicly about it, so many artists reached out and were like, ‘the same thing happened to me, it’s disgraceful.’”We could spend hours raking over the sexism Chubb has experienced as a frontwoman, but rather than cowed or beleaguered, she and her bandmates seem overall quietly euphoric. Rock band economics are precarious – “there are months when we don’t know how much, if any, money we’re going to get in,” says Chubb – and the lifestyle can be tough: their original guitarist Colm O’Reilly left last year because he wanted to settle down. “Touring life is not for everyone – if you don’t like it, it’s hell,” says McCann.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Politkovskaya’s gutsy, impassioned reporting on thesecond Chechen warwas highly critical of the Kremlin, the Russian army and Vladimir Putin personally. (The fact that she was murdered on his birthday was surely no coincidence.) Nineteen years after her death, she remains a folk hero worldwide for resistances to autocracy, especially given the rise in repression everywhere and constant threats to journalists.Given all that, the film deserves respect for the subject matter, even though this is a pretty basic rendition of Politkovskaya’s story, a little too sticky with hagiographic sentimentality and the cliches of crusading journalist-led movies. It also should be noted that Politkovskaya’s family haven’t given the film their blessing; some of them may not be happy, for instance, with the thinly written characterisations of their fictional counterparts, like her son Ilya (Harry Lawtey) who is made to seem peevish and self-absorbed even when his feelings are understandable. (“I’m not watching you die!” he bellows at one point.)In fact, the flawed peripheral characters are more interesting than Peake’s Politkovskaya, who spends much of the film with her strong jaw jutting out, projecting nobility despite the over-lacquered blond wig inflicted on her. Her best scenes are those in which she spars withJason Isaacs, who plays her husband, Sasha – a TV journalist clearly proud of his wife but jealous of her success – and with Ian Hart (always a treat when playing the heavy) as a sinister FSB secret policeman who loves history.The gently swelling strings in the score and flat lighting all serve to underscore the televisual atmosphere – even in what should be the film’s climatic set piece, thedisastrous siege at Moscow’s Dubrovka theatre, a cataclysmic event that deserves more dynamic film-making than the bit of slow-motion and sound dimming offered here. Politkovskaya served as a negotiator between the Russian security forces and the Chechen terrorists; she was later poisoned on a plane headed to Beslan, where a school full of children were also killed by terrorists. Politkovskaya survived that particular assassination attempt but those who know her story will dread the arrival of the final blow. It is to the film’s credit that over the end titles we see a portrait not just of the real Politkovskaya but also some of the 1,500 journalists worldwide who have been murdered in recent years.Words of War is on digital platforms from 30 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsAnna PolitkovskayaRussiaPeriod and historical filmsMaxine PeakeJason IsaacsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Diagnosed withpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Kenny was sleeping between 18 and 24 hours a day, and became so paranoid that he thought dog walkers were Taliban snipers. The worst thing was that the crying of their baby son, Harris, triggered his PTSD. This intimate documentary, told without a scrap of sentimentality, follows the couple over 10 years.The story unfolds almost like couples therapy, unpeeling the relationship layer by layer. On the voiceover Kenny jokes that when he met Kerry he told her he was a deep-sea firefighter, not a soldier, because he thought the truth would scare her away. What he loved first about his wife was her honesty; but Kerry has never fully opened up to him about a trauma from her childhood. The camera is a fly-on-the-wall in their lives through the worst of Kenny’s illness. In the darkest moments, he is agonisingly, unflinchingly direct about what is going on in his head.While Kenny is becoming more unwell at home, Kerry, who hated school and left with only a few GCSEs, goes back to education. She studies psychology at university and qualifies as a practitioner, while Kenny eventually begins to seek support. A small negative about the film itself is that we don’t get any sense of the chronology; it would have been helpful to have captions showing time passing. Love & Trouble perhaps works better on television than the big screen, but you cannot help but admire Kerry and Kenny’s emotional courage.Love & Trouble is in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPost-traumatic stress disorderScotlandMental healthHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a melancholy place, with that vanilla-and-almonds smell of decomposing ink and paper, and little crumbs of disintegrated newspaper on the floor by the reading desks. Like the mayfly, a newspaper is meant to die on the day it is born. News now lives longer on the Guardian website, but prominently displayed warnings tell us when an article is more than a month old. “Who wants yesterday’s papers?” the Rolling Stones sang. “Nobody in the world.”So newspaper history is a tricky genre that must capture the ephemeral and show why it matters. Ian Mayes’s excellent book follows two previous, quasi-official volumes of Guardian history by David Ayerst and Geoffrey Taylor. It begins in 1986 when the Guardian was still a one-section, inky, monochrome paper full of misprints and poor quality pictures, newly threatened by Rupert Murdoch’s move to Wapping and the birth of the Independent. It ends in 1995 with a radically restyled paper, with new sections such as G2 and the pocket-sized TV and entertainment supplement, the Guide. A second volume will tell the story up to 2008, when the Guardian moved to its current home in Kings Place.Few events in these years, from the fatwa on Rushdie to the first Gulf war, failed to provoke fierce disagreements in the newsroomThe Guardian is seen from the outside as an ideological monolith. Mayes quotes one Daily Mail executive who says that his newspaper was “utterly obsessed with the bloody Guardian” and that the editor, Paul Dacre, “would grumble away to himself under his breath about ‘Polly fucking Toynbee’ as he marched to the lift”. Even to its natural allies, the Guardian could be exasperating. In 1993, Salman Rushdie wrote in: “May I commiserate with your literary editors, Richard Gott and James Wood, whose jobs so plainly make them miserable?” And the paper, at least in this period, had a reputation for suffocating earnestness. In 1986, Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective (played by Michael Gambon) tried to control lustful thoughts while a nurse greased the lower parts of his psoriatic body by thinking of “something very very boring” like “the Guardian women’s page”. It didn’t help, which, Mayes says hopefully, might be seen as “an oblique compliment to the page”.As Mayes reveals, this uniform Guardian imagined from afar does not exist. It may have become a refuge for a loose anti-Tory coalition in these years of Conservative rule, but its politics were all over the place. Richard Gott was convinced that the editor, Peter Preston, was a progressive Tory (Mayes dismisses this, but discovers that Preston did vote Tory once in a local election). Gott was later revealed to have worked for the KGB. Several Guardian journalists stood as candidates for the Social Democratic party. Seumas Milne and Martin Kettle, who both joined the paper in the mid-1980s, represented Labour’s left and right. The Guardian management, and many of the printers, were firmly Tory. Few events in these years, from the fatwa on Rushdie to the first Gulf war, failed to provoke fierce disagreements in the newsroom.Many of the old guard – mostly male and often to be found in smoke-filled pubs and theGay Hussarrestaurant in Soho – worried that the paper’s political direction was being lost in its increasing coverage of lifestyle and popular culture. One of the new guard, Peter Silverton, on first entering the Guardiancanteen, thought that “this dull, clean, uncomfortable, chummy little lunchroom” was “the last of the wartime British Restaurants. And the senior editing staff were in there – in such bad clothes.”Yet for all this, the Guardian thrived. It successfully negotiated the end of hot metal and its replacement by computerised typesetting and printing; it fought off competition from the Independent; it bought the Observer, almost certainly saving it from extinction; and it weathered Murdoch’s price war. One hero of the book is David Hillman of Pentagram, who led the Guardian’s great redesign of 1988, turning it overnight from the ugliest British newspaper to the best-looking one. Longstanding readers will recall this redesign from its distinctive masthead, with theThein Garamond italic font and theGuardianin Helvetica bold. The Hillman revolution worked because he understood that design grew out of content, and that pictures and words had to work together.Covering nine years in more than 300 pages, this book has all the comprehensiveness of an official history. To read it without judicious skipping, you probably need to be interested in the building of printing plants, new computer systems, page layouts and house agreements with the unions. But Mayes enlivens his narrative throughout with humorous touches and compelling character sketches. He never quite cracks the enigma of Peter Preston, his presence in the newsroom announced by pipe smoke, until he swapped smoking for chewing the tops of leaky ballpoint pens, which made him look like “a bizarre Petrushka”. Preston was so quiet in one meeting with the blind politician David Blunkett that Blunkett asked whether he was still in the room. Guardian staff often left meetings with Preston puzzled as to what had occurred. Yet he must take much of the credit for the newspaper’s successful transformation in these years, when some feared it would not survive.A newspaper’s contents may be ephemeral, but the fate of newspapers themselves matters hugely. I finished this book feeling awed by all this forgotten labour in a collective cause, done so that the Guardian could “carry on as heretofore”, in the traditional instruction given to its editors. It also left me thinking that, for all the sometimes fractious office politics, this newspaper remains, in the words of its longest-serving editor CP Scott, “an organ of civilisation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They are a model of male intimacy and understanding: confiding in each other, trusting each other, hugging each other (“real, loving hugs, clutches without irony”). Theirs is truly a friendship for the ages.Or so it seems. For on the weekend of Emerson’s 52nd birthday, an occasion at the centre of Hal Ebbott’s probing and insightful debut novel, something happens that changes everything – and raises the question of whether we can ever truly know anyone.Amos and Emerson met on the first day of college and bonded immediately despite their surface differences (Emerson is rich and handsome, Amos poor but clever). They have each fallen in love, married and had children, their families going through life together, twinned by the two men’s unbreakable bond. “You know,” observes Amos’s wife, Claire, “it’s a triumph of my marriage that I don’t envy what the two of you have.”Among Friends is a bracingly honest and affectingly intimate depiction of abuse, family dynamics and self-deceitThe story begins as Amos, Claire and their daughter, Anna, are driving to Emerson’s house in the country for a weekend of birthday celebrations. The mood is relaxed and carefree. Amos is pleased that a medical check has come back clear. But the reader is warned of the storm to come: “Each in their own way will think of this drive. They will marvel at its ordinariness, they will search it for signs. Was it already broken? Was it already lost?” Once they arrive there are further ill omens: a smashed wine bottle; a twisted ankle; a car crash. We are primed to expect catastrophe.And while on the surface everything seems perfect for these rich and successful New Yorkers, underneath gripes and grievances bubble away. An evening meal can barely pass without some tetchiness. A tone might be considered “too performed”, a laugh too forced. Emerson is so irked by Amos’s childish manners that he nurses his displeasure late into the night (“his thoughts lingered on the way Amos had asked for dessert”). But it is not until a friendly game of tennis gets too heated, and Emerson, bested and embarrassed and feeling his age, retires to the house, that things go seriously wrong.It is not easy to grasp why, and that is part of the novel’s ambiguous power. Emerson himself seems not to know what he is doing (“Am I? Am I going to do it?”). Without giving too much away, a confused sense of entitlement, damaged ego and midlife crisis leads Emerson to an unforgivable act. It is shocking, but not exactly surprising. Ebbott subtly unpicks the luscious tapestry he has so far woven, laying out the more selfish and messy emotions that underlie the characters’ relationships: Amos’s social climbing; Emerson’s need for validation. It is an impressively nuanced portrait.Some aspects are less subtle. The key event is handled somewhat awkwardly, with a jarring attempt at black humour. More undermining is Ebbott’s habit later in the novel of painting Emerson as a black-and-white villain (he is likened to a “wolf” or a “reptile, born already with the memory, the knowledge of violence”), rather than the more ambiguously flawed fiftysomething he had appeared earlier. The style and tone is initially blandly self-confident (“The car flew on. Amos felt himself move with it – this smooth, edgeless life”) but becomes increasingly searching and introspective, with the best section, one from the victim’s viewpoint, taking on a disembodied, incantatory feel as words and phrases run around their head, becoming more and more meaningless: “What he did. What hedid. Whateedyd. Whut eed id.”Among Friends is a bracingly honest and affectingly intimate depiction of abuse, family dynamics and self-deceit. It is sharply observed and psychologically astute, somehow both passionate and dispassionate, and it upends its characters’ lives so ruthlessly and revealingly that it is hard not to take pleasure in a false facade being finally smashed.Among Friends is published by Picador (£18.99).

We have had a few years now, to get out there, to rebuild careers and relationships, to travel, to live in the world again. That’s not the case for everyone. Award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who crafted the beguiling, elegiac soundtracks to games such as Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and Dear Esther, has only just emerged. Diagnosed with a degenerative disease in her mid-20s and seriously immunocompromised as a result of her condition, she began isolating at the start of the pandemic, and for the next five years barely left her home. While there, unable to work or write, her world began to collapse.“Like many people I had an extraordinarily painful and difficult pandemic,” she says. “I watched my dad die on Zoom, and then my auntie and more family members. Then they found a tumour in my ovary, and I had major abdominal surgery, but the operation had gone wrong, so I nearly died in 2022. While I was recovering from the third operation, the roof of our house fell in. It felt like a metaphor for everything. If a novelist had written this, no one would believe the story. And things just kept going wrong. So I wasn’t writing music, I wasn’t even listening to music. All of a sudden, I couldn’t bear it. I’m still trying to work out what that rejection was about – I was just in too much of a mental crisis. I wasn’t even feeding or dressing myself.”One day last year, however, Curry made the decision to start listening to her music again. Not yet ready to compose, she began cataloguing her work instead, putting it in some sort of order after years of manic productivity. The result is Shielding Songs, an album mostly made up of new versions of her favourite pieces, arranged as lusciously ethereal choral works featuring the acclaimed London Voices choir. “Shielding Songs is a kind of gathering together, almost like a manifesto. I was thinking, what do I believe as a composer? What is my legacy? And I have to say, I did think it was going to be the last thing I would put out. And I was like, if it is going to be the last thing, I want it to be good. And I want it to say the things that I feel are important.”View image in fullscreenLusciously ethereal … A recording session for Shielding Songs with the London Voices.Photograph: Jessica CurryAmong them are four pieces from Everything’s Gone to the Rapture, a game about the apocalypse from the point of view of a tiny English village that won Curry a Bafta for her soundtrack. Created by developer The Chinese Room, of which Curry and her husband Dan Pinchbeck were co-founders, it drew praise for its lavish bucolic setting and highly emotional score, heavily inspired by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. It has been some of her most popular music.“I still get emails about it 10 years later,” she says. “So many people have Rapture tattoos – I often get emails that say, I only listen to death metal, but I love this soundtrack. That game has stuck with people, but I wanted to reimagine the music. The Mourning Tree is not the most played track on the score, but it’s the one that people write to me about. Lots of people have played it at funerals. And I thought, there is something beautiful I can do with a purely choral arrangement here.”Another reason Rapture is so prominent on the new album is the parallel between its story of growing isolation at the end of the world and the experience of the Covid years. “The game is about what it means to be human, what does it mean to love?” she says. “And interestingly it has a lot of tie-in with a global event like a pandemic and how we cope with that.” Curry has described Shielding Songs as an exploration of what it means to love and grieve in isolation, but it is also a hopeful study of human endurance. Four of the tracks come from her anti-war requiem Perpetual Light, first performed in 2011 – a response to the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, undercut with a sense of hope for the future.A piece from Chinese Room’s VR sci-fi adventure So Let Us Melt is included too. The titular track is a wilting choral work inspired by John Donne, but the other tracks on the score are more experimental and hint at where she is heading musically. “You can tell it’s mine, but it’s a kind of weird mix of Baba O’Riley with minimalism, with a classical bent, but it also sounds like it’s from a film,” Curry says. “It’s got that sort of epic space opera feel, and everything for me coalesced into that score. I loved the sound.”Curry and Pinchbeck (to whom one beautiful new song on the album, Rest With Your Dream, is dedicated) sold The Chinese Room to Sumo Digital in 2018; Curry departed, Pinchbeck stayed on as creative director, overseeing Bafta-winning oil rig horror adventure, Still Wakes the Deep, but left in 2023. Now the duo have formed a small new studio, and are working on fresh concepts. “Maybe we’re insane,” she says. “But I think we are good at making games, me and Dan. We have things to say.” Curry is still sick, and she still worries about going out, especially now that some people have become aggressive toward those who wear protective masks. But she is composing again.“This is the first time in a long time that I can hear music properly, in my head,” she says. “I didn’t think it would happen again, and I think it is going to be something new. It will be Jessica Curry, but I’m not the same person that I was. When really bad things happen to you, you don’t go back. The ground doesn’t just solidify again. Trauma is messy and it’s exhausting, but music will come from it.”Shielding Songs is out nowvia BandcampExplore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that is the Yorkshireman’s point: there is a better US, now occluded by He Who Shall Barely Be Named, but still worth believing in. Voice of America traces Hodgson’s lifelong love affair with the States, in the teeth of his Europhile parents’ distaste, the disillusion of the Bush years and a recent doomed bid for Hollywood success.It joins as big-hitting a body of work as any in comedy, a suite of autobiographical shows itemising the nerdy obsessions (cycling; Mahler; European politics) of child and adult Kieran. Voice of America hits less big, for my money, partly because its subject is less lovably niche, and also because the binary thinking (America good? America bad?) is simplistic before Hodgson arrives at his predictably more nuanced conclusion.You may have to park your scepticism at Hodgson’s vision (seen through the star-spangled eyes of youth) of the US pre-2000 as a paradise before the fall. This middle-class ingenue from Holmfirth looks in awe at Home Alone, Will Smith and the soaring speeches of JFK. His parents’ dismissal of “American rubbish” only fuels his fetish for Americana. Then comes his career in entertainment, and a growing sense that Tinseltown is the only place to be.Kieran Hodgson: ‘When I was 17 I decided to liven up a lasagne by putting bananas in it’Read moreThe show circles around a tale Hodgson tells of his would-be breakthrough role in a superhero movie, and the can of worms prised open by his obligation to play an American. What, or who,isan American anyway? Is it the culture vulture he meets at the opera? Or is it the current president, whom our host refuses to talk about, but who keeps threatening a hostile takeover of the show? This all supplies a great platform for Hodgson’s vocal and mimicry talent, and for neat jokes, too, like the Canadians/Ewoks number, or the one about the audio entertainment on Hodgson family road trips. Its structure may, like Trump, be crude – but this is another fine show about a meek Brit grappling with the all-conquering myth, and reality, of America.AtSoho theatre, London, until 28 June.

It is equally difficult to picture Yorkshire without its majestic sandstone mills, Grimsbywithout its fishing docks, or parts of Liverpoolwithout their streets of terrace houses. Yet all these things could have victims of the wrecking ball, if it weren’t for one small band of plucky activists.You may not have heard ofSave Britain’s Heritage, or SAVE as it likes to style itself, suggesting the urgency of the matter at hand. But the tiny charity, which celebrates its50th birthday this month, has had more influence than any other group in campaigning for the imaginative reuse of buildings at risk, most of which had no legal protections whatsoever from being bulldozed.“We felt that a much more punchy approach to endangered buildings was really needed,” saysMarcus Binney, who founded Save in 1975, with an agile network of likeminded journalists, historians, architects and planners. “There was too much, ‘Oh, we’ll write to the minister, and have a word with the chairman of the county council.’ The usual channels were not working. We realised that the real battleground was the media.”They were spurred by the surprise success of a 1974 exhibition at the V&A,The Destruction of the Country House, co-curated by Binney, which conveyed the shocking scale of demolition across the country with graphic power. The “Hall of Destruction”, replete with toppling classical columns, displayed more than 1,000 country houses that had been lost in the preceding century, a number that rose to 1,600 by the time the exhibition closed. The scale of the issue struck a chord: more than 1.5m signatures of support were gathered to keep these buildings standing.View image in fullscreenElegant innards … Smithfield market is being transformed into the London Museum, set to open in 2026What set Save apart from other heritage groups at the time was its proactive, propositional approach and energetic, youthful zeal. They had no qualms about calling out the villains, and would admonish greedy developers and lazy local authorities with ferocious glee. Their press releases and campaign pamphlets were a breath of fresh air, emblazoned with bold graphics, punchy headlines and evocative texts written with fierce authority – with a critical media-savviness brought by trustees includingSimon JenkinsandDan Cruickshank. Most crucially of all, theirs was not a call to keep the world in aspic, but to find creative alternative uses for buildings that their owners couldn’t see. “The argument for demolition was always that a building had ‘reached the end of its useful life,’” says Binney. “But the question is: ‘Useful for whom?’”When the Central Electricity Generating Board planned to demolish its (then unlisted) Bankside power station in Southwark and replace it with offices, Save conjured a proposal in 1979, in a moment of wildly improbable blue-sky thinking, to turn it into an art gallery instead. A decade later, Tate announced that Sir Giles Gilbert Scott’s great brick colossus would become the home of its modern art collection. It is now one of the most visited museums in the world. Twenty years on, when a developer wanted to scoop out the elegant innards of Smithfield market and replace them witha bloated office block and shops, Save commissioned an alternative vision, fought two crowdfunded public inquiries, and won.The London Museumis set to open there next year, breathing fresh new life into the atmospheric warren of cast-iron domes and brick vaults, that would otherwise be dust.View image in fullscreenGraphic power … Hall of Destruction at The Destruction of the Country House, a 1974 exhibition at the V&A, LondonIt is hard to appreciate now, but Save’s early activities fundamentally transformed the perception of heritage, and expanded the scope of what was deemed worth keeping. The conservation movement tended to focus on churches, country houses and town halls, but Save was the first to suggest that industrial buildings were equally worthy of attention. Its 1979 exhibition and publication,Satanic Mills, highlighted the threatened textile factories of the Pennines, and led to campaigns to protect places such as Salts Mill in Saltaire – now aUnesco world heritage site– and Lister Mills in Manningham.“The building itself is an icon for Bradford,” says Mollie, who now lives in a flat in Lister Mills, once the largest silk mill in the world, which was transformed by architectDavid Morley for Urban Splash in 2006. “When it was becoming derelict it gave the community a real down feeling – you felt everything was bad and going wrong. When it was done up it really raised people’s hearts.”Save has long argued that communities’ emotional attachment to buildings is just as powerful an argument for their retention as their place in the architectural canon. But that’s not a factor that planners can consider. “The planning system is heavily focused on historic fabric and architectural significance,” says Henrietta Billings, Save’s current director. “But what about emotional attachment and embodied memory? What about the feelings of loss when these buildings are ripped out of communities, and what about the unlisted buildings that people really care about?”The development industry may not speak the language of loss, but it certainly understands the “value uplift” that a “heritage asset” can bring. At Capital and Centric’s recent development of aManchester textile mill, Crusader Works, the sales team received four times as many inquiries for flats in the 19th-century mill buildings than in the new-build blocks. And they sold them for 10% more, inviting buyers into a fantasy of “exposed beams and red brick dreams”. Another office developer says it favours renovating postwar blocks in order to attract the gen Z workforce, who prefer working in “distinctive, characterful buildings” with low carbon credentials over generic “grade A” glass boxes.View image in fullscreenBradford icon … Lister Mills in Manningham.Photograph: David Morley ArchitectsAlongside financial value, Save is increasingly raising the environmental benefits of keeping buildings – something which can be more precisely measured than emotions, and fought over at public inquiries with the help of expert witnesses. The Oxford Street branch of Marks & Spencer recently became a lighting rod for thisnew frontier of the heritage debate, when the carbon emissions of demolishing the 1920s department store and replacing it with a 10-storey behemoth were raised as one of the key reasons for keeping it. The M&S plans, Save argued, with the help ofcarbon expert Simon Sturgis, would release 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the equivalent of almost 20,000 flights from London to Sydney.“It was a watershed,” says Billings, “aligning heritage and sustainability at the heart of a public inquiry for the first time. Although we lost the battle, we were able to show how, by avoiding demolition, you are notchucking out all the embodied carbonin the existing building, as well as not expending more carbon on producing all the steel, glass and concrete for a brand new building.”Save may have lost the case but the inquiry highlighted its next crucial battleground. The then secretary of state Michael Gove’s decision to quash M&S’s permission to demolish the building was ultimately overturned, because he had misinterpreted the national planning policy framework (NPPF). He suggested that there was a “strong presumption in favour of reusing buildings” in the rules – which there is not. At present, the NPPF merely tries to “encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings”. There is a legal ocean of difference between a “strong presumption” and a mere “encouragement”, as M&S’sbarrister successfully pointed out. The devil is in the semantic detail, and it is exactly that detail that Save is now campaigning to see changed.View image in fullscreenStreet life … Liverpool’s Welsh Streets“The current government’s rhetoric is all about ‘build, build, build’ and ‘bulldozing the planning system’,” says Billings. “But planning is not the obstacle. It just needs to be properly funded and tightened up. There are plenty of planning applications that we know local councillors and planners are uncomfortable with, but they are often forced to approve them because of the costs involved in defending refusals.”Entirely funded by donations, Save’s team of six is currently juggling numerous campaigns, from trying toclose legal loopholesin Scotland’s heritage protection rules, to saving aGeorgian seaside hotel on the edge of Snowdonia, to contesting several controversial plans tobutcher Liverpool Street station. As it celebrates five decades of such David and Goliath battles, against a bleak backdrop of rapid global heating, missed emissions targets and a government intent on building at any cost, the work of this gutsy little group is more critical than ever.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHeritageTate ModernfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Butthe rowabout the extramural staging ofDon’t Cry for Me Argentinain Evita at the London Palladium is a sign of its director’s increasing celebrity status. Indeed I’m tempted to rephrase a number from an earlier Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical: “Jamie Lloyd Superstar, Do you think you’re what they say you are?” What, in short, does it tell us about our theatrical culture that this puckishly likable director has become a figure famed on both sides of the Atlantic?His beginnings, asa recent Vogue featurepointed out, were relatively modest. He grew up in rural Dorset, was turned on to live theatre by seeing Michael Jackson on tour and attended the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. But, right from the start, there was something there. The first production of his that I saw wasThe Caretaker, which in 2007 transferred from the Sheffield Crucible to what was then the Tricycle in London. Two things made it original: the use of a creepy score by Ben and Max Ringham to give the play a film noir feel and the insistent presence of Nigel Harman’s Mick reminding us that the work is about the fraternal bond between him and the brain-damaged Aston, which Pinter’s intrusive hobo fails to understand.View image in fullscreenNigel Harman and David Bradley in The Caretaker in 2007.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOver the next few years I followed Lloyd’s career with interest and was struck by several things. One was his trust in actors and his ability to extend their range. There wasZawe Ashtonin the title role in Oscar Wilde’s Salome at Hampstead theatre dancing to a ghetto-blaster; Douglas Hodge inInadmissible Evidenceat the Donmar turning John Osborne’s disintegrating hero into a quasi-Beckettian figure; and Katherine Kelly, best known for Coronation Street, playing Kate Hardcastle inShe Stoops to Conquer, with a rustic graciousness.For a young director, Lloyd had a rare faith in the language and setting of classic plays: that production of Oliver Goldsmith’s comedy at the National was robustly true to the late-18th century just as hisDuchess of Malfiat the Old Vic was unequivocally Jacobean. Without distorting authorial intention, Lloyd also made you look again at a work you thought you knew. By casting Elena Roger, who had played Evita and Piaf, as the heroine in the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musicalPassionat the Donmar in 2010, Lloyd changed the whole balance of the show: Roger’s sickly Fosca, instead of being an ugly duckling, was a lonely woman embodying the power of unconditional love.View image in fullscreenEve Best in The Duchess of Malfi, directed by Jamie Lloyd at the Old Vic in 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSignificantly, much of Lloyd’s best early work was done when he was an associate at the Donmar working under the tutelage of Michael Grandage. Even when he branched out and formed the Jamie Lloyd Company in 2013 there was still much to admire. I may have disliked hisDoctor Faustus, which became a pointless satire on the lure of showbiz stardom, but there was good work with James McAvoy, includingMacbethand Peter Barnes’sThe Ruling Class, and notable revivals of Pinter’sThe HothouseandThe Homecoming.It was, however, a six-month season in 2018-19 of all of Pinter’s one-act plays that for me was proof of Lloyd’s quality. For a start, the season demolished the myth that Pinter’s shorter pieces are inferior to his full-length plays: what became abundantly clear was that, whatever the chosen form, Pinter was preoccupied with analysing the roots of power. Lloyd also attracted an astonishing range of actors:Antony Sher for One for the Road, Tamsin Greig for Landscape and A Kind of Alaska, Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer for The Dumb Waiter, Jane Horrocks and Luke Thallon for The Room.View image in fullscreenJamie Lloyd, centre (with Nicole Scherzinger, left and Andrew Lloyd Webber, right), accepts the award for best revival of a musical for Sunset Boulevard at the Tony awards this month.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APLloyd’s own productions were often revelatory. Having myself wrestled with the difficulty of directing Party Time, in which a wealthy elite remain oblivious to a round-up of dissidents, I was staggered by Lloyd’s courage in having the characters simply line up facing the audience in a cocktail party from hell. Even more impressive was his production ofBetrayal, with Tom Hiddleston, Zawe Ashton and Charlie Cox, which stripped the action of circumstantial detail and reminded us that there are three sides to an emotional triangle: in other words, that the deceived partner is always present in the imagination.Betrayal transferred to Broadway and was nominated for numerous Tony awards, since when Lloyd’s star has been in the ascendant on both sides of the Atlantic. While that is welcome, it also means that in the last six years Lloyd has forged his own particular style: a hi-tech minimalism that involves abandonment of scenery, heavily miked actors and ubiquitous cameras. It worked well for his version ofSunset Boulevardpartly because Nicole Scherzinger gave a dazzling performance and partly because the musical is about the narcissism of the film industry. As the cameras tracked every gesture of the actors, I was reminded of Billy Wilder’s quip on seeing the original stage production: “It’ll make a good movie.”View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler as Eva Perón sings Don’t Cry for Me Argentina on a balcony outside the London Palladium.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PABut similar techniques were used less happily in Lloyd’s production ofRomeo and Juliet. The idea that for their first encounter Tom Holland’s Romeo should be alone on stage and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers’s Juliet should be partying in the theatre foyer struck me as absurd. Lloyd’s belief in amplified sound also had fatal consequences in his Drury LaneTempest. Instead of the tonal variety of the human voice we got an homogenised sound in which, with the exception of Selina Cadell’s Gonzalo, it was difficult to tell who was speaking. I thought back wistfully to the 1957 production of The Tempest at that theatre in which the unaided voices of John Gielgud, Alec Clunes and Robert Harris had a distinct and beautiful resonance.Lloyd is a man of undoubted talent, and technology has a place in modern theatre. But he is in danger of falling back on a formula and, without a strong producer behind him, succumbing to the modern cult of the director. Ideally, theatre is a coalition of all the talents in which writer, actor and director are all working to the fullest possible realisation of the work in question. I look forward to seeing how Evita plays at the London Palladium but we should remember that Everybody’s Talking About Jamie is the title of a musical and not a recipe for theatrical success.Evita is at thePalladium, London, until 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreJamie LloydWest EndMusicalsAndrew Lloyd WebberHarold PinterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first, a lengthy video segment, includes footage throughout the decades, from Motown to the modern day. The second is far grander. As the house lights go down, the Manchester-basedHallé Orchestra, as well as Ross’s band, launch into an instrumental medley of her biggest hits. There’s a rambunctious brass and woodwind section, the glorious swell of strings and four enthusiastic backup singers side-stepping to the music. Then, the woman herself, shuffling on to the stage in a glittering dress as she launches into I’m Coming Out.The opening of this show is relentless: Ross may be 81, but she barely gives herself or the audience time to catch their breath as she blasts through Baby Love, You Can’t Hurry Love, Come See About Me and Stop! In the Name of Love. “More excitement,” she says between songs. “Here we go!”Another less qualified performer may have found themselves dwarfed by the number of musicians on stage, but even with some off-kilter sound levels, Ross more than holds her own. Her voice, while perhaps not as pristine as it once was, is still strong, and for the m ost part she sounds fantastic, even if she leaves the final key change of Chain Reaction, which is given a lively arrangement by the orchestra, in the hands of her backup singers. Her voice shines during her rendition of Billie Holiday’s Good Morning Heartache, the delicacy of her performance seeming to shrink the arena into something far more intimate.You might think that things would dip during the section focused on Ross’s 2021 albumThank You, but these songs are each cut back. Before too long she’s back with the hits: Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You’re Going To) seamlessly transitions into Ain’t No Mountain High Enough, a two-hander so euphoric it should be the finale.Instead, Ross ends with an extended version of Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive and an encore of Thank You, a conclusion that’s not as explosive as this lively show deserves, but nonetheless feels fitting. After all, it’s easy to feel grateful thatDiana Rossis still so good.Explore more on these topicsDiana RossPop and rockHallé Orchestralive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

This sort of tension, the push-pull between genuine vulnerability and an exploration of aesthetics, has always been there in her music, and her wonderfully ambitious first stadium tour runs on it. Its theatrical staging and big ideas are all the more remarkable thanks to some very human moments of doubt.Opening with Stars Fell on Alabama, one of several new songs foreshadowing a country record that might be around the corner, Del Rey’s voice is barely there, with its final notes followed by a dash to the wings to kiss her husband. But she stays on the rails. During Chemtrails Over the Country Club and Ultraviolence, she falls to the floor in Busby Berkeley-esque arrangements alongside her dancers, her vocals now steely as power chords and pulsing red lights ratchet up the drama.View image in fullscreenBravura … Lana Del Rey at Cardiff Principality Stadium.Photograph: Joe Okpako   /Projoe photographyAt the heart of the concert is a remarkable set piece following Quiet in the South. The house starts to burn, its air of Douglas Sirk melodrama and stultifying domesticity tumbling into Hitchcockian mania. A section of Bernard Herrmann’s Vertigo score plays and Del Rey answers it with an off-stage recitation from Allen Ginsberg’s Howl, which becomes the intro to Young and Beautiful. It’s bravura stuff, capped by her gradual rise from a secondary stage as the track ends, now clad in a cocktail dress. The crowd comes unglued.Famously, though, the problem with big swings are the misses. There are a few here, notably a hologram Lana sitting in a window while snippets of Norman Fucking Rockwell and Arcadia ring from the speakers. Aside from wasting two killer songs, it creates an unwanted break in the dialogue she maintains between artist and audience elsewhere – there aren’t many stadium spectacles driven by the gut-level understanding found in Del Rey’s plea to the room during a mesmerising Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd: “Don’t forget me.” Not a chance.Touring the UK and Irelanduntil 4 July 2025Explore more on these topicsLana Del ReyPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It has inspired books (Edmund White’s 1973 novel, Forgetting Elena), a 2022 eponymous romcom and now, a fashion show for Saint Laurent.Taking place atParis fashion weekin 30C heat more suited to a vacation, the show notes named the beach spot as a reference for the creative director, Anthony Vaccarello. They placed the show “somewhere between Paris and Fire Island, where escape becomes elegance, and desire becomes a language”.The collection started with this mood: the first look was a pair of short shorts worn with a silk shirt and sunglasses. There’s little doubt this shape will be on trend for men next year, withPrada also showing it in their show in Milan last week.But as well as beach-ready items, the detail of shorts found their way on to the waistband of tailoring and pastel colours ideal for summer. There was a lot of workwear too, but rather than the more relaxed kind found in most offices in 2025, these designs committed to the same extreme 80s power-dressing shoulders seen in Vaccarello’s hit womenswear collection shown earlier this year.View image in fullscreenShort shorts and silk shirts were on display during the show.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersStriped shirts and ties, trenchcoats and suits were included, often in the jewel tones associated with the brand. Every model wore sunglasses. As well as complementing the holiday feel and the weather outside, there was also a commercial angle: these are the entry-level designs customers can purchase before they can afford a suit.The show took place in the grand Bourse de Commerce, an former stock exchange where the art collection of François Pinault – the original owner of Saint Laurent’s parent company, Kering – has been housed since 2021. The models walked around an installation called Clinamen by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot, which resembled the kind of swimming pool found on holidays.Although the text clarified that the collection was not nostalgic – “not homage. Not memory. Continuity” – it was coupled with an image of a young Yves Saint Laurent wearing short shorts on a tennis court in Oran in Algeria, taken in about 1950, when the designer was a teenager. It also namechecked artists Stanton, Angus and Ellis – presumably Larry Stanton, Patrick Angus and Darrel Ellis – all of whom documented LGBTQ+ life in the 70s and 80s, with Stanton a regular on Fire Island.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This month alone, 82-year-old Christopher Walken appeared in their advertising campaign – a clever move at a time when older legends are appreciated in fashion – and Rihanna, forever influential for her style, was spotted wearing the brand’s clothes. The thigh-high patent waders that were in the January men’s shows have also caused something of a sensation – with both Pedro Pascal and designer Marc Jacobs wearing them recently.Even with this profile, the brand – like many luxury brands – is seeing a decline in sales. A report offinancial results across the Kering groupfor the first quarter of 2025 shows revenue was down 9%. This figure puts it in the middle of its stablemates, with Gucci’s revenue down 25% and Bottega Veneta’s revenue up by 4%. Kering announced Luca de Meo as the new CEO this month, and the man now charged with improving brand performances. Unusually for fashion, de Meo’s experience is from a different sector - he was previously CEO of Renault cars. However, the industry seems to approve of the appointment.

Electronic waste is one of the world’s fastest-growing waste streams, and experts say fast tech is playing an increasingly significant role.In the UK, it is estimated that more than 1.14bn of these small electronic gadgets (including vapes) are bought a year and about half (589m) are disposed of in that same time, which is equivalent to 19 a second, according to Material Focus, the organisation behind the Recycle Your Electricals campaign.Safe and easy ways to recycle electricals – and even get money for your old gadgetsRead more“We’ve had fast food, we’ve had fast fashion, and we’re now in the age of fast tech,” says Scott Butler, the executive director of Material Focus. “We’re not moralist against technology, but what we are concerned about is the volume of low-quality, cheap, flimsy products that are flooding the market, which end up binned or unused.”Fast tech is seen as disposable by more than a third of Britons, according to a survey, and this is, in part, due to the low price point, Butler says. “[It] might be cheap but it’s not disposable. In fact, anything with a plug, battery or cable should never be binned. They’re full of useful metals and can be used again,” he adds.Butler highlights “fad” fast tech as a key issue – cheap items that are bought at certain times of year or for particular occasions, such as mini-fans as the UK warms up or light-up Christmas jumpers. About 7.1m mini-fans were bought in the UK last year and more than 3.5m have already been discarded or forgotten in drawers in that same period.“We just had a heatwave. I’m sure the sale of mini-fans has boomed during that period. There’s nothing wrong in trying to keep yourself cool, but we urge people, if you do need those things, try to buy the best version of it that you can so that it has a much better chance of lasting more than a summer,” he said.Laura Young, an environmental scientist and campaigner, says fast tech represents a new kind of environmental threat – not just because of the potentially toxic chemicals many contain, but because of the sheer volume and disposability.“We have never had throwaway technology like this before,” she says. “And I think people maybe just genuinely don’t realise that there are electronic components inside of a lot of these tiny devices.View image in fullscreenMany users are unaware that electronic vapes contain batteries.Photograph: bennphoto/Shutterstock“With vapes, a lot of people who use them were like, ‘there’s a battery in there?’, and they’d never thought.

There was no disposable technology. So I think it’s right that you would never assume that anything you’re being sold is a disposable technology, because that’s not normal,” she says.And while it is unlikely the amount of fast tech on the market will decline any time soon, Butler says it is crucial to change how we think about it. “Ultimately these things are sold because people buy them. If people didn’t buy them, then obviously they wouldn’t be on the market.“Just be a bit more mindful about what you buy, how you use it, and what you do with it when you no longer need it. Never bin it when it no longer works,” he says, urging people to instead collect their electricals andfind their nearest recycling point using the locator online.There is also a push for better repair, reuse and borrowing options.

As with tomatoes, when Columbus returned from the Americas in the late 15th century, he presented peppers as a gift to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and they very quickly became a key part of our cooking traditions. The pepper’s most iconic contribution to Spanish cuisine is surely pimentón de la Vera, or smoked paprika, which is an essential seasoning in a lot of Spanish cooking, adding exquisite depth to stews, rice dishes, seafood and, of course, chorizo. But we also celebrate fresh peppers in all their guises. Padrón peppers are, of course, a classic tapa, whilepimientos rellenos(stuffed peppers) are filled every which way, from seafood and minced meat to creamy bechamel. From the royal court to home kitchens, peppers have taken root in our culinary culture.Pimentos rellenos (green peppers stuffed with slow-cooked ragu – pictured top)Stuffedpiquillopeppers have long been popular in restaurants and homes across Spain, and are often filled with oxtail or bacalao. This dish provides a similar comforting experience, maintaining the essence of the traditional classic while at the same time being a bit more accessible, making it perfect for home cooking. Serve with a lovely glass ofbobal, a wine from a grape variety common in Valencia and Utiel-Requena. Its richness will complement the bold flavours of the stuffed peppers. You can make the ragu in advance and freeze it, then defrost and pick things up again from the last paragraph.Prep15 minCook2 hr 40 min+Makes83 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped2 celery stalks, trimmed and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed200gcooking chorizo, skinned and finely chopped500gpork mince1 star aniseFinely grated zest of 1 lemon200mlwhite wine400gtin tomatoes2 tbsp tomato puree350mlchicken stockFlaky sea salt andblack pepper8 large green bell peppersHeat the oil in a large saute pan, then gently fry the onion and celery for 10 minutes, until really soft. Add the garlic and chorizo and cook for a further five minutes, until the chorizo releases all its oils.Add the pork mince, turn up the heat and brown all over, breaking up the mince with a spoon so it doesn’t clump. Stir in the star anise, lemon zest and white wine, leave to bubble for a few minutes, then tip in the tomatoes, tomato puree and stock. Season well, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook, stirring occasionally, for two to three hours; add a splash more stock or water if the ragu threatens to reduce too far and dry out.Half an hour before you want to serve, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Cut the tops off the peppers and carefully remove and discard the pith and seeds with a spoon. Arrange the peppers in a roasting tin in which they will fit quite snugly, drizzle with olive oil and season well, then roast for 15–20 minutes, until soft but still holding their shape. Fill the roast peppers with the ragu, then roast for another 15 minutes. Serve hot.Green pepper and sardine empanadasView image in fullscreenJose Pizarro’s green pepper and sardine empanadas.Empanadas should be much more popular than they are, which makes me wonder if people tend to think of them as pasties, which are larger, made with shortcrust pastry that’s often high in saturated fats, filled with starchy vegetables, and often mass-produced containing additives and high in salt. Empanadas, however, are a versatile and healthier option. They’re made with a lighter, thinner dough, have less fat, are more often than not baked, and have a crisper texture. They’re typically smaller than pasties, and use a variety of lighter, tasty fillings including vegetarian, vegan and some internationally inspired alternatives. These ones are made with tinned sardine fillets, but fresh or even mussels would work well, too. Serve with a glass of chilled albariño or a crisp, cold beer.Prep15 minChill30 min+Cook1 hr 30Makes62 tbsp olive oil2 banana shallots, peeled and finely sliced4 green peppers(long ones, if you can find them), stalks, seeds and pith discarded, flesh sliced½ tsp chilli flakes1 bay leaf4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves strippedFlaky sea salt andblack pepper2 tbsp Pedro Ximénez sherry vinegar12 tinned sardine fillets, drainedFor the pastry250gplainflour, plus extra for dusting½ tsp fine salt100g cold unsalted butter, cubed1 egg, beaten1 tsp white-wine vinegarHeat the oil in a large pan, then fry the shallots for five minutes. Add the peppers, chilli flakes, bay leaf and thyme, season and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, until lovely and soft. Add the PX vinegar, cook for a few more minutes, then take off the heat and leave to cool.To make the pastry, tip the flour and salt into a bowl, then rub in the cold diced butter with your fingertips until the mix resembles breadcrumbs. Mix half the beaten egg with two tablespoons of cold water and the vinegar, add to the flour bowl and mix in quickly. Bring the dough together with your hands, then knead very briefly on a floured surface until smooth. Shape into a disc, wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Divide the chilled dough into six equal-sized pieces and roll each one into a ball. Roll out each ball into a large disc, then use a pastry cutter or small plate to cut out a 16cm circle; discard any trimmings, or save for another use.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Divide the pepper mixture evenly between the pastry circles, leaving a border all around the edge, then top each one with two sardine fillets.

Ihave suggested wetry “progressive desensitisation” therapy,which would involvelying down together, with one item of clothing removed, but withno physical contact. We would build from therein the knowledge that this would not lead to sexual contact. My wife, when I suggested it,was not at all interested in this,and in fact, she was actively opposed.She told me the problem was in my head and that she had zero interest in physical intimacy.She also said that this wasnormal for older women. Itold her it was my impression that older people actually craved appropriate physical touch.She then agreed that I couldjust lie in her bed fully clothed before retiring to my own bedroom.But this was justawkwardandhumiliatingfor me, because it was obvious that she wasnot in the least invested in my presence. So I gave up the idea completely.In every other regard our marriage is healthy. At times, I consider asking her if she could accept my seeking intimacy elsewhere, but I think this would lead to theendof our marriage. I feel trapped– I love my wife butmy resentment is growing.Your sense of despair and sadness is understandable, and you deserve to be happier. Your needs are real and valid, but in truth this is not a sexuality problem; rather, it is a power struggle that you are losing. Your joint task would be to break down the barriers to fully seeing each other’s simple human needs and struggles, to summon empathy, and to find common ground.When two people are locked into this kind of emotional “prison”, it is very difficult to see a way out. There can be a way, but the impasse that has developed is so well entrenched that it is unlikely to be dissolved without the willing participation of both of you in some kind of mediation process – preferably couples counselling. Many couples lack the communication and negotiating skills necessary to overcome such a problem without outside help.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

There are also so-called “part and part” mortgages where a chunk of the loan is interest-only and the rest is on a repayment basis.One big problem with pre-financial crisis interest-only loans was that many were taken out without proof borrowers could pay off their debt. In 2009 the FCA’s predecessor regulatorofficially labelled them as “high-risk”and, in 2012, it called them a “ticking timebomb”.The FCA now expects lenders to ensure there is a “credible repayment strategy” for paying back the capital at the end of the mortgage term.Interest-only home loans are available – they made up 4.5% of regulated mortgage sales in 2024, compared with 39% in 2007 – though they are mainly used by buy-to-let landlords. They are also available as a niche product aimed at people in certain generally higher-earning professions such as barristers, accountants, investment bankers and vets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said this type of deal “can spell the difference between staying locked in the rental cycle or accessing home ownership and building meaningful wealth over time”.In its discussion paper, the FCA said: “Interest‑only mortgages can be a flexible way for consumers to engage with the property market … We could, for example, explore circumstances in which borrowers could more easily shift between repayment and interest‑only during the mortgage term without having to set up a repayment vehicle.”Explore more on these topicsMortgagesPropertyFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

She’s been ill and needs help sorting out some payments, but when Meg fromNationwidecalls, she starts to talk about other things that are on her mind. Less than half an hour later, she confides that she’s thinking of suicide and has even worked out how and where she could do it.On another day, a follow-up call to someone who reported being a fraud victim quickly takes a troubling turn. The woman’s account has been used without her permission, but it was an abusive partner rather than an unknown scammer who was to blame.When Nicky asks her to explain what’s happened, she tells a harrowing story involving a sexual assault and years of financial and coercive control. She had thought her former partner was taking her phone to stop her from using it, but he was actually using it to raid her accounts.These are glimpses into the work of Nationwide’s specialist support team, a group whose job it is to help vulnerable customers. The building society let me listen to some of the many and varied cases its staff deal with on a daily basis.The calls highlight how money worries often go hand in hand with other problems – and, it seems, how difficult it can be for people to access help elsewhere.“Every single week we’ll see a brand-new situation, and I think it depends very much on what’s going on in the outside world,” says Shannon Hancock, the specialist support team manager. “You may have heard of [the Netflix TV show]Adolescence– that has drawn calls from people in a similar situation.” A small number of cases they have dealt with have involved exploitation – for example, children being blackmailed to send nude photos – and the team has acted on safeguarding concerns.Most banks and building societies have similar teams in place, although the type of help they focus on varies. Nationwide’s team was set up 10 years ago, and its original focus was on supporting the building society’s members (its equivalent of customers) who were having problems with payments because they had cancer. It worked closely with the charity Macmillan and helped people find and access any help they were entitled to, as well as addressing any problems they were having with their mortgages or other Nationwide products.A decade later, it’s helped more than 100,000 people, and the workload has evolved. A big part of the now 50-strong team’s job is to handle payments for people who can’t bank online or get out to a branch. These customers have been identified, or have come forward, as being in need of extra help or support.View image in fullscreenThe team takes about 350 calls a day from customers seeking help.Photograph: Wavebreakmedia Ltd PH87/AlamyTina Grainger, Nationwide’s head of specialist customer support, says some people ring 100 times a month over a period of years for this type of help. But alongside those cases are the more complicated issues involving domestic abuse, bereavement or incapacity. For these, says Grainger, “there are not black and white solutions, but we have the time, we have the mandate and we have the resources”.Calls like the ones above are “the lowest volume, but they are the highest impact”, she says. Support is given to those taking them but, Grainger says: “Not everyone could be on our team. You have to have a high level of resilience.”There are about 350 calls a day and, although most are not dramatic, they are all important to the people involved. I listen to a call in which Sarah speaks to a man who had fallen behind on his mortgage after his disability benefits were stopped. His family had stepped in and cleared his debt, but the team wanted to be sure that he was happy with the arrangements. During a long chat, Sarah checked if he needed help challenging the benefits decision, or with payments. When he said he felt guilty about getting his family’s help, she was kind and reassuring. When she told him: “If you do ever start experiencing financial difficulty, just reach out to us – we do have teams who can help,” his relief was audible.Calls can last from 10 minutes to two hours – the team typically work from home, and there’s no clock ticking down or screen telling them that people are waiting. Listening, it’s striking how valuable it is for people to be able to talk to someone who has plenty of time, with the clout of a big organisation. When the team calls the police or someone’s doctor (with their permission) to report an emergency, things happen.As a result of the calls I heard, payments were sorted, the woman whose former partner had raided her account was refunded, and the woman contemplating suicide got help from her doctor. They were lifechanging – and sometimes lifesaving – conversations.* In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counsellor.

When my son, Hugo, finished his A-levels, I knew I wanted to “take a journey” with him, to have some sort of final trip before he left home. Ideally a journey that would leave both of us with a few happy memories.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Easier said than done: a midlife woman and a teenage boy are completely different beasts. I wanted to walk. He wanted to be driven. I wanted to get up early. He wanted to sleep in. I wanted unusual food. He wanted pub grub. I wanted to be safely active. He wanted to lie on a sofa or scramble along a vertiginous precipice. I wanted conversation. He didn’t (at least not with me, hour after hour). The problem of where to go seemed insurmountable.SE England E SussexBut there was one activity we both enjoyed: making and building things. Could this be the answer to our “bonding” trip? When I suggested we do a three-day stone-carving course on the South Downs and then a wood-turning class deep in an East Sussex forest, he nodded.We could spend our days together, but not conversing. The start time would be somewhere between his and my preferred rising hours. Our creative endeavours could be interspersed with eating at pubs that catered to each of our food preferences. And the travel requirements were minimal. We would base ourselves at my mum’s in Lewes (but there’s a great choice of local accommodation, including ayouth hostelin a converted Sussex farmhouse in Southease on the South Downs that offers options from private rooms to bell tents). To boot, we may come away with more than just a few memories. Conran-ish wooden bowls and Hepworth-ish stone sculptures swum before my eyes. Yes, this could work, we agreed.View image in fullscreenAnnabel Abbs and her son’s creations.Photograph: Annabel AbbsTo our surprise, a crowd arrived for the ‘private viewing’ in which our sculptures were publicly praised by the tutorsAnd so, with a little trepidation, we turned up at theSkelton Workshopjust after Hugo’s last A-level exam. In a hidden crevice of the South Downs, not far from Hassocks, the Skelton stone-carving studio is near the home of the eminent, deceased sculptor and letter-cutter, John Skelton (students can visit Skelton’s nearby sculpture garden during courses). The vast barn-style workshop looks over slanting vineyards which also contained – to our surprise and delight – a very cool wine bar and restaurant. TheArtelium wine estateoffers vineyard tours and tasting sessionsand, having discovered that the wines had won multiple awards, its alfresco terrace became our lunch spot (charcuterie boards and homemade bread) for the next three days.View image in fullscreenArtelium vineyard and restaurantBut first we had to choose whether we wanted to carve letters or sculpture. We both opted for sculpture. We then had to make another decision: what sort of stone? Hugo chose a beautiful green granite, while I selected a large block of Italian soapstone. Being disorganised, neither of us had arrived with any ideas. The course tutors provided books to inspire us and – after a little discussion with our eight fellow students – we both decided to go abstract. After three days of open-air chiselling, hammering, sanding and polishing, we had sculptures deemed good enough for the end-of-course show. To our (continued) surprise, a crowd arrived for the “private viewing” in which our sculptures were publicly praised by the tutors. We celebrated with an evening meal inThe Gun, a gastropub in Chiddingly that serves stone-baked pizzas and something it calls a “gut-loving burrito bowl” composed of sweetcorn, black beans, guacamole and all the other things anathema to Hugo but much-loved by his mother.As sunlight poured through the foliage above us, wood chips whizzed through the grainy air and sweat ran from our browsThe next day, we drove 30 minutes east, to a privately owned woodland just outside Battle. Here, we hoped to master the ancient art of wood- turning using pole lathes, now a heritage craft. Green woodworkerAmy Leake– youthful, petite, impressively muscled – had set up our pole lathes beneath the shade of a vast, spreading oak. After introducing us to our lathes (simple contraptions Amy made herself, in which sawn branches, rope and a treadle turn the wood), she showed us how to axe an enormous chunk of wood into something that would ultimately become a bowl. As sunlight poured through the green foliage above us, wood chips whizzed through the grainy air and sweat ran from our brows. Turning on a pole lathe requires strength, stamina and skill. Thanks to Amy’s expert guidance, by the end of the day we were the proud (if exhausted) owners of two beautiful bowls.View image in fullscreenCrazy golf in Hastings.Photograph: LH Images/AlamyTo recover, we headed to nearby Hastings for fish and chips on the beach followed by a game of crazy golf on the sea front. Tired after all that treadling it was then back to Lewes for some well-deserved sleep.I’m looking at our (proudly displayed) sculptures and bowls as I write. They always make me smile. Not because I see the embryonic makings of two artistic geniuses, but because they remind me of the connection Hugo and I made while working with our hands, of the shared blood, sweat and laughter. Besides, the bowls are perfect for serving crisps.

Schaffner assumed the note was a phone number – this wasn’t the first time a passenger had hit on her – so she stowed it in her purse without reading it. The man leaned towards her and whispered: “Miss, you’d better look at that note. I have a bomb.”Schaffner read it: “Miss – I have a bomb in my briefcase and want you to sit by me.”She complied. The man was wearing a suit and had a dark complexion. His eyes were hidden by sunglasses. Schaffner watched as he opened his suitcase, revealing four cylindrical sticks connected to a wire and a battery – it certainly looked like a bomb. He then told Schaffner his demands: the passengers were to remain seated while the plane refuelled in Seattle; when he was handed $200,000 (about $1.6m today) and four parachutes, they would be released.When the passengers alighted in Seattle, they had no idea they had just flown on a hijacked plane. The ground crew obeyed the hijacker’s wishes and refuelled the plane, while the authorities gave the cash and parachutes to the aircrew. The man then ordered the pilots to take off, flying low and slow with the flaps down towards Mexico.At some point over Washington, the crew felt their ears pop when the pressure in the cabin dropped – someone had lowered the air stair at the rear of the plane. The man had leapt into the night and vanished, never to be found. The only trace he left behind was a clip-on tie, a tie clip and the name written on his ticket, Dan Cooper, which was misprinted in contemporaneous news reports as DB Cooper. The name stuck – and a legend was born.No one knows who Cooper was (or is), not three-letter spooks or an army of amateur sleuths. The case is on ice, but the tale remains captivating. Leaving aside the audacity of the stunt, several questions persist: was Cooper never found because he didn’t survive the jump? The authorities recorded the serial numbers of the bills handed to Cooper, but they never showed up, except for about $5,800, discovered in a state of disintegration on the banks of the Columbia River near Vancouver, Washington, in February 1980. Who was Cooper? A former paratrooper or a chancer? Where was he from?The answers to these questions seem maddeningly out of reach; I understand how greyhounds feel about mechanical rabbits.Fly too close to this mystery and it sucks you into its orbit. Geoffrey Gray, who wrote the 2011 book Skyjack: The Hunt for DB Cooper, refers to this as the “Cooper curse”. The podcaster Darren Schaefer has the curse, too. He got it after reading Skyjack and felt compelled to start a podcast dedicated to the mystery with Russell Colbert in 2018. Schaefer was originally going to call it The DB Cooper Podcast, but ultimately landed on The Cooper Vortex, after learning how fellow Cooper anoraks describe the case.Schaefer explains that he has promised a few times over the years to abandon Cooper, but, like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, just when he thinks he is out, he gets pulled back in. “The DB Cooper story is like the best book I’ve ever read in my whole life, but I’m missing the first and last chapters of the book. I only have the middle. There is no DB Cooper story before the hijacking and there really is none after. He only exists for about five hours.”There are many theories about Cooper’s identity. The name itself is intriguing: Dan Cooper is the protagonist in a long-running Franco-Belgian comic book series, Les Aventures de Dan Cooper. The comics star a heroic test pilot in the Canadian air force – think Tintin meets Buck Rogers. Some of the plots share similarities with the hijacking, including parachuting from a plane and delivering a ransom in a knapsack. Coincidences – or something more? “If you robbed a train and then escaped on a skateboard and your ticket was under the name Tony Hawk, is that a coincidence?” asks Schaefer.View image in fullscreen‘He deserved to get caught – he got people killed’ …(clockwise from top left)the hijacked plane; a skull found during a search in Oregon in 1975; a helicopter search in Washington in 1976; and a dig on the Columbia River in 1980.Composite: Guardian Design; AP/Bettmann ArchiveWas the hijacker inspired by the comics? The series was not well known outside the Francophone world; perhaps he was Canadian. If so, that would narrow the search to fewer than 2.9 million people, roughly the number of French Canadian males in 1971.What about the money? Always follow the money, they say. Only the money leads nowhere. In more than 50 years, not a single bill from the ransom has appeared in circulation, despite the notes’ serial numbers being shared with banks across the US. (The money found in 1980 brought investigators no closer to the truth.)The simplest explanation for what became of Cooper is that he failed to land safely; his body and loot were lost to the elements and the passage of time. This was the prevailing wisdom among the originalFBIinvestigators. Cooper was wearing a suit and dress shoes and jumped into thick clouds and heavy rain on a freezing night above the Washington wilderness – not the best attire for parachuting or the hike he would have had to make upon landing.Cooper instructed the pilots to fly towards Mexico, but he had no way of knowing the exact flight path they were taking, due to the dense cloud cover. The landscape of the Pacific Northwest is wildly diverse: Cooper could have plummeted into a crag on a mountain, plunged into a lake or crashed into a ravine just as easily as alighted softly on flat agricultural land.But Marty Andrade is not convinced Cooper is dead. The Minnesota author has been following the Cooper mystery for more than a decade. In his book about the case, he argues that the statistics on parachuting survival rates favour Cooper. Importantly, he doesn’t believe Cooper jumped over wilderness.“He probably jumped much closer to a town called Battle Ground, Washington,” Andrade says. “Now, there are a lot of trees and stuff, but it is well‑developed agricultural land, fairly flat compared with the Cascades [the mountain range that runs from southern British Columbia in Canada to northern California in the US]. And if you look at the timing of where the aircraft was, he may have landed within a mile or two of this town.”Karen Humes, a professor at the University of Idaho’s department of earth and spatial sciences, agrees. With the help of her students, Humes created an interactive map of Cooper’s probable flight path and determined that he most likely parachuted over farmland. “It’s a complete myth that it was a wilderness,” she says. “We know it well enough to be confident that he jumped somewhere between Battle Ground, which is a very small town just north of Vancouver, Washington, and just barely south of the Columbia River. So, we’re talking the suburbs of Vancouver and the terrain is pretty flat.”Whether or not he survived the jump is probably moot at this point. Cooper was thought to be about 40. If his behaviour on the flight provides a window into his lifestyle, then he was a heavy smoker and prone to taking absurd risks. As such, he is unlikely still to be alive.It’s a complete myth that it was a wilderness where he jumped ... we’re talking the suburbs of Vancouver“I accept the fact that we probably will never know; that’s fine with me,” says Andrade. The joy he takes from this mystery is the community around it. “It’s nice to be able to sit down and then just randomly start talking about why Cooper chose a felt-tip pen for his ransom note,” he says.Andrade recalls the rabbit hole he went down when he learned that forensic analysts had found traces of metal particles on Cooper’s discarded tie. Andrade said the particles are found in makeup, which he discovered while poring over piles of research papers. “I’m reading all these papers and I’m like: ‘What am I doing?’”Andrade, Humes and Schaefer have made many friends in this space, but things can get intense online, with people wrapping up their self-esteem in pet theories. Also, the community is a bit of a boys’ club. “I’m almost unique,” says Pat Boland over the phone from a cruise liner heading to the Portuguese coast. Along with Humes, Boland is one of the few women investigating DB Cooper. At 64, she is old enough to remember the hijacking being reported, but she says she got drawn into the vortex by the rumours swirling around the denouement of the TV series Mad Men. As the finale approached in 2015, it was posited that the series’ protagonist, Don Draper,would turn out to be Cooper. “Which, of course, did not happen. It was possibly a publicity stunt, but I started thinking about it again. And I just fell in headfirst.”Boland has put together groups of researchers and scientists to try to convince the FBI to let them test Cooper’s parachute for DNA. Cooper tore up one of the parachutes he was given to create a makeshift bag for the ransom and left parts of it behind. “This would be at no expense to the taxpayer, as we have volunteers who are quite used to handling this type of evidence. Back in 1971, that type of testing didn’t even exist,” she says. The FBI has refused, but Boland remains hopeful that may change.The Cooper case fits neatly into the true-crime genre, which is most popular among women, so why is Boland an outlier? “I think women tend to want to explain, for instance,the Zodiac killeror some horrible case, because they put themselves in the place of the victims,” she says. Men, on the other hand, identify with Cooper because his heist could have been written by Ian Fleming. “I think a lot of men would love to get an aeroplane and jump out with way over a million and disappear to Mexico with a margarita in their hand.”The first sip from my drink makes the hairs on my neck stand up; a shiver snakes down my spine. It’s a bourbon and soda – the same cocktail Cooper sipped mid-flight – but here it’s called a Skyjack. I’m in DB Cooper’s, a Manhattan dive bar dedicated to the hijacking.The bar was opened six months ago by the Irishman Ciaran Willis and two of his friends. Not wanting to be just another banal Irish pub – Celtic surnames, green snakes and shamrocks – they came up with a name that would stand out. As well as serving themed cocktails – the Flight 305 mixes pear vodka with pear nectar, blackberry and lemon juice – the pub is decorated with Cooper-inspired photos, drawings, newspaper clippings and T-shirts. “We’re running low on stuff at the minute,” Willis says as he gives me a tour. “These were the ones we did for St Patrick’s Day,” he continues, showing me a stack of green T-shirts. He leads me to the bar’s pièce de résistance: a giant framed poster illustrating the story of the hijacking.A Cooper conventiontakes place every year in Portland, Oregon; Willis is in touch with the organisers and says he hopes to host an event.After 50 years of mystery, siblings claim hijacker DB Cooper was their fatherRead more“Do you see him as a hero?” I ask Willis as he pours me another Skyjack. “I don’t really know how to answer that,” Willis says. “He didn’t hurt anyone, I guess. But I wouldn’t advocate for any kind of air piracy. I suppose it took balls to do what he did, but I wouldn’t be advocating for any copycats.”Andrade is more emphatic: “He was definitely a crook,” he says. “I don’t make him a Robin Hood character … He definitely deserved to get caught. He got people killed.” Andrade is referring to the copycats who hijacked planes in the aftermath, some of whom died in their attempts. “And he destroyed lives, not intentionally, but that was the end result. There were consequences to this that were serious and meaningful. It’s not a victimless crime.”Boland agrees: “All the women I’ve spoken to about it, they also think he’s a criminal. Because I think they tend to really sympathise with the air stewardesses.” Cooper drew two flight attendants into his orbit on Flight 305. After Schaffner took his note and instructions to the cockpit, Tina Mucklow sat with Cooper for the remainder of the flight and acted as a liaison between him and the rest of the crew. It was Mucklow who received the ransom; she was the only flight attendant on board when the flight left for Mexico.Mucklow probably doesn’t need anyone’s sympathy. “I just moved on. Maybe that’s part of being young and resilient, but it was also part of what we train for. That was part of what our job was,” she toldRolling Stonein 2021. The only trouble she has had is batting away the hordes of amateur Columbos who pursue her for interviews.Schaefer has a different view. “I want to know the answer so badly I would do anything if somebody came to me and said: ‘Hey, I have all the secrets and I’ll tell you, but you can never tell anyone else.’ I would 1,000,000% say: ‘Yes, absolutely, tell me what happened, so I can know.’”We live in an era of information overload. Facts flow like water and are just as difficult to control. It’s encouraging that there are still some mysteries left in a world where all the maps are charted. If Schaefer found Cooper, there would be no need for his podcast, no need for Andrade to discuss the finer details of felt-tip pens with his friends, no more conventions to attend, no more novelty bars. Not knowing seems the whole point of this mystery. Who is DB Cooper? Whomever you want him to be.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The aircraft was cruising thousands of metres aboveIsraeland as the crew noticed the error, they checked their GPS signal. The plane’s internal instruments showed it was flying at just 1,500ft, well below the cruising altitude of 38,000ft it should have been at.Seconds later, alarms began to sound and lights flashed throughout the cockpit.“Our terrain avoidance system sprang into action, warning us that we were heading for a collision with the mountainous terrain,” the plane’s pilot says. Over years of flying, it had been drilled into the crew to pull back on the controls when such an alarm sounded, but on this occasion the pilot took no action.The crew were prepared for their system to make “spurious” warnings and knew from experience they were still flying at a safe altitude.The pilot involved – who works on long-haul routes for a UK airline – said they had experienced GPS spoofing, one in a catalogue of growing risks facing airlines as they traverse a world in whichwarfare has become newly normalisedamid a fracturing of global diplomacy.Speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the pilot called the incident last year unsettling, but stressed the flight was never at risk. However, they expressed concern that such an event only makes pilots more desensitised to the internal systems they have relied upon for decades.“You are meant to feel uncomfortable in your inaction and that is exactly how I felt.”Flying through conflictsSince Russia’s fullscale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the world has seen a surge in state-based conflicts. By some measures, the proportion of the worldengulfed by warfare has grown 65%since 2021– an area equivalent to nearly double the size of India – with new and reemerging hotspots in Ukraine, the Middle East, Myanmar and central Africa.As the paths through safe airspace distort and narrow, airlines have been forced to divert flights around conflict zones and geopolitical hotspots, while cancelling some routes altogether.Most western airlines are now banned from flying over Russia, forcing them to fly longer routes, extending flight times and pushing up costs. As a result, last year British Airways and Virgin Atlanticaxed their direct flights between London and Beijing.View image in fullscreenAn image posted to X by Flightradar24 saying “this is what global air traffic looks like right now”, days into the Israel-Iran conflict.Illustration: Flightradar24For other airlines, diverting routes through the Middle East to avoid Russian airspace only supplanted the risks, as conflict spreads across the region and pilots find themselves sharing the skies with barrages of drones and missiles – some of which have reportedly come close enough tobe seen by pilots and passengers.‘It all happened so quickly’: how the Air India plane crash unfoldedRead moreSudden outbreaks of conflict – as seen earlier this month when tensions between Israel andIranerupted into open warfare – have forced airlines to respond rapidly. On Monday, as Iran launched a retaliatory barrage of missiles at a US base in Qatar, two dozen flights were forced to divert away from one of the world’s busiest hubs, between Dubai and Doha.The incident demonstrated how the effects of unexpected strikes and airspace closures can reverberate across the world: Qantas was forced to divert two flights in mid-air, while Air India said it would suspend all flights to eastern North America and Europe due to the increasingly narrow path between those destinations and the Indian subcontinent. Hundreds more flights were cancelled altogether.The re-routings are placing a bigger burden on airlines’ bottom lines – and on the environment.As one example, flights between Helsinki and Tokyo now take up to three and a half hours longer than before the war inUkrainebegan, says Viktoriia Ivannikova, assistant professor in aviation management at Dublin City University.“If you have longer flight trajectories, we will have more fuel consumptions and more CO2 emissions.”Herresearch has foundthat on certain routes between Europe and Asia, costs have risen by between 19% and 39%, while emissions have increased by between 18% and 40%.Ivannikova also points to the increased risk of a plane being hit by missiles and drones. In 2014, the downing ofMalaysian airlines flight MH17over eastern Ukraine was an early example of this new threat. Intercepted communications between pro-Russian separatists made it clear that they initially believed they had hit a military plane, not a civilian liner.View image in fullscreenVapour trails are seen in the skies over Hebron, in the West Bank, after Iran launched missile strike on Israel on Tuesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIvannikova also points to the example of anAzerbaijan Airlines flight which crashed in Kazakhstan in December, killing 38 people. That plane was accidentally shot down by Russian air defences, according to Azerbaijan’s president.Even away from active conflict zones, risks abound, as nations push the boundaries of diplomatic norms.In February, planes flying between Australia and New Zealand were diverted while China conducted live firing drills in the Tasman Sea. The exercises performed by the three naval ships only came to light because the warships were broadcasting a notification alert on a channel not monitored by air traffic control, but which was picked up by a Virgin Australia pilot.“As long as I’ve been flying there’s always been a war going on somewhere,” says Mike Thrower, a retired British Airways pilot and flight safety rep for the British Airline Pilots’ Association trade union. He says the airlines “have become very good at flight planning around those areas”.The ‘normalisation of deviance’As conflicts have expanded and usable airspace shrunk, pilots have seen an explosion in another deeply worrying trend: GPS spoofing.Spoofing involves radio transmitters overriding GPS signals to send a false location to planes. International flight experts atOps Group recorded a 500% increasein spoofing in 2024, affecting an average of 1,500 flights per day.It’s mostly concentrated around conflict zones, where opposing forces will broadcast incorrect position to confuse incoming drones and missiles. Ops Group have identified the most prevalent locations as being the eastern Mediterranean, near Israel, Lebanon and Egypt, as well as the Black Sea, westernRussiaand the India-Pakistan border.“I would say it is not dangerous in its own right,” says the pilot of the flight that was spoofed over Israel, “but its prevalence is having an adverse effect on safety.”“It just adds to the workload,” says Thrower, who is concerned that many in the industry are getting used to ignoring the planes inbuilt warning systems, as they are so often being interfered with. He calls it the “normalisation of deviance”.“If half of you is thinking, ‘I don’t think this is really a real warning, we’ll just press on,’ it introduces a level of degradation to the safety of the operation room.”GPS is interwoven into many systems within an aircraft and Thrower warns that the knock-on effects from spoofing are also of concern to many pilots.“These aircraft systems are so interconnected now with the nav system feeding into various other parts of the system … There have been instances where other systems have locked up as a result of the GPS interference,” he says.In its 2024 report, Ops Group says the high dependency on GPS “creates a chain of complexity that makes safety and risk assessment challenging.” It notes that false alerts are now routine and crews are getting used to seeing on-board clocks run backwards due to spoofing.Thrower notes that pilots are trained to deal with such issues and are quick to spot spoofing when it occurs. In its survey of pilots, Ops Group says that the vast majority are confident in dealing with spoofing and report that managing the issues has little to no effect on the comfort of passengers.The pilot whose flight was spoofed over Israel says they feel that flying is as safe as it was four years ago, but the weight of responsibility is burdening crew with a whole new catalogue of procedures that they have to keep in mind.“We are human and when you are flying at 34,000ft over an area that has been deemed safe above 33,000ft, it is hard to completely detach yourself from wondering if that 1,000ft buffer is really enough,” the pilot says.“Ultimately though … it is incredibly safe and as pilots, it’s our jobs to keep it that way.”Explore more on these topicsAir transportIsrael-Gaza warUkraineRussiaTravel safety adviceFlightsIranfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Welcome to the 93% Club, 19 June). As someone from the 93% who left a secondary school – in Walthamstow, east London – many years ago with no academic qualifications, I know the feeling.After years wandering around low-level criminality and unskilled “cash in hand” jobs, I was lucky that a youth worker presented me with two options: carry on earning money through dodgy activities, including following up individuals with outstanding debts for the infamous Kray twins, and end up in prison; or use my brain and get myself off to university.With his support, it meant moving on from my working-class school mates and the closed social networks they offered. This was challenging. It took time to develop new cultural capital, play down intermittent feelings of impostor syndrome and reinvent myself to fit in with middle-class culture – new friends who knew which knife or fork to use first at dinner and learn professional network protocols.Campbell is spot-on. Enhancing social mobility by offering mentoring and support from individuals with backgrounds such as mine in state schools to counter the 7% in privileged positions of power in our class-ridden society is a way forward. I’m up for it.Roger GreenVisiting research fellow, Goldsmiths, University of LondonAlastair Campbellis right about the awe in which we still seem to hold the graduates of our posh schools. Eton is fond of telling us how many prime ministers it has provided, but the fact is that our ascent into first-world status depended almost entirely on people from other walks of life.When the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century kickstarted our journey away from religious superstition, it was mainly the grammar schools and academies of lowland Scotland that provided pioneers in empirical philosophy, economics, science, engineering and town planning. These institutions were teaching science a century before the posh boarding schools in England got round to it.And the movers and shakers of the Industrial Revolution that followed were a mixed bunch indeed. George Stephenson, the railways pioneer, was illiterate until his late teens. But as the nouveau got riche, they sent their children to the English boarding schools to give them the patina of a classical education without having to get their hands dirty, and to have them meet the “right people” – the rich landowners, in this case. And so began the pattern that we see today.Was it the late Fred Dibnah, a steeplejack and television personality, who said this country was made by men in overalls, but ruined by men in suits?David RedshawSaltdean, East SussexAlastair Campbell’s article omits one key element. Many boarders must surely live with emotional and psychological trauma resulting from their early separation from family. Thus many of our office-holders (and usually cabinet ministers) are unable to feel the empathy that good governing requires. They see themselves as entitled to power and are often responsible for doing harm to our society. I welcome the current cabinet’s state school backgrounds, as long as they stay true to their values. I write as a Fettesian who hated and has been handicapped by his school days.George RookLyneal, ShropshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The airlines requested the training and provided flights and accommodation; the training was free, at no expense to the public purse.The visit to Cairo was particularly noteworthy as we took a briefcase full of forged passports to show the airline staff. On our departure, the briefcase was opened by “security” at Cairo airport, the contents examined, and then closed with no further interest. We did, of course, also carry official documents setting out why we carried forged passports, but no one ever asked to see them.Peter HillmanFormer chief immigration officerHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I would go further. All places of study should offer dialogue spaces so that shared deliberation becomes a core component of the educational experience. Students should be equipped with three skill sets for living in a polarised and disinformed culture.First: critical thinking – to evaluate ideas dispassionately, to deconstruct rhetoric and to expose how biases can deform thought. Second: dialogic engagement – to experience the value of listening to, and learning from, others who see the world differently. And third: constructive disagreement – to inquire into the life experiences and cultural factors that lead people to hold contrary positions.Participating in such deliberative environments would equip people to challenge ideologically motivated reasoning and elevate free speech into something more socially useful than the mere amplification of unquestioned received opinions.Simon KeyesFormer professor of reconciliation and peacebuilding, University of WinchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Where’s the sense in this?Jenny BradleyCirencester, GloucestershireI note that a government spokesperson has responded to an inquiry about dentists by boasting about “the upcoming 10-year health plan”.

The WHO’s local office, which did not assign blame, said six children and five health workers were among the dead and that there were “dozens of injuries”.The RSF and Sudan’s armed forces have beenfighting since April 2023, when a power struggle broke out into open warfare in the capital, Khartoum. Tens of thousands of people have been killed andmore than 12 million displaced, 4 million of them to outside the country. More than 20 million are in need of food aid and areas of the country arein famine.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a post on X: “We cannot say this louder: attacks on health must stop everywhere!”The RSF said in astatementon its website that the armed forces were responsible for Saturday’s attack. “The Rapid Support Forces strongly condemn and denounce the barbaric aggression … This attack constitutes a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva conventions, which explicitly prohibit the targeting of health facilities and personnel,” it said.The news site Darfur 24cited the West Kordofan Emergency Response Rooms, part of a network of Sudanese grassroots humanitarian groups, as saying the attack was an airstrike carried out using a Sudanese military plane. Emergency Lawyers, a group that documents abuses by both sides in the war, said the hospital was hit by a military drone.Nabil Abdallah, a spokesperson for Sudan’s military, said the allegations were false. “Sudanese armed forces do not violate international law and do not target civilians, but target the places of militia gatherings everywhere as legitimate targets, against facilities used by the militia for military purposes,” Abdallah said.“These are lies and propaganda aimed at blaming false charges [on] the Sudanese state and its armed forces and [are] part of the regional and international conspiracy against Sudan.”The United Nations’ children’s agency, Unicef, said in anX post: “The attacks do not only kill and injure but also severely impede the communities’ ability to receive life-saving services. We urge the government and all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law. The attacks and violence must end now.”In January,70 people were killedin an attack on what was then the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher, in the Darfur region. The attack was blamed on the RSF.In March, Sudan’s armed forcesrecaptured the presidential palaceas they asserted control over Khartoum. Meanwhile, the RSF consolidated their dominance over the western region of Darfur, where their predecessors, the Janjaweed Arab militias, were accused of committing genocide against non-Arab tribes in 2004.Earlier this month, a UN aid convoy came under attack, withfive people killed, as it tried to bring supplies to El Fasher, which has been under siege by the RSF for more than a year.Virginia Gamba, the UN secretary general’s special adviser on the prevention of genocide,told the UN Human Rights Councilon Monday: “Both parties have committed serious human rights violations.”She said: “RSF and allied armed Arab militias continue to conduct ethnically motivated attacks against the Zaghawa, Masalit and Fur groups. The risk of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan remains very high.”Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He waseventually returned to the USthis month after the government secured a federal indictment accusing him of being a co-conspirator in a people-smuggling ring.Melgar-Salmeron, 31, a married father of four who lives inVirginia, is believed by relatives to be in custody in a high-security prison after he was deported despite the government having given the appeals court an “express assurance” that it would not schedule a deportation flight for him until the following day while his case was heard.In the event, Melgar-Salmeron left on a flight forEl Salvador28 minutes after the order was issued. A court filing for the government blamed “a confluence of administrative errors”.In addition to ordering the government to facilitate his return, Tuesday’s order also gave officials a week to file a “supplemental declaration from an individual with personal knowledge, addressing … the current physical location and custodial status of Petitioner; and … what steps the government will take, and when, to facilitate his return to the United States”.The court denied an application by Melgar-Salmeron’s lawyers for the appointment of a special master for the case, saying that the government counsel who had given assurance that he would not be removed “took reasonable and diligent steps to ensure removal would not occur in violation of that assurance”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also served two years in jail for illegal possession of an unregistered sawn-off shotgun before he was placed in immigration detention, according to the New York Times.His is one of four cases, along with that of Ábrego-García, of people being removed in breach of court orders.Also among the four isDaniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan, who was deported along with about 240 other men from Venezuela and taken to the Cecot facility after US authorities declared them to be members of Tren de Aragua. A Maryland court later ruled that he had been improperly removed in violation of an earlier settlement forbidding his removal while his immigration case was pending.The fourth case is that of a Guatemalan immigrant identified only as “OCG”, who was deported to Mexico, despite claiming to have been raped and kidnapped in that country.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpEl SalvadorLaw (US)VirginiaKilmar Ábrego GarcíanewsShareReuse this content"

Everything is on the table. We are considering, we are talking with the relevant parties.”Zhang said the company had taken 2% of the UK electric vehicle market since the company launched in 75 showrooms in the UK in September, and the curiosity of British drivers was translating into sales – including what he claimed was a “super” hybrid car with capacity for 90 miles on drive-generated energy.“The UK market is quite open. 40% of customers say they are willing to consider Chinese brands,” he said.Chinese manufacturers are intensifying their export efforts in the UK and in the EU in the face of prohibitive tariffs imposed by Donald Trump in the US.Geely Auto has invested more than£3bn in the British sports car maker Lotus, and another Chinese EV battery firm, EVE Energy, is intalks to invest more than £1bnto build a giant new factory on the outskirts ofCoventry.They are also investing in factories in the EU to avoid tariffs imposed on EV imports by Brussels last summer.Rival Chinese firm BYD is building its first assembly plant in the EU in Hungary, and Omoda has sealed a joint venture plant with Spanish carmaker Ebro, south of Barcelona.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it is still four times the tariff rate on car imports from the UK that applied before Trump’s “liberation day” in April.A 10% tariff on general imports from the UK still applies, as does a 25% tariff on UK steel. Reynolds has said he is “fighting” to get these eliminated.“I’m fighting quite hard to make sure we are included [in a steel tariff exemption],” he said. “I believe it’s possible [to strike a deal] on the reciprocal tariffs, the so-called 10%, so there’s still a lot of work going on on that.”Sherard Cowper-Coles, chair of the China-Britain business council and a former diplomat, told the conference that the UK was stepping up its engagement withChinaand Chinese investors were actively looking for opportunities in the UK “because of Trump”.He claimed that the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, would “visit China in the middle of next month to prepare for a visit by the prime minister” and that Reynolds would go to the joint economic and trade commission in September.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryChinaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsManufacturing sectorAsia PacificEuropeInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Indeed, as you noted in February when Australia provided the U.S. with a $500m Aukus payment, ‘this is not a mission … America can undertake by itself. It has to be [done by] robust allies and partners. Technology sharing and subs are a huge part of it.”The letter said the breadth and depth of support for Aukus within the US Congress had grown dramatically and “we have worked quickly to recognize Aukus’s mission to deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt also pointed to progress made, saying “legislation necessary for Aukus to proceed had passed Congress; shipbuilding rates in the US had lifted substantially; and Australian naval officers had begun joint training on US nuclear-powered submarines.”Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, who is in London on his way to the Nato meeting at The Hague, said he was “not going to speculate about what the review will ultimately say” but stressed a review of a major defence project was a “perfectly natural step” for an incoming administration to take, one that was supported by Australia.Asked about workforce challenges faced by both the US and UK shipbuilding industries, Marles said the “human dimension” was a key challenge in securing Aukus submarines.“We are confident that we can get this right, but we’re not sanguine about it. There is a lot of work to be done to meet the human challenge, but we believe we can get it done.”View image in fullscreenAustralia’s defence minister, Richard Marles.Photograph: Hilary Wardaugh/AAPDemocratic Congressman Joe Courtney, co-chair of the Friends of Australia Caucus (and whose district in Connecticut includes the shipbuilding hub of Groton), as well as Republicans Michael McCaul, chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, were the lead signatories on the letter.Elbridge Colby, the under secretary of defence for policy at the Pentagon, is leading the 30-day US review, due to report in July.Colby has consistently declared he is “very sceptical” about the pact and its benefits for America.He told the US Senate armed service committee that the US was not building enough submarines for its own defence, and would not sell submarines to Australia if that might jeopardise American interests.“We don’t want our servicemen and women to be in a weaker position and more vulnerable … because [the attack submarines] are not in the right place at the right time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in March the Australian federal police revealed they believed it was a “con job” by organised crime figures seeking to divert police resources and influence prosecutions.The premier and the police minister refused to appear at the inquiry before the committee sought the appearance of their staffers. Ministers from the lower house cannot be required to appear before an inquiry of the upper house.Last week the staffers claimed – in a letter to the inquiry chair, the independent MP Rod Roberts – that they had the “reasonable excuse or just cause” required by law to not appear.The staff members argued they were “proxies” because Minns and Catley could not be compelled to appear as witnesses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re important powers. No one is above the law and don’t challenge these powers.”Higginson was asked on Wednesday if she thought the government had misled parliament beforethe hate speech and places of worship lawswere passed.“There was absolutely knowledge held by some and not presented to the parliament to assist us in understanding the full picture,” she said. “This is a democracy, and how we pass laws is a very important matter for everyone.”Roberts told 2GB on Wednesday that allowing the staffers to give evidence was a “big backdown” by the government.“This is unprecedented that a premier would take it to that level,” the committee chair said. “[But] the government has capitulated [and] waved the white flag.”Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsChris MinnsCrime - AustraliaNew South WalesLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

Another national record. Pretty happy with that, it’s not a bad first up in Europe.”The meet in Ostrava is part of a carefully curated program for Gout which will culminate at September’s world championships; the Queensland teenager’s place in the team has already been confirmed.On a strong night for Australia in Europe, Cam Myers was also in record-breaking form, the 19-year-old bettering his own national Under-20 1500m mark by nearly three seconds.Myers finished fourth to move to third on the all-time Australian list, just 0.39s behind current record holder Ollie Hoare.“My fastest races the last two years have been miles.

The move marks the first time the UK has used Russia-linked funds to directly bankroll weaponry for Kyiv.The missiles will be deployed through UK-supplied Raven systems – five more of which are en route toUkraine, taking the total to 13. Originally designed as air-to-air missiles, ASRAAMs have been retrofitted by RAF engineers and MBDA UK to fire from the back of a British-made truck. The conversion took just three months.Nato summit expected to be triumphant for Trump and deflating for UkraineRead moreStarmer, speaking before Nato’s annual summit in The Hague, said: “Russia, not Ukraine, should pay the price for Putin’s barbaric and illegal war. It is only right we use seized Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences. The security of Ukraine is vital to our own.”The defence secretary, John Healey, said the missiles would save lives and were proof that the UK’s military and industrial base could adapt to the needs of modern war. He accused Moscow of continuing indiscriminate missile attacks and made clear that “Putin is not serious about peace”.The new package is part of the UK’s largest-ever yearly commitment to Ukraine – £4.5bn in military aid. It follows a £1.6bn deal in March for more than 5,000 air defence missiles and a separate £350m investment to ramp up drone deliveries tenfold.Ministers are also using the Nato summit to discuss escalation in the Middle East and to push allies on long-term defence spending.Ahead of the Nato summit, the prime minister had agreed with Volodymyr Zelenskyy towork closely together on military productionbetween the UK and Ukraine.After meeting in No 10 on Monday, the pair announced a new military partnership in front of soldiers from Britain, Ukraine and other western allies.The Ukrainian president has been invited to the summit but will not take part in its main discussions, which will be highly focused on defence spending.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerUkraineDefence policyMilitaryRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s obscene’Read moreThe authorities in Venice have upped security across the city, particularly in the Jewish neighbourhood.The 200 or so wedding guests, who may also include Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian and Leonardo DiCaprio, will arrive in Venice on Tuesday and Wednesday. An estimated 95 private planes are reported to be landing at the city’s airport.No precise dates or details have been confirmed, although it is believed the celebrations will begin on Thursday, with the couple exchanging vows on Friday in San Giorgio Maggiore basilica on the Venetian island of the same name. The big party is expected to be held on Saturday.Activists said that instead of trying to stop the wedding, they will organise a “no Bezos, no war” march.“We feel as if we scored a victory,” said one activist, who asked not to be named. “The crocodile initiative would have given a bad impression of the city – this is why the venue was changed even if the authorities might try to claim it was because of the war.”View image in fullscreenSan Giorgio Maggiore, where Bezos and Sánchez are expected to exchange vows on Friday.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersThe campaign group emerged soon after Venice’s millionaire mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, confirmed in March that thecouple would be getting married in the city. Protesters say the event risks turning the world heritage site, which has long suffered from the effects of excessive tourism, into a playground for the rich.Posters featuring an image of Bezos’s head on a rocket blasting into space – in reference to his Blue Origin space tourism venture – have appeared across the city.Greenpeace Italia and the British activist group Everyone Hates Elon have also joined the protests, unfurling a huge banner in St Mark’s Square on Monday with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: “If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.”Greenpeace said the initiative was aimed at highlighting the “social and climate injustice” of such events.View image in fullscreenA banner in St Mark’s Square unfurled by Greenpeace Italia and Everyone Hates Elon.Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters“Bezos embodies an economic and social model that is leading us towards collapse,” Greenpeace said, arguing that lifestyles fuelled by “the arrogance of a few billionaires” are devastating for the planet.Brugnaro said he was ashamed of those who protest against people who “bring riches” to the city.Eyeing an opportunity amid the controversy, Matteo Pressi, the mayor of Soàve, a walled village in Veneto with a population of about 7,000, said he had written to Amazon Italia inviting the couple to host their nuptials there instead.“Venice is unique, but getting married in the most beautiful village inItalywouldn’t be so bad either,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosVeniceItalyEuropeActivismThe super-richWeddingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer, who is at the Nato summit in The Hague,has promisedto meet Nato’s target of spending 5% of gross domestic product on defence by 2035.Nato members willingly increasing defence spending amid rising threat from Russia, says RutteRead moreThe review says: “Some adversaries are laying the foundations for future conflict, positioning themselves to move quickly to cause major disruption to our energy and/or supply chains, to deter us from standing up to their aggression. For the first time in many years, we have to actively prepare for the possibility of the UK homeland coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario.”In a written foreword to the review, Starmer, the prime minister says: “The world has changed. Russian aggression menaces our continent. Strategic competition is intensifying. Extremist ideologies are on the rise. Technology is transforming the nature of both war and domestic security. Hostile state activity takes place on British soil.”The document was published on Tuesday, weeks after a separate strategic defence reviewrecommended a major ramp-upof Britain’s defence industry, with a focus on building more drones, more submarines and more capability in artificial intelligence.The security review goes into fuller detail about the threats which the country is dealing with both at home and abroad, naming Russia as the principal among them,given their frequent cyber-attacksand attempts at sabotage.“[The Ukraine] war has been accompanied with a campaign of indirect and sub-threshold activity – including cyber-attacks and sabotage – by Russia against the UK and otherNatoallies and the use of increased nuclear rhetoric in an attempt to constrain our decision making,” the review says.It particularly highlightsthe threat Russia poses to the UK’s undersea fibreoptic cables, which carry 99% of the country’s digital data and which it says are under “persistent and growing” attacks by Russian submarines.It also singles outIranas posing a particular threat, given Tehran’s alliance with Moscow, as well as the regime’s intensifying attacks on dissidents abroad. “Iranian hostile activity on British soil is also increasing, as part of the Iranian regime’s efforts to silence its critics abroad, as well as directly threatening the UK,” it says.The report strikes a very different tone from the last major security review, which was undertaken by Boris Johnson’s government four years ago. That reportwas publishedin the midst of the Covid pandemic and talked at length about pandemic resilience and vaccine manufacturing, both of which only get a single mention this time.This year’s review does not go into detail about the danger posed by China, despite ministers having now completed their “China audit”, which officials say will never be published in full.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Downing Street spokesperson later refused to repeat Lammy’s language, pointing instead to the wording of the review.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of having “gone cap in hand” to China to bail out the UK economy.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoRussiaIranEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He has said the west is “closing its eyes” to what he called a scandalous “spiral of violence” and rising civilian deaths.Recentpollsshowed de Villepin’s stance on the Middle East crisis has made him the most popular politician in France – and that he is particularly liked by leftwing voters, despite having led a rightwing government.De Villepin, 71, toldLe Parisienon Tuesday that too many parties in France were “tempted by populism, one-upmanship and stigmatisation” and France needed to move away from the identity politics polarising the country. He said his party, La France humaniste, was free to join and open to anyone from any political stance. It was a movement aimed at bringing together citizens and coming up with ideas, he said.Asked about running in the 2027 presidential election, de Villepin said it was not the moment to “enter the presidential debate”. But he left the way open for consideration of a possible bid.De Villepin toldFrance Inter radioon Tuesday that the world was becoming a more dangerous place “because we’re now in a world without rules, without international law, where the law of the jungle, the law of the strongest prevails”.A gaullist who historically positioned himself on the centre-right, de Villepin’s term as prime minister under Chirac was marred by the biggest street protests in decades, which forced him to scrap a controversial youth employment law.Christelle Craplet, director of opinion at BVA pollsters, said de Villepin’s high popularity was not the same as a firm intention to vote for him. She said his popularity was greatest not among his traditional centre-right, but among supporters ofJean-Luc Mélenchon’s leftwing party, La France Insoumise, for whom Gaza was a key issue.A recentBVA pollasking French voters a more specific question on who they would like to have an influence on French politics in the future, found de Villepin came relatively low down, in 17th position, far behind the far-right’sJordan Bardellaand Marine Le Pen, and the centre-right former prime minister Édouard Philippe.Craplet said: “Dominique de Villepin made an impression 20 years ago with his refusal of the Iraq war, and today his strong position on Gaza is also making an impression. He is popular because he has a strong voice on the Middle East conflict and part of the French electorate feel not enough is being said about Gaza. This is particularly true among those who sympathise with LaFranceInsoumise.”She said: “But I think that if tomorrow de Villepin had to set out his position on domestic French politics – the economy and social measures – support from left voters wouldn’t last. So I think it’s very paradoxical, and today it seems to me like a bit of a bubble.”The 2027 French presidential race remains open. Emmanuel Macron, who has served two successive terms, cannot run again and it is uncertain who will represent his centrist party. The far-right leader Marine Le Pen was this yearbanned from running for public officeafter she was found guilty of embezzlement of European parliament funds. She is waiting for an appeals trial next year to see if she could run, or would be replaced by Jordan Bardella.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It said “many media outlets, individuals and other community stakeholders initially understood [the letter] to be a statement of the board”.Its code of conduct required deputies not to misrepresent the position of the board and not to bring the institution into disrepute, it added.The investigative panel unanimously found the 36 signatories to be in breach of the code.After considering the panel’s findings, the board’s executive body decided to send a “notice of criticism” to 31 of the 36 signatories.But five deputies have been suspended from the board for two years and, where applicable, removed from elected positions. In three cases, the suspension may be reduced to six months “by way of apology to affected parties”, the board said.Michael Wegier, its chief executive, said: “We are a democratic organisation that welcomes debate, diversity and free speech. Managing diversity of opinion within our organisation depends on our code of conduct.“That code ensures deputies do not create misunderstandings about the position of the board or its members, do not bring the institution into disrepute, and treat one another and the institution with respect.”The letter,published by the Financial Times on 16 Apriland signed by about one in eight of the board’s elected representatives, said: “The inclination to avert our eyes is strong, as what is happening is unbearable, but our Jewish values compel us to stand up and to speak out.”It added: “We know in our hearts we cannot turn a blind eye or remain silent at [the] renewed loss of life and livelihoods, with hopes dwindling for a peaceful reconciliation and the return of the hostages.“This most extremist of Israeli governments is openly encouraging violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, strangling the Palestinian economy and building more new settlements than ever … Israel’s soul is being ripped out and we, members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, fear for the future of the Israel we love and have such close ties to.”The signatories said: “We stand against the war … it is our duty, as Jews, to speak out.”The board launched its investigation after receiving an unspecified number of complaints about the letter.Many of the complaints reportedly came from members of the United Synagogue, the largest communal denomination in the UK. Most of the letter’s signatories belong to Reform, Liberal or Masorti communities.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warReligionIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump issued a blunt instruction, writing: “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!”LiveIsrael 'never had a better friend than Trump in the White House', says NetanyahuAfter a phone conversation with Netanyahu, Trump returned to the platform to announce: “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave’ to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!”Minutes later, explosions were reported by Iranian media around Tehran and in the north of the country.The US website Axios reported that Netanyahu had told Trump that he could not cancel the strike entirely, and that ultimately “it was decided to significantly scale back the strike, cancel the attack on a large number of targets and strike only one target”. Haaretz reported that the single target was an Iranian radar installation.Iran denied having broken the truce or launched missiles that Israel claimed to have intercepted mid-morning on Tuesday. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered immediate retaliation on Tehran.Trump’s allies in Washington were quick to take a victory lap. Congressman Earl Carter of Savannah, Georgia sent a letter to the nominating committee for the Nobel peace prize, saying Trump’s “leadership at this moment exemplifies the very ideals that the Nobel peace prize seeks to recognise”.And leaders of the isolationist faction of Trump’s Maga coalition gave strong backing to the US president on Tuesday, including administration officials wary of foreign interventions, and conservative media pundits who had been openly critical of the US decision to launch strikes against Iranian nuclear sites at the weekend.“We are seeing a foreign policy doctrine develop that will change the country (and the world) for the better,” wrote JD Vance, the US vice-president, usually a fierce critic of US military interventions in overseas wars. “1) clearly define an American interest; 2) negotiate aggressively to achieve that interest; 3) use overwhelming force if necessary.”“It turns out you can just do what you said you would do,” he added. “No mission creep. No protracted, ill defined ‘nation building’ BS. Just very proud of the president and the whole team this morning.”View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers and rescue workers carry a body from a residential building destroyed by an Iranian missile strike that killed several people, in Beersheba.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APTrump had used social media to announce the ceasefirejust after 5am GMT on Tuesday, asking the warring parties not to violate it. Both sides carried out an intense exchange of fire before signalling their acceptance.Iranian state media suggested the ceasefire had been “imposed on the enemy” after “four waves of attacks on Israeli-occupied territories”. The Israeli authorities confirmed Iran had fired 20 missiles, and that five Israelis had been killed and more than 22 wounded in the southern city of Beersheba.Ninety minutes after Trump’s announcement, Israel – whichbegan the war with a surprise attack on 13 June– also acknowledged the truce and claimed victory.In the hours before the declaration of a ceasefire, Israel carried out some of its most intense airstrikes on Tehran yet, residents said.The Isna news agency said that 16 Iranians had been killed in the north of the country, while Israel claimed to have struck missile launchers in western Iran and struck dozens of targets in Tehran in the early hours of Tuesday morning.Netanyahu’s office claimed to have killed hundreds of militants in the Basij, a volunteer force used to suppress internal dissent, and targeted an Iranian nuclear scientist, bringing the toll of assassinations of Iranian scientists to at least 15.Iranian state media named the scientist killed overnight as Mohammad Reza Seddighi Saber, saying he had been targeted at his parents’ residence in Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh in northern Iran. His 17-year-old son was reported to have been killed in a strike on the family home in Tehran several days ago, state television said.An Iranian social media user in Tehran wrote that the Israeli strikes on the capital city were “intense” in the run-up to the announced ceasefire.“The bombardment tonight in Tehran was extremely intense. For a full hour the explosions wouldn’t stop. We are a completely defenseless people,” the user wrote.View image in fullscreenA woman in Hafte-Tir Square in central Tehran on Monday.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAAfter the Israeli government officially accepted the ceasefire, the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said it was also time to endIsrael’s war in Gaza. “It’s time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war. Israel needs to start rebuilding,” Lapid said on X. An estimated 56,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over 20 months of Israeli bombardment.The ceasefire was announced after an Iranian missile launch against aUS base in Qatar, in reprisal for American participation in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday. Iran said it had given advance warning of the missiles to Qatar and there were no reported injuries, suggesting its response was carefully coordinated to allow Tehran and Washington an off-ramp.Trump advisers privately said they believed Iran would accept the US president’s olive branch in order to avoid continued strikes by Israel, and because they had inflicted symbolic retaliation.Why is Iran’s nuclear programme so essential to its identity?Read moreUS congressional leaders were set to receive their first classified briefings on the strikes on Tuesday but they were later postponed with little explanation from the Trump administration.“This last-minute postponement is outrageous, evasive, and derelict,” said the leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat.“What is the administration so afraid of? Why won’t they engage with Congress on the critical details: the results of the recent strike, the scope and trajectory of this conflict, the administration’s long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and the potential risks facing American citizens and our service members?”Top Democrats have sharply criticised Trump for launching the strikes without consulting or informing congressional leadership before they took place. A number of them have claimed the strikes violated the War Powers Act, a 1973 law that restricts the US president’s ability to order military action without congressional support.“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” said the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican.“I’m persuaded by that argument. They think it’s a violation of the article II powers of the commander-in-chief. I think that’s right.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

She had read the news of a ceasefire before sleeping, but did not believe it.“I never thought there would be a ceasefire,” said Sardinas, a 27-year-old psychologist, while watching rescue workers comb through rubble and flattened cars. “But I hope there will be one because we are in danger every day here.”Sardinas, like many Israelis, was weary after nearly two weeks of war withIran.Unlike the Gaza war, which has killed more than 56,000 people in the territory, ordinary Israelis could not afford to ignore the conflict with Iran. Tehran’s ballistic missiles could not be batted away like the rockets Hamas fired from nearby Gaza.Scenes like that of the struck building in Beersheba, which had its top two floors crumpled, while shredded clothes and broken appliances hung off the sheared-open back wall of the structure, were rare in Israel.“I told all my family and friends that I would always feel safe here, this was true until this war. I don’t know if I would have moved to Israel if I knew this war would happen,” said Sardinas, who emigrated from Argentina about three years ago.As she spoke, it was still unclear if the ceasefire announced by the US president, Donald Trump, at 1am local time, to begin “in approximately six hours” would hold.Israel had launched its most intense barrage of strikes in the hours before the ceasefire took effect, hitting sites belonging to internal security forces and killing hundreds of Iranian security personnel.Iran let off five waves of missiles before the truce and Israel accused it of shooting three missiles three hours after the deadline – a claim Iran denied.Trump quickly reigned in the Israelis and warned them not to respond to the Iranian missiles,letting off an expletive in front of reportersin a clear sign of impatience with both countries.After announcing their commitment to the ceasefire, both Iranian and Israeli officials claimed victory.“The enemy was left with no option but to retreat, express regret and unilaterally bring its aggression to a halt,” the Iranian supreme national security council said in a statement.“This is a great success for the people of Israel and its fighters, who removed two existential threats to our country, and ensured the eternity of Israel,” an Israeli government statement said.‘A pause before something worse’: Iranians wary of what future holdsRead moreIn Israel, there was a palpable sense of victory – and relief that the fighting was over.“I want to be safe. For 10 years Iran has said they want to kill us. If what the president of the US says is true, that we’ve gotten rid of the atomic bombs, then this war is finished,” said Gil Cohen, a 51-year-old who lives near the struck building.Israel started the war with Iran by launching hundreds of airstrikes across the country without warning on 13 June, in what it said was a pre-emptive operation meant to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded by shooting off a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel, kicking off 12 days of tit-for-tat fighting.Iran has long insisted that its nuclear programme was meant purely for civilian purposes. US intelligence assessments put it two to three years away from obtaining a nuclear bomb – an estimate with which Israel and Trump disagreed.In total, 29 people were killed and hundreds more wounded by Iranian attacks in Israel. At least 430 people were killed and more than 3,500 wounded by Israeli strikes in Iran, according to official sources, though the real number is suspected to be higher. Hundreds of thousands of people were also displaced within Iran by the attacks.To Sardinas, that toll was justified. She said Israel was “doing the world’s dirty work” by setting back Iran’s nuclear programme.“Of course the war was worth it, it’s not worth it to stop nuclear weapons? Someone needed to do it. We are attacking them first to prevent their attacks,” she said.Another passerby pushing his two daughters in a stroller said he thought a ceasefire had come too soon, as he was sceptical that enough damage had been done to Iran.Amnesty International said the 12 days of fighting had had devastating effects on civilians in both countries, as attacks struck non-military targets on both sides.“Both Israeli and Iranian authorities have time and again demonstrated their utter disregard for international human rights and humanitarian law, committing grave international crimes with impunity,” Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement on 18 June.The rights body later condemned Israel’s strike on the Evin prison in Tehran on Monday, which held hundreds of prisoners, including defenders of human rights.What happens after the ceasefire remains uncertain. Western leaders have urged a return to US and Iranian negotiations, and Israeli defence officials have indicated that their military gains could translate to a nuclear deal that was more favourable to them.Iranian officials have not yet made a comment on their stance on negotiations.After the initial Israeli attack on Iran, the country’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he felt negotiations with the US had been a ploy to catch the country off-guard and he accused Israel and the US of “blowing up” diplomacy.“The war should definitely stop, the best option for everybody is a ceasefire. I don’t want anything to do with this war,” said an Israeli soldier supervising relief work, confessing he had been sending memes to his friends about being forced to fight in “world war three” after Israel began attacking Iran.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

TV set viewing has remained relatively stable with the average amount of daily viewing just a little longer in 2015 at three hours and 23 minutes.Chart showing mobile phone usage is high from morning until late eveningUK ministers ‘too scared of Donald Trump’ to back levy on TV streaming giantsRead moreThe research, which is published by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), assesses that over-15s spend on average 7.5 hours a day engaged in screen-based activities – including using mobiles, laptops, tablets, games consoles and watching TV – up from 6.5 hours a decade ago.The survey’s findings also highlight the “always on” nature of mobile consumption.TV set viewing shows peak viewing in evenings, while computer use aligns with the traditional 9-5 workday. However, mobile phone usage remains consistently high from morning until bedtime, suggesting that handsets are now the most constant media companion.Chart showing social media and messaging accounts for half of time spent on mobile phones“This data marks a milestone in the evolution of media consumption,” said Dan Flynn, the deputy research director at the IPA, which has been running the TouchPoints survey since 2005. “It’s a clear signal of how embedded mobile phones have become in our daily lives. Always on, always within reach and increasingly central to how we consume content, connect and unwind.”The survey shows the dramatic shift in the habits of younger people, with research by media regulator Ofcom last year finding thatless than half of young people watch any live television in an average week.Younger generations have been increasingly drawn to watching streaming platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Netflix on mobile, as well as scrolling social media platforms including Instagram and Facebook, rather than choosing to sit down in front of traditional TV.The latest TouchPoints survey, which polled 6,416 people over 15, found that the youngest cohort aged up to 24 now spends four hours 49 minutes on their mobile phones, almost 50% more time than the overall average. This demographic also spends just one hour 49 minutes watching traditional TV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the IPA study notes, TV creates positive feelings, mobile the opposite.”The survey found that browsing social media and sending messages accounted for the biggest proportion of time spent on mobiles, at 49%.

As Labour heavy-hitters waded into the row, there were fears inside government that the number would rise and scupper Starmer’s changes to benefits.The mayor of London,Sadiq Khan, was among those urging the prime minister to drop his plans, warning they would “destroy the financial safety net” for millions of people.While cabinet ministers were deployed to win over Labour rebels, some whips and government aides were accused by MPs of threatening deselection and suggesting a defeat could blow up the government. No 10 denied the claims.The Labour rebels, including senior committee chairs, have tabled an amendment that calls for the government to pause the legislation and bring forward the promised £1bn to get more people into work first. If ministers do not agree, they will try to vote the bill down.Widespread Labour dissent over welfare bill is sign things are going very badly for StarmerRead moreThe scale of the rebellion appeared to take Downing Street, and even some of the Labour backbenchers, by surprise, amid concerns that thousands of vulnerable people could be plunged into poverty as a result of losing their disability benefits.Starmer, however, said on Tuesday that he would press ahead with the overhaul, insisting there was a “clear moral case” for change.Speaking on his way to the Nato summit in The Hague, the prime minister defended the plans to tighten the eligibility criteria for personal independence payment (Pip).“There is a clear moral case, which is: the current system doesn’t help those who want to get into work,” he said.“It traps people. I think it’s 1,000 people a day going on to Pip. The additions to Pip each year are the equivalent of a city the size of Leicester. That is not a system that can be left unreformed.”Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, spent much of Tuesday locked in talks with MPs as she sought to win over opponents. Cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Jonathan Reynolds and Wes Streeting were also understood to have been deployed to try to convince anxious backbenchers.On Tuesday night a rebel said that just one Labour backbencher had withdrawn their name, despite the attempts by cabinet ministers and whips to persuade MPs to fall in line, while 16 more had added theirs.Another said that the amendment had more supporters who had decided not to sign, meaning the scale of opposition could be even larger.The size of the rebellion is enough to threaten Starmer’s working majority of 165 and defeat the government’s plans if opposition MPs side with the rebels. No 10 could opt to pull the bill rather than face defeat.Vicky Foxcroft, a former government whip who resigned over the welfare plans, has signed the amendment, along with the former cabinet minister Louise Haigh. More frontbenchers, who would then have to stand down, are expected to join the rebellion.On Tuesday evening Kemi Badenoch offered Conservative support to help the government pass its welfare bill in exchange for three commitments from Starmer.Badenoch ​t​old Sky News: “I’m just making it very clear to Keir Starmer that if he will make commitments at the ​dispatch box to meet our conditions, which are to reduce the welfare budget, to get people into work and not to have tax rises, then we can support his bill.“The bill is a bit of a mess. It needs some work. It looks like it’s been rushed for Rachel [Reeves] to fix other problems that they’ve got. But our welfare budget is far too high, and we really need to bring it down.”With the government unlikely to bow to Tory pressure to make commitments, particularly on tax rises, it appeared that she was giving the opposition political cover to vote against or abstain on the bill.The rebel amendment, led by the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, raises concerns the proposals could push up to 250,000 people – including 50,000 children – into poverty.It also criticises the government for failing to publish the Office for Budget Responsibility’s impact assessment before the vote, and for pursuing changes without adequate consultation with disabled people.The proposed legislation would make it harder to qualify for Pip by requiring claimants to meet a higher threshold in their assessments. It also includes plans to halve the health top-up in universal credit for new claimants from 2026 and phase out the work capability assessment.Khan urged ministers to look again at the hardship the changes would force on vulnerable and disabled people. He said the additional employment and training support should be brought in as soon as possible, and proper transitional protections put in place before cuts.“I have always said that more must be done to support people to go from relying on benefits to getting back into work,” he said.“It’s vital for a healthy and prosperous London. What we can’t do is take away the vital safety net that so many vulnerable and disabled Londoners rely upon.”Asked if concessions would be offered to rebels, a No 10 spokesperson said: “We’ll talk to them over the next week but the government believes this is a good package of reforms. We hope that colleagues will engage positively over the next few days.”The Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, said on Tuesday morning it would be a “very serious thing” for Labour MPs to effectively vote down the legislation at its first major outing in the Commons.Disabilitycharities have criticised the changes, warning they will disproportionately affect people with mental health conditions, women with fluctuating illnesses and unpaid carers.Experts warned that up to1.2 million people with disabilitiesare expected to lose thousands of pounds a year under Kendall’s plans to save £5bn a year by overhauling the welfare system, including by cutting Pip.Anextra 250,000 peoplewill fall into relative poverty by 2029-30, according to the government’s own impact assessment.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityWelfareKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Participants completed a questionnaire that asked for personal, social, demographic, health and lifestyle information.Health information included lifetime diagnoses for disorders including autoimmune and psychiatric conditions. Six autoimmune conditions were included in the study: rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’ disease (thyroid hormone disorder), inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.The mental health conditions the researchers were interested in were self-reported diagnoses of affective disorders, defined as depression, bipolar or anxiety disorder.In total, 37,808 people reported autoimmune conditions and 1,525,347 did not. The lifetime prevalence of any diagnosed affective disorder was significantly higher among those with an autoimmune disorder than it was among the general population: 29% against 18%.Similar associations emerged for depression and anxiety: 25.5% compared with just over 15% for depression, and just over 21% compared with 12.5% for anxiety. The prevalence of current depression and anxiety was also higher among people with autoimmune conditions.While the prevalence of bipolar disorder was much lower, it was still significantly higher among those with autoimmune disorders than among the general population: just under 1% compared with 0.5%.The prevalence of affective disorders was also significantly and consistently higher among women with autoimmune disorders than it was among men with the same physical health conditions: 32% compared with 21%.The reasons for this are unclear. But the researchers, whose findings were published in theBMJ Mental Healthjournal, said theories suggest that sex hormones, chromosomal factors, and differences in circulating antibodies may partly explain the differences.Overall, the risk for mental health conditions was nearly double in people with autoimmune conditions – between 87% and 97% higher. It remained high even after adjusting for potentially influential factors, including age, household income and parental psychiatric history.The study was limited by a lack of available information on the time or duration of illness, making it impossible to determine whether autoimmune conditions preceded, co-occurred with or followed affective disorders.No direct measurements of inflammation were made either, making it impossible to establish the presence, nature, timing or severity of inflammation.The researchers concluded: “Although the observational design of this study does not allow for direct inference of causal mechanisms, this analysis of a large national dataset suggests that chronic exposure to systemic inflammation may be linked to a greater risk for affective disorder.“Future studies should seek to determine whether putative biological, psychological, and social factors – for example, chronic pain, fatigue, sleep or circadian disruptions and social isolation – may represent potentially modifiable mechanisms linking autoimmune conditions and affective disorders.”They added that it could be worth regularly screening people diagnosed with autoimmune diseases for mental health conditions, especially women, to provide them with tailored support early on.Explore more on these topicsMental healthBipolar disorderDepressionAnxietyOsteoarthritisThyroid disordersMultiple sclerosisnewsShareReuse this content"

But military planners say there needs to be a “substrategic” capability that could be employed on the battlefield to deter an attack by Russia on aNatocountry.The F-35As will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk and will join Nato’s dual capable aircraft (DCA) programme – part of the alliance’s longstanding strategy to deter adversaries with a shared, US-led nuclear umbrella.Armed by America: how Europe’s militaries depend on the US – a visual analysisRead moreSimilar arrangements have existed since the cold war in Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Turkey. In each case, the nuclear weapons belong to the US and remain under the control of the US president, because they cannot be sold or given to another country under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Officials said the UK would remain compliant with that international agreement.The Ministry of Defence has a longstanding policy of not commenting on where nuclear weapons are deployed, though there are vaults at RAF Marham, where British tactical weapons were previously stored, though their readiness is unclear.Old storage vaults for nuclear weapons exist at nearby RAF Lakenheath, which is used by the US air force. They are in the process of being upgraded in programmes funded by the US taxpayer, though the American facility is 20 miles away.The B61-12 is designed to have four different explosive yields, of 0.3 kilotons (kt), 1.5kt, 10kt and 50kt, according to the Federation of American Scientists. By comparison, the Hiroshima bomb that killed anywhere between 70,000 and 140,000 people had an explosive yield of 15kt.Officials said the new jets will support more than 20,000 jobs and over 100 UK suppliers, though the jets are manufactured by US defence firm Lockheed Martin.Ministers have also emphasised the cost benefit of switching from the F-35B which costs roughly £100m, to the F-35A model, which they claim will deliver savings of up to 25% per aircraft. The purchase is part of a longstanding plan to acquire up to 138 F-35s in total.Starmer added: “Supporting 100 businesses across the country and more than 20,000 jobs, these F35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies.”Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, welcomed the move as “a robust British contribution to the alliance”.The decision follows warnings in this year’s strategic defence review about rising global instability and renewed nuclear threats. The defence secretary, John Healey, said the announcement reflected a “Nato-first” strategy and used defence as a “growth engine” for the UK economy.The government has warned in a newly published security strategy that Britain needs toprepare for the possibility of being attackedon its own soil. Russia’s military buildup and Iran’s increasing attacks on dissidents abroad mean the country could soon find itself involved in a domestic war, the review said.“For the first time in many years, we have to actively prepare for the possibility of the UK homeland coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario,” the review said.The warning echoed the recent comments from Rutte that, without a big increase in defence spending, British people “better learn to speak Russian”. Starmer, who is at theNato summit in The Hague, has promised to meet Nato’s target of spending 5% of gross domestic product on defence by 2035.The security review goes into fuller detail about the threats that the country is dealing with both at home and abroad, naming Russia as the principal among them,given the Kremlin’s frequent cyber-attacksand attempts at sabotage.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNuclear weaponsMilitaryKeir StarmerNatoUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

For one with a working majority of 165 MPs, it suggests that things are, in fact, going very badly.This was the scenario Keir Starmer faced on Tuesday after more than 100LabourMPs signed an amendment to his welfare bill which could blow up his attempts to reform the disability benefits system.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, spent the day in one-to-one meetings with MPs who are deeply concerned about the impact of the cuts on the most vulnerable people. Ministers including Angela Rayner, Jonathan Reynolds and Wes Streeting hit the phones.Whips and government aides were also deployed, with rebel MPs told their colleagues were removing their names from the amendment, and unsanctioned briefings that the vote should be treated as a confidence issue.There were even claims – denied by No 10 – of aides issuing veiled threats to MPs about deselections and warning that a defeat could bring the government down. Yet the attempts did not appear to be moving the dial.Sadiq Khan joins growing Labour rebellion against disability benefit cutsRead moreA leading Labour rebel suggested that the number of MPs who had signed the amendment on Monday night – 108 – had now risen to 127, though that number cannot be confirmed until after the House of Commons rises late on Tuesday night.“The numbers have definitely been moving, but not necessarily in the right way,” admitted one government insider.Yet there are also those inside government who are frustrated at No 10’s handling of welfare reform. First, for failing to understand until it was too late that they needed to get Labour MPs onside. The view inside No 10 had been that they should focus on the public.“Of course it is ultimately public opinion that matters, but you’ve got to get to that point first, and you need the parliamentary party to do that,” said one critic. “They thought they could make MPs blink first, but it doesn’t look like they’re going to.”Second, for focusing too much on the financial case for reforming the welfare system – that the ballooning bill was unsustainable – rather than on the moral one, which would have been that the current system was letting down millions of people who could be supported into work.At the time of the spring statement, ministers said there were two justifications for the move: to get people off benefits in the long term, and that £5bn cuts to health and disability benefit were needed to make sure the system remained financially sustainable.“They didn’t make the moral case properly because they were so focused on the money. Of course that’s important but it was the wrong way round,” said one source. Senior Downing Street figures have since privately conceded that the approach was wrong.Labour’s benefit cuts will have ‘devastating’ impact on disabled women, say charitiesRead moreThird, the government announced the benefit cuts at the same time as setting out how unemployed people would be helped back into work, with £1bn of additional support available, rather than first making sure that help was in place before cutting their incomes.Kendall, MPs say, was one of the few Labour figures who understood the back-to-work reforms should be a priority, and had argued for as much of the savings from cuts as possible to be ploughed back into the system.Having spent weeks speaking to angry and worried backbenchers, she offered them an olive branch this month, with added protections for the most vulnerable benefits recipients. But it was too little, too late.The scale of the rebellion appears to have taken No 10 by surprise, not least because much of the planning took place below the radar, and through separate groups of MPs coming together. Even some of the rebels were shocked at the numbers.But although Downing Street promised it was in “listening mode”, there are few indications, for now, that it plans to change its mind before the vote on Tuesday 1 July.A stern-looking Starmer told reporters at the Nato summit in The Hague that the welfare system was broken “and that’s why we will press ahead with our reforms”. Downing Street rejected suggestions the welfare bill was “dead on arrival”.Government insiders say dropping the bill would be impossible anyway, not least because it would leave the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, with a £5bn hole to fill.So they will spend the days ahead making their case for reform, while reminding MPs that governing involves tough choices, and hoping that when push comes to shove, they will balk at voting against the government.Yet there are still those who believe that, if the number of rebels does not start to fall, Starmer may have to delay the vote, with all the political humiliation that would entail. One minister observed: “I don’t think the final chapter of this particular story has yet been written.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabourDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

It was not clear whether the new advisory panel would be asked to vote on such a move.Redwood’s presentation was in contrast with a separate report posted by CDC staff on the agency’s website on Tuesday that says evidence does not support a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.Kennedy has long pushed a link between vaccines and autism contrary to scientific evidence.RFK Jr grilled on vaccine policies and healthcare fraud in bruising House hearingRead moreRedwood could not immediately be reached for comment. An HHS spokesperson said the study being referenced was the Toxicological Sciences study Berman said was being misrepresented.The CDC’s briefing material reviewed some studies on neurodevelopmental outcomes and vaccines that contain thimerosal, which has long been used in the US in multidose vials of medicines and vaccines to prevent germs from growing in them.According to the CDC report, 96% of all influenza vaccines in the US were thimerosal-free during the 2024-25 flu season. It also added that the number of pregnant women receiving a thimerosal-containing flu vaccine has decreased over time, with only 0.3% of doses given in 2024 containing thimerosal.Kennedy wrote a book in 2014 claiming that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, causes brain damage.On Monday, Cassidy, who heads the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions (Help), called for the meeting to be delayed, saying it should not take place with a relatively small panel and without a CDC director in place.Murray, a senior member and former chair of the Help committee, has also called for the fired panel members to be reinstated or the meeting to be delayed until new members are appropriately vetted.Explore more on these topicsUS newsHealthVaccines and immunisationRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, after the warden got off the phone with the governor’s office, he asked Gudinas whether he wanted to make a last statement. Although Gudinas’s words were inaudible to those in the viewing room, Griffin said he repented and made a reference to Jesus.The drugs were administered, and Gudinas’s eyes began to roll back as he underwent slight chest convulsions. After several minutes, he lost color in his face and fell still. The prison warden announced that the sentence had been carried out, the curtain to the execution chamber closed and witnesses were escorted out.Gudinas was the seventh person put to death in Florida this year, with an eighth scheduled for next month. The state executed six people in 2023, and carried out one execution last year.A total of 24 men have been put to death in the US this year, with scheduled executions set to make 2025 the year with the most executions since 2015.Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are next, with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana and Tennessee one. On Wednesday, Mississippi will carry out its first execution since 2022.Despite the increased frequency of executions this year, Florida department of corrections spokesperson Ted Veerman said there’s been no significant operational strain.“Our staff are doing a fantastic job keeping up with the pace of these executions,” Veerman said Tuesday. “And we are going through with these in a professional manner.”McGrath was last seen at a bar called Barbarella’s shortly before 3am on 24 May 1994. Her body, showing evidence of serious trauma and sexual assault, was found several hours later in an alley next to a nearby school.Gudinas had been at the same bar with friends the night before, and they all later testified that they had left without him. A school employee who found McGrath’s body later identified Gudinas as the man who had been fleeing the area shortly beforehand. Another woman identified Gudinas as the person who had chased her to her car the previous night and threatened to assault her.Gudinas was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995.Attorneys for Gudinas filed appeals with the Florida supreme court and the US supreme court, which were rejected.The lawyers had argued in their state filing that evidence related to “lifelong mental illnesses” exempted Gudinas from being put to death. The Florida supreme court denied the appeals last week, ruling that the case law that shields intellectually disabled people from execution does not apply to individuals with other forms of mental illness or brain damage.Separately, a federal filing argued that the Florida governor’s unfettered discretion to sign death warrants violates death row inmates’ constitutional rights to due process and has led to an arbitrary process for determining who lives and who dies. The US supreme court on Tuesday denied Gudinas’s request for a stay of execution.Officials said Gudinas had one visitor, his mother, on Tuesday and did not meet with a spiritual adviser.Explore more on these topicsFloridaCapital punishmentUS crimeUS prisonsnewsShareReuse this content"

He noted, however, that the administration’s policies frequently shift.Line graph shows fall and rise of interest rates from 2020 to 2025, with it peaking at 5.4% in 2023 and 2024, and hovering at 4.4% in 2025 alongside a label that says “no cut”“Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain,” Powell told the US House of Representatives financial services committee. “The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined.“Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.”Powell, whom Trump appointed as Fed chair during his first stint in the White House, stressed he was open to the prospect of the inflationary impact of tariffs being less severe than expected. “We aren’t commenting on tariffs,” he stressed.At its latest two-day policy meeting last week, the Fedkept rates on hold, but its officials signaled thy might make two cuts this year. They lifted their projections for inflation and downgraded their estimates for growth.The “obligation” of the central bank’s policymakers is to “keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem”, Powell told Congress on Tuesday.He added: “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyFederal ReserveDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsUS politicsJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said it would respond “forcefully”.Oil price chartTrump said both Israel and Iran violated the ceasefireand he was not happy with either country but especially Israel, Reuters reported. Speaking to reporters before leaving for the Nato summit in The Hague, Trump saidIsrael“dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I’ve never seen before”right after agreeing to the deal.Financial markets have been lifted by news of the ceasefire. In London, the FTSE 100 edged 0.4% higher, while Germany’s Dax rose by almost 2%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei climbed by 1.1% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 2.1%.Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said: “While the agreement initially looked solid, this is still a very fluid situation. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] announced this morning that missiles were fired into Israel fromIran, which caused the oil price to pare losses, as Brent crude edged back towards $70 a barrel.“Brent crude had rallied nearly 20% in the past month as a war premium was attached to the price of oil, which is now being unwound. However, if there are more signs that the ceasefire is not holding, we could see the oil price resume its uptrend.”Airline and travel stocks rose on news of the ceasefire, and shares in Air France KLM, British Airways owner IAG, Hungary’s Wizz Air and Germany’s Lufthansa were up between 2% and 10%. Europe’s largest travel operator, Tui, jumped by 8.6%, while Intercontinental Hotels rose by 2% and French hospitality company Accor was up by 4.8%.Airlines are continuing to halt some flights to the Middle East, due to safety concerns, despite the ceasefire news. BA has suspended all flights to Doha up to and including 25 June, and the budget carrier Wizz Air has cancelled flights to and from the United Arab Emirates until 30 June.The UK travel company Saga reported that its ocean and river cruises had a strong start to the year, and said it had not been affected by the Middle East conflict. It does not offer cruises to the region and only sells holidays to Jordan and Egypt.Oil stocks took a hit, with Shell losing 2.9% and BP down by 4.2% in London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The details may still be a little up in the air, but global stock markets are pushing higher as a result.“Iran’s telegraphed retaliation against the US had already been taken as a sign that de-escalation was the most likely path forward, which had helped lift US stocks, and the rally has extended. Traders have arguably been betting on this outcome for a while. Despite the turmoil over the weekend, oil prices were quick to shift into reverse – an early signal that markets were betting on de-escalation sooner rather than later. Iran’s response notably refrained from targeting any oil facilities or the important strait of Hormuz.”He added: “Lower oil prices are a key component to keep inflation down and something the US Federal Reserve will have one eye on when thinking about whether to cut interest rates at the next meeting in July.”On Monday, US stocks also rose slightly, with the benchmark S&P 500 up nearly 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average rising 0.9% in New York.Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online platform IG, said: “There are still hurdles to navigate, most notably the 8 July deadline for trade deals, but for the moment the market thinks that there will be some kind of fresh extension.“Slumping oil prices have negated some inflation fears for now, and with two Fed governors calling for rate cuts the overall tone continues to be supportive for risk assets.”While the Iranian parliamentvoted to close the strait of Hormuz– through which 20m barrels, more than a fifth of the world’s oil supply, and much of its liquefied gas passes each day – it has so far remained open.Explore more on these topicsOilIranMiddle East and north AfricaOil and gas companiesIsraelEnergy industryCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

People are not only going to lose their healthcare, they’re going to die.”Fountain’s dilemma is one that millions of Americans may face if Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” passes through Congress in its current form. The bill will cut Medicaid across the US by 7.6 million to 10.3 million people, according toCongressional Budget Office estimates, with the majority of the cuts as a result of work reporting requirements, increasing barriers for enrollment and renewal of Medicaid coverage, and limiting states’ ability to raise state Medicaid funds through provider taxes.Medicaid recipients and advocates are warning of the negative impacts of work reporting requirements, pointing to the examples of the two states to have already tried work requirements for Medicaid,Georgiaand, briefly, Arkansas. In both states, there was a significant increase in individuals without health insurance and medical debt, and no boost in employment, one of the Trump administration’s key arguments for imposing the requirements.The Medicaid work reporting requirements would begin in December 2026, with proponents of the reporting requirement for able-bodied adults to work, volunteer or attend an education program at least 80 hours a month. The change comes after the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson,claimedMedicaid recipients were “taking advantage”, “cheating” and “defrauding” the system.View image in fullscreenColby Fountain inside his apartment in West Little Rock, Arkansas, last week.Photograph: Harlan Bozeman/The GuardianResearchers at the Yale Public School of Healthestimatethe cuts to health programs, including Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace unenrollment, could lead to 42,500 lost lives annually. The work requirements wouldrequireolder adults not yet eligible for Medicare, people with disabilities, and caregivers to navigate the reporting requirements to maintain Medicaid eligibility.In Arkansas, work requirements were enacted in 2018, only to be cancelled months later after a federal court stepped in toblockthe requirements.Kelly Fountain’s son, Colby, was born with a rare genetic condition, haploinsufficiency syndrome, and has autism and other health and developmental issues associated with the disorder.She explained the only way they were able to have the expensive genetic testing done was throughMedicaid, which they have also relied on to cover Colby’s medical care.It took 13 years on a waitlist waiver program for Colby to be able to get into a community-based program where he is learning to do tasks such as grocery shop, cook, or count money, but she said the lack of resources for employment, such as support through employment and transportation, has made it infeasible for Colby to work.“He still can’t work because there’s no supportive employment. He would need to have staff with him the whole time he’s working in order to train him properly. That does not exist here,” said Fountain. “At one point in time, if we’re fortunate, we’re all going to be disabled at some point in our lives. We all deserve healthcare. It should not depend on whether or not we can find a job. We should be able to access healthcare when we are at our sickest and most vulnerable, and right now Congress wants to eliminate that availability.”View image in fullscreenKelly Fountain and her son Colby flip through his medical binder in West Little Rock.Photograph: Harlan Bozeman/The GuardianAbout 813,000 children and adults in Arkansas are currently enrolled in Medicaid, covering over 25% of the state’s population.64%of adults on Medicaid in Arkansas are working. Most Medicaid enrollees classified as “able-bodied” are predominantly older women and only comprise15.8%of the total non-working population of Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 18 to 64, according to ananalysisby the Milbank Quarterly.“Most who are not working because they can’t find a job, are disabled, children, or elderly,” added Fountain. “We don’t have consistent internet here. They don’t have access to training programs, transition services, and they haveunderstaffedthe department of health and services so badly they have to submit their paperwork three, four or five times before DHS says they received it.”Arkansas’s work reporting requirements pertained to adults ages 30 to 49 with no children, and led to unenrollment of18,000 individualsbefore the court blocked further implementation, while no changes to employment were recorded.Research on the requirements in Arkansas found theadministrative coststo implement the policy were $26.1m and also resulted in increased medical debt and delaying of medical care for those who lost health insurance coverage.Camille Richoux, the health policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families said the work requirements were more of a “paperwork requirement” and led to confusion. She saidabout 95%of individuals who lost Medicaid coverage were meeting the requirements or should have qualified for an exemption.“It was a mess,” said Richoux. “The rollout was chaotic and resulted in just a massive loss of insurance. Employment did not increase, wages did not increase during this time. The only impact was more people becoming uninsured.”To report their work Medicaid beneficiaries had to use a website, which was glitchy, unreliable, and poorly disseminated to the people affected, she argued.View image in fullscreenNancy Morrell with her sister, Carolyn, at their home in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Nancy is a live-in caregiver for her sister.Photograph: Henry O Head/The GuardianDespite the serious issues with the requirements, Arkansas is seekinganother waiverto impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, in addition to the requirements in the federal spending bill.“We could actually have a situation inArkansaswhere we have two different work requirements with different components,” added Richoux. “Work requirements are not some incentive for getting a job. They’re just a punishment if you don’t do things right, or if you miss a paperwork, or if the state makes a lot of errors, and that can turn into an entire crisis in your life.”Republican senators’ proposed Medicaid cuts threaten to send red states ‘backwards’Read moreIn Georgia, work requirements enacted in July 2023 haveledto similar results, with significant barriers for Medicaid enrollment for eligible beneficiaries due to delays, application issues, and extensive administrative costs ofnearly $58m.Luke Seaborn, a 54-year-old mechanic from Jefferson,Georgia, became the public face of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, Governor Brian Kemp’s insurance program for impoverished Georgians, when it was unveiled last year. Pathways included Medicaid work requirements.Seaborn has since turned on the legislation,telling ProPublicaearlier this year his benefits were cancelled due to red tape twice in the past year. “I used to think of Pathways as a blessing,” Seaborn told ProPublica. “Now, I’m done with it.”“States are not ready or equipped to implement these work requirements, and that’s going to cause even more harm. What happened in Georgia was they spent all this money on paying consultants to implement a very complicated bureaucratic system to see if people are working, and it slowed down their processing of Medicaid applications and Snap [food stamps] applications for everyone else,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy at the advocacy and legal non-profit Justice in Aging, who noted the proposed Medicaid cuts are also shifting more federal costs on to states.View image in fullscreenNancy Morrell with her sister, Carolyn, at their home in Eureka Springs.Photograph: Henry O Head/The Guardian“We know from history, when states have budget shortfalls, they tend to cut home-based care for older adults and people with disabilities first, so even the indirect impacts of this will be really harmful,” Kean added. “What work requirements amount to are penalties for people who lose their job, or when we’re thinking about older adults, for people who have to retire early or often having chronic conditions that prevent them from working full time. These requirements would mean that when you get into that situation, you also lose your healthcare, or you can’t get healthcare in the first place.”Back in Arkansas, Nancy Morrell, a live-in caregiver in Eureka Springs, said the push for Medicaid cuts had already affected her family. In April 2025, she was notified that the hours that Medicaid would cover for her care of her sister Carolyn, with cerebral palsy, would be reduced by 75 a month despite no changes in her care needs.“I don’t know why they decided to cut them,” Morrell said. “There was just no sympathy, really whatsoever. It was just, this is what it is, and this is what it’s going to be. And of course, they send you the papers that say that you can ask to appeal it, which is the process that we’re going through right now.”Morrell claimed a staffer with the Arkansas health department told her “you can be paid to feed her. You just can’t be paid when she’s chewing. So you have to take some time off of that.” The staffer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Arkansas department of human services declined to comment, citing confidentiality requirements.Morrell argued she takes care of her sister 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is only compensated for eight of those hours. She views the additional cuts to those hours as a push to put her sister in a more expensive care facility.View image in fullscreenNancy Morrell with her sister, Carolyn.Photograph: Henry O Head/The Guardian“We take care of her 24 hours a day, but we’re only paid for a third of that, basically. And yet, Medicaid is willing to cut this now,” added Morrell. “The push here is for me to put Carolyn in a nursing facility where she can’t even push a call button for help. She would die within a few months. Which is exactly what they want to save Medicaid funds.”A spokesperson for the Arkansas department of human services claimed the waiver the state is seeking for work requirements, called Pathway to Prosperity, “is an innovative new approach to a work and community engagement requirement” that will assist “beneficiaries attain economic independence, and by extension improve their health. Beneficiaries who are not exempt and who actively choose not to participate in qualifying activities, which could include training, education, employment and Success Coaching, will be suspended from their Medicaid coverage.”They claimed the program was “informed by lessons from Arkansas Works, but it is fundamentally different in several key ways, including the focus on data matching rather than individual reporting”.The Georgia department of community health and White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsMedicaidArkansasGeorgiaUS healthcarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also indicated he may be concentrating on life away from the field when he revealed he got married earlier this year.Rodgers added that he believes the Steelers are the ideal team with which to end his career. He has spoken repeatedly about his respect for Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, who has never had a losing season since taking charge of the team in 2007.“I’ve played 20 freakin’ years. It’s been a long run and I’ve enjoyed it,” said on Tuesday. “What better place to finish than in one of the cornerstone franchises in theNFLwith [coach] Mike Tomlin and a great group of leadership and great guys and a city that expects you to win?”The Steelers are unlikely to get the version of Rodgers who once cut a swathe through theNFLin his prime with the Green Bay Packers, winning four league MVP awards and a Super Bowl along the way. Rodgers’s tenure with his last team, the Jets, was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.Rodgers will face a familiar foe in Week 1 of the upcoming season: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their 2025 opener.

He was later officially diagnosed with the injury the next day.“An MRI taken on Monday confirmed that Haliburton tore his right achilles tendon,” the Pacers said in a statement on Monday evening. “Surgery is scheduled later today with Dr Martin O’Malley at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.”A year ago Tyrese Haliburton was a punchline. Now he’s the NBA’s finest punch-out artistRead moreHaliburton’s injury recalled one suffered by Kevin Durant during theNBA finalsin 2019. Like Durant, Haliburton was playing through another injury – in his case a calf strain – before tearing his achilles. But Haliburton said he would have made the same choice again.“I’d do it again, and again after that, to fight for this city and my brothers,” Haliburton wrote on social media on Monday night. “For the chance to do something special.”Durant missed the entire following season after his injury, and Haliburton may do the same. The typical recovery time for a basketball player with a torn achilles ranges from eight to 10 months.Without Haliburton, the Pacers were outscored 56-43 in the second half on Sunday night as Oklahoma City won the championship with a 103-91 victory.

We look back at the biggest takeawaysClaire de LuneTue 24 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 12.32 EDTShareIt ain’t over till it’s overIf a single, overarching lesson can be taken from this year’s NBA postseason, it’s this one: no game is over until the clock hits 00:00. Whether it was the New York Knicksstealing victoryfrom the jaws of defeat against the Celtics in Boston in round two,Aaron Gordon’s buzzer-beating dunksealing a crucial win for the Nuggets against the Clippers in Los Angeles in round one, or the Indiana Pacers defeating the odds over and over again with their clutch time brilliance throughout the playoffs, a lead has never felt less safe in the NBA.The depth era is hereOnce upon a time in the NBA, it was pretty much agreed upon that a team needed at least a big two, if not a big three, to reach the promised land. But ina post “apron” era, where it’s increasingly difficult to afford to keep more than one top-tier player on your roster, it’s become more important than ever to have a bench that’s not just playable, but excellent. The playoffs are as fast, physical, and exhausting as they’ve ever been. Having the luxury of fresh legs is a superpower.You can live by the three, but you may die by itWe are indisputably living in the three-point era, much to the chagrin of the internet. But one thing hasn’t changed: you still have to have other options. The Celtics found this out the hard way, as their blind allegiance to chucking ‘em up from beyond the arc, which proved a winning formula last season, came back to bite them against the Knicks in round two.Does Tom Thibodeau really run his players into the ground? The data says ... not exactlyRead moreNo job is safeThis trend technically kicked off before the playoffs, when the Memphis Grizzlies and the Denver Nuggets fired their coaches with a handful of games left to play in the regular season. But it was truly crystallized with the abrupt firing of Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeaujust days after he helped lead the team to their first Eastern Conference Finals in decades, plural. Sure, Thibs had faced (warranted) criticism before. But if upsetting the defending champs and breaking generational playoff curses can’t ensure coaching job security, it’s fair to assume that nothing can.Justice for Doris BurkeBurke was only added to the “A-team” at ESPN in recent years, a job that includes being a part of the voice of theNBA finals. But Burke put intimeon her way to the top of the basketball broadcasting pyramid. In her 12 years at ESPN alone, she worked her way up the ladder from sideline reporter, to color commentary in less high-profile games, to, eventually, her current seat. The way the internet has been discussing her aptitude during these finals was nothing short of disrespectful – if anyone knows ball, it’s Doris Burke.Oklahoma loves its basketball teamEvery team has in-arena chants. Every team, at this point, gives away matching T-shirts to their fans to wear during playoff games in a show of solidarity. But the Oklahoma City Thunder’s fanbase has demonstrated an allegiance to their team in a tier all its own. Everyone in the building knows the chants, no prompts on the jumbotron necessary. And you’d be hard-pressed to find a single soul in Paycom Center not wearing that evening’s T-shirt giveaway: no one is too cool to show their support and fall in line. I’ve been to alotofNBAarenas; I’ve never heard screaming at that decibel, so consistently. Thunder fans are, as the kids say, built different.Speed is a superpowerThe Lakers’ Luka-LeBron era begins with a stumble, not a statementRead moreIt is, admittedly, a little on the nose that the defining characteristic of the Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers is that they play really, really fast – but their speed has proven to be their superpower. The Pacers left a graveyard of drained, hands-on-knees stars in their wake: even MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looked worn down by the end of the first few games when his Thunder, a fast-paced team in their own right, met Indiana in the NBA finals. It’s hard to make shots in the clutch when you’re dead tired, and the Pacers and their unique stamina capitalized on that beautifully.The changing of the guardLeBron James suffered a first-round exit, Stephen Curry was sidelined with a hamstring injury before round two even really started, and Kevin Durant’s team didn’t even make the play-in-tournament. While I’m not ready to write off the NBA’s elder statesmen just yet, it was glaringly obvious in this postseason that the young guns, including the eventual champion Thunder (the youngest NBA champions ever) are coming for the crown, not tomorrow, but right now.Rick Carlisle is a Hall of FamerView image in fullscreenRick Carlisle proved his coaching skills this postseason.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APCarlisle has long been held in high esteem by basketball fans, especially in light of his stewardship of the Dallas Mavericks squad that upset the three-headed juggernaut Miami Heat to win the title in 2011. But what he’s done with this year’s Pacers, who are without a top five (or, arguably, even a top 10) superstar, is nothing short of remarkable. His group is incredibly poised, confident, and well prepared, and most importantly, they never say die. Carlisle deserves a lot of credit for that identity, and he will be etched into the annals of the highest echelon of coaching because of it.It’s time for the Heat to set it on fireIt is strange to say that the East is wide open and, at the same time, that the Heat need to blow it up in the same breath, but it feels right. Seeing Miami’s “performance” in round one, if you can even call it that, distilled just how far they are from contention with their bizarre, post-Jimmy-Butler but pre-another-superstar roster. As nice of a contributing piece as Andrew Wiggins can be on a contending team, Butler he is not, and the Heat are sorely lacking in talent and identity. Assuming a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade isn’t on the horizon (and, really, how could it be? What would Miami offer?) blowing it up seems like the shrewd move.Giannis should stay in the East (but maybe leave Milwaukee)The East has been the weaker of the two NBA conferences for ages. But it feels more wide open than ever heading into the 2025-2026 season: The Celtics are all but eliminated for next year with the loss of Jayson Tatum to injury, the Knicks are in the middle of a potentially disastrous coaching search, and while the conference champion Pacers are excellent, they certainly don’t feel unbeatable, especially afterTyrese Haliburton’s injury. Milwaukee don’t have a clear path to put a contending team around Antetokounmpo, so it would probably be wise of him to move elsewhere, but he’d be well served to stay in the same timezone or eastward.The Clippers may truly be cursedIf you buy a plot of land that’s an ancient burial ground, it doesn’t really matter, ultimately, how nice the house is that you build on it. Steve Ballmer is anexemplaryNBA owner: deep pockets, smart hires, boundless enthusiasm. The word “ball” is in his name: that’s how much he’s about this life. But he bought a franchise that, for whatever reason, seems to be destined to fail in the most spectacular fashion. This year, it was getting annihilated, with little to no resistance, by the Nuggets in Game 7 of their first-round meeting. This came after the Clippers showed flashes of being a true contender, with one of the best defenses in basketball. Kawhi Leonard was healthy, and the excuses were slim: the Clippers just clipped.A year ago Tyrese Haliburton was a punchline. Now he’s the NBA’s finest punch-out artistRead moreChampionship windows can close in a blinkThere’s already talk of a budding “dynasty” in Oklahoma City, due to the youth of the team’s core. But if anything came to light in this year’s playoffs, it’s that championship windows are fleeting – and fragile. After their victory last year, many predicted the Celtics were about to start a dynasty, but they were staring down the barrel of a 1-3 deficit against the Knicks in round two evenbeforetheir best player, perennial MVP candidate Tatum,went down with an achilles tearthat will sideline him for most, or even all, of next season. And the Pacers went from being on the doorstep of a championship to facing a year without their star player, Haliburton. Time is of the essence for teams seeking out the Larry O’B: you never know when even the most wide-open windows will slam shut.If anything, Tyrese Haliburton isunderratedIt’s not hyperbolic to say that no individual player has ever had a clutch run through the playoffslike Haliburton had this year. It was truly heartbreaking to see the guard go down with an achilles rupture in Game 7 of the finals, especially considering that he was having a brilliant first quarter, coming out with all the aggression his detractors have been clamoring for. But the lore from the 2025 playoffs will be one that leads with Haliburton for ever – he (and his underdog Pacers squad) have etched themselves into NBA history, and he’s earned a ton of due respect along the way.View image in fullscreenThe results from Karl-Anthony Towns this season were … mixed.Photograph: Jeff Roberson/APThe KAT/Randle trade was a net neutralWe spent much of this season deliberating who “won” the Karl Anthony Towns for Julius Randle trade between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Knicks. The battle took some wild swings, with Towns having a hellacious start to the season (warranting him both an All-NBA and All-Star roster spot), and Randle shaping into form towards the end of the season and into a damned impressive start to the postseason. But both players, too, showed their significant flaws in the postseason, and ultimately, the answer to the question of who “won” the trade is muddy. They are two flawed players with tremendous highs and forehead-slapping lows, and for now, at least, it appears to be a draw.Nikola Jokić is still the best player on Earth …To be fair, I knew this before the playoffs. But watching Jokić drag a ramshackle Nuggets team to Game 7 against the eventual champion Thunder, while serving, in many ways, as their honorary interim head coach, was impressive even by the Serb’s impossibly high standards. He’s the kind of spectacular, once in a generation talent who can render context irrelevant, who can make the craziest pass you’ve ever seen appear routine, who is such a ridiculous offensive force that he’s almost an offense unto himself. He may not be the most valuable player this year, but he is the best.… But SGA deserved his MVP awardIf there has been one constant this postseason, it’s Gilgeous-Alexander and his dependable, humming offensive output. You could set a clock to it. That’s been the case since day one of the regular season, and it really didn’t wane in the postseason, either. The Canadian had one of the greatest single statistical seasonseverby a guard, and yes, that includes all those on the NBA’s Mount Rushmore. In this season alone, he won the scoring title, league MVP, Western Conference finals MVP, and NBA finals MVP. That’s a historical run, and makes him a truly generational player by any measure.Thunder’s thrilling nerd juggernaut ushers in NBA’s nice guy eraRead moreHouston were a piece away (and it’s Kevin Durant)As impressive of a season as the upstart Houston Rockets had this year, it came as no surprise to anyone who’d been paying attention that the Western Conference No 2 were sent packing in round one. The team were on a string defensively, and playhard(kudos to Coach of the Year candidate Ime Udoka), but there was a glaringly apparent hole on the offensive end, especially late in game, when it mattered. Hopes were high for young guard Jalen Green, but he flamed out in a real way in his first postseason.Enter stage right: Kevin Durant, one of the greatest scorers the league has ever seen. It should be exciting for all basketball fans to see how this age-gap marriage turns out come October.The NBA has an injury problemThe evidence is, at this point, beyond anecdotal.According to Jeff Stotts of InStreetClothes, the eight (eight!) achilles tendon ruptures this season are an NBA record, clearing the previous mark of five easily. What was shaping up to be a fascinating NBA finals Game 7 ended with a depressing whimper as Haliburton went down in a heap in the first quarter, sobbing and yelling “No! No! No!” as he banged his fist on the hardwood in anguish. The rest of us could only watch helplessly, having all become injury experts after watching Damian Lillard and Tatum meet the same fatein this postseason alone.The NBA can no longer afford to ignore the pressing issue: the game is faster and more difficult, the season is far too long, and the injuries are mounting.Faith is a skillIt’s a rare occasion when the team who ultimately hoists the trophy is not what we, as a collective, will remember about a given season. But this version of the Pacers, who came just two quarters shy of a championship, will live on in the hearts and minds of basketball fans for years to come. In true Hoosiers fashion, this team was all heart, no fear. They taught us perhaps the most valuable lesson of all: unwavering belief may very well be the most powerful skill. Chips down, odds long, down double digits with a minute to go. There was no challenge too big, no order too tall, for the never say die Pacers. Even though their season ended in horrible fashion, with a devastating injury to Haliburton and an everlasting “what if” along with it, their identity as one of the most resilient and joyful teams in recent memory will for ever be the stuff of legend.Explore more on these topicsNBANBA finalsBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Monaco, Nantes and Paris FC will face no further action.Although Lyon can still appeal against the ruling, the decision to relegate a club that won seven consecutive titles between 2001-02 and 2007-08, and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League as recently as 2020, will send shockwaves through French football.The club’s president John Textor told L’Équipe last week he was confident the club’s financial position had been resolved, having said in November there was “no chance” the club would be relegated.Textor is in the process of selling his shares in Crystal Palace, who are at risk of being denied their place in the Europa League next season as Lyon have also qualified after finishing sixth inLigue 1.A sale to Woody Johnson, owner of the NFL’s New York Jets, has been agreed but the Premier League is yet to ratify the deal and Johnson must yet pass the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test.After receiving the provisional relegation last year, Lyon sold the likes of Saïd Benrahma, Anthony Lopes and Maxence Caqueret in January, and this summer they have alreadysold Rayan Cherkito Manchester City.Explore more on these topicsLyonEuropean club footballLigue 1newsShareReuse this content"

Improving side will hope to prove they are more than a one-woman teamByWim ConingsTue 24 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 19.10 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewThe year started with a big surprise and shake-up of the national team setup with the longtime coach Ives Serneels sacked after 14 years in the post. He had taken Belgium to Euro 2025 but the playoff wins against Greece and Ukraine were unconvincing and made the Belgian FA wonder if the team was still improving under him.The answer was no and in came Elísabet Gunnarsdóttir and under her the team finished third in an extremely tough Nations League group made up of Spain, England and Portugal. She moved to a 5-4-1 out of possession and is trying to make Belgium a team that thrives on quick transitions. In the striker Tessa Wullaert and the right wing-back Jill Janssens Belgium have two fast players who are good at running in behind the defence.In attack the 5-4-1 switches to a rather adventurous 3-4-3 with the left wing-back Davina Philtjens joining midfield, Janssens joining the attack and Hannah Eurlings leaving her inverted position in midfield to become a left-winger.During the short international breaks, Gunnarsdóttir and her team have focused on what happens in both penalty areas and at set pieces. There is still work to be done in possession, though. “In the weeks before Euro 2025, all the focus will be on our buildup play,” she said. “We still have to improve a lot there.”During the Nations League campaign, Belgium often panicked slightly when they had the ball, especially when building from the back. However, they picked up six out of a possible nine points from their final three games against England, Spain and Portugal, includinga notable winagainst the reigning European champions. That helped increase the interest around the team and in May, against Spain, a record crowd of 8,054 showed up.Three players – Saar Janssen, Laura De Neve and Féli Delacauw – will all miss the tournament with serious knee injuries and Sari Kees, normally a rock in defence, has had her own injury problems but made the final squad.The most recent friendly, against France, ended with a rather chastening 5-0 defeat. “The first half was the most disappointing 45 minutes we have played since I took over,” Gunnarsdóttir said. “I take full responsibility. I had my team train a full week on specific patterns in possession that I would like to see against Italy [their first game at Euro 2025], but in doing so I failed to prepare them for this friendly.”BelgiumThe coachElísabet Gunnarsdóttiris enjoying her first months at the helm of a national team after a remarkable 14-year-spell in charge of the Swedish side Kristianstads. The 48-year-old Icelandic coach has lived so long in Sweden that she now considers it home: she is a fluent Swedish speaker and has gained citizenship.She took a year out in 2024 to look after her mother, who had suffered a stroke, and decided to take the Belgium job after a long walk on the beach. Part of the reason? Her dog had run off and straight into the arms of a Belgian couple – as good a sign as any that she should take the job. Gunnarsdóttir is a tactically impressive coach who puts a lot of emphasis on set pieces.Star playerFew countries will have such a standout player as Belgium. The 32-year-old Inter strikerTessa Wullaertis the country’s record scorer, having found the net 92 times and is not slowing down: recently scoring against Spain, England (twice) and Portugal (twice). She normally has two defenders marking her but if she feels she is not getting involved enough she will drop deeper into midfield and start play from there. Any team that can keep her out of the game will either draw or beat Belgium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is joining Nantes this summer and may start the tournament on the bench, but keep an eye out for her when she comes on.Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top flightThe Lotto Super League is not near the level of neighbouring countries. Attendances are low and, as an example, ballgirls or boys are often not present at games so the players have to go and get the ball themselves.

After leading England Under-21s to theirfirst European titlein a generation in 2023, the former Everton midfielder finds himself back in the semi-finals on ­Wednesday evening having spentalmost six months in interim charge of the senior side.“I was actually thinking about this the other day and how fast things have moved,” said Carsley as ­England prepare to face the Netherlands. “I definitely need a bit of reflection time, but it’s been so exciting. It put us backwards a little bit in terms of coming back to the 21s, in terms of the amount of monitoring that we would have been doing with the players, missing out on the three camps, which obviously I’ve done with the senior team.Elliot Anderson finishes off Spain as England Under-21s reach Euros’ last fourRead more“But I wouldn’t have changed it. It was such a privilege to do. But again, I feel like I’m in a really good position now as well to potentially take the team into another final, which they fully deserve to be part of.”It is no secret that Carsley feels much more comfortable away from the media spotlight but he seemed at home in the national stadium in Slovakia’s capital discussing ­England’s chances of emulating Dave Sexton’s sides of 1982 and 1984 by winning successive titles at this level.The team’s progress during this tournament has improved Carsley’s reputation given they arrived in Slovakia without their first-choice striker Liam Delap and the key ­midfielders Adam Wharton and Jobe Bellingham, not to mention seven members of Thomas Tuchel’s most recent senior squad who were eligible.With only Harvey Elliott and the impressive Toulouse centre-back Charlie Cresswell ­remaining from the triumph in Georgia, this group does not have the same quality as the one from two years ago yet defeated the pre-tournament favourites, Spain, in the quarter-finals thanks to their best performance so far.“The skill of a coach is making sure you get the best out of the players that you’ve got in front of you, not trying to make them something that they’re not,” Carsley said. “I think we’ve done quite well in that.“We’ve tried to put them in positions where they can be really ­effective, whether that be with or without the ball.“Ideally, and I’ve spoken to the players about it, you want to coach a team where you’re watching the team play and you’re enjoying watching them. And that Spain game and the second half of the Germany game, you’re on the side, enjoying watching the players play and expressing themselves.“You want foreign journalists to speak about our players the way that we sometimes speak about their players in terms of their technical ability or the way that they can take the ball. I think we’re definitely changing that perception of English players.”Bournemouth’s Alex Scott is one of those who have stepped up having won the European title at under-19 level three years ago and he is hoping to draw on the experience of scoring the winning goal in that semi-final against Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think that brings experience as well. A few of the lads have been there and done it. I know what it takes to win a major tournament. Hopefully we can take that experience we have and take it into tomorrow.”The last time these sides met at this tournament, at the semi-final stage 18 years ago, it needed 32 penalties to find a winner, with Anton Ferdinand missing the decisive spot-kick as the Netherlands went on to win their second title in a row with a team that included Ryan Babel. They have not reached the final since and will be without three key players owing to suspension, including the captain Ruben van Bommel, son of the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich enforcer Mark, who was sent off against Portugal in the previous round.But Carsley is wary of a squad, managed by Michael Reiziger, that includes several of the AZ team who won the Uefa Youth League in 2023, beating Real Madrid and Barcelona on the way. The temperature at kick-off is expected to exceed 35C.Carsley insisted that fear of failure from the spot is a thing of the past thanks to the influence of Gareth Southgateduring his spell as England’s senior manager. “It’s definitely something Gareth really pushed,” Carsley said. “We speak a lot about routine, almost like a golf swing where you would address the ball, take your time, think about your shot, the breathing; there’s a lot more that goes into it. But taking a penalty in a shootout is a totally different mentality. Because of the walk, you have that much thinking time to think about what you are going to do. If you change your mind, make sure you are clear and focused.”Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21sLee CarsleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They also appear uninterested in a potential part-exchange deal involving the Newcastle left-winger Harvey Barnes.Football transfer rumours: Garnacho and Nkunku set for blockbuster swap?Read moreIf Elanga does end up departing the City Ground it is unlikely to be for less than £60m, a sum Newcastle believe is too high.Trafford, valued at £40m by Burnley, will not come cheap either. The 22-year-old, though, looms large on Howe’s shopping list, with Newcastle’s manager disappointed a £20m move for the Burnley keeper foundered last summer.With Trafford keeping 29 clean sheets and conceding only 16 goals as Burnley won automatic promotion from the Championship, the price tag of a keeper whose highly assured footwork is coveted by Howe has doubled.Although the Lancashire side are likely to drive a hard bargain as negotiations open this week, the impending arrival of the Karlsruher SC goalkeeper Max Weiss at Turf Moor for about £4.5m suggests that Scott Parker is preparing for life without Trafford.Much may depend on whether Newcastle – who have goalkeeping alternatives in mind – can negotiate a compromise over the price.At 6ft 6in Trafford’s commanding presence is combined with shot-stopping excellence and footwork that demonstrates his origins as a highly regarded outfield schoolboy player.View image in fullscreenJames Trafford kept 29 clean sheets and conceded only 16 goals to help Burnley win promotion.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PATrafford, who grew up on a farm in a village outside the small town of Cockermouth, has admitted he was “disappointed” whenlast summer’s mooted transfercollapsed.Trafford’s likely arrival places the future of Newcastle’s first-choice goalkeeper, Nick Pope, in doubt. Although Howe would ideally like Trafford and Pope to compete for a starting spot, the latter is much admired by promoted Leeds.

João Pedro is thought to favour a move to London.With Howe’s hopes of signing the Crystal Palace centre-half Marc Guéhi diminishing, attentions on Tyneside have turned to Atalanta’s Giorgio Scalvini. The 21-year-old is regarded as one of the brightest young defenders in Serie A.Newcastle are understood to be open to selling either Sean Longstaff – an Everton target who has also been monitored by Leeds – or his fellow midfielder Joe Willock. They will resist interest in Alexander Isak from, among other clubs, Liverpool.They are expected to offer Isak a lucrative contract extension this summer. While it is far from certain that he will agree to it, the striker’s deal runs until 2028 and St James’ Park executives are determined not to sell their prize asset this year.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowNewcastle UnitedBurnleyPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Enzo Maresca has made no secret of his desire to sign a winger and talks over Gittens are moving in the right direction.Bayern Munich are also monitoring developments around the England Under-21 international butChelseaare confident they will not be outflanked by the Bundesliga champions.It is understood that figures from Chelsea’s recruitment department have been able to hold face-to-face talks with their Dortmund counterparts at the Club World Cup. Chelsea have had two bids for Gittens turned down but are expected to return with an improved offer. Dortmund have been holding out for at least £50m for the 20-year-old, with the payment structure also expected to be important.Delap is Chelsea’s shiny new toy but uncut gem Jackson offers rare point of difference | Jonathan LiewRead moreChelsea want a right-footed winger who can play on the left after deciding not to sign Jadon Sancho from Manchester United. Their options have also been limited byMykhailo Mudryk being chargedby the Football Association with doping offences. Maresca has sometimes had to use the left-footed Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke on the left, even though both forwards are happier cutting inside from the opposite flank. Estêvão Willian, who will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup, is another left-footed player who mainly operates from the right.Signing someone of Gittens’ profile should give Chelsea more balance in attack. Gittens was previously at Manchester City’s academy and scored 12 goals for Dortmund last season. He has not been a regular since the arrival of Niko Kovac, who has preferred a 3-5-2 system. Fifa’s regulations will prevent Chelsea from registering Gittens for the Club World Cup if they sign him while at the tournament.Chelsea have identified Lyon’s Malick Fofana and Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho as alternative targets. They also want a versatile attacker and are monitoring West Ham’s Mohammed Kudus, Brighton’s João Pedro andEintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike. There have been suggestions of a swap dealinvolving Garnacho and Christopher Nkunku, although United are prioritising other targets in attack.Meanwhile, Arsenal are reportedly interested in Chelsea winger Noni Madueke. The club are not actively trying to sell the winger but will listen to suitable offers for the England international.Fifa’s disciplinary committee has upgraded Nicolas Jackson’s ban to two games after reviewing footage of the striker’s red card duringChelsea’s 3-1 defeatby Flamengo last Friday. The striker was already suspended for Chelsea’s final game in Group D, against Espérance in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, but will also be unavailable for any last-16 tie in Charlotte on Saturday.

Agreed at its AGM this month, the EFL is understood to have removed the Scottish ProfessionalFootball Leagueand Irish Football League from the list of competitions clubs are prohibited from investing in.The EFL has concerns about potential integrity issues raised by multi-club ownership, but given it is increasingly widespread it has opted to align its rules with other competitions, including the Premier League.Middlesbrough appoint Rob Edwards as head coach on three-year dealRead moreThe need for greater alignment was highlighted when Leeds’s majority owner, 49er Enterprises, entered exclusive negotiations about buying Rangers ina deal completedlast month. 49ers Enterprises paid £75m for 51% of Rangers in a transaction that would have been delayed hadLeeds not been promotedto the Premier League.The EFL declined to confirm whether it would have blocked the investment had Leeds remained in the Championship. EFL sources acknowledged the Leeds/Rangers issue, but said the changes were not made to address that situation.Under the regulations that will come into operation this coming season, owners and directors are prohibited from having interests in more than one club in the EFL, Premier League, National League, Southern League, Isthmian League and Northern Premier League. An interest is defined as holding shares in two clubs or exerting any managerial or administrative influence.In the Premier League, the Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, paid £10m for a 29% stake in Hearts this month, and Bournemouth’s owner, Bill Foley, paid £6m for 25% of Hibs last year.IFL clubs are likely to benefit from more investment offers after the rule change, with EFL sides eager to increase their options for parking European Union players. Since Brexit, EU players moving to the United Kingdom require work permits issued by the Home Office under the governing body endorsement (GBE) points-based criteria.The GBE system requires players to secure 15 points to pass, with those lacking a significant number of international appearances or not playing in one of Europe’s top five leagues often missing out.Explore more on these topicsFootball LeagueFinancesFootball politicsBusinessRangersLeeds UnitedShareReuse this content"

I try to respect the advice he gives me. Hopefully, we’ll be good for the next few stages. It was freedom. I’m very happy to play like this, without the pressure.”Ilkay Gündogan keen to see out final year of Manchester City contractRead moreAfter last season’s malaise, City need to plug themselves back into the electric play that dominated the domestic game for most of the previous eight years of Guardiola’s tenure. Do so at the Club World Cup and they may successfully defend a trophyclaimed two years agoin the competition’s final seven-team iteration.The£31m signing from Wolveswith lightning pace and quicksilver feet could be the catalyst, the man to relocate the mains for a side whose energy levels flatlined dismally last term.In any Guardiola unit the full-backs have to be able to rush forward and join the attack. Picture Kyle Walker doing so season after season along the right and see the dimension City have missed on the opposing flank by – until Aït-Nouri’s arrival from Wolves – not signing a natural left-back capable of becoming an established first-team player since summer 2017.Then, Benjamin Mendy arrived from Monaco. But a combination of injury and a complicated private life – which led to court cases in which he was cleared – hobbled his City career (he departed in 2023), with Guardiola deploying stand-ins in the position for most of the past eight seasons, including João Cancelo, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Sergio Gómez, Josko Gvardiol, Nathan Aké and Nico O’Reilly.Guardiola was delighted by Aït-Nouri’s performance, saying: “Wow. He had to defend a back four, then make a back five. He played really well. It was his first game, but he has played in the Premier League for many years. He can help us play in that role outside, but then had to play as a holding midfielder and go into the pockets – he moves really well into the spaces.“He is intelligent and clear to defend and take the ball. He is so clever in the final third, taking the right decisions to create more spaces. Really pleased with the game he played.”Aït-Nouri is excited, too, about working with Guardiola and linking with Erling Haaland in attack. He says: “We know Erling is a great player – he has achieved a lot of big things in football. It’s good to play with him and to play with the other players. It’s the best team in the world when playing its good game.View image in fullscreenNew signing Rayan Cherki has also impressed at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Derik Hamilton/AP“I had a few opportunities to cross to him – it’s part of my game right now.

I enjoyed playing with the team, I wanted to give everything on the pitch and it was a good game for me. Hopefully, it will continue like this. It’s a big honour to play [for Guardiola]. I can improve a lot with him.”Rayan Cherki, a forward, who scored against Al Ain, and the No 8 Tijjani Reijnders, who impressed in City’s2-0 opening winover Wydad, are City’s other major summer signings.Aït-Nouri says: “We are very excited to play together. They also made a very good first game. Rayan played well – he scored. It’s very good for us, for him, for the confidence also.”Another unanswered goal against Al Ain and a draw against Juventus at Orlando’s Camping Field Stadium in Thursday’s 3pm local time showdown would have been enough to top Group G. But now victory is needed to secure first place and avoid the winners of the group from which two of Real Madrid, Red Bull Salzburg and Al-Hilal will progress.Aït-Nouri says of the display against Al Ain: “We played our game. We tried to score a lot of goals and scored six goals; it’s good for the confidence. Hopefully we’ll continue like this.”If Aït-Nouri prospers against Juventus as he did versus Al Ain, City’s prospects of taking all three points should sky-rocket.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityClub World CupClub World Cup 2025US sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 373they scored to winwas Stokes’s sixth, a remarkable record he said owed everything to clarity, calmness, and “turning up every session with the attitude that we could blow this match apart”.England’s unlikely win a beautiful reward for approach under Ben Stokes | Andy BullRead more“We’re a very simple-minded pair, me and Baz, when it comes to cricket,” he said of his ­partnership with the team’s coach, Brendon McCullum, and their ability to inspire such fourth-innings ­heroics. “We just try to keep ­everything as simple and as calm as we possibly can.“When you’re chasing down totals like that, keeping the relaxed vibe as much as we can is so important to the mindset of someone, to go out there in the middle with the pressures of that situation. Everyone goes out there with a pretty clear mind about what we’re trying to do. [Our task] was pretty simple: if we bat the overs that are left in the game, we will win.”In the glow of victory, Stokes was able to hit back at those who ­lambasted his decision at the toss to put India in to bat when the tourists proceeded to coast to 359 for three at the end of the opening day. “Test matches are played over five days,” he said. “Imagine thinking that way at the end of day one, before we’ve even had a chance to bat on a wicket.View image in fullscreenJasprit Bumrah on the ground on the fifth day of the first Test.

One thing we’ve done so well this week is our commitment to turning up every day and every session.“In particular, sometimes when you’ve been out on the field for a long time it’s very easy to wait for things to happen.

We won’t change it,” he said. “For us to manage his workload is more important. There is a lot of cricket going forward.”Gambhir backed his other ­seamers to make up for Bumrah’s absence. “We trust in them.

But, aside from a slip and fall on the grass in set one, she appeared to come through her opening examination at Devonshire Park unscathed.Victory over the world No 64 Li in two hours and 18 minutes sets up a second-round match with the 19-year-old Australian Maya Joint, who knocked out the two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur on Monday.The seventh seed Raducanu produced an emotional response after sealing her progress with a fine backhand winner.“It feels incredible. I want to thank the crowd for getting me through some really sticky moments,” the former US Open champion said in her on-court interview. “It really meant a lot to me and I’m really proud of how I fought back after losing the first set. I’m very, very happy to come through that.“It was tough, it was up and down, but from the middle of the second set I think I found another gear and another level.”Earlier, Harriet Dart had two match points on serve but slipped to an agonising defeat to the reigning Wimbledon champion, Barbora Krejcikova. After two suspensions of play in the opening set due to wet weather, Dart moved to the verge of one of the greatest wins of her career.But Krejcikova, whodefeated Jasmine Paoliniin last year’s Wimbledon final, survived a first-round shock by hitting back to progress 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-5 in two hours and 40 minutes.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Harriet Dart let two match points slip against Barbora Krejcikova.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe second seed will face another Briton in round two following Jodie Burrage’s 6-3, 6-2 win over Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima.Dart did little to hide her frustration at failing to capitalise on the pair of match-clinching opportunities againstthe 2021 French Open champion, letting out a piercing scream as the following game slipped away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was pretty close. I missed a ball on match point and then she played a really good point on my other match point and then she becomes a bit freer. It was a tough match overall.“My level was 10 times better than I’ve played the last two weeks. For me that’s more important, especially going to Wimbledon. Of course, I’d like to have won today.

For back-to-back tests against Republic of Ireland followed by a meeting with Canada, nearly all of their Europe-based players are on vacation.“We’ve left out the vast majority of players that are playing in Europe bar one, and that’s Naomi Girma,” said the head coach, Emma Hayes. “The rest of those players have been playing non-stop [for the] last two years without a summer break and this is the only opportunity they will get for a much-needed break. It also gives us the chance to play players who are playing domestically.”Making Orlando proud: English coaching duo’s unlikely route to NWSL gloryRead moreThe USWNT have their eye on winning the 2027 World Cup. Hayes’ decision to prepare for that by deferring her Europe-based players to the next window, which is not until the autumn, is a calculated call and one that could bolster the team’s chances long-term. In a sport rife with injury amid oversaturated calendars – in addition to the often-overlooked impact of mental health – Hayes is prioritising rest for the likes of Arsenal’s Emily Fox, Chelsea’s Catarina Macario, OL Lyonnes’s Lindsey Horan and Manchester United’s Phallon Tullis-Joyce.The decision is in character with Hayes’ approach over the past year as she carefully plans for the individual development and health of each player via the process of periodisation and, in the process, vets a wider playing pool. The timing also provides sharp relief to the tumultuous state of the US men’s squad which, too, is lacking Europe-based talent, though in its case due to injuries, uncertain club situations, continued club duty or, in the case of Christian Pulisic, a personal and controversial request for a break. Hayes’ strategy is an attempt to pre-empt the exact same situation for the women’s team’s two years out from their most important event.Hayes’s 25-woman squad contains six uncapped players and four entirely new names. There are 10 defenders in the squad, including Girma, and US fans can expect various permutations in the backline. There will certainly be experimentation at full-back, with Kansas City’s Izzy Rodriquez in line for a start at left-back on her first call-up to the squad and Houston’s Avery Patterson, who has four caps, likely to feature at right-back in the absence of Fox. As could Gisele Thompson, who returns to camp listed as a full-back having been listed as a forward in the previous camp. “Gisele may very well move fluidly between those positions,” Hayes noted. “I think Gisele’s best strength is as a wing-back so sometimes it’s adept for her to be the full-back in the team and sometimes it’s adept for her to be the winger”. As with multiple players in this camp, such as the 18-year-old Seattle centre-back Jordyn Bugg, Thompson might be moved to the youth team as Hayes also uses this time to develop players for the 2028 Olympics and 2031 World Cup.View image in fullscreenChelsea defender Naomi Girma with Ashley Lawrence.Photograph: Stephen Flynn/ProSports/ShutterstockIn midfield, two exceptionally talented Olympians in Rose Lavelle and Croix Bethune also return from injury. Lavelle is among the most experienced players in the squad with 110 caps and Hayes outlined how much of a miss she has been, saying of the 30-year-old: “She’s supremely gifted as a football player and someone who [is still] maturing as a top-level footballer. In the last 12 months she’s started to add new dimensions in between the lines.”On Croix Bethune, the 2024 National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) rookie of the year, Hayes said: “There is still work to do for Croix to reach the next level. We want to sit down with her and work through all the things we’re looking for at the top level so that she can keep adding those things into a game for the Washington Spirit. But she’s exceptionally gifted, particularly with a final pass, her weight of pass. She can execute.”Starting this week in Colorado, a mix of players returning from injury, emerging into their prime or making their first appearance for the national team will contend for a role in the squad that competes at the World Cup. The circumstances are unique and it is up to them to make the most of that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The CMA will then consult on the first wave of bespoke measures.One option for the “choice screens” would be to include new AI-powered rivals in the search space, such as Perplexity and ChatGPT.The CMA will also consider further action on other issues such as introducing more transparency into Google’s search advertising business. However, the CMA struck a note of caution on this second wave of potential measures, saying interventions in these areas “may be more complex to develop”.Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, said the announcement marked an important milestone in a new regulatory regime under the recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act.Cardell said: “These targeted and proportionate actions would give UK businesses and consumers more choice and control over how they interact with Google’s search services – as well as unlocking greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy.”The CMA said it planned further action to address more complex issues over a longer period, starting in 2026, such as concerns about Google’s treatment of rival specialised search platforms and transparency and control in search advertising.The watchdog is also delaying action on “default agreements” where Google pays to be the search engine of choice on products such as the Apple iPhone until the conclusion of a court case between the company and the US department of justice – which isseeking to end such arrangements.The CMA also announced that it would delay a third strategic market status designation until next year. A verdict on designating Apple and Google’s smartphone platforms as worthy of the status is expected next month.Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at the UK law firm Geradin Partners and the CMA’s former legal director, said the regulator could have gone “harder and faster” on Google but was trying to avoid any accusation that it was anti-growth. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has ordered regulators todo more to encourage economic growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The CMA could have gone harder and faster, but it is treading carefully to avoid being labelled as being ‘anti-growth’ by Google and its allies.”The Google announcement is the CMA’s most significant step on big tech since theappointment of Doug Gurr, the former UK boss of Amazon, as the authority’s chair. The government was forced to deny it was “in the pocket of big tech” in the wake of Gurr’s hire.Google said the move could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK.“We’re concerned that the scope of the CMA’s considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided,” said Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director for competition.Bethell also indicated that Google might delay product releases in the UK as a consequence.“The UK has historically benefited from early access to our latest innovations, but punitive regulations could change that,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetInternetCompetition and Markets AuthorityTechnology sectorRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s obscene’The Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, is about to descend on Venice with his fiancee, some ex-Marines and his limitless credit card. We meet the Italian activists who are saying: enoughZoe WilliamsTue 24 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 12.32 EDTShareWhen she heard thatJeff Bezoswas getting married in Venice this June, Heather Jane Johnson felt worse than she had in her entire life. Twenty-five years ago, she ceased trading as a bookseller in Boston, Massachusetts. “I lost a lot because of Bezos and the complicity of Americans in the making of Amazon,” the 53-year-old says. “A big reason I moved to Italy is because I felt betrayed by my countrypeople.”So when posters went up calling a public meeting in the city she now calls home, she went, and she has been to every meeting of anti-Bezos activists since, including one the day before her own wedding last week. “These young people have really restored my faith in humanity,” Johnson says.Many of the No Space for Bezos activists are based in Laboratorio Occupato Morion, which describes itself as an “anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist and trans-feminist political space”. “Let’s say that this is the house of many struggles,” says Federica Toninello, 33. It has the same vaulted ceiling and grand proportions as its neighbours, but is full of banners and placards, ready to festoon Venice for Bezos’s wedding celebrations, which are due to start on Thursday. (I spotted no billionaires when I visited on Sunday, but then they have a powerful drive towards invisibility.) It could be any countercultural collective, except this is Venice, so everything is a hundred times more beautiful. Striking, timeless graphics from past campaigns plaster the walls – No Big Ships, an anti-cruise, anti-tourist campaign, which started here before spreading across Europe; No One Is Illegal, a grassroots refugee solidarity movement; posters on the climate crisis, the housing shortage, and one from a pop-up feminist union representing the city’s maids.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t think he is welcome’ … Bezos with his fiancee, Lauren Sánchez.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageNoemi Donà, 19, is from the USG (loosely, the union of left youth); Oliver, 43, came viathe “Sardines”, an anti-racist group set up to fight the hard-right Lega Nord. He works as a receptionist in a Venice hotel – not one of the hyper-luxe ones, just “a small, 14th-century palace” – but has his eye on the economy beyond tourism. “Bezos can pay, he can stay,” he says, “but thousands of shops in Italy have closed because of Amazon. So I don’t think he is welcome.” There’s a university collective that meets here, which occupied a number of campuses last year, protesting about the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.The air is delicious and a bit headachey with the smell of aerosol and felt-tip pens. Some banners say Free Palestine; others say Stop Bombing Iran. Palestina Libre is an active organisation acrossItaly, and the US’s attack on Iran is still less than 24 hours old and deeply shocking. But if No Space for Bezos – “it’s not a collective, it’s a platform”, says Marta Sottoriva, a 34-year-old secondary school teacher – has ambitions that feel unimaginably large, it has already achieved some of what it wants, after only a few weeks.“If Bezos had announced his marriage here, and we hadn’t moved, the narrative in the world’s media would have been the luxury hotels, the VIPs, the dresses, the gossip,” says Sottoriva. “We really wanted to problematise the ridiculous and obscene wealth that allows a man to rent a city for three days.”On 12 June, the movement unfurled its simplest and largest banner – eight metres long, featuring just Bezos’s name crossed out in red – down the bell tower of the San Giorgio Maggiore basilica, while the deeply unpopular city mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, was trying to do a press conference. Toninello laughingly describes their slanging match on social media: “He was saying, ‘For shame!’ and we were saying, ‘Youshould be ashamed!’” Activists put up a similar banner on the Rialto bridge in the same week.View image in fullscreenThe protest at San Giorgio Maggiore.Photograph: Marta SottorivaThey have already shifted the focus from: “How much money does that one man have?” to the more interesting: “How much disruption can No Space for Bezos cause? What kind of numbers will they get? What conversations will they start?” Between Elon Muskhanding voters million-dollar chequesand Vladimir Putin ordering up chaos and death like consumables, there is this awful sense of limitlessness to the elite’s purchasing power. If it turned out there was something a billionaire couldn’t buy, and it was something that ought to be simple – a little goodwill, servility, privacy and respect, for him, his fiancee Lauren Sánchez and their 200 friends – well, that would be a really big deal.Not all the direct action this week will be announced in advance, but one thing has not been kept secret: this Saturday, there will be a demo to block access to the cavernous Scuola Grande della Misericordia, where Bezos planned to hold a big party.‘A managerial Mephistopheles’: inside the mind of Jeff BezosRead moreI walked around the building on Sunday evening, just to see what kind of numbers you’d need on the protest to really, comprehensively screw the chance of Kim Kardashian showing up. Along the north wall is a pavement of probably three metres, with a steep drop into the canal, and a narrow bridge, the walkway ending randomly, Venetianly, in a metal gate. The west side has a wider pavement, again with the canal running alongside, with a little bridge to the left that could let police in or protesters out, but only in slow-moving units of maybe seven at a time. It is the most beautiful bridge in the world, unless you count all of Venice’s other bridges, but it’s not built for speedy access. At the front, a square, Misericordia on one edge, canal on the other; 200 protesters could make a lot of trouble for you here.The rumour is that Bezos is not relying solely on the police but is bringing ex-marines with him, which has only served to make him less popular. “How can you move away a person from the water without injuring that person?” Toninello asks, her tone much more playful than anxious. “We are using our bodies to say: ‘Stop. No more. We don’t want this.’”According to media reports on Monday, Bezos has been forced to move the party to another venue.View image in fullscreenA banner on the Rialto bridge.Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/ReutersEven if you can picture the city’s exquisite eccentricities – bridges that stop dead at a front door, like the 14th-century lagoon equivalent of a lift that opens into your penthouse; alleyways with framed paintings stuck on the walls, as if that were normal – you still, I promise you, would not understand without pacing it how comically impossible it would be to have an elegant, star-studded party here if even 15 people made it their business to tell you that you weren’t welcome. It crossed my mind that maybe Venice is a decoy, and they’re actually having the parties in Maui.The activists’ assemblies aired everything – critics say Bezos and Sánchez aren’t great targets for the anti-tourist movement, since they’re bringing just 200 guests, a drop in the ocean for a city that receives 30 million visitors a year. Yet in almost every scenario, Venetians perceive the same disregard from local government. It will effectively close down the centre of the city to please a billionaire; it has the power to limit Airbnb rentals, but declines to do so; it thinks last year’s tourist levy of €5 a day has solved the problem, but seemingly doesn’t consider that, as Sottoriva says, locals “really feel like animals in a zoo, or cartoon characters in Disneyland”.Sofia, 26, is originally from Barcelona, so she has been around these discussions of overtourism often enough, but she sees something unique in this city, for good and ill. “There is a hidden Venice, which I was lucky enough to find through activism. A very vibrant community where you know each other, and support each other. I don’t mean an intellectual movement – I mean there are places where people do live, where they have neighbourhood suppers, where you can see children playing. The place risks becoming lifeless if you never see children.”The political vision for a depopulated Venice – made of tourists, its workers coming in from the mainland, and existing as a one-of-a-kind theme park – is made obvious in the mayor’s dealings with the Bezos nuptials. But it also seems to chime with the values of the Amazon boss himself: his behaviour as an employer, his manifest resentment of corporate tax responsibility, an antisocial, anti-equality attitude that you’d be able to see from space, if he thought you were worthy of going there.View image in fullscreenMichael Jordan’s yacht docked in Venice ahead of Bezos’s wedding.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersClimate change activists have other, intersecting complaints. Never mind that Amazon “promotes a culture of extreme, overexaggerated consumption”, says Stella Faye, a 27-year-old university researcher, “it represents a model of exploitation of people and of nature. It depends on huge amounts of electricity, for the servers, and then huge amounts of water resources to cool the servers, which are often placed in arid areas. So they’re taking water resources from regions where people desperately need them.”Politically, Bezos has swung from what everyone always assumed was mild support for the Democrats to active support for Trump. “We are not seeing a multibillionaire bending to Trump,” Sottoriva says, “we are seeing a new political grammar in which the private interests of digital capitalism and technocapitalism merge with fascism. This is not just about Venice.”What might conceivably trouble Bezos the most is the burgeoning critique of billionaires not as individuals, but as a structural force. “I would say anti-wealth movements are new,” says Robin Piazzo, a political scientist from Turin university. “Usually Marxists don’t like to focus on people like billionaires: they use concepts such as capitalism, objective things, not specific people. So most of the extra-parliamentary left avoided the wealthy themselves. And when the institutional left focused on, for example, Berlusconi, it was not framed as: ‘He is too rich.’ The problem was that he was using his money to influence politics and the media. It was always about good billionaires and bad ones, because they wanted to co-opt the good ones.”At a grassroots level, however, there has always been a strong strain of anti-wealth critique, the one thing religion and politics could agree on. Piazzo is also a city councillor for the Democratic party, the largest centre-left party. A 90-year-old woman came up to him after the last council meeting and said, “You have to do something about rich people, I hate them. I’m with Papa Francisco [Pope Francis].” This is a dangerous moment for the ultra-high-net-worths: when wealth itself is seen to be acting in its own interests, and it has accumulated to the degree that its impact scars every poorer life with which it comes into contact, that starts to look a lot like a class war, albeit with one side very small (there are roughly 2,700 billionaires in the world; they could fit into a regional concert hall) and, until recently, almost invisible.What’s the point of Davos when even the rich are fed up with the super-rich? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreSo at some point, wealth will show its teeth. I think back to the last protest I went to in Italy, theG8 summit in Genoa, 2001. The policing was unbelievably reactive and harsh; aprotester called Carlo Giulianiwas shot dead on the first night by the carabinieri. I was with British lefties, whose first reaction when the police come at you is to run down a side street – a great strategy if you’re being charged by a horse, a terrible idea if you’re being teargassed. You get stuck in this well of gas, and it gets in your vagina, which weirdly nobody ever mentions. It’s much worse than the eyes.After the death of Giuliani, the Corpo Forestale was brought in: very distinctive uniforms, powder blue with knee-high black boots, hitting people with batons, a little bit like Nazis choreographed by Busby Berkeley. But what was most surreal was that the G8 had already erected an almost impenetrable metal fence. Only one protester managed to get through and she was arrested immediately. In that steel-ring protection was an admission: that those heads of state were the enemy, all our interests were not aligned.Twenty-four years later, there’s something gaslighty in Bezos’s decision that he could represent all he represents – wage degradation, hyper-consumerism, environmental destruction, wealth supremacy – and still be a regular Joe that the people of Venice would be happy for, because he’d met his special person. What an out-and-out bizarre and provocative place to say that – a city with non-negotiable borders and a cliff edge into a canal every 50 yards. “I am afraid, personally,” says Noemi Donà. “But I’m here.”Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosWeddingsActivismVeniceItalyThe super-richEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both countries have long histories with digital warfare. The particular focus of the current conflict, Iran’s nuclear program, was the target of one of the first cyberweapons meant to cause physical destruction, the sophisticated worm Stuxnet.Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week. My colleague Johana Bhuiyan reports:Cybersecurity company Cloudflare assessed that internet traffic levels inIran“are now ~97% below where they were at the same time a week ago”. Severed internet connectivity has led to a troubling lack of access to information for everyday Iranians as their country descends into conflict.The reduction in internet speeds comes after an anti-Iranian government hacking group with potential ties to Israel claimed that it hacked Iran’s state-owned Bank Sepah. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, said on Twitter/X that officials in Tehran had restricted internet access to ward off additional cyberattacks.On Wednesday, Iran’s fears came to fruition. My colleague Dan Milmo reports:An Israel-linked hacking group has claimed responsibility for a $90m (£67m) heist on an Iranian cryptocurrency exchange.The group known as Gonjeshke Darande, Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, said on Wednesday it had hacked the Nobitex exchange, a day after claiming it had destroyed data at Iran’s state-owned Bank Sepah.Elliptic, a consultancy specialising in crypto-related crime, said it had so far identified more than $90m in cryptocurrency sent from Nobitex crypto wallets to hacker addresses. The hackers appear to have in effect “burned” those funds, rendering them inaccessible by storing them in “vanity addresses” for which they do not have the cryptographic keys, Elliptic said.Iran has attempted to retaliate, but as with the wider war, it seems that Israeli attacks have been more successful and damaging. Israeli officials warned the country’s residents that Iran is hijacking home security cameras that are connected to the internet to gather real-time intelligence on the ground,Bloomberg reports. Security professionals say hackers for Hamas and Russia have done the same. Home cameras may be a new front in the waging of war, but disrupting them does not seem as powerful as disrupting a central bank, as Israel has done.Late Friday, Iran seemed to lift the internet blackout for some citizens,the New York Timesreported, though even those who could access limited online services believed their connections were temporary.The city of love? PornHub fights Paris over verifying children’s ages onlineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockPornHub, widely estimated to be the most-visited site for pornographic content in the world,returned to France on Fridayafter a three-week blackout.The site’s owner, Aylo, had rescinded access to the site protest of a new French law demanding adult websites verify users’ ages with a credit card or identification document. PornHub drew a line in the sand on the issue and revoked access for a market of nearly 70 million rather than implement an age gate.Since then, a French court has suspended the law while it considers compliance with the European Union’s constitution, and so Pornhub is back online. But the quarrel between Paris and PornHub is the latest front in the debate over online age verification, which is heating to a boil across the globe.The issue sits at the intersection of two driving forces of internet regulation that often conflict: keeping children safe online and preserving both privacy and freedom of expression. It’s an area where lawmakers have been uncharacteristically prone to action, even in the US, where tech regulation is often as hands off as can be.More than 20 states now have age verification laws on the books. PornHub has made itself unavailable in17 of them. Texas, the second-most populous state in the US with 31m people, is the highest-profile example. The state legislature there passed a law requiring an ID to visit PornHub in September 2023. In March of the following year, the site went dark in the state, greeting would-be visitors with a banner calling the law “ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous”. In Louisiana, which has imposed age verification laws, PornHub is still available, but it has seen traffic there decline by 80%, which itattributesto the barrier of the ID requirement. The US supreme court heard arguments in January over whether these laws infringe on the constitutional right to free speech.Research into the laws into the UShave foundthat they are not effective in their stated goal. Online search data showed that people in states with age verification laws sought out porn sites that did not comply with local laws so as to circumvent the age gates as well as virtual private networks to hide their locations from internet providers.The other battlefields over age verification concern social media bans for underage users. Australia, which has passed a law banning under-16s from social media, has been testing different technologies with which to enforce its prohibition butfound them lacking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UK’s system for verifying ages to keep pornography away from children, a provision of the Online Safety Act, will take effect in July. Will London be the next Paris or the next Texas?Taking apart the Trump phoneView image in fullscreenComposite: The Guardian/Getty Images/Trump Mobile/Trump Watches/EbayLast week, Donald Trumpdebuted a mobile phonebranded with his family name – “T1” etched into the gold case alongside an American flag – with a listed price of $500 and a pledge that it would be “proudly designed and built in the United States”. Specifically in Alabama, California and Florida. Its monthly service plan will cost $47.45.The Trump phone will struggle to live up to those promises. Its makers have to abide by the same market forces as other phonemakers. Both cheap labor and electronics expertise reside in China. They do not in the US. There’s a reason Apple’s phones are labeled “Designed in California” – to take advantage of the caché and appeal of the US without suffering its labor costs.Looking ahead, experts predict thatTrump’s own tariffscould cause the price of smartphones to spike by double or even triple digits. The electronics supply chain in the US is nowhere near developed enough to assemble a phone entirely domestically. Analysts at investment bank UBSwarned in Aprilthat the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage could rise by 79% from $1,199 to about $2,150, based on a total tariff of 145%. Apple itself seemed to concur with those assessments when it flew some $2bn worth of iPhones into the US before the tariffs on China went into effect.There is already an example of a phone assembled – but not entirely made – in the US, the Liberty Phone. It costs nearly four times what Trump promises his will, nearly $2000. The Liberty Phone sources its motherboard from the US but still requires screens, batteries and cameras manufactured overseas, according to aWall Street Journalinterview with the CEO of Purism, which manufactures the device. Its operating system can only run basic apps such as a calculator and a web browser because it runs on PureOS, software of the company’s own making, per the Journal.The specs on the Liberty Phone are worse than Trump’s T1, though the price is higher, making the president’s device even less likely to appear on the market as announced. Some of the promised technical capabilities of the T1 would best those of the top-of-the-line iPhones, which cost nearly double what Trump has promised. The Vergeput together a good listof which Chinese companies might manufacture the phone for Trump to white label.Eric Trump, who is co-leading the venture with his brother Donald Jr, has acknowledged that the first batch of T1 phones will not be made in the US. “Eventually, all the phones can be built in the United States of America,” Eric Trump saidlast week.

Electronic waste is one of the world’s fastest-growing waste streams, and experts say fast tech is playing an increasingly significant role.In the UK, it is estimated that more than 1.14bn of these small electronic gadgets (including vapes) are bought a year and about half (589m) are disposed of in that same time, which is equivalent to 19 a second, according to Material Focus, the organisation behind the Recycle Your Electricals campaign.Safe and easy ways to recycle electricals – and even get money for your old gadgetsRead more“We’ve had fast food, we’ve had fast fashion, and we’re now in the age of fast tech,” says Scott Butler, the executive director of Material Focus. “We’re not moralist against technology, but what we are concerned about is the volume of low-quality, cheap, flimsy products that are flooding the market, which end up binned or unused.”Fast tech is seen as disposable by more than a third of Britons, according to a survey, and this is, in part, due to the low price point, Butler says. “[It] might be cheap but it’s not disposable. In fact, anything with a plug, battery or cable should never be binned. They’re full of useful metals and can be used again,” he adds.Butler highlights “fad” fast tech as a key issue – cheap items that are bought at certain times of year or for particular occasions, such as mini-fans as the UK warms up or light-up Christmas jumpers. About 7.1m mini-fans were bought in the UK last year and more than 3.5m have already been discarded or forgotten in drawers in that same period.“We just had a heatwave. I’m sure the sale of mini-fans has boomed during that period. There’s nothing wrong in trying to keep yourself cool, but we urge people, if you do need those things, try to buy the best version of it that you can so that it has a much better chance of lasting more than a summer,” he said.Laura Young, an environmental scientist and campaigner, says fast tech represents a new kind of environmental threat – not just because of the potentially toxic chemicals many contain, but because of the sheer volume and disposability.“We have never had throwaway technology like this before,” she says. “And I think people maybe just genuinely don’t realise that there are electronic components inside of a lot of these tiny devices.View image in fullscreenMany users are unaware that electronic vapes contain batteries.Photograph: bennphoto/Shutterstock“With vapes, a lot of people who use them were like, ‘there’s a battery in there?’, and they’d never thought.

There was no disposable technology. So I think it’s right that you would never assume that anything you’re being sold is a disposable technology, because that’s not normal,” she says.And while it is unlikely the amount of fast tech on the market will decline any time soon, Butler says it is crucial to change how we think about it. “Ultimately these things are sold because people buy them. If people didn’t buy them, then obviously they wouldn’t be on the market.“Just be a bit more mindful about what you buy, how you use it, and what you do with it when you no longer need it. Never bin it when it no longer works,” he says, urging people to instead collect their electricals andfind their nearest recycling point using the locator online.There is also a push for better repair, reuse and borrowing options. Young points to community initiatives such as repair cafes and tool libraries that allow people to borrow items, often for a fraction of the cost of buying it new.“I’m signed up to a tool library. I don’t buy DIY equipment any more.” Tackling fast tech requires “thinking differently”, she says, and not thinking “I have to own everything” or making unnecessary impulse purchases.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyRecyclingWastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

While there are still no details of how social media users would be age checked, she said Australians should expect “a waterfall of tools and techniques”, manylikely to include artificial intelligencelike analysing facial or hand features.Guardian Australia is aware several social media platforms have privately expressed concern about a lack of information about their obligations under the laws, and raised doubts they would be able to build such age assurance systems with less than six months until the deadline.Inman Grant indicated age verification would take place on individual platforms, rather than at the device or app store level, adding that many social media sites already used tools to estimate or verify users’ ages. She said platforms would need to report their progress to eSafety, and demonstrate they were using tools to verify users and remove children.Trial reveals flaws in tech intended to enforce Australian social media ban for under-16sRead moreHowever Inman Grant also conceded systems would not be perfect: “We know that companies aren’t going to get it right the first time. None of these technologies are foolproof, but again, if they’re using them in tandem with one another, they’ll have greater levels of success.”“While the social media delay will not solve everything, it will create some friction in the system … this world-leading legislation seeks to shift the burden of reducing harm away from parents and carers and back on to the companies themselves,” Inman Grant said.“We are treating big tech like the extractive industry it has become. Australia is legitimately asking companies to provide the lifejackets and the safe guardrails we expect from almost every other consumer-facing industry.”YouTube had beenpledged a carve-out by former communications minister Michelle Rowland, who listed it alongside Google Classroom and online services from ReachOut and Kids Helpline as being exempt from the ban because they help children “get the education and health support they need”.Federal government sources said the communications minister, Anika Wells, would decide within weeks whether to take the commissioner’s advice to amend the draft rules.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have had a few years now, to get out there, to rebuild careers and relationships, to travel, to live in the world again. That’s not the case for everyone. Award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who crafted the beguiling, elegiac soundtracks to games such as Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and Dear Esther, has only just emerged. Diagnosed with a degenerative disease in her mid-20s and seriously immunocompromised as a result of her condition, she began isolating at the start of the pandemic, and for the next five years barely left her home. While there, unable to work or write, her world began to collapse.“Like many people I had an extraordinarily painful and difficult pandemic,” she says. “I watched my dad die on Zoom, and then my auntie and more family members. Then they found a tumour in my ovary, and I had major abdominal surgery, but the operation had gone wrong, so I nearly died in 2022. While I was recovering from the third operation, the roof of our house fell in. It felt like a metaphor for everything. If a novelist had written this, no one would believe the story. And things just kept going wrong. So I wasn’t writing music, I wasn’t even listening to music. All of a sudden, I couldn’t bear it. I’m still trying to work out what that rejection was about – I was just in too much of a mental crisis. I wasn’t even feeding or dressing myself.”One day last year, however, Curry made the decision to start listening to her music again. Not yet ready to compose, she began cataloguing her work instead, putting it in some sort of order after years of manic productivity. The result is Shielding Songs, an album mostly made up of new versions of her favourite pieces, arranged as lusciously ethereal choral works featuring the acclaimed London Voices choir. “Shielding Songs is a kind of gathering together, almost like a manifesto. I was thinking, what do I believe as a composer? What is my legacy? And I have to say, I did think it was going to be the last thing I would put out. And I was like, if it is going to be the last thing, I want it to be good. And I want it to say the things that I feel are important.”View image in fullscreenLusciously ethereal … A recording session for Shielding Songs with the London Voices.Photograph: Jessica CurryAmong them are four pieces from Everything’s Gone to the Rapture, a game about the apocalypse from the point of view of a tiny English village that won Curry a Bafta for her soundtrack. Created by developer The Chinese Room, of which Curry and her husband Dan Pinchbeck were co-founders, it drew praise for its lavish bucolic setting and highly emotional score, heavily inspired by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. It has been some of her most popular music.“I still get emails about it 10 years later,” she says. “So many people have Rapture tattoos – I often get emails that say, I only listen to death metal, but I love this soundtrack. That game has stuck with people, but I wanted to reimagine the music. The Mourning Tree is not the most played track on the score, but it’s the one that people write to me about. Lots of people have played it at funerals. And I thought, there is something beautiful I can do with a purely choral arrangement here.”Another reason Rapture is so prominent on the new album is the parallel between its story of growing isolation at the end of the world and the experience of the Covid years. “The game is about what it means to be human, what does it mean to love?” she says. “And interestingly it has a lot of tie-in with a global event like a pandemic and how we cope with that.” Curry has described Shielding Songs as an exploration of what it means to love and grieve in isolation, but it is also a hopeful study of human endurance. Four of the tracks come from her anti-war requiem Perpetual Light, first performed in 2011 – a response to the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, undercut with a sense of hope for the future.A piece from Chinese Room’s VR sci-fi adventure So Let Us Melt is included too. The titular track is a wilting choral work inspired by John Donne, but the other tracks on the score are more experimental and hint at where she is heading musically. “You can tell it’s mine, but it’s a kind of weird mix of Baba O’Riley with minimalism, with a classical bent, but it also sounds like it’s from a film,” Curry says. “It’s got that sort of epic space opera feel, and everything for me coalesced into that score. I loved the sound.”Curry and Pinchbeck (to whom one beautiful new song on the album, Rest With Your Dream, is dedicated) sold The Chinese Room to Sumo Digital in 2018; Curry departed, Pinchbeck stayed on as creative director, overseeing Bafta-winning oil rig horror adventure, Still Wakes the Deep, but left in 2023. Now the duo have formed a small new studio, and are working on fresh concepts. “Maybe we’re insane,” she says. “But I think we are good at making games, me and Dan. We have things to say.” Curry is still sick, and she still worries about going out, especially now that some people have become aggressive toward those who wear protective masks. But she is composing again.“This is the first time in a long time that I can hear music properly, in my head,” she says. “I didn’t think it would happen again, and I think it is going to be something new. It will be Jessica Curry, but I’m not the same person that I was. When really bad things happen to you, you don’t go back. The ground doesn’t just solidify again. Trauma is messy and it’s exhausting, but music will come from it.”Shielding Songs is out nowvia BandcampExplore more on these topicsGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than any candidate, he sensed the war-weariness of Americans after the fiascos in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and especially the dismay of military veterans, 60% of whom voted for him over Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump’s maverick, anti-interventionist “America First” narrative also resonated strongly with those in the Maga movement who have never served in the military, particularly blue-collar workers.Now, Trump, once an unsparing critic of military misadventures, has bombed the nuclear enrichment installations of Iran, a country that hadn’t attacked the US, wasn’t preparing to and didn’t even threaten war. Since the bombing, Trump has gone further: he has ruminated aboutregime changein Iran. His transformation has startled many of his Maga acolytes who share Tucker Carlson’s view that Trump risks being dragged into Israel’s fight with Iran and becoming embroiled in his own forever war. The fragile truce agreed to by Iran and Israel may ease their worries if it holds, but Trump might be drawn to regime change again if fighting resumes.I spent five years in Iran’s notorious Evin prison but when Israel bombed it I felt horror and fear | Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeRead morePerhaps Trump floated regime change to scare Iran’s leaders into dismantling their entire enrichment operation, something Tehran rejected from the outset of the negotiations with Washington. The president may believe that the risk of losing power will force Iran’s leadership, which is already under military pressure fromIsrael, to relent.But Trump doesn’t need to go down this path. Having hit Iran’s enrichment installations – though it isnow evidentthat they weren’t obliterated, contrary to his boast immediately after the strike – the president could declare victory. He could tell Israel’s strongest American supporters that he delivered on his pledge to protect it and then turn to reassuring Maga’s stars, such as Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, that he remains a foe of forever wars. He won’t get Iran to sign a no-enrichment deal, but so what? He could claim that, contrary to the malicious mainstream media’s claims, he did in fact demolish Iran’s enrichment capabilities.Taking this path would make sense. Despite his tough-guy persona, Trump has an instinctive aversion to needless wars that could turn into quagmires. The recent strike onIranwas risk-free: Iran lacked the air defenses needed to down the B-2 stealth bombers, so there was no chance of American pilots being killed or captured. And Tehran does not have the means to strike the American homeland in return. Even its ineffectual, face-saving missile salvoes against the US military base in Qatar were preceded by a warning – proof that Iran doesn’t want to do anything that might push Trump to join Israel’s war.Iran has, in effect, provided Trump an opportunity to forget about regime change. He’d be foolish not to take itIran has, in effect, provided Trump an opportunity to forget about regime change. He’d be foolish not to take it. Moving forward with the idea will create problems – politically at home, militarily in Iran.On the domestic political front, the Carlson-Bannon wing of Maga will soon look past Trump’s attack on Iran, which JD Vance and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have already said doesn’t presage something bigger. But a war of regime change will be the equivalent of a bombshell. It will create a canyon-sized rift in Trump’s base between the unconditional supporters of Israel and those who think that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks to drag the US into his war because he believes that the destruction of the Iranian political system can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Trump has nothing to gain from such an outcome.The military and strategic hazards of a regime change war are even worse, and one of them stems from the sheer size of Iran. It has nearly 92 million people and a land area of 636,371 sq miles (1,648,193 sq km). By contrast, Iraq’s population is less than half as large, and its territory is less than a third the size. Moreover, the Iranian army and ancillary forces, more thanhalf a millionactive-duty soldiers, won’t go quietly into the night. They will have the advantage of fighting an invader on home ground and on many fronts across a vast area. Though many Iranians dislike the existing political order, it is hardly certain that they will welcome an invader rather than rallying as nationalists to defend their homeland.Moreover, a military intervention in amulti-ethniccountry like Iran could precipitate prolonged disorder and bloodletting. Persians comprise only 60% of the country’s population. Azerbaijanis account for 16%, Kurds for another 10%, and there are numerous smaller nationalities. The relationship between the Iranian state and minority ethnic groups, especially the Kurds, has featured periods oftension, even violence. The expectation of a regime collapse could trigger rebellions and, in response, repression by the state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the idea that a country’s political order can be revamped through airpower alone is anillusion. Regime change zealots could say, bombs away, stability be damned, upheaval will achieve the goal. The problem, however, is that the US can’t insulate itself from the resulting shock waves.Iran exports1.3 million-plusbarrels of oil a day and overlooks the strait of Hormuz, the conduit for 20% of global oil exports. Iran also adjoins seven countries and shares maritime borders with six others. The latter are all closely aligned with the US, which hasbases or a military presenceon their territories. Shia Muslims, who make up 90% of Iran’s population, comprise between55% and 70%of Bahrain’s population. Shia Muslims constitute only 10-12% of Saudi Arabia’s population but are concentrated in its oil-richeastern province, where they account for25-30%of its denizens. An American intervention in Iran won’t necessarily produce solidarity protests in these underdog Shia communities, but they could, and the Gulf monarchies may struggle to contain the consequences.Given these sobering realities, it would be naive to believe that the US could take a wrecking ball to the Iranian state and walk away unaffected. Here’s hoping that Trump comes to understand this and won’t revert to dreams of regime change if the truce collapses. For now at least, Trump’s recent disavowal of regime change on the ground that it would produce chaos is welcome news. We must hope that the mercurial president doesn’t change his mind, as he does so often.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionIranIsraelIran's nuclear programmeDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Or perhaps not. Within hours, he had attacked both Israel and Iran forbreaking the dealhe took credit for, though there seemed to be a precarious peace. But the volatility of events owes much to the unpredictability of Mr Trump’s own rhetoric and actions. The Middle East crisis will continue to overshadow the Nato summit in The Hague, intended toshore up support for Ukraine.It is just over two weeks since Mr Trump told Israel’s prime minister not to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, hoping for a deal with Tehran. Benjamin Netanyahu ignored him – and within hours,as Fox News celebratedthe Israeli offensive, the president sought to associate himself with it. He demanded Iran’s unconditional surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; then, last Thursday, said he would take two weeks to decide whether to strike.That appears to have been deliberate misdirection: the US military bombed nuclear facilities only days later. But even among administration officials, allies and Pentagon staff, there was reportedly confusion over what he envisaged. Senior administration figures suggested that the US was solely targeting the nuclear programme, hours before Mr Trump again mooted regime change. Then, on Monday, he announced a “complete and total ceasefire”. That its termsremain mysteriousdoes not inspire confidence in its durability. Within hours, a visibly angry president was lashing out at both Israel and Iran for breaking the truce, telling reporters: “They don’t know what the fuck they are doing.”Pot, meet kettle. Mr Trump is a creature of impulse, eager for quick results and lavish praise, reacting to the latest talking head and the last person to speak to him – among them, on Tuesday,Vladimir Putin, though the US president said he had declined Moscow’s help with Iran. He also posted that it was his “great honour” to make it possible for China to still buy oil from Iran. His focus on Moscow and Beijing is one constant in what one might generously describe as his foreign policy. But even the knowns – support for Israel, a desire to keep inflation down and avoid foreign quagmires, the longing fora Nobel peace prize– are buffeted by events and the president’s magnetic attraction to whatever looks like it might bring glory.Mr Netanyahu shares Mr Trump’s focus on how decisions affect personal political interests; there are reports hemay call a snap electionwhile riding high from the offensive against Iran. He has been consistent in his enmity towards Tehran and in maintaining that it cannot be dealt with through negotiation. He is keen to keep international attention away from Gaza, where the carnage continues, and may seek to tempt Mr Trump into further action. The whereabouts of Iran’s enriched uranium is unknown, and it surely has greater reason to desire a nuclear deterrent.Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” was that adversaries might back down if they believed that the US president was truly crazy. International relations scholars disagree over the value of such stratagems. But Nixon’s play had at least been gamed out, was persistently pursued, and had clear goals. Mr Trump’s illegal attack onIranwas a reckless gamble, which history will judge. Monday’s ceasefire declaration was welcome. Diplomacy, not war, is needed. But the Trump approach remains chaotic. And as the president’s intentions and messages proliferate, the risks multiply.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then, as now – it’s not you, it’s himTue 24 Jun 2025 09.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 14.54 EDTShareUntil it finally opens, there remains much speculation over precisely which artefacts will occupy Donald Trump’s eventualpresidential library. My current view is that you could do a lot worse than fill it with all the volumes of text that have been written in the cause of “understanding” him. These increasingly read like the most futile female-targeted self-help books of the 1990s. You Have to Understand He is Very Transactional. Take Him Seriously But Not Literally. Guys, please – no more. We all urgently need rescuing from the Mind, Body & Statecraft section of the bookshop.As I say, so many gazillions of words have been expended on this cause that Trump reminds me a lot of the men of the 1990s – indeed, he was one. Back then, he had emerged from a decade of valiantly avoiding contracting STIs in 1980s Manhattan – a battle he would later describe as “my personal Vietnam”. For much of the 1990s, the rest of mankind – certainly womankind – felt that personal victories of their own must be just around the corner. It definitely helped that the economy was booming and history had ended. But it was a time when people believed you could change everything through self-control/hard work/the right roadmap. In fact, speaking of roads, one of the biggest nonfiction titles of the 90s in the US was M Scott Peck’sThe Road Less Travelled, a hymn to personal growth that was treated by many as the key to all mythologies.The vast, mostly female contingent of self-help-book buyers of this era seemed convinced that men were desperately trying to communicate with them, and that true harmony/a happy ending was possible if they simplylearned how to decodethe messages contained in totally inscrutable behaviour like not calling them back, not appearing to care about what they wanted, or stating they were going to put tariffs on all non-US goods. One of those I might have misremembered. But the general gist was: what could it all mean? Once you had deciphered it, men would love you, and you could then set about managing them into their perfect final form. (This may also be what the rest of the G7 leaders thought once Trump got bored with the conference last weekand left.)Then along came an episode of Sex and the City – the absolute classic show about turn-of-the-millennium guys and the women who loved ’em – in which Miranda related to the girls (and one man) how her most recentdate had gone. They’d had a nice evening, he’d told her he wasn’t going to bomb Iran, but then he had. What could it all mean? No, hang on – I’m in a muddle – that was a different episode of something. Let’s try it again. They’d had a nice evening, he’d kissed her, she asked him upstairs, but he said he had an early meeting so he didn’t come up. What could it all mean? Something really positive, think the girls. “It means he likes you but he wants to take it slow,” is one of their verdicts. Men can be “afraid of having their feelings hurt”. Or “freaked out by their own feelings”. He could have been stressed out, on deadline, or have a migraine. The only man at the table is eventually asked for his opinion, which he parts with almost reluctantly. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it for you,” he says. “He’s just not that into you.”Trump and Netanyahu aim to remake the Middle East with bombs. Iran shows why that will always fail | Sina ToossiRead moreWell now. That last line of dialogue promptly became a real-life meme. Then the meme became a book, when two of Sex and the City’s writers ended up writing an entire self-help tome using it as the title. And then the bookbecame a movie, which continued to disseminate its essential message: stop wasting time parsing really obvious behaviour into whatever you want it –need it– to mean. Plus, by this point, among other things, it was the Bush years, 9/11 had happened, and people had learned that two of M Scott Peck’s children wouldn’t talk to him and he’dcheated on his wifemultiple times throughout their marriage. So, in many ways, everyone was waking up.Watching the events of the past fortnight – in which any number of people have been blindsided, crushed, humiliated, whatevered by Trump – felt like it was past time for a similar awakening for politicians and the analysts who love to comment on ’em. (Hi! I’m here twice a week, etc.) Instead, it feels like Keir Starmer could spend the Nato summit stuck drinking cosmopolitans with his little gang of world leaders, going: “I think I’ve worked out what Donald’s trying to tell me – and it’s incredibly positive! He’s just COMPLEX, like all quality men!” “I don’t think he wants to do any of these bad things, he’s just left with no choice.” “Yes,” the perfectly coiffed Emmanuel Macron might agree as he took another sip. “He rang andtold youhis B-2s were on the way to bomb Iran a whole hour before other people found out – you have a really special relationship!”Ladies, gentlemen, presidents, prime ministers – can I stop you? He Just Wants it to be About Him. Everything being always about him is the position of maximum control and maximum attention. The end. Maybe someone could get a book out of it – God knows I’ve just got 900 words out of it – but honestly, save yourself time, money and emotion and wake up.

They respond to polling and to a vague sense of the cultural zeitgeist, aiming less to persuade than to imitate. Often, Democrats seem as if they are not offering a different policy vision for the country so much as they are offering a different stylistic one: the same austerity, cultural revanchism and inequality but in a more polite package.Now the packaging, too, is changing. Having ceded much cultural and policy ground to Trump, and having thoroughly fled from their previous rhetoric endorsing social justice struggles for gender and racial equality, the party now seems to be looking to elevate not just its most conservative members, but also its most vulgar, cruel and combative ones, leaning into a masculinism that mimics the corruption, boorishness and irreverent disdain for the public of Trump himself. The Atlantic called it “Searching for the Democratic Bully”. We might also think of it as the abandonment of decency.That is one way to characterize the Democratic leadership’s near-lockstep support of Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York state whom many polls favor to win the Democratic nomination for the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday. Cuomo has racked up endorsements from a generation of centrist Democratic heavyweights: from the former presidentBill Clinton, to the South Carolina representativeJim Clyburn, to the aggressively pro-Israel New York congressmanRichie Torres, to the New York Times, which hadpledgednot to endorse in local races less than a year ago – only topublish an op-edpraising Cuomo and casting aspersions on his major challenger for the mayoral nomination, the charismatic millennial state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani.Cuomo, in many ways, is a Democratic Trump: he is loud, vulgar, ill-informed, resentful, vengeful, contemptuous of his constituents, and accused of being abusive toward women. He is apparently indifferent to corruption and willing to tell lies; he is reportedly obsessed, as Trump is, with getting revenge on his perceived enemies. He is ageing, rich, out of touch and hated by the left, having left the governor’s mansion with a long record of stymieing progressive agenda items in one of the nation’s largest blue states. This is evidently just the kind of candidate the Democratic leadership is looking for.It’s not as though Cuomo has not been tested. He resigned from the governor’s office in disgrace in 2021, just four years ago, following a slew of sexual misconduct allegations that were declared credible in a thorough report from the New York attorney general, Letitia James. (Cuomo has denied wrongdoing, though he extended apologies to some of the women at the time.) Cuomo has spent the past four years attempting topunish the womenwho came forward against him, suing one – a then-25-year-old assistant – for defamation and demanding hergynecological recordsin court, and dragging the others through vexatious and punitive legal proceedings for which New York taxpayers have beenfooting the bill, to the tune of tens of millions. He has beenpublicly swipingat James, too, for having the gall to do her duty and investigate the claims against him.His petulant and childish behavior since resigning largely matches the way he behaved as governor, when Cuomo was known for his acute personal hostility to other lawmakers, prominently those in his own party. When a stateanti-corruption commissionstarted sniffing around deals made by Cuomo and his allies, Cuomo had the commission shut down. After Cuomo bungled his handling of the pandemic, making a mistake that may have costthousands of seniorstheir lives, Cuomo could have accepted responsibility and apologized to the New Yorkers whose loved ones died. Instead, he and his aides tried to cover up the deaths, and when a state assemblymember, Ron Kim, spoke out against them, Cuomo called him repeatedly and threatened to “destroy” him,according to Kim.To me, this reads as insecurity, egotism, the kind of pettiness and self-seeking that makes someone morally unfit for leadership. But for the Democratic party, feeling demoralized and emasculated, this kind of bullying and flagrant disregard for principle have come to seem like virtues. In endorsing him forNew YorkCity mayor, Torres called Cuomo a “tough guy”, and not a “nice guy”, which he meant as a compliment. This is more or less the establishment’s consensus: rather than oppose Trumpism’s masculinist domination politics and unaccountable cult of personality, the idea now, in the party’s embrace of Cuomo, seems to be to mimic them; not to oppose corruption and dictatorial politics per se, but to offer a Democratic version of them.This is a moral failure, as well as a failure of imagination. Just four years ago, the Democrats offered a real contrast to Trump, the abuser in chief, by calling for Cuomo’s resignation, and signaling that the abuse of women would not be tolerated within their ranks. The about-face by those who called for Cuomo’s resignation then but are unwilling to declare him unfit for office now – including the statesenator Jessica Ramos, theUS senator Kirsten Gillibrand,Torresand theTimes– is a sign of the establishment’s cowardice. If they are willing, even conspicuously eager, to abandon their stated principles when they think that those principles have become politically inconvenient, why should New Yorkers trust them to behave with integrity and trustworthiness the rest of the time?In addition to dishonorable, it is not clear that the Democrats’ embrace of masculine bullies will even be politically wise. After all, why would those voters who long for a strongman chase after a pale Democratic imitation of Trump, when Republicans are offering them the real thing? Isn’t it more pragmatic – as well as more dignified – to present voters with something different, and maybe even more decent and hopeful, than the mixture of domination and resentment on offer from the right?But perhaps what is most telling about the Democratic party’s embrace of Cuomo is not just their disregard for principle or policy, but their willingness to squander other talent. The mayoral race in New York City is crowded, but Cuomo’s two nearest contenders – Mamdani and Brad Lander, the city comptroller – have run remarkable campaigns. Lander has touted a considerable record of accomplishments for the city, underscoring his ability to deliver on promises to New Yorkers and his willingness to persist against formidable interests in long fights for things like bike lanes and affordable housing. Mamdani, meanwhile, has an infectious charisma, and has launched a campaign that has excited young voters, energized a small army of volunteers, and deployed innovative messaging tactics, achieving impressive numbers with relatively little money. You would think that the Democratic party would be more eager to make use of these men’s talents – the policy achievements of one, the preternatural campaign skills of the other. Instead, mainstream Democrats seem fearful, and almost hostile, towards these candidates. Then again, that’s much the way they feel about their voting base itself.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsAndrew CuomoOpinionDemocratsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

Next week it hosts a UN summit in Seville to prove itSupported byAbout this contentTue 24 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 07.25 EDTShareSpain swims against the tide. At a time when much ofEuropeis grappling with economic crises, caving in to populist anti-aid narratives and slashing development budgets, the country is increasing its financial support for the global south. Instead of planning future aid cuts, Spain has put ambitious goals for 2030 into law.Moreover, at a time when much of the world is looking inward and retreating from multilateralism, Spain will host aUN summit in Sevillethis month, the first of its kind in the global north. Dozens of heads of government, state and multilateral organisations will discuss how to finance development in a post-aid world, suffocated by military spending and unpayable debt in dozens of countries, particularly those in Africa. For the Spanish government, the forthcoming Seville summit is a clear political statement.By promoting multilateralism and international cooperation – while increasing development aid – Spain has become an outlier in the new world disorder. After all, the Trump administration is not alone in slashing development aid. The UK, France and Germany, among others, have jumped on the aid-cutting bandwagon. According to OECD figures, officialdevelopment assistance dropped by 7.1% globallyin 2024, with theEuropean Union cutting aid by 8.6%. And the OECD warns that this marks just the beginning of a broader downward trend; projections suggest that 2025 could see the largest aid cut in history.Solidarity with those beyond its borders is woven into Spain’s identity – rooted perhaps in its own historical memory of underdevelopmentIn sharp contrast, Spainincreased its foreign aid by 12%, according to the foreign ministrylast year, and has committed to reaching the longstanding target ofallocating 0.7% of its gross domestic product by 2030.It is worth noting that, despite these pledges,Spainis not at present particularly generous. Development aid accounts for just 0.25% of GDP, which is less than the 0.33% OECD average. This means not only that Spain has a long way to go to meet the 0.7% commitment, but also that the government’s pro-aid rhetoric is only partly backed up by euros and dollars. Moreover, part of that aid – as in other donor countries – is dedicated to hosting refugees in Spain. At a time when international solidarity is crumbling, however, Spain’s political commitment and vocal support for aid matters all the same.So how did we get here, and what makes Spain (alongside a few other countries such as Portugal or Italy) theAsterix’s Gaulish villageof aid? And more importantly, are there lessons here for other countries?International cooperation has traditionally been a matter of national consensus in Spain. Solidarity with those beyond its borders is woven into the country’s identity – rooted, perhaps, in its own historical memory of underdevelopment. Like Ireland and South Korea – countries also defending aid – Spain became rich after having been poor. Spain’s post-civil war suffering and relative poverty until recent decades make it easier for Spaniards to empathise with hardship abroad.The country’s own development, too, was aided by external support. More recently, European cohesion funds, in particular, played a crucial role. Spain continues to look to Europe with a sense of gratitude and trust. During the Franco dictatorship, Europe was seen as both a lifeline and a beacon of freedoms. Isolationism is not part of the national sentiment.View image in fullscreenTechnicians test samples for pesticides, heavy metals, PCBs and other pollutants at Senegal’s Ceres Locustox lab in Dakar, which receives support from Spain.Photograph: Marta Moreiras/AECIDSupport for aid has traditionally united parties across the political spectrum, from the left and the right to the regional independents. The newCooperation Law, passed in 2023, received backing from every party in parliament – except the far-right Vox. Beyond institutional politics, foreign aid also enjoys strong support among the Spanish public. Last year, Spain was the world’s largest private donor to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, in absolute terms, which is remarkable for a medium-sized country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of these communities have long defended solidarity and social justice as core Christian principles. And while the far right is growing in Spain, its influence remains limited compared with Reform UK, France’s National Rally (RN, formerly the National Front), or Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). On aid policy specifically, Vox has so far failed to drag Spain’s traditional conservative People’s party further to the right.There is a more pragmatic factor that should not be underestimated. While the economies of major donor countries are struggling, Spain continues to grow. While the European Commissionforecasts just 0.9% growth for the eurozone, Spain is expected to grow at a much healthier 2.6%.These figures matter – but don’t tell the whole story. Beneath the surface lies growing inequality, the kind that has fuelled anger and driven millions of disaffected voters into the arms of populist protest parties in other countries. Yet Spain continues to champion development cooperation – alongside feminism, climate action, giving legal status to migrants and diversity policies – placing itself at odds with the culture war agenda.With its progressive stand, Spain tries to position itself as a bridge between the global south and the north – a role in which it holds a degree of some credibility, particularly in light of its outspoken support for Palestinians in Gaza.But there are signs pointing out that a shift might also happen in Spain. The traditional social cohesion, which united Spaniards despite party politics, is cracking at an alarming rate. Society is increasingly polarised and fragile.Levelling the playing field: the football clubs helping migrants make a new home in SpainRead moreSo far, changes in government have not led to major shifts in international cooperation policy, but it would be unwise to underestimate the speed of change elsewhere. In regions where Vox holds or held power along with the traditional right, such as Aragón and Valencia, demands for budget cuts have emerged.On social media, political rivals shout at each other and shamelessly manufacture fake news. We saw it during the recent floods in Valencia, where the traditional right spread xenophobic messages alleging the government cared more about victims in Gaza than those closer to home.Meanwhile, political instability in Spain is growing ever more evident in the aftermath of corruption scandals involving the ruling Socialist party. If there were to be early elections, a new approach to aid could gain traction. Those who believe Spanish social solidarity is too deeply rooted to turn back should perhaps look at the US, Trump’s arrival and the dismantling ofUSAID.Ana Carbajosa is editor-in-chief ofPlanetaFuturo, the development section of El PaísExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionSpainAidHumanitarian responseUSAIDTrump administrationEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

This is not how to avert a famineJames Elder is Unicef’s global spokespersonTue 24 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTFirst published on Fri 20 Jun 2025 07.38 EDTShareAbed Al Rahman, just a boy, carried the weight of his family’s hunger as he stepped into the streets ofGazain search of bread. He had his father’s money, but when he saw the tide of people pushing towards a food distribution site in Rafah, hunger pulled him into their flow.Almost immediately, the site descended into chaos. Gunfire. Drones. Then in a flash, shrapnel from a tank shell ripped through his little body. When I met him at a hospital in Khan Younis – where painkillers, like food, are scarce – the 13-year-old was in agony. “I have shrapnel inside my body that they couldn’t remove,” he told me. “I am in real pain; since 6am I have been asking for a painkiller.” As he recounted the chaos, his father’s composure shattered, and tears rolled down his face. Was he going to lose his son simply because Abed Al Rahman wanted his family to eat?Abed Al Rahman had been trying to get food from a new private and militarised distribution site in Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is funnelling aid through a handful of southern sites guarded by private contractors and Israeli soldiers. With so few distribution points, those who can make the trek are forced to travel long, dangerous distances – risking their lives for grossly inadequate amounts of supplies.In the first week of the GHF’s operation, there werefive mass-casualty eventsin the vicinity of distribution sites as desperate civilians were met by gun and tank fire. Children have been killed. The UN’s aid chief,Tom Fletcher, saidthe sites made “starvation a bargaining chip” and were “a fig leaf for further violence and displacement”. A system that bypasses the UN has, in fact, bypassed humanity. Indeed, politicised aid distribution is unsafe for everyone involved – last week, the GHF said eight of its local team members and volunteers had been killed.And while it’s critical that there is a focus on this lethal lack of aid for Palestinians, the daily killing and maiming of children has become an afterthought. This is my fifth mission to Gaza since the horrors of 7 October, and in all that time almost nothing has been done to stop the world’s deadliest conflict for children in recent memory. There have been more than50,000 childrenreported killed or injured in 20 months. Fifty thousand.On the same morning I met Abed Al Rahman, I spoke with 24-year-old Sheima, also hospitalised. She, too, went to one of the GHF distribution sites. Different day, same story: her family was denied humanitarian aid for months. Consumed by hunger, her father too sick to travel, Sheima reached a site. Again, gunfire. Boxes of food thrown to the dirt. “I saw dead bodies on the ground,” she told me. “People stepping over them, just trying to get some food.” In the mayhem, Sheima became entangled in wire – her leg and arm torn open as she tried to flee. She didn’t get any food. “Even though I almost died, I would go again,” she said. “I’m the eldest in my family – we need food to survive. I wish to die with a full stomach, not from starvation.”These raw testimonials reinforce two critical questions. First, when UN and international non-governmental organisations warehouses outside Gaza are jam-packed with lifesaving supplies, why is there still a lethal lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza? And second, will these few sites run by private contractors solve the crisis?On the first point, after a total blockade on all supplies going into Gaza from early March until 19 May, Unicef and the World Food Programme are now permitted to bring in limited quantities of only a few selected items. Meanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classificationwarned last monththat all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza are facing life-threatening food insecurity. Lack of access to clean water has been pushed to lethal levels.Amid incessant bombardments, drastic aid restrictions and mass displacement of the civilian population, the risk of famine is not just possible, but increasingly likely for families in Gaza. From the end of the ceasefire to May this year, malnutrition admissions among children aged under fivesurged by nearly 150%, with a steep rise in severe cases. This isn’t just a trend – it’s an urgent warning.And to the second question, can the GHF prevent famine? The reality is, far too little aid is being distributed from far too few distribution points, all amid concerns that families travelling from northern Gaza to reach sites in the south will not be allowed to return.This is not how you avert famine. Before the collapse of the most recent ceasefire, the UN operated a highly effective aid delivery system in Gaza. And during the ceasefire, we were delivering assistance from more than 400 distribution points across the territory. Access to food, safe water, medicines and shelter skyrocketed. Unicef even went door-to-door to reach malnourished children.Unicef continues to call for a ceasefire, protection of children, the release of hostages and full aid access. We know what it takes to deliver for children in emergencies – it is the same in every crisis and every conflict since the second world war. Children need nutritious food at scale, safety, clean water and dignity. Not security operators. Not indiscriminate fire. Not chaos.There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We delivered aid at scale during the ceasefire, and we can do it again. We just need to be allowed to do our jobs.Abed Al Rahman died of his injuries on 17 June 2025, after this article was written.James Elder is Unicef’s global spokespersonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Online, “adult tummy time” has gained traction in recent months, with videos filmed byprone TikTokersgaining millions of views.Swing time: experts weigh in on TikTok’s kettlebell challengeRead moreWhat is adult tummy time?There are variations in practice, but adult tummy time usually involves lying, baby-like, on one’s belly, passively propped up on elbows (the sphinx pose in yoga) or on one’s hands (cobra pose). Other videos show static holds without arm support, in an arched Superman position.Various claims have been made about adult tummy time on social media, including that it can help “fix” one’s posture, alleviate neck and back pain, and undo “tech neck”, the hunched, head-forward position many of us inadvertently adopt while deskbound.Posture and painThink of “good posture” and the image of a soldier-like ramrod back might come to mind. “There are very strong cultural beliefs about what good posture is,” says Prof Leon Straker of Curtin University.Despite strongly held assumptions that a slumped posture increases your risk of neck and back pain, researchers say there is little convincing evidence this is actually the case.Onestudy in teenagers, co-authored by Straker, found no association between sitting posture and neck pain, while a second, whichtracked young adultsover five years, found that, surprisingly, “people with the really direct upright posture – which we normally think of as good – actually had slightly increased risk of pain”.“The conclusion there is that posture is really important for function, but it doesn’t link strongly to your risk of pain,” Straker says.“We do have some evidence [in adults] that people that have neck pain do tend to lean forward as they’re sitting at, say, a computer,” the head of physiotherapy at the University of Newcastle, Prof Suzanne Snodgrass, says. But association is not causation – it’s unclear whether thatforward head positioncauses the neck pain, or whether people maintain that posturebecausethey have neck pain.Snodgrass says that when people are seated, “there’s certainly an ideal posture that we tend to talk about: upright, head sitting above your shoulders and not forward, shoulders above your hips, and not leaning forward”.But people shouldn’t get too hung up on “trying to stay stiffly in a perfect posture all the time, because that can be just as bad,” she says. “It’s quite important to move and to feel comfortable moving in and out of different postures.”“Many people can have what would be called poor posture and have no pain at all,” the head of physiotherapy at the University of Technology Sydney, Associate Prof Bruno Saragiotto, says. He points out that back pain is more strongly associated with low physical activity, stress, emotions and sleep than mechanical factors.Can tummy time ‘fix’ tech neck?Extended hours in front of screens –gimmicky dolls made by office equipment companieswould have us believe – will eventually turn us all into slouched Quasimodos.“If you sit hunched for a long time, does your posture end up being stuck that way? I think there’s some merit to that,” Snodgrass says. “For a lot of the years of your life, you can reverse things by doing exercise and movement.”Is good posture overrated? Back to first principles on back painRead moreThe rationale for adult tummy time “is that if your spine is in the opposite position, rounded for a lot of the day, if you put it in that [extension] position, you’re kind of balancing it out,” she says. “Tummy time probably helps your lumbar spine [the lower back] more than it helps your neck.”But as for “fixing” posture, “it’s not going to change how you sit – it’s only going to move your spine in another way, to give it a bit more mobility when you’re doing other things.”Saragiotto finds the idea of “fixing” posture problematic, because it “suggests that posture is a mechanical flaw, which often leads to over-medicalisation, anxiety and fear around normal posture variations”.“A better idea is to build postural tolerance through exercise,” he says. “Posture is dynamic and adaptable, and not something to ‘correct’.”For those inclined to spend more time belly down, Snodgrass advises trying to keep the neck neutral. “There’ll be some people that can’t get up on their elbows because their back is too stiff, and just lying on the tummy with their head on the ground is a stretch for them … As you get a bit more flexible, then you can come up on to elbows.”Straker says from a biomechanics perspective, “it makes good sense for people to be doing a trunk, head [and] neck extension activity to counter the flexed activity that we spend a lot of our time in”. Though the evidence doesn’t suggest adult tummy time will change posture or risk of neck pain in the long term, back extension positions may help to maintain range of movement, he says.He emphasises the “need to start gently and progress it sensibly, so that you’re not actually … creating pain by doing something that you’re body’s not used to”.Other movements to try“There is no single ideal posture linked to pain prevention,” Saragiotto says. Although tummy time positions are low risk and easy to do, “there are better interventions supported by evidence, such as … pilates, having a healthy lifestyle, and even walking.”In an office environment, “having breaks and moving during the day is usually what will help more than having a perfect ergonomic posture,” he says.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Also lifting through the lower abdominal muscles, so pulling them up and in shoulders back … And then just lifting your head nice and long, and standing tall.“At home, you can lie on your back, knees bent, and have your arms out to the side, like drawing angels in the snow … so that you’re stretching your arms. That will stretch out that upper back as well, and while you’re doing that, tucking the chin down to lengthen the back of the neck.”For strength, Straker also suggests exercises that involve lifting the head and neck against gravity, such as swimming.Any ongoing pain, the experts say, should be assessed by a health professional.Donna Lu is an assistant news editor at Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But Farage knows better than Labour that headlines matterTue 24 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.04 EDTShareIn a political landscape where the traditional left struggles to even mention the working class, let alone articulate a compelling vision for them, Nigel Farage and Reform UK are playing a shrewd hand. This week they will add to their political momentum with a bold, headline-grabbing policy: theBritannia Card– a commitment to tax the rich to put money in the pockets of the poor. This isn’t just policy; it’s political theatre, designed to resonate deeply with an electorate hungry for tangible change, mixed with an idea of British patriotism.Reform’s proposal is deceptively simple: anyone seeking to live in the UK must make an “entry contribution” of £250,000. This substantial sum, the policy pledges, would then be directly redistributed to the lowest 10% of earners, making 2.5 million people between £600 and £1,000 better off a year, depending on uptake.This policy capitalises on a surging public appetite for wealth redistribution. Polls indicate thatmore than three-quarters of Britons, and69% of Reform voters, believe the rich should be taxed more. The sheer simplicity of taxing new arrivals and directly putting that money into the hands of struggling families creates an easily digestible and highly memorable message. It also tackles a pervasive public cynicism: a distrust of politicians’ ability to handle tax revenues. By hypothecating – ring-fencing – these funds directly for the poorest full-time workers, Reform bypasses the common fear that taxes disappear into a black hole of government spending.This populist appeal is not unique to Farage. Across the Atlantic, New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has gained significant traction with a similar approach:taxing the wealthy to fund free childcare. The lesson is clear: politicians who offer transparent, direct benefits, funded by those perceived to be able to afford it most, capture the public imagination.Of course, Farage is (annoyingly) a master of political manoeuvring, and the Britannia Card is no exception. While it promises to enrich the poor, it simultaneously offers a subtle tax break to the wealthiest. The proposal would be a significant boon to the global super-rich, because all their overseas income and assets would be exempt from UK taxation for a decade.Labourhas been quick to point out that this could lead to a net decrease in tax income overall. But in the age of soundbites, such nuanced economic arguments often fall on deaf ears. The headline is what matters, and the headline here is “money from the rich, for the poor”.Labour, meanwhile, seems to have retreated from the very ground that should be its natural habitat. Its reluctance to champion the working class, coupled with plans such as cutting personal independence payments (Pip), is a critical misstep. Governments get re-elected when people feel materially better off. The Biden administration’s experience in the US is a stark reminder of this. The Labour leadership has wedded itself to a flawed assumption that aggregate economic growth, if it even materialises, will translate into a felt improvement for the working and middle classes. Labour’s plans for increased investment, while needed, will take years to bear fruit. What is it offering to those struggling today?When I worked directly with progressive governments globally, we found that “solidarity taxes” – similar in narrative to what Reform is proposing – can be highly effective. Uruguay’s tax on the richest during Covid, designed to support the poorest, proved popular due to its transparency and the clear way in which it was communicated. Similar taxes were implemented in Germany during reunification and Japan in the aftermath of the second world war. The key is clarity and directness of purpose.Any government serious about addressing inequality should focus on taxing wealth. The latest Sunday Times rich list shockingly revealed that just50 families now possessmore wealth than the bottom 50% of the UK population. Much of this wealth, unlike income from work, cannot be solely attributed to “hard graft”, but is down to asset inflation. Crucially, the longstanding myth that millionaires will simply flee the country if taxed more heavily is being debunked. The Tax Justice Network – with Patriotic Millionaires UK and Tax Justice UK – hasrecently shownthat supposed “millionaire exoduses” are vastly exaggerated, and that tax is a minor factor in migration decisions for the tiny percentage of wealthy individuals who do move.Labour’s current attempts to address wealth inequality, such as changes to inheritance tax for farmland and VAT on private schools, feel piecemeal. Rumours of a reversal on its non-dom tax policies suggest it remains susceptible to elite lobbying, further undermining its progressive credentials. Instead of dancing around the issue, Labour could, for instance,boldly proposea modest 2% annual tax on wealth exceeding £10m, to raise a significant £24bn annually. The crucial step then would be to articulate clearly how this new revenue would be used – perhaps to address the cost-of-living crisis by boosting social security.Perhaps the most potent lesson Labour can learn from Reform isn’t about the specifics of the Britannia Card, but about the art of communication. While Rachel Reeves often speaks in a convoluted beige, Farage paints in bright, clear colours. He understands that political messaging, particularly on economic issues, needs to be immediate, impactful and easily understood. The very naming of the policy is a masterstroke of patriotic populism.The name also reminds us that we are in dangerous territory. The coupling of anti-immigration rhetoric with populist economic policies is a potent combination. Labour’s true test lies not in outmanoeuvring Farage on his own turf, but in offering a courageous and convincing alternative: a clear, compelling narrative of shared prosperity, funded by those who can most afford it, for the benefit of all.Faiza Shaheen is a distinguished policy fellow at London School of Economics, and the incoming executive director of Tax Justice UKExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionNigel FarageReform UKTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

But in a society where pay has stagnated, support for more strikes is waningTue 24 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 10.53 EDTShare“Because you’re worth it,” goes the ad. But knowing who is worth what is even harder to determine than it was half a century ago. So as doctorsvote in a strike ballot, how will the public weigh up their just reward?Some 50,000 resident doctors – formerly known as junior doctors – are deciding whether to walk out again in England. Their year-and-a-half-long series of strikes ended with Wes Streeting agreeing a 22.3% pay rise over two years. Now their seniors, hospital consultants, are about to vote on striking toreclaim the 26%the British Medical Association (BMA) says their pay has fallen by since 2008.The public backed striking doctors last year despite the1.3m healthcare appointments lost, which cost the NHS £1.5bn. Beyond pay, that was a protest against a government that had stripped the NHS bare: public satisfaction with the health service was at a peak in 2010 but by last year it hadfallen to its lowestsince records began. There was a strong sense among staff and the public that this was about defending the state of the service.Would doctors get that public backing now? YouGov finds48% opposedto further strike action, with 39% of voters in favour. Times have changed: the NHS wasthe big gainerin this month’s spending review, with extra funding designed to cut waiting times and increase GP appointments, though it is still under intense strain. Senior medics, including the former president of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Clare Gerada, wrote aletter to the Guardianimploring doctors not to strike again. “The NHS is at a more perilous state than at any time in our careers,” they wrote. “A doctors’ strike would further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver, and play into the hands of those who don’t believe in an NHS that is publicly funded and based on need not want.” Streeting has just awarded resident doctors an average pay rise of5.4%, more than the rest of the NHS.Here’s the issue: despite last year’s good post-strike rise, the BMA says resident doctors’ pay has fallen by 23% in real terms since 2008, and they intend to get it back,as do theteachers, whose pay has fallen behind like all the public sector. This is a poorer country, with growth practically stagnant, battered like the rest by world events but uniquely stricken by Brexit too. Public and private sector pay hasfallen over the past few years, despite a slight uptick recently. This people know instinctively from how far their money doesn’t go: had pay kept growing at pre-financial crash rates, public pay would be 56% higher and the private sector would be 40% better off. These stark figures underlie deep social discontent and distrust of government. No wonder unions strive to bring back better times, calling the doctors’ pay offer “derisory” and “insulting”.Well, is it? Full Fact’s reliable analysis shows foundation year doctors get a£38,831 basic salarywhile the most qualified resident doctors – 48% of them – get £73,992: the salient fact is many of these doctors will become consultants whose earningsescalate to more than £100,000 a year.Is that a lot or not? What you think depends on what you earn, but very few understand where they stand on the scale. Keep focusing here on a string of numbers, because they are the way we live now. Median pay is£37,430, with half earning more and half earning less. When aggregated across a year, the minimum wagehas just risento £25,396.80. To enterthe top 10%of earners you must have a salary of more than £65,000. Estimates vary, but about£180,000 is the thresholdfor entering the top 1%.It may be no comfort to public sector employees that theprime minister’s salaryhas sharply fallen behind. His £172,153 pay, not quite within the top 1%, should be £305,770 had it kept up with inflation since 2009. Using the PM’s pay as a comparator – as anti-public-sector rightwingers do to castigate any public servants earning more – makes little sense: someheadteachersrunning multi-academy trusts can reach £300,000, as can CEOs of large city councils.Are those sums a lot? They are peanuts compared with private sector high-flyers. The opaquely funded TaxPayers’ Alliance has a “public sector rich list” that fails to make comparisons with private top pay. Six-figure earners in the public sphere, running a large school or hospital, have a far more complex task than company CEOs earning millions for single-performance indicators: the bottom line and the share price. New research from the High Pay Centre, funded by the Aberdeen Financial Fairness Trust, just reported that the median FTSE 100 CEO pay is 78 times greater than their median employee’s pay.Tesco’s CEOon £9.23m makes 431 times more than a median Tesco worker. It’s been six years since revealing these pay ratiosbecame mandatoryfor large listed companies, but high hopes have been dashed becauseit has changed nothing: exposing gigantic inequality has not shamed boardrooms into reconsidering their values on pay.“Fair pay” is a slippery concept. Fair pay agreements for every sector are government policy, starting experimentally with social care, for employers and unions to agree legally binding minimum rates and conditions affordable in their industry. They reflect the old wages councils devised by Winston Churchill to protect “sweated labour”, which were later abolished by Margaret Thatcher. When she disempowered unions, workers’ pay fell while the top pay, off the leash, shot up stratospherically, where it remains.In the light of all that grotesque distortion of worth, doctors and other valued public servants deserve high rewards. But in the everyday world where growth and pay have long stagnated, people seeing resident doctors’ significant pay rise last July may resent them striking again, this time against anNHSat last struggling to its feet.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionNHSEnglandHealthIndustrial actionWes StreetingPaycommentShareReuse this content"

First, define national interestJohn QuigginThe prospect of handing control of the energy company to overseas buyers has raised a series of concerns. But many of them are nebulousTue 24 Jun 2025 01.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 19.17 EDTShareAmid the multifarious chaos of the past week, many of us might have missed the controversy over the proposed purchase of the energy business Santos by an overseas consortium. But the proposal islikely to create big problems for Australian governmentsand its resolution will reveal a lot about how Australian policymakers view energy and climate policy.Santos is one of the largest and oldest Australian producers of oil and gas, second only to WoodsideEnergy(its name is an acronym of South Australia and Northern Territory Oil Search). The core of its operation is the Moomba gas field in the Cooper Basin, in the north-east corner of South Australia. The company now supplies gas to the entire eastern seaboard and has assets in the Timor Sea and Papua New Guinea.The consortium proposing to buySantos, called XRG, is owned by the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) and includes the Carlyle Group among its members. Carlyle, named for the New York hotel where its founders met to set up the business, is one of the world’s largest private equity companies, with close ties to what US President Eisenhower described as the “military-industrial complex”. Its early years are described in Dan Briody’s book The Iron Triangle.Jim Chalmers faces ‘captain’s call’ over Abu Dhabi bid for Australian oil and gas giant SantosRead moreAbu Dhabi is the wealthiest and most important of the United Arab Emirates. The value of its state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds total over a trillion dollars. Abu Dhabi’s wealth is derived almost entirely from oil and gas, so it is unsurprising to see its national oil company pursuing expansion through acquisitions like the proposed buyout of Santos.Unsurprisingly the prospect of handing ownership of a large share of Australia’s energy resources to buyers like these has raised concerns. Most commonly, these are expressed in terms of energy security or, more nebulously, national interest.The issue of energy security can be dismissed pretty rapidly. Unlike the oil we import, the gas is physically located here. If we need it, we can keep it, regardless of the legalities of ownership, contracts and so on. At one time, perhaps, such an attitude might have raised concerns about sovereign risk, threats to future investment and so on. Foreign owners might have threatened us with action under Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) agreements. But the “rules-based order” in which such concerns made sense, is largely a thing of the past, for good or ill. ISDS, in particular, is more or less dead. Even so, the government has shied away from fixing the absurdly unfavourable gas export contracts signed by Santos and others a decade ago.Concerns about how the deal might affect our national interest are harder to address, mainly because Australian governments have no clear idea of what our national interest might be. It might be argued that we ought to be maximising the returns from our natural resources, while winding down fossil fuels, in line with the goal of achieving “net zero” emissions globally by 2050. But there is no sign that Australian energy policy is motivated by such goals.In fact, Santos has been a major player in the expansion of gas exports, notably of LNG from Queensland, and is pushing for even higher exports. The company has just received regulatoryapproval for the $5.8bn Barossa offshore gas projectoff the Northern Territory coast, described by critics as a “carbon bomb”. The extra financial resources available to XRG might accelerate this.What is in our “national interest” is similarly incoherent in regards to tax revenue. Australia taxes itsmassive gas exports weakly, and it’s hard to see how we would get a worse deal from a foreign owned company compared to an Australian one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Carlyle, as a private company, is concerned with maximising its profits. Adnoc wants profits but also more influence over global markets. But it is a mistake to think that Santos cares any more, except about those Australians who happen to be shareholders, and who can expect a big payout if the takeover goes ahead.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsThis article originally stated that XRG was owned by the Carlyle Group and the Abu Dhabi NationalOilCompany (Adnoc).

It’s a white elephant plan, sucking money from local projects that could actually improve livesTue 24 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 10.52 EDTShareThere appear to be two main determinants of what infrastructure gets built. The first is whether it provides large and lucrative contracts for powerful corporations. The second is whether ministers can pose beside it in hard hats and yellow jackets. Otherwise, it is hard to explain the decisions made.Both determinants favour large and spectacular schemes. Big corporations don’t want to dabble in minor improvements: real money comes from prestige projects over which governments cannot afford to lose face, ensuring that they keep throwing cash, however high the budget spirals. And few ministers want to pose beside a new bus stop: a grand ego demands a grand setting.Last week, the government quietly flickedanother £590mat the planned Lower Thames Crossing, to the east of London. That’s the kind of money other public services must beg for. Compare it, for example, with the funding allocated in this month’sspending reviewfor local amenities such as parks, libraries and swimming pools. Across the whole of England, they received £350m. But the extra money for the Lower Thames Crossing buys less than a mile of road. It means that the total costs of the scheme, according to the government, have risen to £9.2bn, for 14 miles of road.Even this is a major underestimate. As theTransport Action Network(Tan) points out, several aspects of the project, such as necessary upgrades to junctions and connecting roads, to take the extra traffic, have been excluded from the total, disguising the full cost. TAN estimates it at £16bn. That’s more than all thenew money (£15bn) trumpetedby Rachel Reeves this month for buses, trains and trams in England, outside London. It’s seven times as much as theTreasury allocatedtofixing England’s school classrooms. Or the government could use it to double theamount investedin the National Housing Bank, to build social and affordable homes: which, by contrast, we need.The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is shocking, whichever way you slice it. Using the official figure for costs, the government bodyNational Highways estimatedthe BCR at 0.48: in other words, a net loss of 52 pence for every pound spent. It then threw in some vaguely defined “wider economic benefits” to deliver an “adjusted BCR” of 1.22. That’s stilllow value for money. Compare it with fixing potholes and maintaining local roads, which has aBCR of 7, officially “very high” value for money. Oh, and guess what? The maintenance backlog for England’s local roads isjust over £16bn.I asked the Campaign for Better Transport to estimate what else might be done with the official figure of £9.2bn. It told me the money would enable every community in England to have what the government defines as a “reasonable level” of bus services for the next nine years. Or it could pay for 11,400 miles (18,400km) of cycle lanes, or 5,700 miles (9,200km) of bus lanes.So why is this vastly expensive white elephant endlessly inflated while crucial services and benefits are cut? The clue is the “vastly expensive” bit: a single project on this scale can be extremely lucrative for large corporations, and they will lobby for it with commensurate vigour.The government insists the new road will relieve congestion. But even30 years ago, official assessments showed that new roads generate new traffic, a phenomenon called “induced demand”. They shift congestion to the next pinch point, which becomes another issue for the government to solve: jobs-for-life for the construction industry. Using modelling data from National Highways, Thurrock council estimates that traffic on the Dartford crossing, which the new road is supposed to relieve, will return to current levelsin just five years. Given that the Lower Thames Crossing will take at least seven years to build, with massive disruption throughout, it’s hard to detect the public benefit. It will also funnel more traffic on to the M25, A13 and M2, greatlyincreasing congestion.TAN has done what successive governments, astonishingly, have failed to do: commissioneda reporton how demand for freight and passenger transport in the region and on the wider network might best be met. It found that new heavy freight and passenger rail connections would provide a far more effective solution, at roughly a quarter of the price. Even with added rail loading gauge upgrades and electrification, bus routes, ferries and trams, this approach would remain far cheaper, while meeting public need, reducing pollution and social exclusion and catalysing the long-overdue transition to rail freight in the UK.But neither successive governments nor National Highways have seriously examined such alternatives to the crossing. For the past 60 years, the answer has been roads, regardless of the question. Not only has National Highways ignored other means of solving the problem, it has become promoter as well as planner of the scheme, engaging in apublic relations offensivethat looks to me like a crashing conflict of interest. If you want what transport planners call a “modal shift” from one kind of travel to another, first you need a conceptual shift. But we won’t get it from existing agencies. National Highways is a relic of another age, unfit for purpose, driving us towards disaster. It should be scrapped.The greatest costs of schemes such as this are felt not in our tax bills, but in our bodies, minds and surroundings. The government estimates the new road will generate6.6m tonnesof carbon dioxide. It would greatly increase bothair pollutionandtraffic noise, and commit us to an even greater extent to car driving, with all its destructive implications forhealth, fitness and mental wellbeing,community cohesionandsocial attitudes.As a rule, though there are exceptions, what improves our lives are multiplesmall interventions, tailored to local needs and responsive to local democracy. What damages our lives are prestige projects tailored to the demands of big finance and corporate shareholders. The capital behind them, that sometimes seems more powerful than governments, treats democracy and public need as traffic engineerstreat pedestrians– obstacles to be designed out of the way.Sometimes big infrastructure is necessary, but at all times it is a threat to democracy. This is why governments should approach it with caution and scepticism. Instead, they act as hucksters for corporate boondoggles. Such schemes allow politicians to stamp their mark on the nation, to don the hard hat and announce: “I did this.” Look on my works, ye mighty …One measure of a nation’s success is the extent to which it can reduce its dependence on road transport, in favour of inclusive, low-impact travel. Our government seems committed to failure.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRoad transportOpinionInfrastructurePollutionPublic transportSpending review 2025EnglandTransportcommentShareReuse this content"

Who is alive now? Who was killed? Were they just collateral damage?Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe denounces Israeli attack on Iran’s Evin prisonTue 24 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 11.32 EDTShareOn Monday morning Israeli airstrikes struck the Evin prison’s gate, damaging the court adjacent to the prison and some of the wards, including the women’s political ward where I spent five years. The prison holds a large number of political prisoners and opponents of the Islamic Republic in Iran. Nobody seems to know what has happened to them.Since the bombing ofIranstarted 12 days ago, I have avoided the news and all requests for interviews. It has felt too sad. But as I was sitting at my desk, I saw the news about Evin popping up on my screen. My hands froze and I felt a shiver down my neck, just as when bad news landed back when I was held. After a couple of minutes I contacted my former Evin cellmates who arenow outside to check if they knew anything. They were as horrified and scared as I was.We tried to get in touch with any of the families of prisoners we could find, to confirm their safety, but it was impossible. The ceiling had collapsed, there were reports of injuries and there were families shouting outside the walls. The UK does not even know how many British citizens are held in Evin, or where they have been moved. Meanwhile, Iran has started a tighter crackdown on civilians, including cutting the internet and makingmore arrests. Days are numb with helplessness and outrage.When I was in prison, we experienced earthquakes, twice. There were power cuts as a result and we had to sit in the dark. Candles were not allowed and the emergency power rarely worked. It was horrid. Some women sat together praying, some sat in morbid silence. It felt as if we had died and we were praying over our own deaths. It felt as if anything could happen to us at that moment and there was no rescue. Prisoners are not a priority to the outside world when disasters come, but their lives matter to their loved ones.Watching those prison doors being blown off felt surreal. I have walked in and out of that gate so many times, beingtaken to court or hospital, and always dreamed of the day when they would finally be opened and all prisoners would be set free from that place of oppression. So bringing down those gates might have seemed like a symbolic act for faraway media. But it did not feel like it made anyone safe inside. If anything, it took away lives. The crackdown from the Iranian authorities keen to reaffirm control feels as if it has only just begun.The Iranian people have suffered decades of crimes by the Islamic Republic,which has violated their basic human rights, incarcerated thousands of people and executed many for standing up for themselves. Many of those are in Evin.Back in 2022, I had a similar feeling when Evin was set on fire shortly after my freedom. It wasn’t joy but fear. I was desperate to get some news about my friends held there, terrified that something terrible would happen to them even as the prison burned. I asked a friend whose house overlooked Evin to video-call me and face the phone screen towards the window so that I could see the prison with my own eyes. There was no comfort in the flames, just fear of what was to come.For so many of my family and friends, it is that same fear now, watching the games of governments we do not trust and the demonstrations of power with a sudden silencing of the protections of law. As Iranfalls apart, it is vulnerable people who are most exposed.Over the past 12 days, we have all been glued to our phones hoping that what we saw was just a wild nightmare we would wake up from. It has been a shock. It started as unlawful bombing of Iran by Israel, though no one seemed to say it was unlawful. It has now escalated into a proper war against Iran with US intervention and the rhetoric of regime change. The mission creep has been unnerving, even for those of us who have suffered at the hands of the Iranian regime. The silence of the international community, including the UK, on this point has been worrying.During my hostage case the UK’s reluctance to acknowledge the law and legal rights was frustrating for our family. But right now, the consequences are much greater. We run the risk of things getting much worse.When I returned to Britain, Keir Starmer was one of the first people to greet me and get a picture. Two years ago he invited me to his Westminster office with other British-Iranian women’s activists on International Women’s Day and promised that his government would stand up for human rights in Iran. In opposition, there was no equivocation. But in government, there has been much more equivocation around the UK’s commitment to international law. Even yesterday there was a dangerous reluctance from Starmer’s ministers to criticise the illegality of allies joining in Israel’s war on Iran. The consequences are felt all around Tehran by families caught between a bomb and a hard place. They have felt very alone.If Evin taught me anything, it was that freedom does not come from bombs and brutality, nor from clever stunts for the cameras. It lies in human connection and empathy. People in Iran, people across the Middle East – in prison and outside – could do with a bit more of that now.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a British-Iranian dual national who was detained in Evin prison for five yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But beneath the fear lies a determination to endureMohammad AzimiAs an Australian Iranian I feel caught between two worldviews – but experiencing this conflict first-hand has shown me the quiet strength of a society under attackMon 23 Jun 2025 23.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareItravelled toIranfrom Australia to visit my ageing parents and reconnect with my roots. What was meant to be a short family visit took a dramatic turn with the outbreak of a sudden and unprovoked war imposed on Iran. I was in Kurdistan on a short sightseeing trip when the first Israeli attack occurred. The news struck like a shock wave, followed by a heavy, ominous silence – the kind that signals something far worse may be unfolding. With airspace closed and internet access severely restricted, I found myself all but stranded.Yesterday, I crossed into Turkey through the Sero-Esendere border in West Azerbaijan province in Iran – a less crowded route which I chose after a painful but deliberate decision. I am now preparing to return to Australia to be reunited with my wife and children.The past few days have been some of the most intense and heartbreaking of my life. Saying goodbye to my elderly parents and siblings, not knowing when – or if – I’ll see them again, was a kind of pain I can’t fully describe. I am profoundly concerned about the growing risk of a wider war that could engulf not just the region, but potentially the world. Above all, I am deeply worried for the future of Iran – one of the greatest countries in the world, rich in culture, history, and resilience.Iranian Australians are worried about Israeli and US strikes – and fearful of Khamenei’s cornered regimeRead moreAs an Australian-Iranian citizen I feel caught between two countries, two identities and two worldviews. It is painfully clear that escalation serves no one. Security cannot be achieved through airstrikes; peace cannot be imposed through fear. The path forward lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and the courage to look beyond past grievances.Experiencing this conflict first-hand has also revealed the quiet strengthof a society under attack– something that rarely makes it into headlines. While international actors debate policy and power, ordinary Iranians navigate each day with remarkable resilience.Shopkeepers reopen their stores, families gather to support one another, and neighbours offer silent gestures of solidarity. Beneath the fear lies a powerful current of dignity – a determination to endure, not out of defiance, but out of necessity and shared humanity.One of the most provocative escalations came with theUnited States’ bombardment of Iran’s nuclear facilities, ordered by Donald Trump. Seen widely as a violation of international law, the strike may paradoxically serve as a turning point.In Australia, Peter Dutton’s electoral loss was in part due to his proposal for peaceful nuclear energy, which alarmed many voters. Yet Iranians have never had that choice. The pursuit of nuclear technology – peaceful or otherwise – has brought more threat than opportunity. The real question now is not what can be gained, but what might be lost.I spent five years in Iran’s notorious Evin prison but when Israel bombed it I felt horror and fearRead moreAt this stage, it no longer matters whether Iran joins the so-called nuclear club. What matters is saving more lives. Will we keep fuelling a war that has lost its core justification? The recent escalation also exposed deeper vulnerabilities. Israel, long reliant on its Iron Dome, found its population confined to bunkers as flaws in the system were revealed. Even the most advanced defence technology cannot promise safety in prolonged conflict.Within Iran, there are different views about missile defence spending, with some seeing it as a point of protection and pride. Yet, as many quietly acknowledge, they can do little to protect against US B-2 bombers.For those of us stranded by this conflict, our only hope is that the leaders of all nations come to understand what ordinary people have always known: peace is the only way forward.Mohammad Azimi is an Australian resident with family in Iran.

As a new exhibition revisits that pivotal moment, the artists remember the prejudice they faced – and what they have achieved sinceKadish MorrisTue 24 Jun 2025 12.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 16.08 EDTShareIt is November 1985 and in a corridor of London’sICA, a pivotal moment in British art history is about to take place. Curated by Lubaina Himid, The Thin Black Line displays work by 11 Black and Asian women artists, hung on the walls of the museum’s narrow walkway – to signify just how they’ve been marginalised. Their work – which explores social, cultural, political, feminist and aesthetic issues – comes as a shock to the stuffy art establishment.Critics dismiss it, or deride the works as “angry”. And yet this show, placing Black women artists firmly at the centre of contemporary British art history, will come to be seen as a turning point, paving the way for future winners of the Turner prize (Himid and Veronica Ryan) and Venice Golden Lion (Sonia Boyce).I didn’t know what to paint for the show. Then Cherry Groce was shot during a police raid on her Brixton homeForty years on, the ICA is revisiting the show with ​​Connecting Thin Black Lines 1985–2025, building on its legacy with new and old works from the original artists, and new contributors. Here, some of them reflect on the original exhibition, the reaction it received, and how the art world has changed.Sutapa Biswas:The 1980s were a charged time politically, socially and economically.I arrived at art college in 1981 with a great degree of understanding about the histories of the empire and how it impacted my parents. They were born in what was called British India. They experienced partition and genocide and were displaced. It was a complex time in the UK, too. In my community in west London, the Southall Youth Movement, an antiracist group, had burned down the Hambrough Tavern where skinhead bands played.Marlene Smith:I was a student, studying for my BA at Bradford School of Art. By the time I joinedthe BLK Art Group,an association of young Black artists, I was already thinking about my identity in relation to feminism. I was not the only Black person studying, but I was one of few. I was certainly the only person trying to make work with political overtones.View image in fullscreen‘The rhetoric was so racist in Britain’ … Sutapa Biswas’s Housewives with Steak-Knives.Photograph: © Sutapa Biswas. All rights reserved, DACS/Artimage 2020. Photo: Andy KeateJennifer Comrie:I was living through a really interesting time: the Troubles, the miners’ strike, Thatcherism, apartheid in South Africa. My work reflected this.Artfor me has always been a wayto garner a better understanding of myself and the world around me.Ingrid Pollard:I was doing various jobs, and signing on for benefits. I was a cleaner. I was a gardener for the council. There weren’t any rosy aspirations to be an artist. I had been doing screen-printing in an evening class and then a job came up in this feminist print shop in London, which I got, much to my surprise. There was a dark room there, so I started doing photography.Sutapa:One day on my university course, I was confronted by a painting by Turner titledThe Slave Ship. My tutor was talking about the expressionistic nature of the brushmarks. I was sitting there thinking: “What about what’s in the water?” That moment, coupled with what I heard in another lecture, made me think: “We’re talking about class and gender – but we’re not talking about race.”Marlene:My painting tutor didn’t like what I was doing. He was not at all convinced that art could, or should, be political. So when Lubaina showed up and stood in front of my work and had a conversation with me, it was totally transformative.Jennifer:When Lubaina came in to my studio by chance and looked at my work, she was intrigued and asked if I would be interested in showing it. Initially I was unsure. I did not realise how pivotal this chance meeting would be.View image in fullscreenSweet spot … Ice Cream Van, by Chila Kumari Burman, whose work featured in the original show.Photograph: Rob HarrisSutapa:I found out Lubaina was doing a talk and went along. I introduced myself and said: “I’m a student at the University of Leeds. I’d love to interview you.” When I submitted my dissertation, I invited Lubaina to do a talk at the university. There, she saw my paintingHousewives with Steak-Knivesand the video work Kali. “I’m organising this exhibition,” she said. “I would love to include your work.”Marlene:The show was coming up, but I had no idea what to make. ThenCherry Grocewas shot [during a police raid on her Brixton home]. So I made Good Housekeeping – a larger than life painting of a woman leaning against a doorway. Behind her outstretched arm is a framed photograph of my sister’s birthday party. Above that image, painted on the wall, are the words: “My mother opens the door at 7am. She is not bulletproof.” I was thinking about Cherry Groce as a middle-aged single mum.Sutapa:The rhetoric was so racist in Britain. So I began to think about performance as strategic intervention. That’s what emerged in Kali. But it also has a presence in Housewives with Steak-Knives. It’s not a static piece, settled against the wall. It sits forward and looks as if it’s going to fall on top of you.Jennifer:Coming to Terms Through Conflict, a work I put in the show, questions identity: northern, Jamaican, British, Black, Christian, etc. Untitled continued this journey. Its broken stitching is intentional, representing a refusal to be contained or defined by social constraints – church, family, anyone. It’s a visual declaration of freedom.Marlene:Jenny had this beautiful singing voice. I remember her singing as we were installing. Even when I think of it now, it chokes me up. I remember Sutapa climbing up and writing the words for my work in black paint.Ingrid:It was fun installing it all. We thought we were being slightly naughty, because it was a well-known gallery. It was only later that I understood the ramifications, the politics of what Lubaina was trying to organise.Helen Cammock[involved in new show]:I was 15 when that exhibition was at the ICA. I wasn’t interested in art then. It wasn’t on my radar until 2005, when I did a photography BA. I had bought some books that contained Ingrid’s work.Postcards Home[her photography book about England and the Caribbean] was on my desk while I wrote my dissertation. The images moved me. I was sad. I was angry. I found beauty.View image in fullscreenA still from There’s a Hole in the Sky Part I by Helen Cammock.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Kate MacGarry, London.Marlene:The response to The Thin Black Line,in terms of art criticism, was pretty appalling. The critics came to it very defensively, rather than looking at what the work had to say. Sutapa and I wrote a piece forSpare Ribmagazine, talking about the lack of useful critique around Black artists.Sutapa:The reviews were reduced to questions of identity and that became a platform for white guilt. But the real issue was avoiding the language ofourpractice, in the way that you might talk about the language of David Hockney’s work or Helen Chadwick’s. We weren’t being afforded the same level criteria. They weren’t dealing with the aesthetics of our practice.Helen:It’s not a new thing. It happens now. This notion that you’re angry. That you’re didactic. It’s a marginal experience and people aren’t interested in it. The whole framing of the show undermined the quality of its ideas, of its potential to shake people’s ways of thinking and seeing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you examine the YBAs, there was a synergy with what had happened earlier with the Black Arts Movement; it’s striking that they seemed to be using our methods of DIY. However, they were not including the Black artists in their projects.Ingrid:There was never a time, after, when I wasn’t making art. I wasn’t ill. I didn’t have children. I was teaching as a way of keeping a regular income. I didn’t have to deal with the aspirations of a gallery representing me. Those things were very alien.Marlene:In 2011, Tate did a show looking back at The Thin Black Line. And then Graves Gallery stumbled across work by the BLK Art Group and did a show. So that felt like something was happening. Over the last 10 years, it feels like there’s been a resurgence of interest in the Black Arts Movement because, despite its significance, it has not made it into discussions of art history.Amber Akaunu [involved in new show]:I studied art and art history at Liverpool Hope University from 2015 to 2018. I didn’t really learn about Black art history. I feel a bit of pain when I find out about things I didn’t know. I started a magazine with another artist in the course called Rooted.We just felt there was a big gap in knowledge.View image in fullscreenHorsing around … Sutapa Biswas’s Birdsong, which is in the new show.Photograph: © Sutapa Biswas. All Rights Reserved. DACS 2025.Sutapa:After the show, I continued to work. I showed with Vito Acconci, Tania Bruguera, Doris Salcedo and Louise Bourgeois at Iniva in London. In 2004 I had a show there that was not nominated for the Turner. Where is my retrospective at the Tate? Where isClaudette Johnson’s? I have not received accolades for my recent exhibitions at the Baltic and Kettle’s Yard.Ingrid:Getting recognition came after a long period of work, 20 to 30 years. I was surprised to be nominated for the Turner. It raises your public profile. The media had ignored me and a lot of artists for 40 years.Marlene:I had a solo show called Ah, Sugar in2024. At the opening, Lubaina introduced me to the curators from the ICA and said that this new exhibition, Connecting Thin Black Lines, would be coming up. It was a surprise, exciting.Helen:I was looking at the complete lineup. Their voices weren’t heard before – and now they are being heard more loudly than ever.Amber:Lubaina hosted a lunch for some of the artists who were going to be in this new show. I just sat there and soaked everything in. It was shocking – but touching – to hear their stories. A lot of these artists have gained so much success, but you can still hear the hurt. I related so much. Some 30 to 40 years on, I’m having similar experiences. I remember curating an exhibition over four days, and showing some work for Black History Month, and we weren’t paid for it.Ingrid:A lot of the young students I speak to are still complaining: lack of recognition, opportunities. Things change, but they remain the same. My advice is you need a gang. You can’t do it on your own. It takes a village to make an artist.Helen:It happened to be a really monumental experience for me being in a show called Carte de Visite with Claudette Johnson and Ingrid Pollard in 2015. I think it encapsulated what’s happening now, the interconnectedness across generations.Marlene:It was a real privilege for me to exhibit with them in the first place. And it’s a real privilege to be reunited. It’s always nerve-wracking when you make new work. There’s a bit of an echo between the piece I’ve made this time and the 1985 piece. This piece is probably more gentle.Amber:The film I’m showing is about motherhood and friendship. It’s a documentary style that that explores my childhood being raised by a single mum in Toxteth, Liverpool.Jennifer:It’s incredible to see the works being recognised again after 40 years. It genuinely feels like a few moments ago we were setting up the works in the ICA’s corridor.Ingrid:I’m hoping the exhibition annoys a lot of people in the art world. When they had an opportunity to engage with these artists, they didn’t take it. So it’s like: “See what you missed out on, mate.”Connecting Thin Black Lines 1985-2025is at the ICA, London, until 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsExhibitionsArtPaintingICABlack British cultureBritish identity and societyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And how will it stay sparkly?Translucent bridge to form centrepiece of national memorial to Elizabeth IIOliver WainwrightTue 24 Jun 2025 10.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 13.52 EDTShareIs a £46m glass tiara the right way to remember the UK’s late queen? The Elizabeth II memorial selection committee certainly think so, in their choice of a glitzy glass bridge designed byNorman Fosterfor her permanent memorial in St James’s Park, announced on Tuesday.As architects go, the 90-year-old Foster is perhaps the closest we have to a national treasure, so he might seem like a fitting choice – an establishment figure and safe pair of hands, who knew the queen personally. It could be an apt final project for the architect lord, although he shows no signs of slowing down.Foster might have done well to take a closer look at the history of the tiara in questionHis personal connection might have clinched the deal. Lord Foster of Thames Bank, whoquit his seatin the House of Lords in 2010 in order to retain his non-dom tax status, says he met the queen on both formal and informal occasions, and it was this dual acquaintance that informed his design.“She was wonderfully formal when the occasion demanded,” he recalls, “and warmly informal when she engaged with people and individuals.” His project attempts to “combine the formal and the informal”, riffing off a similar duality found in the landscape design of St James’s Park, laid out by John Nash in the 1820s.In reaching for a suitably regal metaphor to embody the late monarch, Foster landed on her wedding tiara. He has accordingly conjured an ethereal vision of a bridge with a cast glass balustrade, shimmering above the lake. This translucent glass crossing, he says, will be “symbolic of Her Majesty as a unifying force, bringing together nations, countries, the Commonwealth, charities and the armed forces”.View image in fullscreenGlass act … how the bridge will look.Photograph: Foster + Partners/PASo far, the images give off the vibes of a temporary Swarovski-sponsored installation, and it’s hard to imagine how the Royal Parks’ maintenance team will keep it looking quite so sparkly. The vision recalls Foster’s “blade of light” idea for the Millennium Bridge, which ended up being a good deal more chunky (and wobbly) than the dashing sketch promised.Foster might have done well to take a closer look at the history of the tiara in question. It was originally designed in 1919 for Queen Mary, Elizabeth’s grandmother, a great lover of jewels, who had the headpiece made in the fashionableRussian kokoshnikstyle, using diamonds from an old necklace gifted to her by her grandmother-in-law, Queen Victoria. It was a model of recycling, which has been passed down the generations ever since – used by the Queen Mother, Elizabeth, Princess Anne, and most recently Princess Beatrice.Not so Foster’s bridge. His project, which also includes a series of gardens, will see a perfectly good crossing needlessly destroyed. The existingBlue Bridgewas built in 1957, to the designs of the Ministry of Works’ youngest ever chief architect, Eric Bedford, who went on to design the startlingly futuristic Post Office Tower (now BT Tower) in Fitzrovia. As it happens, Bedford also played a key role in Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, designing a series of interlocking steel arches on the Mall, topped with lions and adorned with metalwork crowns and fan motifs, that were illuminated by night.In our age of rapid global heating, when the carbon emissions of construction are closely counted by the kilo and architects strive to reuse as much existing fabric as possible, this wasteful act of demolition seems like a strange way to memorialise anyone. In selecting blocks of solid cast glass for his new bridge, Foster has chosen one of the most carbon-intensive materials available, given the furnaces must be heated to over 1,000C. Memorialising more than just the queen, this costly tiara will be an apt bookend to an age of excessive consumption.Explore more on these topicsNorman FosterArchitectureHeritageLondonQueen Elizabeth IIParks and green spacesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If he hadn’t shot himself in a cornfield at the age of 37, and had made it to his 60s, he could have witnessed all that end in the 1914-18 war. If he’d lived to 80, he would have read in his newspaper, at an Arles cafe table, of Adolf Hitler becoming German chancellor, and in 1945, at 92, watched newsreel footage of the emaciated survivors of Belsen.Odd thoughts, but they are stoked by the Royal Academy’s strange and startling exhibition. This is an intimate encounter between the great living German history painter, to mark his 80th year, and his hero Van Gogh. It juxtaposes his responses to the latter, from teenage drawings to recent gold-spattered wheatfield scenes, with the Dutch artist’s works. The peculiar result is to make you see how the dreamer of sunflowers and starry nights might have painted the horrors of modern history, if he’d lived to see them.Kiefer was born in 1945, as the facts of the Holocaust started to emerge in Germany’s ruins. His art has been a long war against forgetting, fought with paintings, actions and installations. This exhibition includes his 7.5m wide 2019 canvas The Last Load, a European landscape under a black sky, emptied out by history, a gnarled waste land of stumps and stubble, including straw stuck into the masses of earthy paint. You just know what it’s about. Every ploughed furrow receding across the dead space looks like the rail tracks to Auschwitz.View image in fullscreenTwo cenotaphs for vanished feet … Vincent van Gogh, Shoes, 1886.Photograph: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation)Nearby is a pair of abandoned shoes: Van Gogh’s, in his 1886 painting Shoes. But in this context these battered, lifeworn boots – two cenotaphs for vanished feet – look like the many shoes, suitcases, glasses and other objects left by the murdered. Another Van Gogh painting here, Piles of French Novels, takes on the same memorial quality: a pile of books, a heap of forgotten stories.It is Van Gogh’s disturbing ability to step outside of himself and paint his shoes and books as if they were relics of a dead man that makes him appear, through Kiefer’s dark lens, a prophet of the Holocaust. It’s a convincing, if harrowing, image of him. At the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam earlier this year, a different version of this show refused to see anything macabre or morbid in Van Gogh’s art, and consequently made little sense. Here, Kiefer and Van Gogh blend together in a weird Romantic death dance – or, to use the title of a poem about the Holocaust by Paul Celan that has long obsessed Kiefer, a Death Fugue.So a vast canvas by Kiefer sends giant black crows hurtling towards you over waving wheat in a colossal restaging of Van Gogh’s last, or nearly last, suicide note of a painting, Wheatfield With Crows. In case you miss the deathliness of these winged messengers, Kiefer calls it Nevermore. Or as Celan wrote: “we dig a grave in the sky there is plenty of room”.There’s nothing subtle about Kiefer’s vision of Van Gogh. It’s as bold and sentimental as Don McLean’s Vincent. Fair enough. Van Gogh reaches out to us, our hearts go out to him. Kiefer portrays himself lying down, floored byweltschmerz, or world pain, in a field of giant sunflowers. They are black. He sees the gloom even in Van Gogh’s brightest theme, but amazingly, the curator finds a match for these blooms of death in Van Gogh’s 1887 painting Sunflowers Gone to Seed, a sad grey-brown study of dead, drying nature.View image in fullscreenInnocent nature … Vincent van Gogh, Snow-Covered Field with a Harrow (after Millet), 1890.Photograph: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation)Even Van Gogh’s 1890 Poppy Field looks here like a prophetic poem to the Flanders fallen – a sea of blood-red flowers under the uneasily placid sky. The hint of tragedy is really there, for this is another ruminatory landscape from Van Gogh’s final months.So the show spookily succeeds in making Van Gogh look like Kiefer. But Kiefer doesn’t come off so well when he tries to look like Van Gogh. The Dutch artist can be as bleak as he is here, yet he also paints ecstasy and (brief) hope in the Provence sunshine. Kiefer doesn’t have that joy in him – and when he tries to lighten up, he looks fake, splashing gold leaf over real corn stuck on to canvases enormous in scale but lacking intensity.Still, that too is a truth. Despite the intimations of modern disaster that this exhibition brings out, Van Gogh painted before 1914, before Auschwitz. He painted a more innocent nature. The snow enveloping the fields, in a wonderful wintry scene he painted in 1890, may look like ash if you squint enough, but it’s still just snow. Kiefer can’t see nature with the same fresh joy because no one can any more. His metallic attempts at golden ecstasy reflect our time, our sorrow.Kiefer/Van Gogh is atRoyal Academy, London, from 28 June until 26 October.Explore more on these topicsVincent van GoghAnselm KieferRoyal Academy of ArtsExhibitionsPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is this a sensible safeguard – or simple snobbery?Jonathan JonesTue 24 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 12.38 EDTShareIt’s that time of year again. As the crowds grow, historic Italian cities and museums become the setting for a You’ve Been Framed-style sequence of absurdist moments. Last year it wasa young woman embracing a (replica) Giambologna statuein the streets of Florence. This year the Uffizi gallery, guardian of Florentine art, has been defiled as a man posed for a photo in front of a portrait of Ferdinando de’ Medici. While imitating the hand-on-hip, baton-wielding pose of this scion of the soon-to-be-extinct Medici family,he slipped and put his hand through the canvas. This comes shortly after an incident in a Verona museum, wherea tourist sat on an artwork in the form of a crystal chair, also for a photo, and shattered it.View image in fullscreenA barbarian horde? … A tourist damages a painting at the Uffizi gallery, Florence, in images taken from an exclusive video by TG1.Photograph: Independent Photo Agency Srl/AlamyThe Uffizi’s director says it will now take action against the swarm of visitors “coming to museums to make memes or take selfies for social media … We will set very precise limits, preventing behaviour that is not compatible with the sense of our institutions and respect for cultural heritage.” But is it really fair to see everyone who takes a selfie with a painting, or shares their travels on social media, as part of a barbarian horde intent on destroying civilisation? If so, the battle is lost.Judging how other people experience art in museums is a dubious activity. Just because someone adopts a silly pose for a selfie does not mean they are an idiot the rest of the time – they might be an overexcited PhD student doing a thesis on the last days of the Medici. Hypothetically.Last year, I spent a long time in front of one of the Uffizi’s greatest treasures, The Birth of Venus by Botticelli, and the whole time people were taking selfies with it. They did so responsibly and politely: taking turns, not hogging. And none objected to my getting in the way so I could stare at Venus’s pearly skin or the waves that are spurts of sperm.1:10Palazzo Maffei releases CCTV footage of tourists breaking crystal-covered chair – videoAnd while I don’t do selfies, I snap away on my phone – I’ve got scores of Uffizi pics, and I was told off for taking photos last year in the church of Santo Spirito. To the custodian, I was a tourist idiot, never mind that most of my snaps were of architectural details of this Brunelleschi masterpiece.It would be pure snobbery to assume anyone is failing to appreciate art simply because their enjoyment includes, or is even dominated by, one of the most common ways 21st-century people structure all their experiences. There were plenty of old-style cultural tourists, in the 19th and 20th centuries, who trudged from one landmark to another clutching Baedeker guidebooks but not feeling very much about what they saw. Who’s to say today’s phone-clutching Botticelli fans don’t appreciate more? The history of tourism is a history of fads, absurdities and ignorance, yet it is also a culturally uplifting experience. One thing’s for sure: the guy who the Uffizi now hopes will be prosecuted won’t forget that portrait of Fernando de’ Medici in a hurry.As a child, I believed the replica of David outside the Palazzo Vecchio was the real thing. So what? Millions of people visit Italy. We see art in between pizzas and ice cream, misunderstand a lot of what we see, must look to locals like morons. But locals too can get confused by the sheer cultural overload – last year in Florence, a charming bar owner informed me that Michelangelo’s painting of God creating Adam was in the nearby Brancacci Chapel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I mean the Medici balls, or palle, their coat of arms that is all over Florence. In its shadow, generations of visitors come and go and the city adeptly changes to accommodate them, without ever losing its heart. Once every tourist ate Eggs Florentine, but now you would be laughed at for ordering it. Everything must change so that everything can stay the same. The occasional selfie disaster won’t spoil the incredible Italian art legacy. It’s just another twist in the grand tour, the most ridiculous and sublime experience many of us will ever have.Explore more on these topicsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sprints are delighted to be riding the wave of the “Irish renaissance”, as the Dublin band’s frontwoman Karla Chubb wryly refers to it. “We’re definitely in a good time for being Irish internationally,” nods drummer Jack Callan, before swiftly puncturing this optimistic sentiment. “I’m just waiting for it all to crash and burn now, like someone’s going to ruin it.” Chubb zeroes in on the worst-case scenario: “Paul Mescal’s going to do something terrible!”Mercifully, at the time of writing at least, Mescal remains secure in his position as the internet’s most-wanted boyfriend – not that Sprints need to cling to their countryman’s coattails. Since forming in 2019, the band – which also features Sam McCann on bass and guitarist Zac Stephenson – have risen through rock’s ranks by gigging relentlessly with their cathartically boisterous, brutally candid post-punk. In 2023 they supported Suede on tour, finding a champion in Brett Anderson, who tended to linger side of stage during their sets. (McCann would often turn to suddenly see “a menacing black silhouette” standing there. “Like Slenderman,” says Callan.) The following year, their blistering, brooding, hook-riddled debut album, Letter to Self – which doubled as an unflinching, aphorism-strewn account of Chubb’s mental health and ADHD struggles – reached the UK Top 20. In January it was shortlisted for an RTÉ Choice music prize, Ireland’s biggest music award.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David WillisNow, ahead of their most high-profile Glastonbury slot yet, the band are preparing to step things up again. Letter to Self’s forthcoming sequel, All That Is Over, leans harder into certain existing influences – Bauhaus, PJ Harvey – to arrive at a sound Chubb is semi-jokingly calling “gothic cowboy”, while expanding into less autobiographical territory by drawing on novels (Prophet Song,The Bee Sting, the works ofOctavia Butler) and video games (Fallout). Not quite “end of the world” stuff, explains Chubb over coffee with her bandmates in the bar of their London hotel on a sunny June day. “But otherworldly. A lot of it is escapism – even though we’re escaping from one dystopian world to another.”The album was shaped by a contradiction: things really began to take off for Sprints just as the news cycle started to get significantly darker. “We’ve built this beautiful, liberal, queer, creative bubble, and would be on tour playing these amazing shows … then you’d pick up your phone and be like, ‘What the fuck is happening?’ Like in Gaza, or the forest fires in LA. We’re doing the most artistically true and honest thing, and it’s set against this backdrop of the world feeling like it’s gonna end at any moment.”Music helps Chubb make sense of it all, she says. That is what the band’s latest single, Descartes, is about, with its core lyric – “I speak so therefore I understand” – riffing on the philosopher’s first principle to capture the clarity and catharsis provided by songwriting. The track also reiterates the band’s commitment to using their voice. Like many Irish acts – including Fontaines DC (whom they are due to support on tour this summer) and Kneecap – Sprints are politically outspoken. Chubb feels she bears the brunt of the pushback from this, and much more besides. Over the last year, she has been confronted with “articles about my weight” alongside “open letters from idiot men criticising my political stance – calling me arrogant because I had the audacity to use my platform on stage to speak about Palestine”.Some of Chubb’s anecdotes about the mansplaining she has endured are amusingly ludicrous – such as the one about the punter at a recent Dublin show who deigned to give her advice about the band’s guitar parts before telling her his son “could have done a better job”. In the early days of Sprints, Chubb felt pressure to perform solos “to prove that I could play the guitar, because people were automatically going to assume that I didn’t.” Today, she cares far less about the opinions of random blokes: “With this album, I don’t really give a fuck.”Yet other instances of misogyny are harder to shake off. Last year, Chubbmade headlineswhen she spoke about being groped by a gig-goer while on stage in Belfast (it happened during a Munich show too). At first, she wasn’t even shocked, but then “I started to talk about it and the guys were like, ‘What the fuck?’ So I thought, ‘OK, this is something I’m allowed to be upset by.’ When I decided to speak publicly about it, so many artists reached out and were like, ‘the same thing happened to me, it’s disgraceful.’”We could spend hours raking over the sexism Chubb has experienced as a frontwoman, but rather than cowed or beleaguered, she and her bandmates seem overall quietly euphoric. Rock band economics are precarious – “there are months when we don’t know how much, if any, money we’re going to get in,” says Chubb – and the lifestyle can be tough: their original guitarist Colm O’Reilly left last year because he wanted to settle down. “Touring life is not for everyone – if you don’t like it, it’s hell,” says McCann.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Film photos by Maclay HeriotTue 24 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 02.02 EDTShare‘It’s always good to make yourself feel small,” says Stu Mackenzie. We’re sitting behind the stage of the Ancient theatre in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, after the second night of his bandKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s three shows there. The marble-hewn amphitheatre was built between 98-117AD. We’re flanked by columns bearing ancient Greek inscriptions from back when this place was called Philippopolis; the precipitous drop behind us reveals the east side of Europe’s longest continually inhabited city, the glowing cross of the Cathedral of St Louis and the shadow of the hills in the distance.In front of the stage where the Australian experimental rock band have just spent two hours wilding out is an arena where man and beast used to do battle in front of a far more bloodthirsty crowd than the one that just drank the venue dry of beer. It’s hard not to feel like a speck here, awesomely adrift in all of human history.View image in fullscreenThe band at Lukiškiu prison, Vilnius, LithuaniaPlovdiv marks the end of Gizz’s European residency tour, which has seen the band post up in five different cities for three-night runs in historic or otherwise curious venues: the panopticon Lukiškės prison in Vilnius, which closed in 2019 and is now a venue; Lycabettus hill theatre in Athens. After similarly successful residencies at natural amphitheatre-type venues in the US, the band wanted to make sure their European fans didn’t get left out.“We’re like tourists on this trip as well,” says Mackenzie, still in his sweat-dappled baby pink stage boilersuit. “The contrast between a regular bus tour, where we’re in a different city every night, is pretty stark. Usually you wake up after a long drive, you actually can’t remember where you are and it’s about orienting yourself – finding a coffee or a green space and just surviving. But on a tour like this, you actually have a moment to soak it up and breathe, which is rare. We’re having such a ball – spending time cruising around, eating, seeing the cities, just hanging out with each other – the good stuff.”View image in fullscreenBoarding from Lisbon to BarcelonaView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAmbrose Kenny Smith on a day off in Hydra, Greece (left), and in Lisbon, PortugalIf anyone knows the price of hard-touring, it’s Gizz, who started as a party band in Melbourne in 2010 – hence the un-serious name, which stuck – and have gigged their way to becoming their generation’s Grateful Dead or Phish, bolstering their psych-rock with metal, krautrock, microtonal experiments and more. They’ve headlined Green Man and End of the Road, and this month saw the release of their27thalbum, Phantom Island, where country choogle meets Philly-inspired soul thanks to their first foray into orchestral arrangements. It’s a beautiful if worried record, its lyrical protagonists often observing the world from the cockpit of a plane and wondering what the purpose of it all is.View image in fullscreenPerforming at Lycabettus theatre, Athens, GreeceThe existential vibe feels right at home in these perspective-realigning venues, built on thousands of years of human existence. “A lot of the lyrics we’ve written together have stemmed from spending a lot of time away from home, from family, from kids,” says Mackenzie, who welcomed his third baby just before tour started, “and trying to figure out how we make sense of all of that, and the world. It has been an existential few records,” he agrees.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Mickey Cavs, Stu Mackenzie, Joey Walker, Ambrose Kenny Smith, Lucas Harwood and Cook Craig backstage at the Ancient theatre, Plovdiv, BulgariaGizz run a staunchly DIY enterprise. They self-release their albums, which they still record in the same small studio in Melbourne. They’ve never worked with a producer. Their friend Jason Galea does all their artwork and Maclay Heriot takes their photos. They release free bootlegs of every live show – the Barcelona residency is already up on Spotify by the time they hit Plovdiv – and broadcast a high-quality livestream of each night on YouTube that they’ve taken painstaking care to perfect.To outsiders, they’re perhaps best known for their prolificacy – in 2017 alone, they released five albums. Their output can be seen as intimidating, or perceived as some sort of novelty factor. But for Mackenzie, it seems more about the sense that every creative whim is worth honouring, and every bit of life really is worth figuring out creatively, indicative of a tendency towards archivism.View image in fullscreenA member of the Weirdo Swarm at Coliseu dos Recreios, Lisbon“You’ve nailed a big part of the motivation for it,” he says. “We as a group have a big appetite for risk. We’ve been good at just being in it together, and if this fails or people don’t like it, it’s fine. We’re all here together because we actually are all best friends, we’re really grateful to be here and I don’t think anyone wants to do anything else.”The ambition isn’t to play the Royal Albert Hall, as they are this November; that’s just a nicely crazy surprise. “It does keep the motors greased and it keeps us on the horse,” says Mackenzie. “But it’s definitely not the goal. We’ve been pretty careful to honour that. As things become more seductive, we’ve tried to keep it feeling very small. There might be a few more people around, but I think we’ve been very protective of our little, tiny, miniature universe.”But in another sense, Gizz is a beautifully open-source universe. They give fans – the Weirdo Swarm – their blessing to make bootleg merch and even bootleg records of their live recordings (they only ask that they send them a “fair” amount of pressings in exchange). Where much pop fandom constitutes little more than idol worship, the Swarm are a generative and self-sustaining community: on their fansite, they’ve put together a detailed guide to each city on the EU tour, including information about attitudes to LGBTQ+ people and drugs (both very censorious in Bulgaria). “I do feel really proud of that,” says Mackenzie.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Stu Mackenzie and Joey Walker playing ‘Nathan’ at Lukiškiu prisonIn Plovdiv, a group of local fans thrilled that Gizz have finally come to their country have organised daytime meet-ups at a bar before the first and last shows, where stickers and friendship bracelets are traded and bespoke posters are sold, as well as nightly afterparty gigs at a local bar. Once again, not a drop of beer remains at any event.The atmosphere is radiantly sincere and celebratory. We meet fans from Denver who are almost always on acid; a kid from Belgrade who posts in the rapidly renewing Gizz sub-Reddit that he loves Plovdiv so much he wants to move there, and includes the details of his outfit so that anyone can come up and say hi, which we do and get a huge hug. We hear about the flight from the last date in Athens to the Bulgarian capital Sofia, which was filled with about 80 Gizz heads and the band themselves.View image in fullscreenA closeup of NathanTara from San Diego has seen the band umpteen times and used to be a Phish fan; the difference in the oft-compared “jam bands”, she says, is that Phish wig out into abstraction – catnip for casual listeners off their nut on drugs – while Gizz splice together intricate medleys of their songs, which rewards close focus from fans literate in their vast catalogue. One group of fans have made Gizz-themed football shirts in the Bulgarian team colours; the back of one is emblazoned with “Nathan”, the name of the modular synth rack that looks like an old-fashioned telephone switchboard that the band have been consistently building and experimenting with on tour. “Every city we go to, they’re like, ‘Is there a modular synth place here?’” says Heriot, their photographer: the band – and particularly musician Joey Walker – add new bits to it like tourists collecting fridge magnets.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Joey Walker and Stu Mackenzie building Nathan in LisbonOn day two, an excellent free socialist architecture walking tour of the city that apparently usually draws five people attracts a crowd of 43 – largely Gizz heads – to the delight of the tour guide. Before the show, an American guy called Michael is going around the venue asking people what their first ever gig was, though it’s hard to imagine anyone having a better story than his: after his dad picked up some German hitchhikers who stayed for a month, to his mother’s chagrin, their parting apology was to take him to see Fleetwood Mac on the Rumours tour.During the performances, Heriot is underneath Nathan, shooting upwards through Mackenzie’s legs, putting his battered Leica M6 – originally a war camera – to good use. Drugs may be illegal but weed, acid and MDMA are apparently flowing freely. And after a heavy rainshower before the show, fans everywhere (me included) are stacking it down the steep, slippery marble steps, many of which have no hand rails, sending drinks flying. (The venue’s health and safety doesn’t seem to have moved on since ancient times.) On the last night, we overhear an Australian man giving a local tips on how to know when the acid is kicking in.As the final show of the run draws to a close, Walker says from the stage: “Thanks to our majestic crew for facilitating our bizarre-as-fuck behaviour.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ambrose Kenny Smith, Cook Craig, Lucas Harwood, Mickey Cavs, Joey Walker and Stu Mackenzie at Lukiškiu prisonPart of that is rewarding the fans with a totally different setlist on each night of a single residency, not repeating any songs in a single city. “It’s not really sent over until half an hour before the show,” says Heriot, who has known the band for 10 years, has carte blanche to document their existence and also got their blessing to learn how to shoot on 16mm film for a forthcoming documentary. “They all know what to do, but it leaves that opportunity to step it up. You can see there’s a chemistry there where they don’t even have to talk, they’ve played with each other for so long and for so many hours. It’s super interesting to watch, and what makes it exciting to document and photograph.”He talks about the classic “hero photograph” of a musician, where they’re caught mid-jump or in a triumphant pose. “The photo looks incredible – then you see them doing it again the next night. It happens every night in the same spot, at the same time.” Gizz’s constant deviation from any script means “you really have to respond to the moment, to be as tuned in as possible to what’s happening.” To aid that, Heriot wears an in-ear with the front-of-house mix. “It means I can really hear what’s happening on stage and chase their energy.”Gizz entered proggy territory around 2016’s Nonagon Infinity, leading to a tightly structured live show that never stopped for breath. “We got to the end of the rainbow on that one,” says Mackenzie. “For us, at least, it got boring. And that’s when the setlist started to unravel, throwing in older songs. We had this back catalogue we barely ever played live – we should dig into this. We really noticed around that time that the audience slowly started to change in a nice way, and it became apparent that nobody cares if you make a wrong note.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPerforming at Lukiškiu prisonKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard: Flight b741 review | Album of the weekRead moreIt dovetailed with the 34-year-old’s growing interest in connecting with people rather than shocking them. “People are interested in the humanity of that, and that’s quite a liberating feeling. It’s also something we still wrestle with on the daily – you get up there and you might as well be naked. It’s pretty intense, like – shit, I can’t remember this song we haven’t played in two years, we didn’t soundcheck it. But you work your way through it together, it forces you to look at each other and make music with each other.”Previously, he said, he felt like a performer; now he feels like a musician. Gizz also don’t rehearse. “You have no choice but to figure it out as you go, you listen and you’re playing on the fly, creating in real time,” says Mackenzie. “It’s the best feeling. We’ve leaned into that more and more. This residency thing, part of the format is that we get to play seven hours or something of all different music – that’s like a dream to us.”On the opening, title track of Phantom Island, one of Gizz’s pilots has landed on a mysterious desert island, experiencing “a symphony of delusion as my thoughts finally realise their purpose”. Amid loneliness and doubt, conspiracy and suspicion blooms. It feels like the kind of typically characterful reflection on modern life that Gizz have been writing in recent years.In a grasping industry and an increasingly siloed modern life, their existence feels like an antidote to this sort of isolation: generous, communal, devoid of cynicism and pure of motivation. Their world is seductive: small egos, huge hearts, full of purpose. Old places can make you feel small, says Mackenzie, and so can big crowds, in the best possible way. “I know some people can get anxious in them, but I think it’s important. There’s something in the experience of going to a concert that is innately human, being around other people.”Phantom Island is out now on p(doom).King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard tour the US from 28 July, the UK and Europe from 31 October and Australia from 2 December.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayKing Gizzard and the Lizard WizardPop and rockIndiePsychedeliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For 50 years, one small band of activists have been finding creative alternative uses for great buildings their owners couldn’t seeOliver WainwrightTue 24 Jun 2025 09.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 12.09 EDTShareIt’s hard to imagine London without the mighty riverside citadels of Tate Modern and Battersea power station, or bereft of the ornate Victorian market halls of Smithfield and Billingsgate. It is equally difficult to picture Yorkshire without its majestic sandstone mills, Grimsbywithout its fishing docks, or parts of Liverpoolwithout their streets of terrace houses. Yet all these things could have victims of the wrecking ball, if it weren’t for one small band of plucky activists.You may not have heard ofSave Britain’s Heritage, or SAVE as it likes to style itself, suggesting the urgency of the matter at hand. But the tiny charity, which celebrates its50th birthday this month, has had more influence than any other group in campaigning for the imaginative reuse of buildings at risk, most of which had no legal protections whatsoever from being bulldozed.“We felt that a much more punchy approach to endangered buildings was really needed,” saysMarcus Binney, who founded Save in 1975, with an agile network of likeminded journalists, historians, architects and planners. “There was too much, ‘Oh, we’ll write to the minister, and have a word with the chairman of the county council.’ The usual channels were not working. We realised that the real battleground was the media.”They were spurred by the surprise success of a 1974 exhibition at the V&A,The Destruction of the Country House, co-curated by Binney, which conveyed the shocking scale of demolition across the country with graphic power. The “Hall of Destruction”, replete with toppling classical columns, displayed more than 1,000 country houses that had been lost in the preceding century, a number that rose to 1,600 by the time the exhibition closed. The scale of the issue struck a chord: more than 1.5m signatures of support were gathered to keep these buildings standing.View image in fullscreenElegant innards … Smithfield market is being transformed into the London Museum, set to open in 2026What set Save apart from other heritage groups at the time was its proactive, propositional approach and energetic, youthful zeal. They had no qualms about calling out the villains, and would admonish greedy developers and lazy local authorities with ferocious glee. Their press releases and campaign pamphlets were a breath of fresh air, emblazoned with bold graphics, punchy headlines and evocative texts written with fierce authority – with a critical media-savviness brought by trustees includingSimon JenkinsandDan Cruickshank. Most crucially of all, theirs was not a call to keep the world in aspic, but to find creative alternative uses for buildings that their owners couldn’t see. “The argument for demolition was always that a building had ‘reached the end of its useful life,’” says Binney. “But the question is: ‘Useful for whom?’”When the Central Electricity Generating Board planned to demolish its (then unlisted) Bankside power station in Southwark and replace it with offices, Save conjured a proposal in 1979, in a moment of wildly improbable blue-sky thinking, to turn it into an art gallery instead. A decade later, Tate announced that Sir Giles Gilbert Scott’s great brick colossus would become the home of its modern art collection. It is now one of the most visited museums in the world. Twenty years on, when a developer wanted to scoop out the elegant innards of Smithfield market and replace them witha bloated office block and shops, Save commissioned an alternative vision, fought two crowdfunded public inquiries, and won.The London Museumis set to open there next year, breathing fresh new life into the atmospheric warren of cast-iron domes and brick vaults, that would otherwise be dust.View image in fullscreenGraphic power … Hall of Destruction at The Destruction of the Country House, a 1974 exhibition at the V&A, LondonIt is hard to appreciate now, but Save’s early activities fundamentally transformed the perception of heritage, and expanded the scope of what was deemed worth keeping. The conservation movement tended to focus on churches, country houses and town halls, but Save was the first to suggest that industrial buildings were equally worthy of attention. Its 1979 exhibition and publication,Satanic Mills, highlighted the threatened textile factories of the Pennines, and led to campaigns to protect places such as Salts Mill in Saltaire – now aUnesco world heritage site– and Lister Mills in Manningham.“The building itself is an icon for Bradford,” says Mollie, who now lives in a flat in Lister Mills, once the largest silk mill in the world, which was transformed by architectDavid Morley for Urban Splash in 2006. “When it was becoming derelict it gave the community a real down feeling – you felt everything was bad and going wrong. When it was done up it really raised people’s hearts.”Save has long argued that communities’ emotional attachment to buildings is just as powerful an argument for their retention as their place in the architectural canon. But that’s not a factor that planners can consider. “The planning system is heavily focused on historic fabric and architectural significance,” says Henrietta Billings, Save’s current director. “But what about emotional attachment and embodied memory? What about the feelings of loss when these buildings are ripped out of communities, and what about the unlisted buildings that people really care about?”The development industry may not speak the language of loss, but it certainly understands the “value uplift” that a “heritage asset” can bring. At Capital and Centric’s recent development of aManchester textile mill, Crusader Works, the sales team received four times as many inquiries for flats in the 19th-century mill buildings than in the new-build blocks. And they sold them for 10% more, inviting buyers into a fantasy of “exposed beams and red brick dreams”. Another office developer says it favours renovating postwar blocks in order to attract the gen Z workforce, who prefer working in “distinctive, characterful buildings” with low carbon credentials over generic “grade A” glass boxes.View image in fullscreenBradford icon … Lister Mills in Manningham.Photograph: David Morley ArchitectsAlongside financial value, Save is increasingly raising the environmental benefits of keeping buildings – something which can be more precisely measured than emotions, and fought over at public inquiries with the help of expert witnesses. The Oxford Street branch of Marks & Spencer recently became a lighting rod for thisnew frontier of the heritage debate, when the carbon emissions of demolishing the 1920s department store and replacing it with a 10-storey behemoth were raised as one of the key reasons for keeping it. The M&S plans, Save argued, with the help ofcarbon expert Simon Sturgis, would release 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the equivalent of almost 20,000 flights from London to Sydney.“It was a watershed,” says Billings, “aligning heritage and sustainability at the heart of a public inquiry for the first time. Although we lost the battle, we were able to show how, by avoiding demolition, you are notchucking out all the embodied carbonin the existing building, as well as not expending more carbon on producing all the steel, glass and concrete for a brand new building.”Save may have lost the case but the inquiry highlighted its next crucial battleground. The then secretary of state Michael Gove’s decision to quash M&S’s permission to demolish the building was ultimately overturned, because he had misinterpreted the national planning policy framework (NPPF). He suggested that there was a “strong presumption in favour of reusing buildings” in the rules – which there is not. At present, the NPPF merely tries to “encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings”. There is a legal ocean of difference between a “strong presumption” and a mere “encouragement”, as M&S’sbarrister successfully pointed out. The devil is in the semantic detail, and it is exactly that detail that Save is now campaigning to see changed.View image in fullscreenStreet life … Liverpool’s Welsh Streets“The current government’s rhetoric is all about ‘build, build, build’ and ‘bulldozing the planning system’,” says Billings. “But planning is not the obstacle. It just needs to be properly funded and tightened up. There are plenty of planning applications that we know local councillors and planners are uncomfortable with, but they are often forced to approve them because of the costs involved in defending refusals.”Entirely funded by donations, Save’s team of six is currently juggling numerous campaigns, from trying toclose legal loopholesin Scotland’s heritage protection rules, to saving aGeorgian seaside hotel on the edge of Snowdonia, to contesting several controversial plans tobutcher Liverpool Street station. As it celebrates five decades of such David and Goliath battles, against a bleak backdrop of rapid global heating, missed emissions targets and a government intent on building at any cost, the work of this gutsy little group is more critical than ever.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHeritageTate ModernfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This sort of tension, the push-pull between genuine vulnerability and an exploration of aesthetics, has always been there in her music, and her wonderfully ambitious first stadium tour runs on it. Its theatrical staging and big ideas are all the more remarkable thanks to some very human moments of doubt.Opening with Stars Fell on Alabama, one of several new songs foreshadowing a country record that might be around the corner, Del Rey’s voice is barely there, with its final notes followed by a dash to the wings to kiss her husband. But she stays on the rails. During Chemtrails Over the Country Club and Ultraviolence, she falls to the floor in Busby Berkeley-esque arrangements alongside her dancers, her vocals now steely as power chords and pulsing red lights ratchet up the drama.View image in fullscreenBravura … Lana Del Rey at Cardiff Principality Stadium.Photograph: Joe Okpako   /Projoe photographyAt the heart of the concert is a remarkable set piece following Quiet in the South. The house starts to burn, its air of Douglas Sirk melodrama and stultifying domesticity tumbling into Hitchcockian mania. A section of Bernard Herrmann’s Vertigo score plays and Del Rey answers it with an off-stage recitation from Allen Ginsberg’s Howl, which becomes the intro to Young and Beautiful. It’s bravura stuff, capped by her gradual rise from a secondary stage as the track ends, now clad in a cocktail dress. The crowd comes unglued.Famously, though, the problem with big swings are the misses. There are a few here, notably a hologram Lana sitting in a window while snippets of Norman Fucking Rockwell and Arcadia ring from the speakers. Aside from wasting two killer songs, it creates an unwanted break in the dialogue she maintains between artist and audience elsewhere – there aren’t many stadium spectacles driven by the gut-level understanding found in Del Rey’s plea to the room during a mesmerising Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd: “Don’t forget me.” Not a chance.Touring the UK and Irelanduntil 4 July 2025Explore more on these topicsLana Del ReyPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Of those who’ve survived, nobody seems happy about the results of the restructuring.”However, the chair of the trustees, Gerard Lemos, said in an official statement to staff: “I am sorry to say that Nick has requested to step down from his role as chief executive for personal reasons relating to family health. The Board has agreed to his request, which will take place with immediate effect. The Board would like to thank Nick for everything he has done.”He added: “Since February 2024, Nick has led EnglishHeritagethrough a challenging time, during which he has overseen a major change programme aimed at delivering financial sustainability.”English Heritage cares for more than 400 historic monuments, buildings and sites. As the charity no longer receives a government grant, it relies on membership, tickets and sales in its shops and cafes. Before the redundancies, it had 2,535 employees and about 5,000 volunteers.Its attempts to restructure itself to cut costs descended into chaos earlier this year. Everything was meant to have been in place by April, yet staff were still unclear about the plans weeks later, while hearing that several consultants had been taken on – no doubt on hefty fees, they assumed.One insider spoke in April of their dismay over when or how they would be selected for vacancies: “People who were the sole candidate in selection pools have been forced to have interviews – and then told they don’t have the job without any proper reason being given. A case study of how not to do a reorganisation.”On Tuesday, they spoke of the way in which people had been made redundant: “There’s lingering bitter resentments, both from the people who’ve left and the people who survived.”In April, English Heritage defended the cuts, saying: “The aim of these proposals is to ensure that English Heritage is financially resilient and can fulfil our charitable purposes. We’re committed to working with our employees and our trade unions to find ways to avoid and reduce redundancies where we can.”Some staff also felt that Merriman seemed to have moved the organisation away from its core role. One insider said: “That responsibility is looking after pre-modern monuments. But he never seemed to be especially interested in that.”Another source said: “There’s been a lot of gossip about how much of this was driven by Nick Merriman and how much came from the trustees.”Another added: “Everyone thinks he’s been pushed possibly by the trustees. Apparently they lost faith a while ago.”The trustees have asked Geoff Parkin to serve as the interim chief executive. He has worked with English Heritage, on a pro bono basis over the last year, “to craft a new commercial strategy, alongside acting as non-executive chair of two private equity backed travel businesses”, Lord Lemos noted.Explore more on these topicsEnglish HeritageEnglandHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

There will also be a “family of gardens” and meandering paths.View image in fullscreenThe national memorial in St James’s Park will include gardens and meandering paths.Photograph: Foster + Partners/PAThe bridge, with its cast-glass balustrades, will replace the park’s blue bridge near Buckingham Palace.

The headpiece was of great sentimental value to the queen.Foster said: “Her majesty loved history and tradition, so this is reflected in the inspiration of the original design of St James’s Park by Sir John Nash.“Some of his principles have survived, while others have been lost and will be restored, creating a family of gardens joined by gently meandering paths.“I knew the queen on formal occasions but also enjoyed her informality when attending events as a member of the Order of Merit.View image in fullscreenA mockup of the glass bridge.

Winston Churchill is said to have told his cabinet to read it in order to comprehend the Nazi threat.The Jewish dealer who bought art hated by the Nazis – and created one of the greatest collections ever seenRead moreHaffner, who changed his name in the UK from Raimund Pretzel in order to protect family still living in Germany, went on to work as a journalist in London for the Observer. He was recognised as one of the commanding analysts of nazism and what brought Hitler to power, returning to Berlin for the Observer in 1954, and later becoming a prominent columnist for the news magazine Stern.His son, Oliver Pretzel, 86, said his family had deliberated for years over whether to release Parting after Haffner’s deathin Berlin aged 91in 1999. They had been concerned, he said, that the work, a love story, might have seemed too slight, and overshadowed their father’s towering reputation as a heavyweight commentator.“My sister didn’t think the novel was very good,” Pretzel, a professor of mathematics based in London, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung. “I initially shared this view somewhat. But when I re-read it and since I set about translating it into English, I suddenly realised how ingeniously constructed it is.”Happily, the critics seem to agree. In Germany they have heaped praise on the 181-page work, calling it “a literary windfall”, an “incredibly fast-paced, light, and lively text”, and “a beautiful book of youthful sparkle and great emotional impact”.View image in fullscreenHaffner with Gertrude Joseph, on whom the main female character in the novel is based.Photograph: SuppliedSet on the last day of a two-week sojourn in Paris by the protagonist and his love interest, Teddy, before he has to return to a Berlin overcome by a growing sense of fear and political uncertainty, the novel was “shockingly lucid”, Marie Schmidt wrote in the Süddeutsche.The novel reflected the same “keen historical awareness that astonished and fascinated the world” in Haffner’s other posthumous work, History of a German, she added. That book was written in 1939 but only published for the first time in German in 2000, and in English, under the title Defying Hitler, in 2002. It was praised for its clear-sighted scrutiny and credited with extinguishing the repeated assertions of Haffner’s contemporaries that they had not known about Nazi crimes.Jekyll and Hyde was first published in Germany in 1996 under the title:1939 – Deutschland voninnen betrachtet(Germany observed from within). Both books also topped the German bestseller lists when they were published.Haffner was 24 when he wrote Parting in just a few weeks in October and November 1932, just months before the Nazis came to power. His attempts to get it published failed.Its narrator, Raimund, is an apprentice lawyer who smokes Gitanes Rouge and reads Aldous Huxley. In Paris in the spring of 1931 he meets Teddy, who has left Berlin, describing it as a time in which “crisis had not yet been invented”.Teddy is thought to have been based on Gertrude Joseph, a Jewish woman from Vienna with whom Haffner had been in love. He described in his autobiographical book History of a German how she had returned to Nazi Berlin from Paris for the last time in the summer of 1933, bringing with her “an air that one could breathe, and which one breathed in greedily”. Raimund in the novel describes the growing foreboding of having to “leave for a cold Berlin”.Haffner and Joseph, who ended up in Sweden, kept in touch until the end of their days. Twenty letters from him to her were found in her possession on her death.In an epilogue to the novel, the literary critic Volker Weidermann says the family’s fears about its publication were unfounded.“It [Parting] completes the historical picture that Haffner has presented to us in his … historical writings because it describes the root cause of the grief on which his later books lean, of everything of a good Germany that was lost – cosmopolitanism, tolerance, and humanity. Haffner himself repeatedly emphasised that history unfolds in private micro stories that, together, make up greater world history. In Parting he has set out this core idea.”An English-language edition of Parting, translated by Oliver Pretzel, is expected to be published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeSecond world warAdolf HitlerNazismPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

This catch-up with passengers makes for a fun hour of unintentional comedyLucy ManganTue 24 Jun 2025 09.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 14.58 EDTShareWith the latest instalments of the documentary anthology series Trainwreck, Netflix appears to be trying to grant us a brief summer pause from its usual run of true crime horror. Previous episodes included the Woodstock 99 riots and Astroworld festival crowd crush, in which 10 people died, including a nine-year-old child. Now, it has pivoted in tone.Last week it gave us Mayor of Mayhem, the tale of Rob “I am not a crack addict” Ford, the crack-addicted mayor of Toronto and his very un-Canadian way of doing municipal business. In coming weeks, there will be accounts ofthe balloon boy’s story, a private investigation agency run by soccer moms, and “the greatest shitpost ever made”. Whether this tonal change comes as a relief from having your hopes for humanity further ground down, or feels as psychologically jarring (should such disparate subjects as child death and municipal confusion be yoked together in the same anthology series?), will vary.Meanwhile, here is Poop Cruise, which tells the 2013 story of theTriumph cruise ship, whose engine room caught firehalfway across the Gulf of Mexico. The ship’s power was cut off, stranding more than 4,200 passengers and staff for five long, hot and increasingly fetid days, after the toilet flushes malfunctioned.The story is told partly through archive news footage, of which there is plenty, because as one reporter puts it: “Sometimes there are those scenarios that come along and just grab everyone’s attention.” A 13-storey, 272m-long cruise ship – “a skyscraper on its side” – filling with shit is one of them. It is joined by eye- and olfactory-witness testimonies from the likes of Larry and his daughter Rebekah, there to escape the stresses of her parents’ recent divorce; Devin, on board with his fiancee and his in-laws-to-be; cruise director Jan; bartender Hannah; chef Abhi; and, most gloriously, Ashley, a bride, and Kalin and Jayme, her two bachelorettes. None of them appear to have come to terms with the experience one jot in the intervening 12 years.People had to poo in bags, you see. Jan had to get on the public address system and explain to thousands of disbelieving passengers that “number ones” could be done in the shower but “number twos” must be done in the red biohazard bags being distributed, then placed in corridors for collection by unnamed staff, none of whom chose to appear in this documentary. Ashley starts necking Imodium; Devin promises himself he will not crap in a bag while on a cruise with his future father-in-law; Abhi, the chef, notes that the unworking loos filled with poos layered with toilet paper look “like a lasagne”.Every guest is appalled and fantastically humourless about the experience, even at this distance. You cannot help but wonder at cultural divides and how differently the British might have approached – or at least recalled – such events, at least in the early days. For us, surely, it would be a story for the ages. You could dine out on it for ever, so to speak. But, Ashley, Kalin (“This can’t be real!”) and Jayme (“No way. Not happening”) seem absolutely traumatised, haunted still by the memory. It’s fascinating.To be fair, when we reach the point where tugboats finally arrive to tow the ship to shore, causing it to list sharply, and the backed-up sewage to start running across every floor and down the walls, the comedy does fade slightly. In retrospect, it was also a mistake to open up a free bar on day two. Not that Jan needs retrospective. “I was definitely against the idea.” Jan is English and northern. Always listen to Jan.The only happy American on show is Frank Spagnoletti, a maritime lawyer sitting at home in Houston watching the debacle unfold. “Obviously, my antenna was piqued.” I shan’t give away what the fates have in store for him. I shall say only – check your tickets’ small print every time, folks. There is some raw work pulled at the contractual font sometimes, and no mistake.Unlike the unfortunates aboard the Triumph, we viewers are in and out of the situation in under an hour and feel like we have had quite a lot of fun in the process. If anyone wants to write the sitcom or the film, I would give either one my full attention. Also, some primeval part of my brain hisses, an international reality show based on it. I think there’s a real opportunity to build some national pride here. Channel 4, it’s over to you.Trainwreck: Poop Cruise is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

They are a model of male intimacy and understanding: confiding in each other, trusting each other, hugging each other (“real, loving hugs, clutches without irony”). Theirs is truly a friendship for the ages.Or so it seems. For on the weekend of Emerson’s 52nd birthday, an occasion at the centre of Hal Ebbott’s probing and insightful debut novel, something happens that changes everything – and raises the question of whether we can ever truly know anyone.Amos and Emerson met on the first day of college and bonded immediately despite their surface differences (Emerson is rich and handsome, Amos poor but clever). They have each fallen in love, married and had children, their families going through life together, twinned by the two men’s unbreakable bond. “You know,” observes Amos’s wife, Claire, “it’s a triumph of my marriage that I don’t envy what the two of you have.”Among Friends is a bracingly honest and affectingly intimate depiction of abuse, family dynamics and self-deceitThe story begins as Amos, Claire and their daughter, Anna, are driving to Emerson’s house in the country for a weekend of birthday celebrations. The mood is relaxed and carefree. Amos is pleased that a medical check has come back clear. But the reader is warned of the storm to come: “Each in their own way will think of this drive. They will marvel at its ordinariness, they will search it for signs. Was it already broken? Was it already lost?” Once they arrive there are further ill omens: a smashed wine bottle; a twisted ankle; a car crash. We are primed to expect catastrophe.And while on the surface everything seems perfect for these rich and successful New Yorkers, underneath gripes and grievances bubble away. An evening meal can barely pass without some tetchiness. A tone might be considered “too performed”, a laugh too forced. Emerson is so irked by Amos’s childish manners that he nurses his displeasure late into the night (“his thoughts lingered on the way Amos had asked for dessert”). But it is not until a friendly game of tennis gets too heated, and Emerson, bested and embarrassed and feeling his age, retires to the house, that things go seriously wrong.It is not easy to grasp why, and that is part of the novel’s ambiguous power. Emerson himself seems not to know what he is doing (“Am I? Am I going to do it?”). Without giving too much away, a confused sense of entitlement, damaged ego and midlife crisis leads Emerson to an unforgivable act. It is shocking, but not exactly surprising. Ebbott subtly unpicks the luscious tapestry he has so far woven, laying out the more selfish and messy emotions that underlie the characters’ relationships: Amos’s social climbing; Emerson’s need for validation. It is an impressively nuanced portrait.Some aspects are less subtle. The key event is handled somewhat awkwardly, with a jarring attempt at black humour. More undermining is Ebbott’s habit later in the novel of painting Emerson as a black-and-white villain (he is likened to a “wolf” or a “reptile, born already with the memory, the knowledge of violence”), rather than the more ambiguously flawed fiftysomething he had appeared earlier. The style and tone is initially blandly self-confident (“The car flew on. Amos felt himself move with it – this smooth, edgeless life”) but becomes increasingly searching and introspective, with the best section, one from the victim’s viewpoint, taking on a disembodied, incantatory feel as words and phrases run around their head, becoming more and more meaningless: “What he did. What hedid. Whateedyd. Whut eed id.”Among Friends is a bracingly honest and affectingly intimate depiction of abuse, family dynamics and self-deceit. It is sharply observed and psychologically astute, somehow both passionate and dispassionate, and it upends its characters’ lives so ruthlessly and revealingly that it is hard not to take pleasure in a false facade being finally smashed.Among Friends is published by Picador (£18.99).

Politkovskaya’s gutsy, impassioned reporting on thesecond Chechen warwas highly critical of the Kremlin, the Russian army and Vladimir Putin personally. (The fact that she was murdered on his birthday was surely no coincidence.) Nineteen years after her death, she remains a folk hero worldwide for resistances to autocracy, especially given the rise in repression everywhere and constant threats to journalists.Given all that, the film deserves respect for the subject matter, even though this is a pretty basic rendition of Politkovskaya’s story, a little too sticky with hagiographic sentimentality and the cliches of crusading journalist-led movies. It also should be noted that Politkovskaya’s family haven’t given the film their blessing; some of them may not be happy, for instance, with the thinly written characterisations of their fictional counterparts, like her son Ilya (Harry Lawtey) who is made to seem peevish and self-absorbed even when his feelings are understandable. (“I’m not watching you die!” he bellows at one point.)In fact, the flawed peripheral characters are more interesting than Peake’s Politkovskaya, who spends much of the film with her strong jaw jutting out, projecting nobility despite the over-lacquered blond wig inflicted on her. Her best scenes are those in which she spars withJason Isaacs, who plays her husband, Sasha – a TV journalist clearly proud of his wife but jealous of her success – and with Ian Hart (always a treat when playing the heavy) as a sinister FSB secret policeman who loves history.The gently swelling strings in the score and flat lighting all serve to underscore the televisual atmosphere – even in what should be the film’s climatic set piece, thedisastrous siege at Moscow’s Dubrovka theatre, a cataclysmic event that deserves more dynamic film-making than the bit of slow-motion and sound dimming offered here. Politkovskaya served as a negotiator between the Russian security forces and the Chechen terrorists; she was later poisoned on a plane headed to Beslan, where a school full of children were also killed by terrorists. Politkovskaya survived that particular assassination attempt but those who know her story will dread the arrival of the final blow. It is to the film’s credit that over the end titles we see a portrait not just of the real Politkovskaya but also some of the 1,500 journalists worldwide who have been murdered in recent years.Words of War is on digital platforms from 30 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsAnna PolitkovskayaRussiaPeriod and historical filmsMaxine PeakeJason IsaacsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The film immerses itself in the world of the protesters – particularly the young and female protesters – a whole generation energised and brought together by the insurgent movement; their passion was complicated and intensified by the fact that the revolution, at least at first, only brought in a “Transitional Military Council” or TMC, which did not seem in any great hurry to transition to democratic civilian rule. In fact, it carried outa grotesque massacre against people at a sit-in in June 2019, resulting in 127 people dead and 70 cases of rape.Meddeb finds among the protesters a vivid, vibrant artistic movement: an oral culture of music, poetry and rap which flourishes on the streets. There is also a kind of subversive, surrealist energy: the camera finds a mock traffic roadworks sign reading: “Sorry for the Delay – Uprooting a Regime”. The most amazing performances from both women and men are witnessed, as well as a kind ofsoixante-huitardculture of slogans and maxims; young women hold up signs and prose-poems.Above all, the protesters are suspicious of theocracy and the prevalence of a clerical class who have a great love of bullying the populace; one woman remembers a preacher who insisted on the virtues of poverty for everyone else while owning a sleek four-wheel drive. “The people demand justice for the dead!” declaims one banner; this is a movement which is passionately aware of its fallen comrades, betrayed by those who were ushered into power by their sacrifice and courage.Sudan, Remember Us is in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsProtestSudanMiddle East and north AfricaAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet the whole thing is stranger than fiction – more metaphorical, more metatextual than fiction – and, of course, taken from real life.Pintilie co-wrote the screenplay with Romanian author Horia Patrascu, based on Patrascu’s novel about an extraordinary event that took place in the early 1960s. Two drunken, hapless youths were caught brawling at a riverside cafe and were made to re-enact the event in detail for a solemn instructional film produced by the communist party authorities to be shown in schools, offices and clubs as a terrible warning against alcohol and anti-social bourgeois delinquency. The two stars of this strange film are moreover tacitly expected to redeem their offence, to expunge their sins moment-by-moment, by recreating their lives in the service of state-sponsored morality. (The actual official film that inspired this, on which Patrascu worked as a crew member, presumably exists in an archive somewhere.)A bleary prosecutor (George Costantin) and careworn schoolteacher (Emil Botta) are tasked with overseeing this earnestly high-minded project, to be filmed at the very cafe where the original events took place. However, they are more concerned with their own problems: the prosecutor’s marriage is crumbling and the schoolteacher has relapsed into alcoholic despair due to the death of his daughter. Scowling militiaman Dumitrescu (Ernest Maftei) represents conventional authority while the two offending teens are Vuica (George Mihaita) and Nicu (Vladimir Gaitan) who smirk and flinch with utter bewilderment at what is happening, as the director yells at them to hit each other in the face. They are moreover embarrassed to be having to do this for the amusement of a bikini-clad young woman (Ileana Popovici) who is hanging about, watching.The punishment-slash-redemption involved in this “reconstruction” is a mixture of sophistication and crass official clumsiness. It is very heavy-handed, pedantic and intrusive for the state to humiliate two young people in this way, and such is the laxity and incompetence of the authorities that nothing gets done for hour after hour, despite the fact that the filming has to get finished before an expected crowd of football supporters shows up. The sweaty prosecutor is more interested in bathing his feet in the river, and even hints that this “film” is in fact just voluntary, not compulsory. The two boys, larking about, manage to scare away a local woman’s flock of geese; they must recover these creatures. Reconstruction demonstrates not just the inefficiency of the political apparatus, but that of movie-making itself, which always involves hanging around on location.Yet it is also an unsettling incident of surveillance, scrutiny, intimate control; an attempt to invade the consciousness of the wrongdoer. The re-enactment is not just for the public, but also to compel the culprits to look at what they have done, to confront them with it in detail. Pintilie’s film is the exact opposite of BBC TV’s Crimewatch, which reconstructs unsolved crimes to catch the criminals; this is to further mortify the malefactors and anyone in the audience tempted to do something similar. Film is punishment; film is cruelty. Reconstruction is cousin to Powell’s Peeping Tom and Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange; this is the postwar communist enlightenment: not an assault upon or imprisonment of the defendant’s body, but an incursion into his mind. Pintilie shows these state-sanctioned film-makers demand documentary realism, with grimly ironic and yet blackly comic results.Reconstruction is on Klassiki from 19 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsRomaniaFilm adaptationsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Can love keep them together?Cath ClarkeTue 24 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 24 Jun 2025 08.31 EDTShareThere is never the tiniest doubt that Kerry and Kenny Watson love each other. “I always tell him that he has the most beautiful ears,” says Kerry, marvelling at the wonder of her husband. “Even his wrists are beautiful.” But when Kenny came home toScotlandafter serving as a sniper in Afghanistan, it looked as if their marriage was almost certainly over. Diagnosed withpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Kenny was sleeping between 18 and 24 hours a day, and became so paranoid that he thought dog walkers were Taliban snipers. The worst thing was that the crying of their baby son, Harris, triggered his PTSD. This intimate documentary, told without a scrap of sentimentality, follows the couple over 10 years.The story unfolds almost like couples therapy, unpeeling the relationship layer by layer. On the voiceover Kenny jokes that when he met Kerry he told her he was a deep-sea firefighter, not a soldier, because he thought the truth would scare her away. What he loved first about his wife was her honesty; but Kerry has never fully opened up to him about a trauma from her childhood. The camera is a fly-on-the-wall in their lives through the worst of Kenny’s illness. In the darkest moments, he is agonisingly, unflinchingly direct about what is going on in his head.While Kenny is becoming more unwell at home, Kerry, who hated school and left with only a few GCSEs, goes back to education. She studies psychology at university and qualifies as a practitioner, while Kenny eventually begins to seek support. A small negative about the film itself is that we don’t get any sense of the chronology; it would have been helpful to have captions showing time passing. Love & Trouble perhaps works better on television than the big screen, but you cannot help but admire Kerry and Kenny’s emotional courage.Love & Trouble is in UK cinemas from 27 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPost-traumatic stress disorderScotlandMental healthHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Butthe rowabout the extramural staging ofDon’t Cry for Me Argentinain Evita at the London Palladium is a sign of its director’s increasing celebrity status. Indeed I’m tempted to rephrase a number from an earlier Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical: “Jamie Lloyd Superstar, Do you think you’re what they say you are?” What, in short, does it tell us about our theatrical culture that this puckishly likable director has become a figure famed on both sides of the Atlantic?His beginnings, asa recent Vogue featurepointed out, were relatively modest. He grew up in rural Dorset, was turned on to live theatre by seeing Michael Jackson on tour and attended the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. But, right from the start, there was something there. The first production of his that I saw wasThe Caretaker, which in 2007 transferred from the Sheffield Crucible to what was then the Tricycle in London. Two things made it original: the use of a creepy score by Ben and Max Ringham to give the play a film noir feel and the insistent presence of Nigel Harman’s Mick reminding us that the work is about the fraternal bond between him and the brain-damaged Aston, which Pinter’s intrusive hobo fails to understand.View image in fullscreenNigel Harman and David Bradley in The Caretaker in 2007.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOver the next few years I followed Lloyd’s career with interest and was struck by several things. One was his trust in actors and his ability to extend their range. There wasZawe Ashtonin the title role in Oscar Wilde’s Salome at Hampstead theatre dancing to a ghetto-blaster; Douglas Hodge inInadmissible Evidenceat the Donmar turning John Osborne’s disintegrating hero into a quasi-Beckettian figure; and Katherine Kelly, best known for Coronation Street, playing Kate Hardcastle inShe Stoops to Conquer, with a rustic graciousness.For a young director, Lloyd had a rare faith in the language and setting of classic plays: that production of Oliver Goldsmith’s comedy at the National was robustly true to the late-18th century just as hisDuchess of Malfiat the Old Vic was unequivocally Jacobean. Without distorting authorial intention, Lloyd also made you look again at a work you thought you knew. By casting Elena Roger, who had played Evita and Piaf, as the heroine in the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musicalPassionat the Donmar in 2010, Lloyd changed the whole balance of the show: Roger’s sickly Fosca, instead of being an ugly duckling, was a lonely woman embodying the power of unconditional love.View image in fullscreenEve Best in The Duchess of Malfi, directed by Jamie Lloyd at the Old Vic in 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSignificantly, much of Lloyd’s best early work was done when he was an associate at the Donmar working under the tutelage of Michael Grandage. Even when he branched out and formed the Jamie Lloyd Company in 2013 there was still much to admire. I may have disliked hisDoctor Faustus, which became a pointless satire on the lure of showbiz stardom, but there was good work with James McAvoy, includingMacbethand Peter Barnes’sThe Ruling Class, and notable revivals of Pinter’sThe HothouseandThe Homecoming.It was, however, a six-month season in 2018-19 of all of Pinter’s one-act plays that for me was proof of Lloyd’s quality. For a start, the season demolished the myth that Pinter’s shorter pieces are inferior to his full-length plays: what became abundantly clear was that, whatever the chosen form, Pinter was preoccupied with analysing the roots of power. Lloyd also attracted an astonishing range of actors:Antony Sher for One for the Road, Tamsin Greig for Landscape and A Kind of Alaska, Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer for The Dumb Waiter, Jane Horrocks and Luke Thallon for The Room.View image in fullscreenJamie Lloyd, centre (with Nicole Scherzinger, left and Andrew Lloyd Webber, right), accepts the award for best revival of a musical for Sunset Boulevard at the Tony awards this month.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APLloyd’s own productions were often revelatory. Having myself wrestled with the difficulty of directing Party Time, in which a wealthy elite remain oblivious to a round-up of dissidents, I was staggered by Lloyd’s courage in having the characters simply line up facing the audience in a cocktail party from hell. Even more impressive was his production ofBetrayal, with Tom Hiddleston, Zawe Ashton and Charlie Cox, which stripped the action of circumstantial detail and reminded us that there are three sides to an emotional triangle: in other words, that the deceived partner is always present in the imagination.Betrayal transferred to Broadway and was nominated for numerous Tony awards, since when Lloyd’s star has been in the ascendant on both sides of the Atlantic. While that is welcome, it also means that in the last six years Lloyd has forged his own particular style: a hi-tech minimalism that involves abandonment of scenery, heavily miked actors and ubiquitous cameras. It worked well for his version ofSunset Boulevardpartly because Nicole Scherzinger gave a dazzling performance and partly because the musical is about the narcissism of the film industry. As the cameras tracked every gesture of the actors, I was reminded of Billy Wilder’s quip on seeing the original stage production: “It’ll make a good movie.”View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler as Eva Perón sings Don’t Cry for Me Argentina on a balcony outside the London Palladium.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PABut similar techniques were used less happily in Lloyd’s production ofRomeo and Juliet. The idea that for their first encounter Tom Holland’s Romeo should be alone on stage and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers’s Juliet should be partying in the theatre foyer struck me as absurd. Lloyd’s belief in amplified sound also had fatal consequences in his Drury LaneTempest. Instead of the tonal variety of the human voice we got an homogenised sound in which, with the exception of Selina Cadell’s Gonzalo, it was difficult to tell who was speaking. I thought back wistfully to the 1957 production of The Tempest at that theatre in which the unaided voices of John Gielgud, Alec Clunes and Robert Harris had a distinct and beautiful resonance.Lloyd is a man of undoubted talent, and technology has a place in modern theatre. But he is in danger of falling back on a formula and, without a strong producer behind him, succumbing to the modern cult of the director. Ideally, theatre is a coalition of all the talents in which writer, actor and director are all working to the fullest possible realisation of the work in question. I look forward to seeing how Evita plays at the London Palladium but we should remember that Everybody’s Talking About Jamie is the title of a musical and not a recipe for theatrical success.Evita is at thePalladium, London, until 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreJamie LloydWest EndMusicalsAndrew Lloyd WebberHarold PinterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Elsa and Anna drew an audience of zealous young cosplayers. Can Hercules bring in his own sword-and-sandal stans? His zero-to-hero journey was certainly winning in the 1997 animated film, with Gerald Scarfe’s sharp-lined designs and James Woods’ deliciously wicked Hades. But lightning does not strike twice with this stage version, although it is a sturdy enough Disney vehicle, with strong songs and plenty of splash.There is a briskness to its drama, under the direction of Casey Nicholaw, and a pounding out of the material – Songs! Lights! Action! – that makes it seem like a conveyor-belt musical. The characters are not so much divine as 2D, although the sound and optics are always eye-popping, the swivelling set designs intent on moving heaven and earth. Gregg Barnes and Sky Switser’s costumes are heavenly, too, and camp as hell: gold dresses, white Spanx and Hercules in a mesh vest and miniskirt-style toga by the end.View image in fullscreenSongs! Lights! Action! … Hercules, designed by Dane Laffrey.Photograph: Johan PerssonLuke Brady is an incredible singer, as Hercules navigates his journey between godliness and humanness with sidekick Phil (Trevor Dion Nicholas). But the title character is rather generic, a Hunkules who is earnest for too long despite shades of Joey from Friends (why not lean in to that?). The cast around Brady is just as strong vocally, but breezy in their dialogue. The animated film’s Hades was a fabulous creation, his head permanently licked by flames from his underworld. Here, Stephen Carlile looks and sounds like a pantomime baddie, complete with corny jokes. You want to boo him every time he delivers his lines.The big booming songs – including seven new numbers written by Alan Menken (music) and David Zippel (lyrics) – come to sound samey and a little soupy, such as the new addition, Today’s Gonna Be My Day. They are delivered as briskly as the action by an American-accented cast. Go the Distance is a lovely solo by Hercules but you do not feel quite enough emotion from it. The upbeat numbers work better, especially the reprises of Gospel Truth by the five muses, all powerhouse singers. So there is astolidity to the story, as if an ancient tablet of stone has taken the place of a flesh and blood heart.View image in fullscreenChemistry … Luke Brady as Hercules and Mae Ann Jorolan as Meg.Photograph: Matt CrockettThe first half culminates in an NFL style parade, full of military motifs and twirling batons, all taking us outside the story’s ancient world and into unimaginative, bland entertainment, with stock choreography (by Nicholaw and Tanisha Scott). But in the second halfKwame Kwei-Armahand Robert Horn’s book gets funnier, Hercules turns goofier and his love story with Meg (Mae Ann Jorolan, cool cat to Brady’s golden retriever) grows in chemistry. Not everything rights itself, however. The monsters that Hercules meets are certainly big but seem oddly cuddly as if the production is afraid of frightening its younger audience.Perhaps this musical shows the film’s age: this feels like old-school Disney, its hero not quite self-mocking enough (compare him with the brilliantly self-parodying Maui from Moana) and the earnestness heaped heavy. In the programme, Zippel acknowledges the animated Hercules’s mix of heart and wit. “Everything comes with a wink,” he says.

But that is the Yorkshireman’s point: there is a better US, now occluded by He Who Shall Barely Be Named, but still worth believing in. Voice of America traces Hodgson’s lifelong love affair with the States, in the teeth of his Europhile parents’ distaste, the disillusion of the Bush years and a recent doomed bid for Hollywood success.It joins as big-hitting a body of work as any in comedy, a suite of autobiographical shows itemising the nerdy obsessions (cycling; Mahler; European politics) of child and adult Kieran. Voice of America hits less big, for my money, partly because its subject is less lovably niche, and also because the binary thinking (America good? America bad?) is simplistic before Hodgson arrives at his predictably more nuanced conclusion.You may have to park your scepticism at Hodgson’s vision (seen through the star-spangled eyes of youth) of the US pre-2000 as a paradise before the fall. This middle-class ingenue from Holmfirth looks in awe at Home Alone, Will Smith and the soaring speeches of JFK. His parents’ dismissal of “American rubbish” only fuels his fetish for Americana. Then comes his career in entertainment, and a growing sense that Tinseltown is the only place to be.Kieran Hodgson: ‘When I was 17 I decided to liven up a lasagne by putting bananas in it’Read moreThe show circles around a tale Hodgson tells of his would-be breakthrough role in a superhero movie, and the can of worms prised open by his obligation to play an American. What, or who,isan American anyway? Is it the culture vulture he meets at the opera? Or is it the current president, whom our host refuses to talk about, but who keeps threatening a hostile takeover of the show? This all supplies a great platform for Hodgson’s vocal and mimicry talent, and for neat jokes, too, like the Canadians/Ewoks number, or the one about the audio entertainment on Hodgson family road trips. Its structure may, like Trump, be crude – but this is another fine show about a meek Brit grappling with the all-conquering myth, and reality, of America.AtSoho theatre, London, until 28 June.

Longtime partners and creative collaborators, the two met on the set of 2002’s Resident Evil, an adaptation of the Japanese video game franchise which pushed the limits of the PlayStation in the 90s. Starring the former and written and directed by the latter, the production – which would inaugurate a six-film, billion-dollar franchise – was not without its hiccups.The story goes that Jovovich, unhappy with script revisions which palmed her action scenes off to her co-stars, threatened to walk. But instead of leaving, she and Andersonspent hours amending the script: the genesis of a fruitful partnership, both professional and personal. Most significantly, the rewrites returned to Jovovich’s character (the amnesiac Alice) the film’s defining scene, in which she runs up a wall, spins, jumps and kicks a zombie dog square in the face.The games that provide the source material were light on action and heavy on dread; they ostensibly ushered in the nascent medium’s “survival horror” genre. Less concerned with generic fidelity than sensory thrills, the film ports the games’ universe into the nu-metal action cycle of the early 2000s (see: The One, xXx), a period brimming with tactile, tacky pleasures – chief among them hard rock and martial arts.Onscreen, the wall-jump dog kick plays out in graceful slow motion with a guitar lick, a yell and the shatter of glass. Arriving at the halfway mark, it’s a turning point: with a single blow, Alice begins to regain both her memory and corporeal ability. From here on, it’s her film.Like the games, the adaptation is set in a world under the purview of the Umbrella Corporation, a multinational conglomerate with their grubby mitts on everything from healthcare to military technology. When a hazardous viral material is let loose within one of their secret subterranean research facilities known as The Hive, the site goes into lockdown. You might’ve guessed what happens next: all the staff turn into zombies.View image in fullscreen‘The franchise places proficient women at the forefront of the action’: Resident Evil.Photograph: Constantin Film/AllstarAlice’s relation to these events is initially unclear. She awakens, dazed, in an empty mansion. Before she can gather her wits, she’s swiftly ushered by a military clean-up crew, descending into a subterranean facility full of cold concrete and faceless steel to aid the investigation. Less post-apocalyptic sprawl than claustrophobic pressure cooker, the proceedings are decidedly intimate. It’s all smoke and corridors.As the crew progress deeper into the labyrinthine facility, Alice regains further fragments of her memory. Flashbacks offer an echo of her identity: an insider feeding information to environmental activists in the hopes of exposing Umbrella’s illegal experiments. Like all great sci-fi, Resident Evil possesses a healthy scepticism of corporations and a distinctly anti-capitalist subtext. The film’s zombies aren’t mindless consumers à la Romero or hyperactive runners in the vein of 28 Days Later, but reanimated workers, cursed to roam the halls of their place of employment in the afterlife.Four Nights of a Dreamer: Robert Bresson’s timeless poem of young loveRead moreIn the image of Aliens, the franchise places proficient women at the forefront of the action. Alice is adept and adaptable. At her side is the resilient special ops agent Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), a battler who staves off infection seemingly to grunt choice quips. “When I get outta here, I think I’m gonna get laid,” she jests, despite being bitten any number of times.All this, of course, made for humble beginnings for a long and loving marriage. Anderson is affectionately referred to in fan circles as the medium’s pre-eminent “wife guy”. Peruse his filmography and you’ll find film after film in which Jovovich plays lead and bestows balletic blows in slow motion, her bodysuspended in the camera’s loving eye.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Easier said than done: a midlife woman and a teenage boy are completely different beasts. I wanted to walk. He wanted to be driven. I wanted to get up early. He wanted to sleep in. I wanted unusual food. He wanted pub grub. I wanted to be safely active. He wanted to lie on a sofa or scramble along a vertiginous precipice. I wanted conversation. He didn’t (at least not with me, hour after hour). The problem of where to go seemed insurmountable.SE England E SussexBut there was one activity we both enjoyed: making and building things. Could this be the answer to our “bonding” trip? When I suggested we do a three-day stone-carving course on the South Downs and then a wood-turning class deep in an East Sussex forest, he nodded.We could spend our days together, but not conversing. The start time would be somewhere between his and my preferred rising hours. Our creative endeavours could be interspersed with eating at pubs that catered to each of our food preferences. And the travel requirements were minimal. We would base ourselves at my mum’s in Lewes (but there’s a great choice of local accommodation, including ayouth hostelin a converted Sussex farmhouse in Southease on the South Downs that offers options from private rooms to bell tents). To boot, we may come away with more than just a few memories. Conran-ish wooden bowls and Hepworth-ish stone sculptures swum before my eyes.

In a hidden crevice of the South Downs, not far from Hassocks, the Skelton stone-carving studio is near the home of the eminent, deceased sculptor and letter-cutter, John Skelton (students can visit Skelton’s nearby sculpture garden during courses). The vast barn-style workshop looks over slanting vineyards which also contained – to our surprise and delight – a very cool wine bar and restaurant. TheArtelium wine estateoffers vineyard tours and tasting sessionsand, having discovered that the wines had won multiple awards, its alfresco terrace became our lunch spot (charcuterie boards and homemade bread) for the next three days.View image in fullscreenArtelium vineyard and restaurantBut first we had to choose whether we wanted to carve letters or sculpture. We both opted for sculpture. We then had to make another decision: what sort of stone? Hugo chose a beautiful green granite, while I selected a large block of Italian soapstone. Being disorganised, neither of us had arrived with any ideas. The course tutors provided books to inspire us and – after a little discussion with our eight fellow students – we both decided to go abstract. After three days of open-air chiselling, hammering, sanding and polishing, we had sculptures deemed good enough for the end-of-course show. To our (continued) surprise, a crowd arrived for the “private viewing” in which our sculptures were publicly praised by the tutors. We celebrated with an evening meal inThe Gun, a gastropub in Chiddingly that serves stone-baked pizzas and something it calls a “gut-loving burrito bowl” composed of sweetcorn, black beans, guacamole and all the other things anathema to Hugo but much-loved by his mother.As sunlight poured through the foliage above us, wood chips whizzed through the grainy air and sweat ran from our browsThe next day, we drove 30 minutes east, to a privately owned woodland just outside Battle. Here, we hoped to master the ancient art of wood- turning using pole lathes, now a heritage craft. Green woodworkerAmy Leake– youthful, petite, impressively muscled – had set up our pole lathes beneath the shade of a vast, spreading oak. After introducing us to our lathes (simple contraptions Amy made herself, in which sawn branches, rope and a treadle turn the wood), she showed us how to axe an enormous chunk of wood into something that would ultimately become a bowl. As sunlight poured through the green foliage above us, wood chips whizzed through the grainy air and sweat ran from our brows. Turning on a pole lathe requires strength, stamina and skill. Thanks to Amy’s expert guidance, by the end of the day we were the proud (if exhausted) owners of two beautiful bowls.View image in fullscreenCrazy golf in Hastings.Photograph: LH Images/AlamyTo recover, we headed to nearby Hastings for fish and chips on the beach followed by a game of crazy golf on the sea front.

As with tomatoes, when Columbus returned from the Americas in the late 15th century, he presented peppers as a gift to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and they very quickly became a key part of our cooking traditions. The pepper’s most iconic contribution to Spanish cuisine is surely pimentón de la Vera, or smoked paprika, which is an essential seasoning in a lot of Spanish cooking, adding exquisite depth to stews, rice dishes, seafood and, of course, chorizo. But we also celebrate fresh peppers in all their guises. Padrón peppers are, of course, a classic tapa, whilepimientos rellenos(stuffed peppers) are filled every which way, from seafood and minced meat to creamy bechamel. From the royal court to home kitchens, peppers have taken root in our culinary culture.Pimentos rellenos (green peppers stuffed with slow-cooked ragu – pictured top)Stuffedpiquillopeppers have long been popular in restaurants and homes across Spain, and are often filled with oxtail or bacalao. This dish provides a similar comforting experience, maintaining the essence of the traditional classic while at the same time being a bit more accessible, making it perfect for home cooking. Serve with a lovely glass ofbobal, a wine from a grape variety common in Valencia and Utiel-Requena. Its richness will complement the bold flavours of the stuffed peppers. You can make the ragu in advance and freeze it, then defrost and pick things up again from the last paragraph.Prep15 minCook2 hr 40 min+Makes83 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped2 celery stalks, trimmed and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed200gcooking chorizo, skinned and finely chopped500gpork mince1 star aniseFinely grated zest of 1 lemon200mlwhite wine400gtin tomatoes2 tbsp tomato puree350mlchicken stockFlaky sea salt andblack pepper8 large green bell peppersHeat the oil in a large saute pan, then gently fry the onion and celery for 10 minutes, until really soft.

Stir in the star anise, lemon zest and white wine, leave to bubble for a few minutes, then tip in the tomatoes, tomato puree and stock. Season well, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook, stirring occasionally, for two to three hours; add a splash more stock or water if the ragu threatens to reduce too far and dry out.Half an hour before you want to serve, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Cut the tops off the peppers and carefully remove and discard the pith and seeds with a spoon. Arrange the peppers in a roasting tin in which they will fit quite snugly, drizzle with olive oil and season well, then roast for 15–20 minutes, until soft but still holding their shape. Fill the roast peppers with the ragu, then roast for another 15 minutes. Serve hot.Green pepper and sardine empanadasView image in fullscreenJose Pizarro’s green pepper and sardine empanadas.Empanadas should be much more popular than they are, which makes me wonder if people tend to think of them as pasties, which are larger, made with shortcrust pastry that’s often high in saturated fats, filled with starchy vegetables, and often mass-produced containing additives and high in salt. Empanadas, however, are a versatile and healthier option. They’re made with a lighter, thinner dough, have less fat, are more often than not baked, and have a crisper texture. They’re typically smaller than pasties, and use a variety of lighter, tasty fillings including vegetarian, vegan and some internationally inspired alternatives. These ones are made with tinned sardine fillets, but fresh or even mussels would work well, too. Serve with a glass of chilled albariño or a crisp, cold beer.Prep15 minChill30 min+Cook1 hr 30Makes62 tbsp olive oil2 banana shallots, peeled and finely sliced4 green peppers(long ones, if you can find them), stalks, seeds and pith discarded, flesh sliced½ tsp chilli flakes1 bay leaf4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves strippedFlaky sea salt andblack pepper2 tbsp Pedro Ximénez sherry vinegar12 tinned sardine fillets, drainedFor the pastry250gplainflour, plus extra for dusting½ tsp fine salt100g cold unsalted butter, cubed1 egg, beaten1 tsp white-wine vinegarHeat the oil in a large pan, then fry the shallots for five minutes. Add the peppers, chilli flakes, bay leaf and thyme, season and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, until lovely and soft. Add the PX vinegar, cook for a few more minutes, then take off the heat and leave to cool.To make the pastry, tip the flour and salt into a bowl, then rub in the cold diced butter with your fingertips until the mix resembles breadcrumbs. Mix half the beaten egg with two tablespoons of cold water and the vinegar, add to the flour bowl and mix in quickly. Bring the dough together with your hands, then knead very briefly on a floured surface until smooth. Shape into a disc, wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Divide the chilled dough into six equal-sized pieces and roll each one into a ball. Roll out each ball into a large disc, then use a pastry cutter or small plate to cut out a 16cm circle; discard any trimmings, or save for another use.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Divide the pepper mixture evenly between the pastry circles, leaving a border all around the edge, then top each one with two sardine fillets.
