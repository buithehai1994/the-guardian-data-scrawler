He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, theVaticansaid in a late update.The pope has been hospitalised for a week with a complex lung infection.The statement said the “Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved.”Earlier, doctors said his health remains touch and go and he is expected toremain in hospital for at least another week.They have warned that the main threat facing the pope would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia.As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he was taking, the pope’s medical team said.Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal.Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the US National Institutes of Health.Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on 14 February after a week-long bout of bronchitis worsened.Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs.They prescribed “absolute rest” and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it.Dr Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Gemelli hospital, said: “He knows he’s in danger,” Alfieri added. “And he told us to relay that.”The Vatican hierarchy tried to tamp down speculation that the pope might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated.Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working.The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to rumours about a possible resignation.It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret.Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat out denied that any such meeting occurred.Parolin said such speculation seemed “useless” when what really mattered was the health of the pope, his recovery and return to the Vatican.“On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumours can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,” Parolin was quoted as saying.“However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyEuropeThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

Three other police officers were lightly wounded.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the knife attack was “without any doubt an act of Islamist terrorism”. The suspected attacker, an Algerian male who has been arrested, is on a terror prevention watchlist, according to the anti-terrorism prosecution office (PNAT).He has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, and was under an expulsion order from France, according to union sources.Shortly before 4pm, he attacked local police officers shouting “God is greatest” in Arabic, PNAT said in a statement. Witnesses confirmed to Agence France-Presse that the suspect had several times shouted the phrase.One of the seriously wounded police officers sustained an injury to the carotid artery, and the other to the thorax.The passerby, who is understood to have been a Portuguese national, was killed trying to intervene, the PNAT said.View image in fullscreenFrench municipal police officers collect evidence at the site of an attack where one person was killed and two municipal police officers wounded in Mulhouse on 22 February.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty Images“Horror has seized our city,” Mulhouse mayor Michèle Lutz said on Facebook. The incident was being investigated as a terror attack, she said, but “this must obviously still be confirmed by the judiciary”.The French interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, is expected to travel to the scene of the attack on Saturday evening. Police have established a security perimeter after the attack, as forensic scientists searched for evidence. Military units have been sent to the scene as backup.The government was determined to continue doing “everything to eradicate terrorism on our soil”, Macron said. The “solidarity of the nation” was with the attack victim and his family, he added.France’s terror prevention list compiles data from various authorities on people to prevent terrorist radicalisation. It was launched in 2015 after deadly attacks on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and on a Jewish supermarket.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The aim would be to agree a broad European position on the Trump-led effort to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Starmer also spoke yesterday to the European Commission’s president,Ursula von der Leyen, and agreed that Europe must “step up” to ensure Ukraine’s security.Starmer’s meeting with Trump is being described in Westminster as possibly career-defining for the prime minister. Former UK foreign secretary William Hague said it was the most important first bilateral between a prime minister and a president since the start of the second world war.After a week of extraordinary anti-Zelenskyy and pro-Russian rhetoric from Trump and his team, the US president issued another dismissive assault on Zelenskyy’s leadership and relevance to a peace deal on Friday, saying: “I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you. When Zelenskyy said: ‘Oh, he wasn’t invited to a meeting,’ I mean, it wasn’t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.”View image in fullscreenUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has so far refuse to sign a $500bn minerals deal with the US.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAs well asdismissing the democratically elected Zelenskyy as a dictator, the White House has been pressuring Ukraine’s president tosign a $500bn minerals dealin which he would give the US half of his country’s mineral resources. The Trump administration says this is “payback” for earlier US military assistance.Zelenskyy has so far refused to sign, arguing that the agreement lacks clear US security guarantees.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An under-pressure Zelenskyy has signalled his willingness to accommodate Washington’s demand, but he has stressed he cannot “sell out” his country.Ukrainian officials are scrambling to find alternatives to Starlink in the event that Trump’s threat is carried out. Ukraine’s armed forces depend on the system to provide real-time video drone footage of the battlefield and to conduct accurate strikes against Russian targets.The Russian military uses Starlink too. Ukrainian commanders are now contemplating a nightmare scenario, in which Musk’sSpaceXcompany switches off Ukrainian access while continuing to offer it to the Russians – with the White House in effect helping Moscow to win the war.A senior Ukrainian official said his country’s armed forces need American satellite intelligence data. If intelligence sharing were to stop, Ukraine would struggle to continue its successful campaign of long-range strikes against targets deep inside Russia, he said.Asked if the US threat to turn off Starlink was blackmail, he replied: “Yes. If it happens, it’s going to be pretty bad. Of that we can be sure.” Frontline troops used the internet system continuously and it was fitted on advanced naval drones used to sink Russian ships in the Black Sea, he noted.Trump’s savage attack on Zelenskyy shaped by pro-Russian coterieRead moreSpeaking on Friday, Trump rowed back on some of his earlier comments, which included a false claim that Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular, with a “4%” rating. Trump told Fox News that Russia did invade Ukraine but said Zelenskyy and the then US presidentJoe Bidenshould have averted it. “They shouldn’t have let him [Putin] attack,” he declared.Trump’s aggressive remarks have consolidated support for Zelenskyy among Ukrainians, with 63% now approving of him, according to the latest opinion poll before the third anniversary on Monday of Russia’s full-scale invasion.An Opinium poll for theObserverfinds more than three times as many UK voters (56%) disapprove of the Trump’s administration handling of Ukraine as approve (17%).About 55% think it likely the UK will need to participate in a large military conflict over the next five years, compared with a fifth (20%) who think it unlikely. A majority (60%) of people believe the UK should increase defence spending.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverDonald TrumpForeign policyUkraineRussiaUS politicsVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Vehicles apparently carrying Palestinian prisoners eventually left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in.The delay imposes further strain on the precarious truce, which is at a particularly vulnerable moment, between first and second phases. The first phase is due to end next Saturday, but negotiations on the second phase have yet to begin.Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou issued a statement accusing Israel’s prime minister of “procrastination and stalling tactics”.“The [Israeli] occupation’s failure to comply with the release of the seventh batch of prisoners in the exchange deal at the agreed-upon time constitutes a blatant violation of the agreement,” al-Qanou said.While a majority of Israelis want the release of the remaining hostages to be the government’s priority, there is resistance from the right wing of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which wants the war to resume with the aim of obliterating Hamas.The hostages released by Hamas on Saturday included an Ethiopian-born Israeli and a Bedouin man, both with a history of mental illness, who had been held captive for a decade after they wandered into Gaza on foot.Avera Mengistu, aged 39, crossed a barbed wire fence on the Gaza beach in September 2014.“Our family has endured 10 years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today,” Mengistu’s family said in a statement.Hisham al-Sayed, 36, a Bedouin from the Negev desert, walked into Gaza from the east in April 2015 and was detained by Hamas.“Why were they holding someone like that who did nothing wrong? He’s a man of peace, a man who wanted to reach Gaza. He loves Gaza, he did not go there as an aggressor,” Sayed’s father, Shaaban, told Israeli public radio earlier in the week. “This was more painful for us than everything else.”Five of the hostages released on Saturday were handed over in ceremonies that Hamas has used for propaganda and that have been condemned as cruel and disrespectful by the Red Cross.View image in fullscreenOmer Shem Tov, a hostage held since the 7 October 2023 attack, kissed two Hamas militants on the head when he was released in Nuseirat.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersIn one ceremony, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside armed and masked Hamas fighters in front a large propaganda poster. An overjoyed Shem Tov kissed two militants on the head and blew kisses to the crowd assembled to watch the release.Under the terms of a ceasefire deal, Israel was supposed to free 602 Palestinians from its prisons, of which 445 had been captured in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of the war. They were due to be released inside Gaza. Of the remaining 157 Palestinians freed, some were due to be deported while others were transferred to the West Bank. Of them, 50 had been serving life sentences.The head of the Israeli prison service, Kobi Yakobi, has sought to use the exchanges to make political points. Palestinians freed in an exchange the previous week had been made to wear T-shirts with an Arabic inscription: “We will not forget and we will not forgive”.On Saturday, Yakobi prepared sweatshirts for the Palestinians being handed over that said: “I will pursue my enemies and overtake them, and I will not return until they are destroyed”, as well as bracelets inscribed: “The eternal people do not forget. I will pursue my enemies and overtake them.”The release of six Israelis yesterday brought to 25 the number of hostages freed by Hamas in the first phase of the ceasefire. They also handed over four bodies of hostages who had been killed during the conflict, and are due to hand over four more in the coming week.Among the bodies handed over on Thursday were those of two small boys from the same family, Ariel Bibas, four, and his brother Kfir, nine months old, who were kidnapped in the surprise Hamas attack on Israel’s western Negev region on 7 October 2023. The remains of their mother, Shiri Bibas, were also handed over, but only after the body of another woman, presumed to be a Palestinian, was transferred. Hamas claimed it was a mistake but it caused outrage in Israel.1:07Avera Mengistu's family celebrate his release by Hamas after more than a decade – videoThe US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has encouraged the parties to move forward to a second phase, which would involve the release of the remaining 60 or so hostages (at least half of whom are believed by Israeli authorities to be dead), as well as hundreds more Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and the complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.Donald Trump has however continued to offer Netanyahu support should he choose to go back to war, pointing to the incident involving Bibas’s body.“He is not torn. He wants to go in,” Trump told Fox News Radio on Friday. “He is just so angry at what happened yesterday and he should be.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warThe ObserverHamasGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Never in the previous 153 years of this fixture had Scotland managed five successive wins over the auld enemy and another tartan triumph really would have had them dancing in the streets of Galashiels in Bill MacLaren’s memory. This was a desperately tight old battle though, with a second gripping home victory in consecutiveSix Nationsgames only secured right at the death.In the end it all hinged on whether Finn Russell could land the angled conversion following Duhan van der Merwe’s 79th-minute try. Up went the ball, end over end, and for the first half of its flight it seemed Scotland might be celebrating once more. Agonisingly for the visitors, though, it then curved just wide of the left upright to leave a below-par English side, to their immense relief, still alive in the title race.Scotland’s Gregor Townsend questions England’s crucial penalty decisionRead moreIt was hard not to feel sympathy for Russell, whose side scored three tries to one and were much the better attacking side behind the scrum. Once again, though, England were able to hang tough when it mattered, a long raking last-quarter penalty from Fin Smith ultimately proving just enough to stem the tide of modern history. The middle weekend of the Six Nations championship is often a defining one and England will cling to this result as further evidence their fortunes are looking up.The old adage normally has it that forwards decide matches and backs determine by how much. It was very nearly disproved here. Scotland’s three-quarter line were a constant threat, dark blue predators throughout, showing exactly why they will probably supply a clutch of British & Irish Lions in Australia this summer.Ultimately though, England’s scramble defence and superior kicking off the tee proved the decisive factors, with Russell missing all three of his tricky conversion attempts. The fly-half’s preparations for this game were necessarily restricted following the heavy blow to the head he sustained against Ireland and, on another day, Scotland might also have had couple more tries as reward for their superior territory and possession stats.View image in fullscreenDuhan van der Merwe scores Scotland’s third try to take them within a point of England, only for Finn Russell to miss the conversion.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersFor all England’s pre-game bullishness, the recent history of this fixture should have forewarned them. One red rose win in the previous seven games between the teams could hardly be dismissed as a fluke and the hosts needed all the bench horsepower they could muster to allow Maro Itoje to hoist the famous old trophy and prevent another Gregor Townsend-inspired heist. England were the slightly fortunatebeneficiaries of French largesseearlier this month and this was another game that almost slipped away from them.It added up to another gripping example of why this has become one of the calendar’s most entertaining contests and another grand occasion in a season increasingly full of them. The sense of pre-game theatre and expectation remains among the Six Nations’ hardiest perennials and, temperature wise, it also felt less like winter and more like spring. Scotland, furthermore, had spent the build-up training in Spain and began as if they were participating in a summer sevens tournament. With England already back-pedalling, Van der Merwe surged past Ollie Lawrence’s tackle and fed Tom Jordan who rifled a sensational long inside pass to the supporting Ben White who scored with ease.England managed a swift response when Tommy Freeman, with advantage being played, crashed through Russell and Jordan to the referee’s satisfaction, with Marcus Smith’s conversion recapturing the advantage for his side. Scotland, though, were still looking confident with ball in hand and only a couple of small set piece errors temporarily spared England from further inconvenience.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman barrels over to score for England.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAIt was not a huge surprise, then, when Scotland conjured another ripper of a try. Kyle Rowe, roaming hungrily off his wing, fed Blair Kinghorn who set Van der Merwe free down the same left touchline. This time the man lurking on the inside was Huw Jones who smashed past Ollie Sleightholme to give the visitors further encouragement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe there is a psychological block they struggle to overcome in that fixture; the merest glimpse of a white shirt, however, and they come alive. Tactically they also have a keen sense of where England’s vulnerabilities might lie and their pace and incision in the wider channels frequently made life a nightmare for England’s overstretched defence.In Russell they also have a player who has learned not to overplay his hand. Only in the scrum did the home side enjoy consistent joy and, just before half-time, another set-piece penalty led to England’s most dangerous attacking surge of the opening 40 minutes. An excellent tackle from Van der Merwe stopped a speeding Marcus Smith from going all the way to the line but, with the try still crying out to be scored, Lawrence’s attempted “cat flap” offload to Sleightholme flew wastefully into touch.Quick GuideGalthié rings the changes for FranceShowFrance are seeking a reaction to their defeat by England as they look to reignite their Six Nations title push in Rome on Sunday. Fabien Galthié has responded to the 26-25 loss at Twickenham by making seven changes, including dropping the star wing Damian Penaud and the fly-half Matthieu Jalibert.Thomas Ramos shifts from full-back into the No 10 jersey and Galthié has sprung another surprise by naming a seven‑one split between forwards and backs on the bench.The wing Simone Gesi and the hooker Gianmarco Lucchesi are the new faces in Italy’s team as they look to follow up their victory over Wales. The hooker Giacomo Nicotera said: “We can’t say: ‘We’ve beaten Wales, that’s it.’ The objective is to beat a team that is better than Wales.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The loss of a dazed Tom Willis at the interval and Tom Curry, who suffered a dead leg, within seven minutes of the restart were further blows but surely England would prove more incisive in the second half regardless? Their kick-heavy diet was beginning to earn boos from their own supporters and presenting Scotland’s backs with loads of free ball was a plan with plenty of risk attached.A fine stop tackle by Fin Smith on Jordan, though, underlined the hosts’ continuing resilience and a 56th minute penalty from Marcus Smith drew them level towards the end of the third quarter. In similar circumstances against France they kicked impressively off the bend but this was a different kind of contest, against more focused opponents. Even at 16-10 up, with England finally looking safe, up popped Van der Merwe wide on the left to scare the living daylights out of them. This time, though, Russell could not quite nail down the coffin lid.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025The ObserverEngland rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The M48 has also been closed both ways between junction 1 and the M4, and links from M5 to the M4 are also shut.The closures, which are expected to cause significant delays in and out of Wales, are likely to remain in place until the early hours of Sunday morning, police said.The force said: “Enquiries are under way to identify the deceased and notify next of kin, while an investigation to establish how the person came to be on the motorway continues.“Police are keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along that stretch of the M4 and has any relevant information or dashcam footage.”The road closures start on the English side of the Prince of Wales Bridge and the Severn Bridge.Explore more on these topicsBristolRoad transportPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Of 98 cases concluded in the magistrates courts in England and Wales in the past six months, just three resulted in a deprivation order.In other cases involving digital devices, such as offences regarding indecent images of children, these orders were made consistently.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) this weekend said more must be done to “stop ­perpetrators retaining these images and continuing to take gratification from their crimes”.In one case earlier this month, a man was rebuked by magistrates for “thoroughly disgraceful” and “deeply disturbing” behaviour “designed to emotionally blackmail and control” his victim. The 35-year-old from Swansea was given a six-month suspended sentence, a rehabilitation order and a three-year restraining order – but no deprivation order, leaving the police with no legal power to retain and wipe his devices.In another case last October in Crawley, West Sussex, a 32-year-old man was jailed for 26 weeks after sharing private sexual photos of his ex-girlfriend. He was given a ­restraining order until 2029 – but no deprivation order.The findings point to a systemic failure of courts to impose the orders, and of prosecutors to request them in the first place.View image in fullscreenCampaigners said the failure to force deletion of intimate images shared without consent was leaving victims ‘living in fear’.Photograph: Microgen Images/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RFA spokesperson for the CPS said: “While courts already have the power to deprive convicted offenders of nonconsensual intimate images and videos, we accept there is more we can do.” It is reviewing its guidance for prosecutors. The Sentencing Council, which produces guidelines for magistrates and judges in England and Wales, will also consider whether updates are needed.Campaigners said the failure to force deletion in every case was ­leaving victims “living in fear” that the images could be shared again.Sophie Mortimer, who runs theRevenge Porn Helpline, said that even if there was no such threat, just ­knowing the perpetrator still had access to them was a “vile thought”.Mortimer said she also knew of cases where images obtained ­illicitly, such as through voyeurism, were not destroyed. One man who secretly recorded a woman was convicted and given a suspended sentence – only to be handed back devices containing the imagery afterwards.When the victim challenged the decision, police said they had no legal power to act because there was no court order. “They told her: ‘Our hands are tied,’” Mortimer said.She called for urgent changes to ensure content was destroyed in every case – from cloud storage, hard drives, and social media accounts, as well as physical devices. “The ­government says the courts already have powers to order this, but it’s pointless if it’s never used,” she said.Elena Michael, of the campaign group#NotYourPorn, said ­allowing perpetrators to keep images and devices sent the message that they were “untouchable”. “You’re ­handing back the weapon that caused the crime and rolling out the carpet for them to do it again,” she said.She said the group had worked with 450 victims and found there was “no consistent approach” to the issue. “Sometimes the police try really hard to hold on to devices or find a way of getting rid of ­content. But they’re in a situation where the law is not supporting them even if morally they know it’s right,” she added.A victim in a case where the ­perpetrator was not made to delete sexual videos said: “It makes my skin crawl to know that he could still be watching these, let alone uploading them on the internet again.”Emma Pickering, head of technology-facilitated abuse at the charity Refuge, said: “This critical loophole needs to be urgently addressed.”TheObserver’s analysis looked at cases of sharing or threatening to share intimate photos of a ­person without consent that have been heard in the magistrates courts since August 2024, using records from the Courtsdesk database of hearings in England and Wales.It also looked at people convicted in the past six months of an earlier version of the offence: “disclosing or threatening to disclose private sexual photos with intent to cause distress”.Of about 600 defendants who appeared before magistrates charged with the crimes, many were awaiting further hearings. The cases considered most serious were referred to the crown court for trial or sentencing.For the defendants who were sentenced by magistrates, punishments varied widely. They ranged from 50 to 250 hours of unpaid work, rehabilitation orders requiring them to attend “building better relationships” courses, fines of between £100 and £450, and suspended or immediate custodial sentences.Of the 98 defendants, 54 were also given restraining orders lasting from one to five years that, in 17 cases, explicitly prohibited posting about their victims online. The three cases where ­prosecutors did request deprivation orders included one in December in Bromley, southeast London, where ­magistrates ordered a 27-year-old man be “deprived of the photographs used in the course of the offence”. He was also given an eight-week suspended sentence and a five-year restraining order.In another case in September, Hull magistrates jailed a man for 22 weeks and ordered that his phone be destroyed. In both cases the men had also been convicted of a further offence – harassment – as well as the intimate image crime.In a third case, court records show prosecutors requested a deprivation order from Chester magistrates for a man convicted of sharing intimate photos. He was also given a 12-month suspended sentence and 200 hours of unpaid work in October. It is not clear whether the order was made.The inconsistencies are revealed as the government prepares to introduce its new crime and policing bill to parliament, which seeks to tighten the law on sharing intimate images without consent.Charlotte Owen, a Conservative peer, said she was “appalled” that content was being destroyed in so few cases. “No one should have to suffer from the ongoing trauma of knowing their abuser still owns intimate images of them,” she said.Lady Owen previouslyintroduced a private member’s billthat included a line on forced deletion of imagery, “including physical copies and those held on any device, cloud-based ­program, or digital or messaging ­platform they control”.The government responded that there was already provision under the Sentencing Act 2020 for courts to deprive offenders of their rights to any property linked to the crime. TheObserver’sfindings show the power is not consistently being used.Owen subsequently requested amendments to her data bill, suggesting the creation of a code of practice for the courts.On 28 January, the government responded that it would be “constitutionally inappropriate” to do so but that the Sentencing Council was conducting a review.The Sentencing Council told theObserverit was monitoring the government’s plans for new intimate image legislation and would look at “what new guidelines or changes are required” when that came into force.Owen said clear guidance was “urgently needed” for both the ­judiciary and prosecutors. It does not currently advise the use of deprivation orders in intimate image abuse cases. For other offences, such as those involving indecent images of children, prosecutors are told they should always request forfeiture and take a “robust approach” requiring “complete hard drives of any device”.Online forums being used to trade explicit images of local women, says charityRead moreClare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University and an expert in image-based abuse, said it was a “real injustice” that deprivation orders were not routinely being made.She said changes were also needed to protect the thousands of victims who “don’t want to go down the criminal route”, to enable them to request orders for the deletion of explicit images without going through a criminal process. “The law currently is failing to deal with these issues,” she said.The Revenge Porn Helpline and #NotYourPorn are also calling for content linked to intimate image abuse to be made illegal, such as indecent images of children and terrorist content, to make it easier to require internet providers to block or remove it.The act of sharing or threatening to share content without consent is illegal, but the content itself is not, even if it was used in a criminal offence.They also want all images used in offences to be given unique digital identifiers – known as hashing – to make it easier to detect if someone tries to upload them again, and say the police response must improve to ensure devices are seized promptly, before suspects can delete evidence.Data obtained by Refuge showsonly about 4%of intimate image abuse cases reported to police currently result in the perpetrator being charged. The Revenge Porn Helpline has dealt with 60,000 casessince it was founded 10 years ago, with reports rising on average 57% each year.The Ministry of Justice declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseThe ObserverViolence against women and girlsCrimeInternetSocial mediaChild protectionPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

The group had been ousted from power in 1979.Muo Lisa and her cousin, Thum Yen, lived in neighbouring homes in the remote village of Kranhuong. Their parents were doing farm work when the two toddlers apparently came across the unexploded ordnance and it detonated.Old unexploded munitions are especially dangerous because their explosive contents become volatile as they deteriorate.“Their parents went to settle on land that was a former battlefield, and they were not aware that there were any land mines or unexploded ordnance buried near their homes,” said Heng Ratana, the director general of Cambodian Mine Action Center, which determined it was a rocket-propelled grenade after analysing the fragments. “It’s a pity because they were too young and they should not have died like this.”An estimated 4m-6m land mines and other unexploded munitions were littered in Cambodia’s countryside during decades of conflict that began in 1970 and ended in 1998.Since the end of the fighting in Cambodia, nearly 20,000 people have been killed and about 45,000 injured by leftover war explosives. The number of casualties has declined over time; last year there were 49 deaths.“The war is completely over and there is fully peace for more than 25 years, but the blood of the Khmer (Cambodian) people continues to flow because of the remnants of land mines and ammunition,” Ratana said on his Facebook page.Cambodian deminers are among the world’s most experienced, and several thousand have been sent in the past decade under UN auspices to work in Africa and the Middle East.Cambodia’s demining efforts drew attention earlier this month, when US financial assistance for it in eight provinces was suspended due to president Donald Trump’s 90-day freeze on foreign assistance.Heng Ratana said on Thursday he had been informed that Washington had issued a waiver allowing the aid – $6.36m covering March 2022 to November 2025 – to resume flowing.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, has been put in alternative accommodation while police carry out their inquiries.Clive was last seen alive in the Coronation Street area shortly after 11pm. A man matching Clive’s description was last seen in the early hours of the following morning near the banks of the River Tyne.Det Insp Mark Atherton said: “We are doing everything we can to provide Scott’s family with the answers they deserve.“Upon receiving new information, we have taken the decision to arrest two men and a woman in relation to Scott’s disappearance. They remain in custody while our inquiries are ongoing. However, we still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community.“I am again urging anybody who lived on Coronation Street at the time of his disappearance, or has information about Scott’s movements that night, to come forward. The information you have could prove key in our investigations.”Police said they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to witnesses since they launched their investigation more than 20 years ago.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a significant risk that, through this dynamic, coercion will play a part in some cases of assisted dying.”Ofer said the CWJ was concerned that some medical doctors and psychiatrists did not have the skills or training to identify coercive control and said that the involvement of psychologists or other relevant professionals with specialist knowledge was needed.Coercive control is a form of domestic abuse defined by Women’s Aid as an act, or pattern of acts, of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse used to harm, punish or frighten a victim. It became a specific criminal offence in England and Wales in 2015 but experts say it can be difficult for non-specialists to recognise.In recent years, campaigners have called for abusers to be convicted of manslaughter in cases where their victims have gone on to take their own lives. In 2024, Ryan Wellings was charged with manslaughter after his partner, Kiena Dawes, wrote “[he] killed me” in a note found after her suicide. Wellings wasfound guiltyof assault and controlling behaviour in January but cleared of manslaughter. An2023 inquestruled the death by suicide of Kellie Sutton in 2017 was an “unlawful killing”, following her partner’s conviction for coercive and controlling behaviour.Prof Jane Monckton-Smith, a leading expert on domestic homicide, said she had “grave concerns” about the assisted dying bill and that it needed “significant consideration and mention of coercive and controlling behaviour and domestic abuse, and its potential impact on victim decision-making”.Monckton-Smith warned that perpetrators who kill their victims sometimes “stage” their deaths as suicides. “Assisted dying could be coerced suicide, or it could be a staged suicide,” she said. “Both are highly likely in domestic abuse.”She added: “Any professionals, medical, legal or otherwise, assessing someone who has made a request to die should have specialist training in coercive control and domestic abuse … and there should be guidance for professionals in making sure there is no domestic abuse or coercive control in that victim’s life.”View image in fullscreenCampaigners supporting the assisted dying bill outside Parliament.Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty ImagesCherryl Henry-Leach, CEO of Standing Together Against Domestic Abuse, told theObserverher organisation was worried the legislation could be “misused as a tool for femicide”.Henry-Leach said: “Domestic abuse often escalates when a victim becomes ill, disabled, or vulnerable, and abusers exploit this dependence to manipulate and control their victims. The assisted dying bill does not adequately address how these dynamics could intersect with end-of-life decisions, leaving vulnerable individuals at risk of being coerced into ending their lives.”Coercive control to be put on par with other types of domestic abuse in England and WalesRead moreHenry-Leach said the bill should include a clearer definition of coercion, mandated domestic abuse training for professionals, and specialist domestic abuse screening as part of the assessment process.“We must ensure dignity in death is upheld by implementing safeguards in this bill to prevent any potential misuse as a tool for coercive control, exploitation, or harm,” she said.Kim Leadbeater said: “I take very seriously the thoughts of organisations who work with domestic abuse victims and welcome their contributions to this important debate.“Under the status quo, terminally ill people, including women, are taking matters into their own hands; taking their own lives at home or travelling overseas. Right now we cannot know whether these people have made an entirely voluntary decision, free from coercion, and in full knowledge of all options open to them.“Overseas evidence shows that upfront safeguards to detect and prevent potential coercion, such as those included in the bill, work.I have listened to experts and drawn from best practice to propose amendmentswhich include an explicit role for social workers in the process and a requirement for assessing doctors to receive bespoke training in detecting coercion and pressure.“I remain absolutely committed to ensuring the right protections are in the bill, and am continuing to meet with stakeholder groups to discuss their thoughts. The bill would introduce much-needed legal clarity and front-loaded protections, provide meaningful, upfront scrutiny of decisions, as well as true choice for terminally ill people who want and need it as they die.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingThe ObserverDomestic violenceMarital coercionWomenViolence against women and girlsDeath and dyingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But to find a second is the stuff of dreams.Last week British archaeologist Piers Litherland announced the find of the century – the firstdiscovery of a rock-cut pharaoh’s tomb in Egypt since Tutankhamun’s in 1922.His team found the pharaoh Thutmose II’s tomb underneath a waterfall in the Theban mountains in Luxor, about 3km west of the Valley of the Kings. It contained almost nothing but debris, and the team believe it was flooded and emptied within six years of the pharaoh’s death in 1479BC.Now Litherland has told theObserverhe believes he has identified the location of a second tomb belonging to Thutmose II. And this one, he suspects, will contain the young pharaoh’s mummified body and grave goods.Archeologists believe this second tomb has been hiding in plain sight for 3,500 years, secretly buried beneath 23 metres of limestone flakes, rubble, ash and mud plaster and made to look like part of the mountain.“There are 23 metres of a pile of man-made layers sitting above a point in the landscape where we believe – and we have other confirmatory evidence – there is a monument concealed beneath,” he said. “The best candidate for what is hidden underneath this enormously expensive, in terms of effort, pile is the second tomb of Thutmose II.”While searching close to the first tomb for clues about where its contents were taken after the flood, Litherland found a posthumous inscription buried in a pit with a cow sacrifice. This inscription indicates the contents may have been moved by the king’s wife and half-sister Hatshepsut – one of Egypt’s greatest pharaohs and one of the few women to rule in her own right – to an as-yet undiscovered second tomb nearby.View image in fullscreenThe Valley of the Kings in Luxor, Egypt, near where Thutmose II’s tomb was found.Photograph: Image by Ramesh Thadani/Getty ImagesLast week the New Kingdom Research Foundation, a British independent academic body, and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities revealed that a project led by Litherland had found the first tomb in 2022, after more than a decade of work.For about a year, he and his team of Egyptian archaeologists – “discoveries like this are not made by individuals”, he says – have been investigating ways to get access to the second tomb by excavating the 3,500-year-old human-made layers of rock and plaster that surround it.At the top of layers of thick limestone plaster, limestone flakes “the size of a dining room table”, tufa (a flaky limestone which forms a cement) and rubble, is a layer of mud plaster with ash on top, Litherland said. “Among that ash, we found the remains of beer jars and chisel ends used by workmen who made tombs. So there’s no doubt these layers are man-made.”At that point, any tomb underneath the layers would have been well covered. But a further step was taken “and that is what is slowing everything down” on the dig, said Litherland. The ancient Egyptians then “levered away large portions of the cliff and made them come crashing down on top”. These large rocks – some of which are the size of a car – were then “cemented in place using limestone plaster”.Now Litherland’s team is trying to detach those rocks and the limestone plaster by hand: “We’ve tried to tunnel into it, we’ve tried to shave away the sides, but there are overhanging rocks, so it’s too dangerous,” Litherland said.He, his foreman, Mohamed Sayed Ahmed, and his archeological director, Mohsen Kamel, took the difficult decision to remove the entire structure – which stands out from the cliff – three weeks ago, and are about halfway there. “We should be able to take the whole thing down in about another month,” Litherland said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By covering the tomb with layers of plaster and limestone flakes, Ineni protected it from water while simultaneously sealing and concealing the site from robbers. “Ineni says in his biographies that he did a lot of clever things to hide the locations of tombs, including covering the tombs with layers of mud plaster, which he says has never been done before. This has not been remarked on ever, to my knowledge.”It is a strategy that appears to have worked. While grave goods from the ransacked tombs of pharaohs from the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties are commonplace in museums, “there are no burial goods of any sort relating to the burial of Thutmose II in any museum or private collection”, Litherland said.The body of a 30-year-old, found in 1881 in Deir el-Bahari and previously identified as Thutmose II, is too old to belong to the pharaoh, Litherland said. “He is described in Ineni’s biography as coming to the throne ‘the falcon in the nest’ – so he was a young boy.” Some Egyptologists believe he reigned for just three to four years and died shortly after fathering Thutmose III.For Litherland, who became fascinated with ancient Egypt as a young boy, the thought of finding Thutmose II’s final resting place is breathtaking. “You dream about such things. But like winning the lottery, you never believe it will happen to you.”View image in fullscreenArtefacts found during excavations that discovered the tomb of Thutmose II.Photograph: Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsEgyptologyThe ObserverEgyptTutankhamunMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaArchaeologyHistorynewsShareReuse this content"

Appealing to the silent majority and the far right is no easy task.This may come as a shock to ­anyone who is not a regularGB Newsviewer but the channel has a similar dilemma. It wants to be a home for the whole right rather than its more extreme fringes, but the stream of comments underneath its videos is a good place to find some of the wilder theories about the war in Ukraine, which occasionally make it on air.Clare Muldoon, a commentator who only seems to commentate on GB News, said last weekend that the war was “a complete sham” and claimed Zelenskyy wanted fighting to continue. “He can still get this money – goodness knows what he’s doing with it,” she said.Muldoon was challenged but it gave commenters beneath the video a fresh chance to recycle points often made on Russian TV channels, or by people such as Calvin Robinson – the priest defrocked by both GB News andthe Anglican Catholic church– and by Trump.Farage too. Last year, he claimedin a BBC interviewthat Russia had been provoked by Nato’s ­eastward ­expansion and explained to ­interviewer Nick Robinson that in 2014 he had only said he “admired Putin as a political operator” for ­taking control of Russia and insisted he disliked him as a person.View image in fullscreenUS president Donald Trump called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ‘dictator’ last week on his social media platform.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesWhile Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch and Ed Davey all swiftly condemned Trump’s comments last week, Farage took a little longer to find his voice.Eventually, the Reform leader put in an appearance, explaining in an interview on GB News he had been on a plane to Washington for the Conservative Political Action Conference so, unlike every other party leader, he had not been able to comment on Trump’s accusation that Zelenskyy was “a dictator”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he is a loyal envoy brokering the Gaza ceasefire and peace talks on UkraineJulian Borgerin JerusalemSat 22 Feb 2025 12.50 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 12.52 ESTShareWith the first phase of the ceasefire nearing its end, an American property developer has emerged as a key figure in determining whetherGazaattains a more enduring peace or slips back into war.Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s typically idiosyncratic pick as special Middle East envoy, has also found his way into the midst oftalks with Russiaover Ukraine’s future, sitting opposite Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, instead of the official special envoy for the region, Keith Kellogg.On both portfolios, Witkoff is technically outranked by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, but every national capital knows by now that in Trump’s world, power flows through personal connection to the president. Rubio is a former bitter rival turned loyalist, brought into the administration for expediency’s sake. Witkoff and Trump go back nearly 40 years.That is what gives the 67-year-old businessman his clout. America’s interlocutors know he is the genial emissary of a volatile leader capable of swinging from fulsome support to public vituperation in a heartbeat, depending in large part on who has Trump’s ear.Witkoff demonstrated his influence in getting the ceasefire off the ground. On 10 January, Witkoff believed a breakthrough was close, after more than seven months of meandering, inconsequential talks. That Friday evening, he called Benjamin Netanyahu’s office from Doha, where he had been meeting Arab officials, and told the prime minister’s aides that he would be flying to Israel the next day. The aides explained that it would be Saturday and Netanyahu did not do business on the Sabbath, but would gladly meet the American envoy a few hours later, once night had fallen. Witkoffwas having none of itand, according to anaccount inHaaretznewspaper, told them “in salty English that Shabbat was of no interest to him”.View image in fullscreenThe friendship between Donald Trump and Steve Witkoff goes back decades.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APThe Israeli leader abandoned his Sabbath observance and received Witkoff in his office, where the envoy told him to agree to the ceasefire he had been ducking for so long.“The president has been a great friend of Israel,” Witkoff told Netanyahu, according to theWall Street Journal, “and now it’s time to be a friend back.”Netanyahu folded immediately, allowing Witkoff to return to Doha to finalise the deal. The prime minister knew the American envoy was speaking for the president, whom he dared not anger.The bond of trust between Trump and Witkoff dates back to a chance encounter and a ham and cheese sandwich in a New York deli nearly four decades ago.Witkoff was born in the Bronx and raised on Long Island, the son of a women’s coat manufacturer. He qualified as a lawyer, and was working on an all-night property deal in 1986 in which Trump was involved.Witkoff had gone to the deli at 3am to get food for his team and Trump was there, hungry but without any cash in his pocket.“I ordered him a ham and Swiss,”Witkoff told a court in 2023, when he was testifying on his friend’s behalf in Trump’s trial for fraud. He did not run into Trump for another eight years, but the tycoon had remembered “the sandwich incident”, and a friendship grew.Trump persuaded Witkoff to graduate from property law to become a developer. Both men moved between New York and Florida, playing prodigious amounts of golf. Witkoff was with Trump on the latter’s West Palm Beach golf course in September, when a would-be assassin was arrested armed with a sniper rifle.Witkoff has also spoken emotionally about the solace he found talking to Trump when one of his sons, Andrew, died from an opioid overdose in 2011.Everybody is buying into this notion that releasing hostages is a good thing. It just is something that ought to happenSteve WitkoffTheir long history has instilled a fierce personal loyalty in Witkoff, and in return he is treated almost as family by the president. It is a friendship that predates Trump’s embrace of Christian nationalism and the far right, so Witkoff does not bring the same ideological baggage to his diplomacy as other acolytes. His fealty is to Trump personally, not to Maga.His mostly pleasant and polite manner also stands out in the Trump crowd. Don Peebles, another developer who knows both men well,told theJournalthat Witkoff is “not the kind of negotiator that wants to see blood on the floor before getting the deal done”.After the primary race was over last year, Trump dispatched Witkoff to make peace with his defeated Republican rivals. And Witkoff worked on the Gaza ceasefire with his Biden administration counterpart, Brett McGurk, during the transition in a rare example of bipartisan cooperation.“Brett McGurk was great for the Biden administration,” he recalled. “We worked collaboratively. We were able to convince people that a hostage release was a good thing.”He credits Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, with persuading him to take on the role of Middle East envoy, a job Kushner performed informally for the first Trump administration.Kushner, another property developer, claimed the job on the basis of his business connections with the Gulf monarchies, but Witkoff, a far warmer personality than his slightly robotic predecessor, has also developed relationships lower down the social scale, particularly with the hostages’ families.“I have a lot of empathy because I lost a child,” he said. “So I talk to these families who have lost children and they want their children’s bodies back as much as the families who have children who are alive.”Witkoff’s focus on the remaining 58 hostages (of which Israeli authorities believe 34 to be already dead) aligns him with majority Israeli opinion in seeking agreement on the second phase of the ceasefire, but on a collision course with Netanyahu and the far right.The next phase will involve the release of many more Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli prisons and the complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip. It would be a substantial step towards a lasting peace, which is why Netanyahu is set against it. The right wing of his coalition, which opposed the ceasefire in the first place, threatens to walk out if it moves forward to a second phase without Hamas first being obliterated and the strip opened up to Jewish settlement.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff, left, in talks with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, right, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/APWitkoff has been publicly insistent that the second phase must get under way, putting the priority of securing the release of the last hostages above anything else. “I think phase two is more difficult,” he said at a conference in Miami on Thursday. But he added: “Everybody is buying into this notion that releasing hostages is just a good thing. It just is something that’s important and ought to happen.”At the conference, organised by a Riyadh-based charitable institute, Witkoff said it was his contacts among the Saudi royals who got him involved in Russian talks.He explained it was the Saudis who “engineered” the release of an American prisoner held by Moscow, through their contacts to Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund.“They felt that there could be a compelling meeting in Russia that might lead to therelease of Marc Fogel,” Witkoff said. “We got off the plane, not sure it was going to happen, but it did.”Fogel’s release on 12 February gave Trump an early public relations win, and was enough of a sweetener from Vladimir Putin, to secure a phone call with the new US president the same day that began US-Russian talks aboutUkraine, in the absence of Ukrainian representation.Witkoff’s role cemented his standing in Trump’s mind as someone who could get results, leading to his current status as America’s chief troubleshooter. However, enduring peace in Ukraine and the Middle East will ultimately revolve around issues of justice and national sovereignty, terms which Witkoff avoids.When he went to see the devastation in Gaza for himself at the end of January, he said he could not imagine why any Palestinian would want to stay there. The coming weeks may not just test his sway as a Trump emissary, but also the limits of the real estate approach to diplomacy.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsThe ObserverGazaBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUkraineDonald TrumpprofilesShareReuse this content"

Raped,” they replied.“I couldn’t think they were talking about me. It’s like cancer, you think it only happens to other people,” she said. “And how could I have forgotten that?”Faced with the blank in Marie’s memory, the police showed her handwritten notes in Le Scouarnec’s “black books” from 1996, when she was 10 years old and he removed her appendix.“There was my family name, my first name, age, the address of my parents, everything he did and how he felt. It was disgusting. The word ‘raped’ was hard enough, but here were these obscene phrases of what happened.”Le Scouarnec, now 74, will appear in court on Mondayaccused of the rape or sexual abuse of 299 patients – 158 male and 141 female and the majority under the age of 15 – while they were under anaesthetic or recovering from operations between 1989 and 2014. The average age of his alleged victims was 11.The surgeon, who entitled one document “my paedophile letters”, denies penetration with his penis. Under French law, rape is an act of sexual penetration by any body part or object.During the four-month trial, local health and hospital authorities will also face difficult questions over why the surgeon, employed in a dozen public and private medical establishments across Brittany and westernFrance, was allowed to continue practising for almost a decade after a conviction for accessing online child abuse images.“There was an omertà. People knew but said nothing. If there hadn’t been this silence, then he’d have been banned from seeing children in 2004 and there would have been far fewer victims,” Mauricette Vinet, whose grandson Mathis was one of Le Scouarnec’s patients, told theObserver.View image in fullscreenRoland and Mauricette Vinet hold a photo of their grandson Mathis.Photograph: Manuel Ausloos/ReutersMathis was 10 when he was admitted to hospital with appendicitis in June 2007. In 2019 he also received a visit from the police who told him what they had found in Le Scouarnec’s notebooks. Two years later, aged 24, he died of an overdose.Mauricette and her husband, Roland Vinet, believe the alleged abuse was the deep-rooted cause of their grandson’s chaotic life and drug addiction. “When the police told him what they knew, it was hell for him. The sky fell on his head,” she said. “We tried to support him, but he refused to talk about it. It killed him.”The trial comes as France is still reeling from theMazan hearinglast autumn that saw 51 men convicted of raping or sexually assaulting Gisèle Pelicot, including her husband, Dominique, who had drugged her and invited strangers to abuse her.Francesca Satta, the lawyer representing Marie, the Vinet family and other alleged victims, has described Le Scouarnec as “extremely perverse” and a “monster” who used his workplace as a “hunting ground”. Satta believes there could be as many as 400 victims. At least 12 cases were dropped because the allegations were out of time for prosecution.Satta said the investigation had opened a “Pandora’s box” for those treated by Le Scouarnec, most of whom are today in their 30s and 40s and only now learning about the alleged abuse. It was not they who went to the police, but the police who came to them. “It has caused real distress. Many of the victims were five to 10 years old at the time, many were anaesthetised and incapable of knowing what happened. Most had absolutely no idea. In any case, they were children who wouldn’t have recognised the difference between a medical act and sexual abuse. And he was a doctor. They and their parents trusted him,” Satta said.The children may not recall what happened to them, but Le Scouarnec’s meticulously handwritten notes will form the basis of the prosecution’s case. Stéphane Kellenberger, the Lorient public prosecutor, said: “At the time, the victims were asleep and sedated. They were not in a position to perceive the facts or to report them. I also note that Mr Le Scouarnec emphasised the stealth of his actions and the strategies he used to conceal them.”Amélie Lévêque, 43, only ­discovered she featured in Le Scouarnec’s notebooks after reading an article in her local newspaper about the surgeon in 2019 and contacting her GP, who checked her medical records and discovered he had removed her appendix in 1991. During a consultation with a psychotherapist, she said the suppressed memories resurfaced. “In a few seconds, I was back to being nine years old again in the recovery room at the clinic. Everything came back: the feelings, the smells, the cold, the heat, the rape. All of it,” Lévêque toldLa Montagnenewspaper.View image in fullscreen‘Everything came back – the feelings, the smells, the cold, the heat, the rape.

In 1994, he was hired by the private Sacré-Coeur clinic at Vannes in Brittany. For 10 years, the surgeon, specialising in digestive surgery, worked at a dozen hospital across the west of France. In 2004 he moved to the public hospital at Lorient and then Quimperlé.That year FBI agents investigating an international network circulating child sexual abuse images alerted French intelligence services that Le Scouarnec’s bank card had been used to access a dark web Russian child sexual abuse site. He was arrested, convicted for possession of child sexual abuse images in 2005 and given a four-month suspended sentence. His employers were alerted but, facing a shortage of surgeons and recruitment difficulties, did not suspend him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ministry of health was informed, but no action was taken. In 2008, Le Scouarnec was hired by the Jonzac hospital in the Charente-Maritime where he informed the director of his previous conviction. Again, no action was taken and he continued to practise.Frédéric Benoist, lawyer for the child protection association La Voix de l’Enfant (Child’s Voice), a civil party in the case, told theObserverthere had been a “chain of structural failures” in the country’s justice and health systems that had allowed Le Scouarnec to continue.When the surgeon was convicted in 2005 for accessing child abuse images the court failed to order him to undergo psychological treatment and the health authorities failed to understand the seriousness of his crime. “If these institutions had acted properly, they could have stopped Le Scouarnec long before. But each professional at the heart of these institutions, be they legal or medical, did nothing and because of their inaction he was able to continue for 30 years,” Benoist said.The extent of France’s latest sexual scandal has raised the question of why those aware of Le Scouarnec’s paedophile conviction and alleged abuse – including members of his own family and colleagues – either failed to speak out or were ignored when they voiced concerns.The scale of Le Scouarnec’s alleged abuse was uncovered in April 2017 when his neighbour’s six-year-old daughter told her parents “the man with a crown of white hair” had exposed himself and sexually touched her through a broken garden fence.View image in fullscreenJérôme and Laura Loiseau, the parents of the little girl who Le Scouarnec abused while he was their neighbour.Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty ImagesThey went to police who, a week later, searched his home and found hard disks containing more than 300,000 photos and videos featuring child sexual abuse under a mattress, as well as notebooks recording details of the alleged abuse of child patients. Officers also discovered a collection of dolls, some life-sized, under the floorboards.In one note, Le Scouarnec is alleged to have written: “I am a paedophile and I always will be.”In December 2020, Le Scouarnec was sentenced to 15 years for the sexual abuse of four girls: his six-year-old neighbour, a four-year-old patient and two of his own nieces, who were just four years old when the abuse started.At the time of this conviction, police were already investigating the further 299 counts of alleged rape and sexual abuse on young patients to be heard during the trial opening this week .Le Scouarnec’s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told French journalists: “He is waiting to be judged, to express himself, to say what he has to say to each of his victims. From the beginning he’s been ready to confront reality, to accept his responsibility.”In his bookPiégés(Trapped), the journalist Hugo Lemonier trawled Le Scouarnec’s notebooks, linking entries to victims’ statements to police. Lemonier also spoke to the surgeon’s colleagues and victims.In 70% of cases, the surgeon acted in the morning, during a visit to the rooms; some acts were carried out under the pretext of medical examinations; others, a minority, in the operating theatre when patients were unconscious. Most had no memory of the abuse, Lemonier found.“They were often alone at the time of the visit, a few instants were enough. There were no obstacles, nobody asked him any questions,” Lemonier writes, adding that Le Scouarnec’s profession made him “untouchable”. “Nobody was able to stop him because nobody imagined he was a predator.”The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

That old adage, “dance like no one’s watching” – if someone is filming you on their phone, you’re always going to feel a bit inhibited if you are worried you might end up on their Instagram.The ironic thing is, I started putting a sign up on the screens saying, “Please put your phones away. Let’s enjoy the moment” – and then I looked on Instagram and everyone’s filmed it!To anybody who’s thinking of coming along, take one little clip if you want to have a memory of that night or show off to your mates that you were there, then put the phone in your pocket. Live a little. Do the sort of things that you don’t want to see on Instagram.Have you ever had a cringe-worthy run-in with a celebrity?Oh, many! My most memorable one was Dave Berry. I got totally starstruck and I was quite drunk as well. He was ever so polite. I just made a fool of myself. It was when I was the bee’s knees and he did a private show at The Astoria in London, which is a really small venue. I was sitting next to Mick Jagger and Pete Townshend and all his old mates. At the afterparty, obviously he wanted to talk to his old mates, not this drunk idiot. I went, “I’m Fatboy Slim” and he went, “Yeah, I know”. He was very polite, but I walked away with my tail between my legs.View image in fullscreenFatboy Slim at the Creamfields festival in the UK in 1998.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesWhat’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. That one just stuck. If people ask me for life advice, that’s what I give.

He took me aside and he said, “I know you’re drinking. Pound for pound, look at what winos drink – because pound for pound, that’s what gets you drunk the most. So, sherry.” Which was very wise, but not very poetic. I didn’t end up drinking sherry for the rest of my life. Bless my dear old dad for trying.If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it?There are quite a few sandwiches with my name actually, with a name like Fatboy. It’s more burgers than sandwiches, really. But the Norman Cook would be a take on a pastrami reuben with a phenomenal amount of cheese. And then probably some more cheese on the top of the bread. I firmly believe you can’t have too much cheese on a sandwich.Do you have something that you’re secretly really good at?I’m very good at labelling things. Before I got sober, a lot of my life was quite chaotic and so in a semblance of trying to keep some order in my life, I would label everything with a label maker, which I have at my side.[Holds it up]This the don of label makers. I label pretty much everything in my house. The only thing is that it’s not very secret because everyone who comes to my house can go to the fridge and see the cheese shelf and the milk shelf. Woe betide anyone who puts anything in the wrong place. But that is OCD, not actual talent.Do you have a nemesis?For a while, Moby. We crossed swords a few times and then it turned into a feud. Now, I’m kind of an easygoing person. I don’t really get into beefs. But we fell out and we were on each other at that point. We were quite similar in what we were doing and I think that’s one of the reasons why we got into the feud. There were also a couple of potential nemeses, but I had them disposed of.What’s been your most memorable interaction with a fan?There was a girl in Romania who held up a proper, screenprinted sign saying, “Sign my boob, I’ll get it tattooed”. It was so beautifully done. I saw her and laughed, but then she came backstage. It was really bizarre, because she didn’t speak a word of English. Of course, I obliged and she sent me a photo of it afterwards. She gave me the sign, which I now have framed in my house.I also have had very beautiful ones. I’ve done about six or seven wedding proposals, where people have got in touch ahead of a show – we put it up on the screen and get the camera on them. Those really touch me. They also tend to invite me to the wedding. It actually happened in Australia. Last week in Bali, I bumped into somebody who got engaged at my show two years ago in Perth. They’re now married and I feel like I’ve got a connection with them. But they didn’t read the small print – if they have children, they have to call their first-born Norman.The Fatboy Slim Loves Australia tour is heading to Langley Park, WA, on 14 March; Centennial Vineyards, NSW, on 15 March; Peter Lehmann Wines, SA, on 21 March; Mt Duneed Estate, Victoria, on 22 March; and Sirromet Wines, Queensland, on 23 March.

If I didn’t, the hate would eat away at me’: Esther Ghey on life after the murder of her daughter BriannaSimon HattenstoneTransgender teenager Brianna Ghey was stabbed to death by two 15-year-olds. The killers had been radicalised on the dark web, while the victim was trapped in an online world of her own. Now her mother has become friends with the parent of one of the murderersSat 22 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareThe first thing I notice about Esther Ghey is a blossom tree trailing down her left arm to her hand. There is one pink flower on the tattoo. Pink was her daughter Brianna’s favourite colour. If Brianna had got her way, the whole world would have been pink. And just after she wasmurdered by two teenage schoolchildrenin February 2023, Ghey says, the world did briefly turn pink. The local blossom trees filled with the blossomiest blossom she had ever seen. “It really felt she was with us and that she was sending us a sign she was OK,” she says.Now Ghey has written a book, Under a Pink Sky. It’s a memoir of her and Brianna’s lives, and a manifesto of sorts; a shocking exploration of how deadly smartphones and online spaces can be. It’s also one of the most unflinching, inspirational autobiographies I’ve read, a remarkable cry of hope from the depths of despair.Brianna, a transgender girl of 16, was groomed by another teenage girl, who was desperate to kill. It could have been anybody; she just wanted the experience of cold-blooded murder. But the girl became obsessed with Brianna – partly because she was trans. The girl and her male friend lured Brianna out with the promise of taking cocaine, which Brianna had never tried, then stabbed her multiple times. In Under a Pink Sky, Ghey doesn’t mention the killers by name, so I won’t. But she does name the mother of the girl, for a good reason. They have become friends.Ghey emerged from the horror of Brianna’s murder as a hero. She appeared on television and talked movingly about the need for forgiveness. This young mother from Warrington, still only in her late 30s and going through the worst of the worst, came across as extraordinarily together. But the truth, for much of her life, couldn’t have been more different. As a young woman, Ghey was a drug-addled wreck who struggled so much as a mum that her own mother called social services because she was worried for her daughter and her two young grandchildren.We meet in a hotel in Warrington, close to where she lives. Her warmth shines through immediately. As does the trauma. It’s the first lengthy interview she’s given about the book, and she warns me she’s going to find it tough. She apologises for her tears in advance.In a way, Under a Pink Sky is the story of two troubled kids – only one of whom survived to tell their story. Ghey says there are so many parallels between her early life and Brianna’s. As a teenager, Esther Ghey was caught in a web of self-loathing. She had body dysmorphia, was desperate to be thinner, and told herself that nobody would ever love her the way she was. At times she was bullied; sometimes she picked on other children. Then she found drugs. She left school at 16 with no qualifications. “I had no self-worth because of that. I had no respect for myself, no respect for my body, no respect for my life, and that is such a sad, tragic, horrific place to be.”Brianna would go on to struggle with many of the same things: self-belief, school attendance, bullying. And while she was never hooked on drugs, Brianna was addicted to her smartphone and social media.View image in fullscreenBrianna Ghey: ‘She was so goofy and funny.’Photograph: courtesy of Esther GheyBy the age of 20, Ghey was a single parent to two young children. She managed to get a house, hoped to make it a “safe haven” for her and her children, and failed miserably. She remembers buying a load of teal paint and telling herself she was going to make her home perfect. “It turned out to be one of the worst times of my life. I beat myself up about it a lot because I had become addicted to drugs and my house never got finished. That teal paint just turned into sludge.”How serious was her drug problem? “It was a really serious addiction. I hit rock bottom.” What was her drug of choice? “Amphetamines. Yeah.” She pauses. “And everything I could get my hands on, really. My life was absolute turmoil. A mess. People might look at me and think, ‘She’s got her head screwed on’, but it’s not always been like that.”Then her mother, a teacher and foster carer at the time, called social services. “My mum helped as much as possible, but she had five foster children and felt completely helpless. Fortunately for me, social services came in and we had all the basic things we needed.” And she really is talking about basics – bread, milk, light and heat. “And they decided they weren’t going to take the children. That for me was a massive wake-up call.”Esther Ghey did turn her life around. And how. In her late 20s, now clean and a devoted mother, she started with a job as a cleaner at a car dealership before goingback to college, initially doing an English GCSE. She did an access to health professions course, because at the time she wanted to be a nurse, completed a degree in nutrition at Liverpool Hope University, and eventually became a senior product development technologist for a food company.Now 38, Ghey’s face is freckled and open, her eyes sea-blue, and she looks exceptionally healthy. She has two names tattooed on her wrists, celebrating the births of her children. On her right hand, it says Alisha in smudgy black ink; on the left, it says Brett. For 14 years of Brianna’s life, she was Brett. Through the book, Ghey makes a clear distinction. She refers to Brett as he, Brianna as she. Does it seem like two different people? “It does, though that’s not necessarily because she went from Brett to Brianna, it’s just the natural stages of life. It was important for me to talk about Brett as well, because to understand where Brianna was at, you need to understand the whole life.”What was Brett like? Her face lights up and her voice crackles with happiness. “Hyperactive, giddy, funny, always getting up to mischief. A cheeky little thing. Absolutely fearless. He taught himself gymnastics – he did backflips. I think of him bouncing around Asda, completely uncontrollable but also completely full of joy. And so kind. When he was young, he had an asthma appointment and as he was leaving he went to give the doctor a hug. He was so full of love. That kind of love started seeping away once I’d given him the phone. The impact the phone had on his mental health is stark. I believe it took my child away from me.” There’s a tremor in her voice, and Ghey starts crying.I choose not to think about what happened to Brianna. I think about who she was. The good and bad parts. That brings me joyBrett had so many issues, she says –body dysmorphia and dysphoria, asthma, ADHD, appalling eyesight, autism (then undiagnosed). There were times when he couldn’t face school and was a non-attender. At the age of 14, Brett explained that he wanted to transition. Ghey took it in her stride. In the book, she writes: “When the transition happened for Brianna it was perhaps one of the easiest parts of her short life.” Brett wanted the new name to start with a B. They drew up a list – Bella, Bridget, Britney, Blossom, Briony, Bree. Blossom was ruled out because Alisha thought it sounded like a stripper’s name, while both Alisha and Ghey said there was no way they would call her Britney. When Ghey suggested Brianna, Brett liked it. And that was that.Brianna was given a smartphone when she started high school. It hadn’t been a big thing for her older sister Alisha – just a way of keeping in touch with her mum, checking stuff online and playing a few games. For Brianna, it couldn’t have been more different. She escaped into the online world and soon found herself lost and trapped. Ghey documents the descent with chilling precision in her book. At first, Ghey would take the phone away overnight and check for any worrying activity. But by the time Brianna was a teenager, she refused to let her mother see what she was doing.Ghey already felt her child had been spending too much time on the phone. As Brianna, she started making YouTube videos – dancing and natural makeup tutorials for fellow schoolkids. Ghey didn’t like the negative comments, and she worried that the videos Brianna was making were being watched by adults with very different agendas.“I remember in the comments there was a grown woman saying, ‘Do you callthatnatural makeup?’ and I thought, ‘Why would you comment on a child’s video?’ I said, ‘Brianna, why are you even putting yourself out there to receive these comments?’ Her response was, ‘Have you seen how many likes I’ve got, though?’ It’s that dopamine hit when you get likes.”Brianna was a mass of contradictions: desperate for attention in the digital world, but terrified of the real world. At times she wouldn’t leave the family home for weeks on end. In one way, she craved anonymity and invisibility, yet she turned up at school in miniskirts, dolled up to the nines.After one particularly vicious fight over the phone, Ghey discovered that Brianna, then 14, was secretly looking at pornography on X (at that time Twitter) and pro-anorexia and self-harm content online. Her role model was a girl who was denying herself food, in essence teaching other people to copy her and kill themselves in the process. Although Brianna met her killers in the real world – at school – it was the online world that had made her so reckless and vulnerable to exploitation in the first place.The more Brianna looked for harmful content, the more the algorithms served it up to her. And the more Ghey challenged Brianna about it, the more angry and withdrawn she became.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t know who Brianna was talking to online. She was 15. I was concerned she was going to bring something dangerous to the house.’Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“My relationship with Brianna was so bad because all I wanted to do was help her, but because I wasn’t backing down, we were having lots of arguments.” Brianna became abusive and violent. When Ghey confiscated her phone, she punched holes in her bedroom walls. “I saw how addicted she was to her phone through her behaviour,” Ghey says, “because I’ve been through it myself. Smartphones have been built to be addictive. Social media is built to keep you on there as long as possible. It’s the attention economy.”On the rare occasions Ghey did get access to Brianna’s phone, she was sickened by what she found. But she didn’t know what to do for the better. “I’ve got a child who’s isolating herself from the real world, and she’s found a community online and is accessing harmful stuff. How are you as a parent supposed to manage that? Am I supposed to isolate her even more and take her away from social media, or do I let her still be subject to the harmful content that she’s looking at? What’s going to harm her less?” What is the answer? “There is no answer. The health professionals didn’t have an answer, the schools didn’t have an answer, nobody knew what to do.”On one occasion Ghey got up in the middle of the night and saw the light on in Brianna’s room. “I opened her door and she was sat behind the door on her phone I couldn’t get back to sleep and I wrote this frantic email to an amazing supportive teacher. I said, ‘I am worried that I’m going to come home and find both of my children raped and murdered’ because I didn’t know who Brianna was talking to online. She was 15. I was concerned she was going to bring something dangerous to the house.”Brianna lost so much weight in her last year that she had to be hospitalised. Ghey was devastated. Now she finds it equally devastating to admit that Brianna’s time in hospital was one of their happiest times as mother and daughter in the final two years of her life. Brianna was not allowed access to social media in hospital and, for once, Ghey found herself able to talk to her as they used to do. “She had her own room, and I’d go to see her every day and she had no wifi. It was like I had my child back again. She’d send me text messages, and she was so goofy and funny. She’d say, ‘I love you and want you to come and see me.’ She wasn’t being influenced by anything. She was stripped back – it was pure Brianna.” She wipes her eyes and exhales loudly. “Pppprrrr.”When she got home, things quickly deteriorated again. Brianna retreated to her bedroom with only her smartphone for company. She asked Ghey to stop telling her that she loved her. It shattered her, but she agreed.Meanwhile, the girl who went on to murder Brianna was also delving into the darkness of the web. Initially, she became fixated with true crime. But before long that wasn’t enough. She found websites that offered up live abuse. Soon, she vowed to become a killer herself. She and her male accomplice discussed ways of killing people. They drew up a list of potential victims before deciding on Brianna. One time they tried to kill her with an ibuprofen overdose, telling her that it was MDMA. Brianna was violently sick, but survived. The girl voiced her frustration in a text message to the boy: “Like I gave her some today that shld have been enough to kill her but she didn’t die.” The boy suggested she double the dose and put it in a “Maccies milkshake”. Eventually, they decided to kill Brianna with a hunting knife he had bought on a skiing trip to Bulgaria that Christmas. He posted a picture of the knife, with its 5in blade, on a WhatsApp group. Everything about the murder was evidenced on their smartphones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photographs: courtesy of Esther GheyBrianna agreed to meet the two killers, who were 15 at the time, in Culcheth, near Warrington, on 11 February 2023. They met at a bus stop and walked to an isolated area in nearby Linear Park. Brianna was stabbed 28 times with the hunting knife. In court, the girl and boy each blamed the other for the murder.During the trial at Manchester crown court, the Crown Prosecution Service put forward evidence suggesting the killing was a hate crime, including WhatsApp messages that used dehumanising language to describe Brianna. At sentencing last February, the judge, Mrs Justice Yip, lifted the reporting restriction that had prevented the media from naming the two defendants and sentenced them to life in prison. The girl was told she would be jailed for a minimum of 22 years, the boy a minimum of 20. The lengthy sentences reflected that the murder was in part motivated by hostility towards Brianna because she was trans.Outside court, after the guilty verdicts were announced, Ghey said the killers had not shown “an ounce of remorse”, but urged “empathy and compassion” for their parents, saying “they too have lost a child”. I ask Ghey why she chose not to name the killers in Under a Pink Sky. “The girl wanted to be infamous for the crime she committed, and this is about my life and Brianna’s life, and it’s not about them.” Since being jailed, the girl has expressed a further desire to kill people.After Brianna’s death, there was an outpouring of love for her and Ghey. And then the trolling began. Ghey and Brianna both became pawns in the culture wars. Some people suggested that Ghey had been a bad parent for allowing Brianna to transition. One Facebook comment said, “Your son died because you failed him. You’re a failure.” A tribute page to Brianna set up by the funeral directors was defiled. Was Ghey shocked? “I wouldn’t say I was shocked or surprised at being trolled, but it disgusted me. It really knocked me, especially with Brianna’s tribute page. It was flooded with horrific images.” She stops, and changes her mind. “I say it didn’t shock me, but it did, because I didn’t think anybody would ever stoop that low. Initially, I felt I didn’t want to do anything ever again. I didn’t want to put myself in the public eye, I didn’t want to campaign, I wanted to curl up in a ball at home.” But, she says, she knew she couldn’t. She had a mission. She had to make Brianna’s murder count for something.There’s no blame there for the girl’s mother. It was important for me to meet her and see she’s just a normal woman doing her bestLots of people who have been through what you have would still be curled up in a ball, two years on, I say. She nods. “If they were, it would be completely understandable.” Ghey says that in the past when things were bleak, she was helped by mindfulness – the practice of being fully aware of where you are and what you’re doing in the moment to distract from past trauma and fears for the future. This time she believes it saved her. If she focuses on the present, she says, she can make the most of her life. If she wallows in the past, she’ll be screwed. She now works with Alisha atPeace & Mind, a community interest company she founded to raise funds to teach mindfulness in schools.People might expect her to drape herself in sackcloth and ashes, she says, but that is not her way. “In our society, when you’ve lost somebody, particularly in a tragic situation, it’s almost like you have to grieve for the rest of your life – you can never be happy, you should never smile and never laugh. It’s so wrong! You still owe it to yourself to be happy, and whoever you’ve lost to be happy. I choose not to think about what happened to Brianna. I choose to think about who she was. The good parts and the bad parts, and that brings me joy.”What image does she have of Brianna when she closes her eyes? “Ah!” She closes them and smiles. “Honestly? She just had these pyjama bottoms that she would never take off. They were pink fluffy pyjama bottoms and they had stains on them and holes in them, and she had this Barbie T-shirt. As soon as she got in the house, her makeup would come off, those would go on and she would just be walking around the house giving me grief, winding her sister up or making silly noises.” What kind of silly noises? “I don’t know where she got this from, but she would always go, ‘Ana oop ana poop ana scoop.’ I’ve got her ashes in a necklace and on the back, it says ‘Ana oop. Brianna.’” Brianna was dressed in the pink pyjamas for her funeral.Ghey says that writing the book has been both painful and cathartic. What does she want people to get out of it? First of all, she says, she would like us to get to know the true Brianna – and the true Esther. But she also hopes it raises awareness of how dangerous smartphones and online platforms can be for children and young people. If tech companies wanted to make their products safer, it would be easy, she says. “We need phones that are built for children, where by design they can’t download social media apps, can’t access porn sites or anything harmful. Cars are safe by design, with seatbelts, and we need the same for children with smartphones.”Earlier this month, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he thoughtAustralia’s recent legislationto ban social media for children under 16 was a good idea. This is something Ghey agrees with. And if the tech companies and digital platforms don’t do their bit, and if governments fail to regulate, Ghey says, parents can always vote with their feet and refuse to buy smartphones for their children. She supports pressure groups such asSmartphone Free Childhood, and Bereaved Families for Online Safety.View image in fullscreen‘We need phones that are built for children.’ Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian, with thanks toStatham Lodge hotelThe book is powerful as a polemic, but where it astounds is as an exploration of forgiveness and hope. Ghey not only examines her capacity to forgive, but also her capacity to be forgiven. She writes about a girl she taunted and bullied at school, and says it haunted her down the years. “This lovely, lovely girl I knew in primary school, and I used to be horrid to her and pick on her,” she says today. The hurt she caused the girl still distresses her. “This was something I couldn’t let go. It was always in my mind. She was clearly struggling, but as a child I don’t think you have that empathy to understand what’s going on in other people’s lives.” In her 20s, she contacted the girl on Facebook and they agreed to meet up. “I asked for her forgiveness, and she so graciously accepted it, and that taught me such a lot. The fact that she forgave me meant that I could forgive myself.”She says that only by forgiving Brianna’s killers has she been able to move on with her own life. “It was important to forgive the girl and boy for what they’ve done because, if I didn’t forgive them, I would hold that hate in my heart and it would eat away at me. They’ve already taken Brianna away from me and I refuse to let them impact the rest of my life.”As a child psychiatrist, I see what smartphones are doing to kids’ mental health – and it’s terrifying | Emily SehmerRead moreDid she feel the need to forgive herself in any way for Brianna’s death? “I think my whole life has been a journey of forgiving myself. Forgiving myself for the way I was with the children when I was young. Forgiving myself for treating myself badly. Soon after Brianna’s death, there were all sorts of thoughts going through my mind: I shouldn’t have shouted at her for this; I wish I hadn’t treated her this way; I wish we’d never argued. But there’s no way of going back and changing that, and feelings like that are so harmful.” However much Ghey says she has eased up on herself, she still gives herself a pretty tough time. “I need to think what can I do to redeem myself, to make things better, and that’s why I’ve got this drive to help other parents.” Ghey’s words are so measured, but her face is raw with emotion, her voice at times reduced to a whisper.I knew that Ghey had met up with the mother of the girl who killed Brianna. What I didn’t know is the extent of the relationship they have developed. They now see each other almost every week. Ghey tells me they have so much in common – two mothers grieving for their daughters in different ways. “It isn’t Emma who committed the crime. As a parent, I went through such a difficult time trying to monitor Brianna and to keep on top of what she was accessing online. Brianna was harming herself, and Emma’s daughter was harming herself and went on to harm someone else as well. There’s no blame there at all for Emma. It’s easy to tell ourselves stories in our head about how people are, and it was important for me to meet her and see how she actually was. And she’s just a normal woman who was doing her best.”Is it easier to talk to Emma about what happened to Brianna than to other people? “We don’t talk about what happened really. I really look forward to seeing her. We’re quite similar and we’ve got a similar dry sense of humour.”What does she think Brianna would make of their friendship? “I don’t think she’d be bothered. She’d be like, ‘You do you, Mum!’”Tuesday 11 February was the second anniversary of Brianna’s death. She would have been 18 now. Does Ghey wonder how she would be doing if she hadn’t been robbed of her life? “I can only speak through my experience, and I came out of the terrible place I was in. I would have been hopeful that Brianna would have made it through, just the way I did.”As for Ghey, she says she is adjusting to the new normal. The reduced family unit – Ghey, her husband, Wes, whom she’s been with for 10 years, and Alisha – are as close as close can be. They see and hear Brianna all around them in pink skies and pink blossom, little jokes, funny sounds, tattoos, everything.Just before Ghey leaves, she shows me the book cover: a blossom tree in full bloom and the shadow of a mother and her two daughters walking in the sun. It’s beautiful and heartbreaking. As she flicks through the images on her phone, I ask her about the finely etched tattoos on her fingers. They are Buddhist symbols, she says, and she had them inked just before the trial. Which tattoo means most to her? She points to the names Alisha and Brett on her wrists, the cherry blossom with the single pink flower, and finally a gorgeous pink lotus. “You know the lotus flower comes out of the murk and blooms?” She says it’s an important symbol for her. “No matter what shit you go through, there is always hope.”Under a Pink Sky: A Mother’s Story of Love, Loss and the Power of Forgiveness by Esther Gheyis published by Michael Joseph on 27 February at £22.

Shame about the ropey vocal affectations …Rebecca NicholsonSat 22 Feb 2025 17.10 ESTShareThe Peaky Blinders comparisons have been flying around ever since filming on Dope Girls began, so it sounds as if the BBC was hoping that it might have a successor on its hands. Certainly, there are some superficial similarities between the two. Dope Girls is set in 1918 and deals with the aftermath of the first world war, as the surviving men return. But here, it’s the women who are in the spotlight, as the female workforce of the past four years suddenly find their newfound social status has been relegated once again. In mood and tone, however, it is less a return to Small Heath, and more of a predecessor to Cabaret.Kate Galloway (Julianne Nicholson) is a businessman’s wife and wartime butcher, who falls on hard times after a family tragedy. Destitute and homeless, she heads to London, where Armistice Day is looming and the party of the century is about to kick off. With the help of a bright dancer named Billie (Umi Myers), who is as talented as she is troubled, Kate finds her way into the clubland underworld of Soho, where she spies the potential to apply her previous workplace-based knowledge, and sets the ball rolling on building a new empire of nightlife.Joining Kate and Billie is Kate’s daughter Evie (Eilidh Fisher), who begins the series at a fancy boarding school where she is bullied for being from “the slums” – ie she is not landed gentry.Little Women’s Eliza Scanlen is Violet, a young woman from the north of England taking part in “the Female Experiment”, in which 10 women are recruited as the country’s first ever female police officers. Geraldine James, who has been the cherry on the top of a strong female ensemble cake ever since Band of Gold in the 1990s, plays Isabella Salucci, the matriarch of an organised crime family who soon finds herself entangled with Kate’s new venture, and not necessarily in a female-solidarity sort of way.View image in fullscreenJulianne Nicholson as Kate Galloway in Dope Girls.Photograph: Kevin Baker/BBC/Bad WolfCreated and written by the playwright Polly Stenham, with Alex Warren, it is a theatrical affair from the off. It opens with a flash-forward to Kate, soaked in blood and wearing angel wings, frolicking in a fountain in Trafalgar Square; there are plenty of moments when it all goes a bit like a Florence + the Machine video. The first episode establishes how she got there in the first place, but as it must cover a lot of ground, the early mood is skittish and unsettled. It also includes the copious use of Heartstopper-style text graphics, to annotate and explain some of the scenes. One particularly egregious example read “Paaaaaaarty!” over the start of, well, a party. I didn’t love it, but perhaps it is an attempt to win over a younger audience.The show finds more confidence when everyone has been moved into position and the fireworks are finally allowed to begin. As Kate looks to make the most of what life has thrown at her, Violet must prove herself as a police officer by going undercover with Soho’s dancers, criminals and thieves. Both harbour huge secrets that will inevitably be exposed. It’s impossible to root for one over the other, even though they are technically opposing forces, because both are outsiders, and desperate in their own ways.‘It’s now part of my life’: Stephen Graham on shredding to be a buff boxer in A Thousand BlowsRead moreThe timing does feel a little unfortunate. The problem with suggesting it as an heir to Peaky Blinders is that Steven Knight, that series’ creator, has just released another period crime drama, A Thousand Blows, which is also (partly) about female gangs in London.It is set about 40 years earlier, but it, too, deals with outsiders creating their own criminal economy, and women who seek or possess power beyond the levels expected of them. Its energy, however, is bigger and bolder; it spends more time on the story and less time searching for a beautiful angle. A wag might argue that what Dope Girls shares most with Peaky Blinders is a tendency for all accents involved to go wandering around the globe, before settling somewhere, anywhere, in the UK. But that would be impolite.Dope Girls takes place in a busy period, historically, and crams in clandestine same-sex affairs, the 1918 flu pandemic outbreak, spiritualism and empire, among many other ideas. All of this creates a hectic, sometimes fussy scramble.But Dope Girls is in no way a bad series. Its ambition is entertaining, and it is hard to get bored, especially when the crime really gets going. If it is skewed towards a younger audience, then it certainly doesn’t skimp on the brutality or the gore: limbs are severed, tongues are removed and eaten, and you wouldn’t want to guess where a hairpin ends up. It is fun, gory and lively, then, if a little too in love with its own reflection.Dope Girls aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Philip Thurston/Getty ImagesSouthern Ocean waves are growing larger and faster, threatening coastlines. But some scientists think they could help turn the tide in the climate crisisByJames BradleySat 22 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 19.52 ESTShareIn his remarkable memoir of his life chasing breaks in far-flung corners of the globe, Barbarian Days, the writer William Finnegan describes the “spooky duality” of waves, the way that, “when you are absorbed in surfing they seem alive. They each have personalities, distinct and intricate, and quickly changing moods, to which you must react in the most intuitive, almost intimate way – too many people have likened riding waves to making love. And yet waves are of course not alive, not sentient, and the lover you reach to embrace may turn murderous without warning.”This idea of duality is difficult to avoid when thinking about waves. In them we see energy and matter collapse into each other, find fluidity with structure and form, and the eternal in the transient, apprehend both beauty and symmetry and violence and terror. Likewise, the physics of waves are simultaneously very simple and impossibly complex, the non-linear nature of fluid dynamics meaning they can remain relatively regular orcombine without warning into rogue wavescapable of sweeping people off rocks and sinking ships.Waves are also a vital part of the ocean system, helping to control the rate at which the ocean absorbs both heat and carbon dioxide and shaping and sustaining coastlines. And as ocean temperatures rise and weather patterns shift, waves are changing, in some oceans growing bigger and more powerful, and fast.This has frightening implications for coastlines and the coastal communities that bear the brunt of the ocean’s fury. But if harnessed effectively waves – and the energy they transmit – may also have a part to play in tackling the climate crisis.The waves we see on the ocean’s surface are mostly wind waves. Because wind pressure is never uniform, it creates tiny fluctuations in the water’s surface. As the wind pushes against these fluctuations they grow, creating larger and larger surfaces and transferring more and more kinetic energy from the air into the ocean. As they move across the water’s surface these fluctuations interact and combine, first forming ripples, then, as they become more regular, longer and larger waves. Out on the open ocean, where powerful winds can blow on the water for hundreds or even thousands of kilometres without interruption, these eventually become the massive swells that crash on to shores in higher latitudes.View image in fullscreenAs global heating increases the amount of energy in the atmosphere, it generates higher winds and bigger storms, resulting in larger and more powerful waves.Photograph: Philip Thurston/Getty ImagesWaves can also be created by seismic events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The waves created by these events can be immense. In 1958 a landslide at the mouth of Lituya Bay in Alaska sent a wave estimated to be 150 metres high rolling into the narrow inlet; as it spilled inland itlevelled trees more than 500 metres above sea level. But their destructive power usually has more to do with their extremely long wavelengths than their height: although the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami was only about 10 metres high when it reached Aceh, it wasup to 600 kilometreslong, meaning that like a huge tide it swept vast quantities of water long distances inland.Nor are the waves we see on the surface the only waves in the ocean. The ocean is stratified into distinct layers of different temperature and salinity, and just as waves form on the interface between the water and the air, the outflow of fresh water from rivers and glaciers or tidal forces can sendwaves rippling along the boundaries between these layers. Even the daily motion of the tides is really a huge wave created by the gravity of the moon and sun that rolls around the planet. These processes play an important part in ocean mixing, helping transport denser, cooler water from the ocean’s depths towards the surface and to transfer nutrients and carbon from the sunlit upper layers into deeper water.Endangered waves: why Australia’s revered surf spots could soon reach a breaking pointRead moreUnderstanding how these various systems are affected by the changing climate is not easy. Dr Mark Hemer from the CSIRO says that “waves are essentially the product of the winds, which means they’re affected by changes in atmospheric circulation at the surface.” And as global heating increases the amount of energy in the atmosphere it generates higher winds and bigger storms, resulting in larger and more powerful waves.View image in fullscreenAfter a huge storm, waves washed on to properties at Collaroy and Narrabeen beaches in Sydney.Photograph: Felix Levesque/WeatherZoneBetween 1985 and 2018 wave heights in the Southern Ocean increased by 30 centimetres, or around a centimetre a year. Because waves from the Southern Ocean propagate out into the Pacific, South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, this has contributed to increases in wave size there as well.Wave energy is increasing as well, ticking up around 8% since the 1980s, with the rate of change accelerating markedly since the turn of the century, reflecting not just changes in wave height, but also increasingly intense storms andmore frequent extreme wave events.Research by Hemer and his colleagues predicts that without significant cuts in carbon emissions this process will continue, although these changes are not consistent across different regions: wave height in the North Pacific and North Atlantic may actually decrease.Ian Young is Kernot professor of engineering at the University of Melbourne. His research shows thatby 2100 about 60% of the world’s coastline will experience larger and more frequent extreme waves, and predicts that without drastic reductions in emissionsextreme sea level events could increase tenfold or even more by the end of the century, and coastal flooding could strip as much as 20% off the value of the world economy. And while the “the biggest issue is mean sea level rise … breaking wave setup can account for up to 20% of the flooding.”View image in fullscreenAustralian research shows by 2100 about 60% of the world’s coastline will experience larger and more frequent extreme waves.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesEvents like the storm that swept away about 25 metres of the coastline at Narrabeen and Collaroy on Sydney’s Northern Beaches,depositing a swimming pool on the beach and leaving houses hanging off cliffs,clearly demonstrate the effects of larger and more powerful waves on coastlines and coastal communities, especially in combination with rising sea levels. Larger waves have alsocontributed to disastrous flooding events on a number of Pacific islands,helped strip hundreds of metres of sand from beaches and accelerated the retreat of cliffs in south-west England and France, and are helpingaccelerate the disastrous effects of melting permafrost and rising sea levelson vulnerable communities in the Arctic, where coastlines are already retreating many metres a year.Yet as Hemer observes, focusing on wave height alone is “a bit like describing an orchestra simply by the volume at which it plays”, especially when it comes to impacts upon coasts. Even in parts of the world where wave heights are predicted to decrease, there are likely to be changes in the frequency, length or direction of waves. This can result in more damaging wave impacts, major changes in the natural movement of sand and sediment and increases in flooding and storm surges. “Coasts are essentially the equilibrium of the physical forces that act on them. And if you change any factor in that, then you shift the equilibrium and they’ll respond,” says Hemer.While many scientists are concerned about the potential destruction and disruption of larger and more violent waves, others believe waves have a role to play in tackling the climate crisis. The average power of the waves crossing Australia’s continental shelf is estimated to bearound 10 times Australia’s annual energy consumption– more than any other country in the world. And despite the challenges of developing technologies sturdy enough to withstand the rigours of the marine environment, wave power has many advantages over other forms of renewable energy: because it is positioned offshore and at sea level it doesn’t compete for land like solar or affect views like offshore wind. And while wave power is intermittent, it is considerably less variable than either wind or solar.Despite this, the ocean energy sector in Australia remains embryonic, with investment lagging far behind wind and solar. And while there have been successes – in 2022 Melbourne company WaveSwellsuccessfully deployed a 200 kW wave energy converter capable of powering up to 200 homes, and on the other side of the continent, scientists from the University of Western Australia have just beguna trial of a surface-riding wave energy deviceusing technology developed at the University of Manchester – they are mostly small-scale and have yet to be commercially deployed.View image in fullscreenMany scientists are concerned about the potential destruction and disruption of larger and more violent waves, but others believe waves have a role to play in tackling the climate crisis.Photograph: Philip Thurston/Getty ImagesMark Hemer believes part of the problem is that while wind and solar are already able to be deployed at scale, technologies capable of harnessing the waves and the tides are still in development. “One of the biggest challenges for wave energy is they are high-capital projects through that demonstration phase.”Dr Wiebke Ebeling is Manager of UWA’s Marine Energy Research Australia, which is behind the trial in Albany. She agrees the biggest challenge for wave energy is that it is a less mature technology than wind and solar, but argues it still has the potential to be an important part of a properly diversified energy system. “There are a couple of big value propositions with wave power. It’s more power-dense than solar and wind. And because waves are 24/7 you effectively have no intermittency.”Ebeling is particularly focused on studies showing that locating wave energy facilities alongside offshore wind significantly increases the power generated without significantly increasing costs. “If you integrate a wave energy technology around the foundation of a wind turbine, depending on the technology and the location you get anything between two and a half and four times the power. So it’s not one or the other.”Nonetheless, despite growing investment in ocean energy, especially in Europe, the US and China, deployment of wave and tidal power falls well short of the levels needed to help the world reach net zero by 2050, with only a handful of projects that have proceeded beyond the prototype phase. Advocates argue the sector is on the brink of rapid growth, but others remain sceptical. “[As] a broad scale solution for the country it’s got a fair way to go,” says Mark Hemer, “And you’ll be pushing things uphill to get there.”A hotter world means moreturbulence, both literally and metaphorically,and bigger and more powerful waves are only one part of that. But as changes to the ocean’s waves ripple outwards to alter coastlines and affect activities such as shipping they offer an eloquent reminder of the often unexpected ways in which planetary systems are interacting and changing as the planet heats up. “The atmosphere and the ocean work together,” says Ian Young. “Impact one and you impact the other.”Explore more on these topicsOceansRenewable energyClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even the syllables of the composer’s name beat out the rhythm of a waltz, as all Austrian dance teachers know. In their lessons, the words “Jo-hann Strauss” are often swapped in to replace the conventional “one, two, three” step count.Viennese children learn to waltz just like they learn to ride a bike, so the muscle-memory never leaves them. Just as well, because the city is still famous as the home of a 19th-century dance craze that shaped its international image. In this 200th anniversary year of the birth of the “waltz king”, there are rival bids jostling to become the focus of the swirling celebrations.“His music was for everyone, of every class and background. People danced to it at grand balls but also at private parties and at home,” said Eduard Strauss, the composer’s great-grand-nephew. “He really was the first pop star.” As a descendant of Johann’s youngest brother, also Eduard, he’s batting for the Strauss bicentenary venue he thinks has more authenticity than most: a museum set up inside a small dance hall, or casino, where the musician conducted his own hit waltzes for his fans. “It is an original and I am an original,” Eduard says, adding that the building, now the House of Strauss museum, was important not just for its lively music, but as a place to keep warm and meet people in bright lights on dark evenings.This coming weekend, the exclusive 67th Vienna Opera Ball takes place amid the vast grandeur of the State Opera house, with tickets at €395. Hundreds of similar balls, at varying scale, dominate Viennese social life from November to March every year. Formal and lavish, they’re a bit of nostalgic play-acting, with tailcoats, tuxedos and long swishy dresses, and yet staged in deadly cultural earnest. The city’s guilds, professionals and tradespeople, from the cake-makers to the scientists, host glittering events. This weekend, the Viennesekaffeesieder, or coffee brewers, transform the Vienna Hofburg into the “largest and most beautiful coffee house in the world” in tribute to the heritage of another Viennese tradition. Strauss may be best known for theBlue Danube, Austria’s unofficial national anthem, but there are about 500 pieces by him played each ball season. All this comes on top of the New Year’s concert, brimful of his waltzes, beamed out across the world from the Golden Hall of the Musikverein. Before this, at midnight, theBlue Danubeis played to the nation after the chimes of Vienna’s cathedral sound. Each January, the gilt auditorium of the opera house sells out for a performance of Strauss’s comic operettaDie Fledermaus.View image in fullscreenMore than 500 Johann Strauss compositions are played during Vienna’s ball season.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesSo it seems odd the city has waited for this major anniversary to work out how to honour its most on-brand composer. Vying for the role alongside the House of Strauss, the museum housed in the refurbished Casino Zögernitz, is a new, permanent, immersive exhibition in the city centre displaying his life and work to a musical accompaniment, theJohann Strauss Museum: New Dimensions. Vienna’s Theatermuseum is also running a bicentenary exhibition, hailing the composer as “the first international superstar”, until June. More conventional historic sites for Strauss pilgrimage remain his former apartment in the PraterstraßeStrauss apartment, the goldStrauss monumentin the Stadtpark and theStrauss tombin the Central Cemetery. Further out, the Dommayer Cafe is billed as the place where he first picked up a baton in public. The delayed response to the Strauss legacy is probably due to the complexity of the real story. The “waltz king” title originally belonged to his father, Johann Strauss I, who toured Europe with an entourage of 18 to 20 carriages before his son ever stepped into the limelight as the next master of the dance. And then there were Johann II’s younger musical brothers, Josef and Eduard. “People should not just say ‘Strauss’,” says his great-grand-nephew. “They should say which one.”The arrival of the waltz, condemned for immorality like all new crazes should be, was the birth of the modern music industry. Each tune was sold to a music manuscript publisher, who took a photograph or commissioned a portrait of the composer to help sell the sheet music.The catalyst for the trend is thought to have been the Congress of Vienna of 1814, when politicians and monarchs came together in the Habsburg capital to decide on the borders of the continent after the defeat of Napoleon. Entertainments, adhering to the rules of court ceremony, were set up for the dignatories and new dance music commissioned.Within a decade or two there were more than 60 dance halls in the city, and Strauss senior set up financially risky, festival-like outdoor events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are still many nights of waltzing to go, with ball directors all over the city calling out “Alles Walzer!” to start dances into the early spring.Explore more on these topicsDanceThe ObserverAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I was 20 years old, a starry-eyed rube from suburban Bracken Ridge who didn’t even know what a flat white was.On my first day my editor had the rest of the journos join us at a cafe to welcome me to the team. That’s when I met Fiona. Fi. She’d been out on assignment and arrived late; the only seat left was right next to me. She was so natural and warm in the way she chatted with me. What was just polite small talk felt to me like an enormous show of generosity; like a light shining on me. She also reminded me of my childhood screen crush Toni Pearen. I was instantly taken with her.‘I just realised at that moment: I want to laugh through life with this person’Read moreFi was a reporter but she also subedited a lot of articles. For months she corrected my dodgy apostrophes. Four months in and she’d had enough. After work one evening, when everyone else had left, she quietly ran through the rules of apostrophes with me – to save her own sanity and my dignity. What a woman, I thought.Fi was a few years older than me; she’d lived and worked in the UK as a journalist. This was the height of sophistication to me. I was fascinated and enamoured with her. But I didn’t think she’d ever entertain the idea of dating a bloke like me; I was just a kid trying not to blow his big break with errant grammar and misguided affections.Then spring rolled around, the jacarandas were out and Brisbane was awash in purple. Local band Powderfinger were just about to bring out one of the greatest albums of all time, Odyssey Number Five. As a perk of my shit-kicking job I was invited to the industry launch. There was only one person I knew who was a bigger Finger fan than me.At the venue on the night of the gig Fi and I ended up on a back landing smoking Peter Stuyvesants and drinking beers, having the kind of conversation twentysomethings do. I was 21 by then and trying to channel Ethan Hawke from Before Sunrise.When Fi began riffing on how she was over dating, over love, I doubled down on it, agreeing with everything she said. Who needs romantic love? We were serious journalists! John Pilger didn’t give a shit about love; we’re hard-boiled, we’ve got Steinbeck and Down and Out in Paris and London and Kurt Cobain and travel; we’re no cream puffs – we don’t need anything as lame as love!But in my head I thought: holy shit, Idoactually love this girl. I wish I could just tell her right now how amazing I think she is, how I think we should be together, but I didn’t have the guts.Trent Dalton’s Love Stories review – a stage adaptation that grabs you by the heartRead moreThen our beers ran out. I walked back to the bar to get us some more and every beautiful person in Brisbane was in there, swooning around Powderfinger’s lead singer, the great Bernard Fanning.There he was, like a light in the darkness. And there I was, the Elvis Costello to his Jim Morrison, trying to convince myself that I was too cool for love.Who was I kidding? I ripped a Powderfinger poster off the wall and squeezed through the crowds feting Bernard and interrupted his conversation. I apologised, congratulated him on the album and then rambled: “There’s this girl out on the landing, man, and she loves you even more than I do. I really like her, right, and I figured if you sign this, then her love for you might bounce back and get reflected back on to me somehow.”Impressed and bemused, Bernard took the poster from my hands and scribbled on it. He rolled it back up and told me to take it to her and not to look at it.Back outside, Fi unfurled the poster as I looked on. She read aloud: “Fiona, this boy really likes you, love Bernard.”View image in fullscreenTrent Dalton (left) with Fiona Franzmann a few days after the Powderfinger gig in 2000Time stood still. I could have gone and made a sandwich, come back and still been waiting for her reaction. It was pure vulnerability, the knife’s edge. I felt as though I would either have to move to Sydney or we’ll be together for ever.But that was it. That was the moment my life cracked wide open and love poured in. This beautiful rock god had swung open the door to the truth I was too scared to admit: love is the coolest thing there is.We shared a cab home at the end of the night without acknowledging this big elephant in the room – the poster and what Bernard wrote – but I think we both knew this could be the start of something big. It was only a few days after, on the night of Fi’s birthday, that I told her outright that I loved her and she said it back.Twenty-four years later, I still think about what might have happened if I had kept wallowing in self-doubt and tried to stay too cool for the truth of love.And it terrifies me because the joy that came after that moment – it sends a chill through my bones to imagine my life without it.An adaptation of Trent Dalton’s bookLove Storiesis being staged by the Merrigong Theatre Company in Wollongong, New South Wales, from 28 February to 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsThe moment I knewDatingAustralian lifestyleMarriageAustralian musicBrisbanePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2016 he was shortlisted for the Booker prize with his fourth novel,All That Man Is, nine separate stories “self-assembled in the reader’s mind into a sort of collage-novel” (London Review of Books). His new novel,Flesh, follows the fluctuating fortunes of a young Hungarian ex-convict who makes his life in the UK after serving in Iraq.Tell us howFleshcame to be.I decided to abandon a book I’d started in 2017. It just wasn’t working, so it felt like a weight off my shoulders; nevertheless, I was under contract and had to come up with something. Literally nothing inFleshis directly autobiographical, but it started with my underlying experience of being poised between two places and feeling not 100% at home in either of them. I no longer really feel like a native of London, but nor do I feel entirely Hungarian. Even for the decades I lived in London, just by virtue of the name that I have, there was always a sense of being... outsider is too strong a word; I was more of an outsider in Hungary, certainly, but a kind of insider-outsider, because I come from a Hungarian background but don’t speak Hungarian very well. That sort of grey zone interests me.The novel implies that all the tumult of the protagonist’s life begins with the shock of puberty. What made you want to dramatise that idea?My aim was to try to be as honest as possible about what it’s actually like to be a male body in the world – to be a body that has its own demands, and how you manage, accommodate, satisfy and fail to satisfy those demands, and what experiences that leads you into.Money is pivotal to the story, as it tends to be in your work.It structures our society in a deep way. I say that as someone who’s not Marxist or anything like that; anyone can see that money exists as a way of distributing power. The need for money, or wanting more money, or just sort of having to have money, is central in all our lives. Often it’s underplayed in the same way as physical experience – a bigger part of our existence than you’d think from reading fiction.In form and style,FleshresemblesTurbulence[2018]andAll That Man Is, which seemed to mark a break from your first three novels.With my earlier books, I was doing something completely different after each one. Looking back, that was born out of not yet having found what really works for me. I enjoy books made of free-standing units of writing that are somehow in dialogue with one another, where what happens in the gaps is as important as the chapters themselves. The way that the reader has to do their own imaginative work means they might come away with a sense of having read a book that covers a large amount of human experience, without having to plough through a 1,000-page 19th-century novel. I don’t think anyone’s seriously going to deny that we live in an era of short attention spans, which probably isn’t good, but we’re going to have to work with it the best we can.One challenge is always to hold on to the reality of the fictional world for it not to seem like a silly story I’m making upWhere do you write?For various family reasons I go back very frequently to Hungary, so I have to be pragmatic – it’s not like I have some holy desk that’s the only place where I can do anything. One challenge is always to hold on to the reality of the fictional world for it not to seem like a silly story I’m making up. The hour immediately after waking, with the phone still switched off, is when that world can seem most real.How come you left London?I didn’t know I was leaving! I went to Hungary planning to spend a few months and ended up there for more than 10 years. One of the things that kept me in Hungary, unquestionably, was that I could afford to live on my income from writing, which was then very meagre indeed, in a way that I simply wouldn’t have been able to in England.What first led you to write fiction?I genuinely don’t know [laughs]. I’ve been writing for pleasure since I was very young; I stopped in my 20s but came back to it. The thing that got me hooked at the age of 10 or something was probably the game of it – to master the way a book manipulates the reader. I don’t mean it to sound sinister; it’s just the game that’s going on all the time between writer and reader in every context. As a child I enjoyed that and quite unselfconsciously wanted to try doing it as a writer.Is there anything you recall reading at that time?I enjoyedThe Hobbitbut foundThe Lord of the Ringsvery boring. I remember reading books that were slightly unexpected: at 12, I read the complete works of Frederick Forsyth and really enjoyed them, probably much more than I would now. It’s interesting [thinking back] – they work very much on close control of the reader’s expectations.Name something you need in order to write.Solitude. I find the heavy lifting near the beginning, where you have to imagine a world out of nothing, easier if I can go away and basically not interact with anyone. More than a week and it starts to become oppressive, but a week of solitude can be very useful.The story goes that in 2016 you came within a hair’s breadth of winning the Booker. Do you ever think what might have been?Of course. Just being shortlisted transformed my career – I sold far more books than I did before – but it was very disappointing at the time. If I’d won, maybe I’d have become lazy. It feels like some big peak to come back from; more prosaically, you probably get enough sales generated that you don’t have to publish for some years. Either way I’ve managed to convince myself that not winning was a good thing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gregor Townsend feels his team were unlucky to concede the crucial second-half penalty kicked by Fin Smith that ultimately proved decisive and doubts have also been raised over the solitary English try, scored by Tommy Freeman.Townsend was particularly unhappy about the crucial penalty given against Rory Darge and Tom Jordan for lifting Ben Curry out of a ruck. “I’m going to go through the game two or three times to see whether we could have got better decisions,” said Townsend, the head coach. “I did feel the decision that counted against us for the winning three points where we cleared someone out of the ruck … I just don’t know how that’s a penalty.Agony for Finn Russell after missed kick hands England win over ScotlandRead more“We’ve moved someone off the ruck and they’re two feet off the ground and there was no moving [his] legs above the horizontal. That was an interesting call for us to end up going six points behind.”Members of his management team were also unconvinced that Freeman’s early try should have been awarded. “I heard the [other] coaches say it wasn’t grounded but I was on to the next thing, which was a kick-off,” said Townsend. Freeman was adjudged to have touched the ball down beneath a heap of Scottish bodies but smiled broadly and chose his words carefully about his try afterwards.“The referee awarded it – therefore I grounded it,” said Freeman. “He awarded it so that’s the end of it really. I’m not going to say anything different. You take the points and stop asking questions. He must have seen it on the ground.”Townsend, however, was at pains to stress that the French official Pierre Brousset had also played his part in ensuring a gripping contest. “I thought the referee did well. It was a very good game to watch, which would mean that the referee’s had a big part to play in that. Sometimes you’re going to get those decisions and sometimes you’re not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s what we probably should be looking to do with the chances we had.”Steve Borthwick preferred to focus on his team’s second-half resilience after they had trailed 10-7 at half-time. England’s head coach said: “I’m obviously delighted that the endings have gone our way in the last two games and the team worked exceptionally hard for that. In many ways, it wasn’t pretty, and there were things we’d obviously want to do differently and better.

He also tipped Ben Duckett, 165 from 143 balls in a total of 351 for eight, to become the first Englishman to score a double-century in ODI cricket.Inglis inspires Australia to record win over England despite Duckett hundredRead moreDuckett doing so against Afghanistan or South Africa next week would be pretty handy for Buttler, it must be said. The two remaining Group A games – first here in Lahore, before a switch to Karachi – have now become must-win affairs, for England’s semi-final hopes and possibly his own continuation as captain.Asked whether, after a ninth defeat in their last 12 ODIs, England were struggling to remember how to win, Buttler replied: “The longer it goes on, the closer you get to winning. The optimism and the belief is very much there in the team.“I think you have to be proud of the way we played and performed and give credit to the opposition for just being a little bit better and getting over the line. We’ll plan well, keep the boys upbeat, dust ourselves down and go again.”On Duckett, who stitched England’s innings together but only found genuine support from Joe Root’s 68, Buttler said: “There won’t be too many times you score 165 and end up on the losing side. His game is perfectly suited to scoring big runs. I said before the tournament he could be the first Englishman to score a double in ODI cricket.“At innings like this one should really prove to him how consistent he can be and how many runs he can score in this format. It is a big year for English cricket and he’s going to be at the forefront of it. To start as he has done, and looking ahead, I’m sure England fans will be excited to watch him bat for the rest of the year.”In mitigation, it was a tough toss to lose, the pitch slowing up in the first innings before dew fell late on and saw the ball skid on. “I liked the balance of the team that we went with,” added Buttler, regarding the batter-heavy selection. “I thought Root and Liam Livingstone bowled really well and built some nice pressure together.“You’ve got to sometimes credit the opposition – Inglis played a fantastic innings.”Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyThe ObserverEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketJos ButtlernewsShareReuse this content"

It leaves Arsenal still eight points behind Liverpool, with Arne Slot’s side having an opportunity to extend their lead when they face Manchester City on Sunday.West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen delivers major blow to Arsenal’s title hopesRead moreArteta admitted that West Ham were worthy winners against his toothless side but refused to blame the number of injuries to attacking players that forced him to start with Mikel Merino as a makeshift centre‑forward.“We are very disappointed and very, very angry as well,” he said. “I never felt that we were at the level that is required and I am very much responsible for that. We have to look in the mirror at ourselves of what we can do better, what we have done and the will and the desire and the way we run and the way we want it, zero question about that.”Asked whether their poor performance was down to the lack of options in attack, he added: “No, I refuse that completely. We’re talking about the standards of the players and the team that played today, me included. And that was nowhere near the levels that we have to hit to have the opportunity to win the Premier League. Today no, we were very consistent, yes, but football is about what you do today and today, nowhere near.”Lewis-Skelly was shown a red card in the second half for bringing down Mohammed Kudus after a review by the video assistant referee in a similar incident to when he was sent off against Wolves last month.That decision was overturnedbut another reprieve appears unlikely after VAR intervened, with the teenager now set to miss the trip to third‑placed Forest on Wednesday through suspension.“First of all suffer, 24- 48 hours, suffer,” said Arteta when asked how his team will prepare for that game.”And feel the pain. And make sure that we come back on Monday with that bite and that anger still in the stomach for Wednesday.”West Ham’s win was only their second since Graham Potter was appointed last month and he paid tribute to his side’s dogged approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fixture has become significant around the world but in one north African nation it has a new edge as their rising star and their national hero come face-to-face.Omar Marmoush arrived in Manchesterin January after City paid £59m to buy him from Eintracht Frankfurt. The Egypt forward built his reputation in Germany and has added to it in the Premier League after ahat-trick against Newcastlefollowed some promising performances to indicate he is up to Guardiola’s high standards. Marmoush is a beacon in a disappointing season for City but has some way to go to match his compatriot Mohamed Salah, the man leading Liverpool towards a second Premier League title. From Alexandria to Zagazig, eyes in Egypt will be on the Etihad on Sunday as the country’s heroes do battle.Ageless Salah remains driving force behind Liverpool quest for trophiesRead more“Everyone is excited to watch the match, especially since it’s a big showdown between the two biggest teams in England,” says the Egyptian sports journalist Hamed Wagdy. “Salah has faced Mohamed Elneny at Arsenal and Trézéguet at Aston Villa with Ahmed Elmohamady, but this match is between two teams competing for thePremier Leaguetitle, even if Manchester City’s performance has declined. Marmoush is performing well, and there is much talk in Egypt and the Arab world about Marmoush as Salah’s successor in the Premier League and capable of surpassing Salah’s achievements in the future.”Egypt has a population of 114.5 million and Salah has an Instagram following of more than 64 million, while Marmoush has a relatively paltry 2.9 million. Football is big business in Egypt and producing two of Europe’s leading forwards is an exciting moment in the country’s progress in the sport. City and especiallyLiverpoolshirts are becoming commonplace there.“The match comes the day after the Cairo derby between Al Ahly and Zamalek, which will provide an opportunity for the largest possible number of Egyptian fans to watch,” says Wagdy. “In the past, cafes were crowded for all competitions due to Salah’s brilliance, and now the numbers will double due to Marmoush’s presence. I believe the viewers in Egypt will not be less than 10 million, especially since the population exceeds 100 million and the people love football.”Considering Sky Sports’ record viewing figures for a Premier League match stand at 4.5 million, the numbers expected in Egypt are impressive but they are not surprising. Salah put in plenty of hard yards as a child, making a nine-hour round journey from his birthplace in Nagrig three times a week to training in Cairo. When Salah returns to his hometown he is mobbed by locals, eager to get a glimpse of the man who worked his way up to global stardom. Marmoush was born and raised in Cairo and his commute was not as lengthy but he too showed great commitment and dedication. Sunday’s game will be evidence that the endeavour has more than paid off.“This is great, and we are proud of it as Egyptians in general and football fans in particular,” Wagdy says of Marmoush and Salah spearheading two of the world’s biggest clubs. “It provides an opportunity for many young football players to replicate Salah and Marmoush’s experience in European leagues, especially the strongest league in the world, the Premier League. Salah has been at Liverpool for eight years and, because of his brilliance, the number of Liverpool fans in Egypt has increased significantly.”Marmoush turned 26 this month and has 35 caps, 26 alongside Salah. Egypt have lost only twice in 90 minutes in the matches when the pair have combined and there is hope that they can take the team to new heights. Egypt are yet to win a World Cup finals game and want to secure a first Africa Cup of Nations title since 2010. Salah at 32 is showing no signs of decline and with him captaining the national team from the right wing and Marmoush on the left, the continent, at least, is fearful of the attacking options available to Egypt.View image in fullscreenFootball is big business in Egypt and the nation has produced two of Europe’s leading forwards in Mohamed Salah (left) and Omar Marmoush.Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images“Salah is considered the greatest Egyptian and Arab player and one of the greatest African players in history,” Wagdy says. “This is a result of what he has accomplished in recent years, whether in the Premier League or with the Egyptian national team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Basel and Wolfsburg respectively provided the next step in their schooling but both feel a strong bond with their homeland.“Marmoush will be the future of Egyptian football, especially as he is currently training with Pep Guardiola,” Wagdy says. “Everyone sees him as the one to bring back the Africa Cup of Nations title that Egypt has missed for 15 years, in addition to participating in the World Cup and achieving Egypt’s first-ever win in World Cup competitions.”English domestic matters, however, will be the focal point on Sundaytoday.

Wales led 18-10 in the second half before a Jamie Osborne try and three Sam Prendergast penalties for Ireland settled the contest.Prendergast kicks Ireland to triple crown success against spirited WalesRead more“We asked for two things: show the crowd some emotion and ambition,” Sherratt said. “And I think within [the playing] structure, which was important, we did that.”Sherratt had four training sessions with his squad before their third match of the championship, after defeats by France – in which they did not score a point – and in Italy, where they scored just 15 points.The dynamism and fluency of the Welsh attack in comparison to recent performances under Warren Gatland was clear from the start, as Jac Morgan and Tom Rogers tries helped to push Ireland all the way.“I think we got a little bit more of the training week on to the field than I’d imagined,” Sherratt said. “Credit to the players. We’ve really had three days training, so to replicate what we did Tuesday‑Thursday, I was pretty pleased. It shows it’s a good group.”Ellis Mee, the 21-year-old debutant Scarlets wing, was denied a potentially decisive late score for what the officials ruled was a knock-on. “That was a big moment,” Sherratt said. “A very tough call [for the officials]. You could tell that from the length of time it took.”View image in fullscreenMatt Sherratt, the interim Wales coach, takes in defeat by Ireland in his first game in charge.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty ImagesAsked if he will consider taking the Wales job full-time, Sherratt said he was “pretty certain on his next steps”, meaning a return to his permanent Cardiff role.Simon Easterby, the interim Ireland head coach, said Garry Ringrose’s 20-minute red card for a first-half tackle on Ben Thomas would “possibly” have been a straight red card before the introduction of the current system.

It’s the first time I’ve won the same title twice,” the delighted Russian said. “I’m really happy. I don’t know what else to say.”The opening set went with serve for the first 11 games, with Rublev serving to love on four occasions and Draper twice doing likewise, before the Russian finally broke the Briton to take the first set.WTA urges social media companies to do more after Raducanu’s Dubai ordealRead moreThe second set appeared to heading towards a tie-break when Draper broke for a 6-5 lead and served out to level the match.Draper had never beaten Rublev in their three previous meetings, and went into the deciding set with the wind in his sails, but Rublev showed no mercy. Rublev broke twice early on to storm into a 5-0 lead and while Draper avoided a bagel, the Russian fired down two aces to wrap up the win.“I really like Jack as a person and I really like his game. He has a really, really great career and future ahead. He will win many great things,” Rublev said.Draper failed in his attempt to win his third ATP title after winning in Stuttgart and Vienna last year, but the 23-year-old’s run to the final lifts him to a career-high 12th in the world rankings.“I want to congratulate Andrey. He was too good today. Outlasted me,” Draper said. “We played some really tough matches this week. In the third set he was a bit too strong for me.”Mirra Andreeva became the ­youngest player to win a WTA 1000 title when the 17-year-old beat Clara Tauson 7-6 (1), 6-1 in the DubaiTennisChampionships final on Saturday.The Russian, who beat three grand slam champions – Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina – to reach the final, will make her top-10 debut in the world rankings next week.“I’d set a goal for myself to be in top 10 by the end of the year. Now it’s the end of February and I’ve already made it, so this is something incredible for me,” Andreeva said. “I’m just super happy with the way I was playing today. I was hella nervous. I think you could see it during the match with all those double faults, some mistakes.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva plays a forehand on her way to victory.Photograph: Christopher Pike/Getty Images“So I’m just really happy that I could manage and deal with the pressure. And now it just feels amazing… this is something I dreamt of and now my dream came true so I’m just, I’m speechless right now.”Tauson raced into an early lead on the back of a strong service game while Andreeva made two ­double faults to find herself 2-0 down but the Russian quickly recovered and began playing her shots, breaking back to level at 2-2. Both players soon found their range with some heavy hitting, using the full width of the court to enthral the crowd. With nothing to separate the pair, the opening set went to a tie-break.Andreeva has yet to lose one this year and she was near-perfect as she won the first six points before taking the opening set when Tauson sent a return long.Tauson took a medical timeout before the second set and she was frustrated to lose the first game, throwing her racket on the ground. Despite a couple of sublime drop shots from the Danish player, Andreeva grew in confidence to take a 4-1 lead.Andreeva, who is coached by former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, then dictated rallies and began grinding down her opponent, firing winners with emphatic overhead smashes that left Tauson deflated as the Russian teenager went 5-1 up.Andreeva smelled victory as she served for the title and sealed it when another Tauson return went long on her second championship point.Andreeva also broke new ground as only the second teenager – male or female – to win the Dubai event since its inception in 1993, after Rafa Nadal in 2006.“Lastly, I want to thank me for never quitting and always believing in myself,” a beaming Andreeva said after she lifted up the trophy.Explore more on these topicsTennisThe ObserverJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

After a winter of financial discontent in which the club had to take a £500,000 advance in central distribution money to make ends meet, there was some much-needed good news on the eve of the new campaign when the club were sold to a consortium led by the Swiss investment banker Dario Berta.Peter V’landys issues plea to Donald Trump to attend NRL showcase in Las VegasRead moreBut when the Rugby Football League refused to sign off on the takeover heading into their first game against St Helens last week, the Red Devils took the controversial decision to field their reserves, given how they were still subject to salary cap constraints that left them unable to field a full-strength side.They were beaten 82-0 and the backlash was significant, given that game was televised on the BBC, reaching a larger potential audience than Sky matches. However, with that takeover approved earlier in the week, Salford were able to start their season properly here, and begin to look forward, rather than nervously over their shoulders.This was the start of a new and welcome chapter in their history. One of the few Super League clubs without a wealthy benefactor, they have never felt far from financial crisis. Their new chief executive, Chris Irwin, a proud Salfordian, hopes those days are now over.“The money that’s coming in is significant and there is a bigger plan around the investment group and what they want to do with the club,” Irwin says. “My job now is to ensure our club no longer needs to be walking around cap in hand. I think we have the tools to be able to easily avoid that.”View image in fullscreenJames Bentley goes over for a try during Leeds’ vcitory at Salford Community Stadium.Photograph: Craig Thomas/News ImagesBerta, Irwin and the new investment group have big plans, which include a possible arena being built on the land surrounding the Salford Community Stadium and transforming the club’s off-field fortunes.On it, there is less of a need for major surgery, despite this disappointing defeat by Leeds. Salford finished fourth last year and there is optimism they can challenge again in 2025. That is despite lacking the financial muscle of clubs such as Leeds. While the Rhinos have underachieved given their spend of recent years, Salford have been the exact opposite. They now have to meet fire with fire and put themselves on an even financial footing.But they can have no complaints about the outcome and their coach, Paul Rowley, felt he knew why his side fell short. “People have said to us that we must be buzzing to have the restrictions lifted but actually, we’re really tired,” he said after their defeat. “Our team run was flat, and this has really taken a lot out of the boys.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That should give them hope they can compete this year – and Leeds will share a similar optimism after securing their first win of the campaign.The Rhinos have again spent big in the transfer market but the early signs look promising, with new signings such as Keenan Palasia, Ryan Hall and the game’s outstanding player, Jake Connor, taking to life at Leeds very well indeed.Unlike Salford, who have punched above their weight with minimal expectation, there is huge pressure on the Rhinos and their head coach, Brad Arthur. Nothing is won or lost in the first two rounds of the season of course but in Arthur, Leeds have a coach with proven pedigree – and they have a squad of players that could well challenge, despite starting the season last weekend with a home defeat by Wakefield.And for Salford, while this may well have ended in grave disappointment on the field, the fact the Red Devils have come through the most turbulent of off-seasons unscathed should, in itself, be considered cause for celebration because at some points over the winter, it looked far from certain they would make it.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueThe ObserverSalford Red DevilsLeeds RhinosRugby leaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Let me count the ways… Apologies to Elizabeth Barrett Browning for mangling her celebrated poem to reflect Donald Trump’s multiple Ukraine treacheries. This most perfidious of presidents surpassed himself last week, accusing Kyiv of invading itself three years ago on Monday. “You should have never started it.You could have made a deal,” he fatuously griped.Candidate Trump, touting a just peace, pledged to end the war in a day. Now he praises Vladimir Putin, claims Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is “a dictator”and backs a settlement on Moscow’s criminal, one-sided terms. This deranged collapse into craven capitulation, this transition from American saviour to American Judas, took less than a month. It’s contemptible.The wider, negative ramifications of Trump’s infamy may take years to fully grasp. But its immediate import is plain. For Ukraine’s people, daily victims of Putin’s aggression, Trump is right up there with Brutus,Benedict Arnold, Vidkun Quisling and Lord Haw-Haw. Tens of thousands of civilians aredead or injured, millions are displaced and homeless. Now they are all Trump’s victims, too.Putin, a dictator in the true sense, launched an unprovoked, full-scale invasion in defiance of common sense, morality and international law. He is committing serial war crimes. Yet he’s flattered and excused, and told he can keep what he stole, by his White House gangsta bro. Trump should demand Putin’s arrest along with an unconditional end to hostilities. Instead,he plays lickspittle. He’s a disgrace to American democracy.Suggestions that Trump makes wild, disruptive statements for a reason are unconvincing. And it’s not mere recklessness or stupidity, either. He appears constantly angry, always demanding attention, saying whatever comes into his addled head. There is something slightly crazy about this behaviour. Is he mentally unwell? November’s election is ancient history now. Could Americans still choose not to be led by a lying lunatic for the next four years? The25th amendment says they could. Europe cannot fire him, but its verdict is already in. Trump and his astonishingly ignorant sidekick, JD Vance, are betraying their own country as well as everyone else. Trump attacks shared values – sovereignty, respect for laws, human rights – at home and abroad. Friendly governments cling to the wreckage as old postwar certaintiessink beneath them. Washington is no longer seen as a dependable ally, more actual or potential adversary.The breakneck US-Russia reset, symbolised by last week’s syrupy talks in Riyadh, has stunned European Nato states. Now they struggle to avoid a dire choice: break with the US and stick with Ukraine – or meekly accept Trump-Putin diktats. An emergency summit convened by France’s Emmanuel Macron, the closest Europe gets to a leader,dramatised their dilemma and divisions.Trump and Putin, the tyrannical twins, deserve each other, but the world does not deserve themUkraine is in shock over Trump’s unforced concessions and pro-Russia lurch: no return of occupied territory to Kyiv; no Nato membership, no US security guarantees, no troops. Less art of the deal, more art of the steal. Zelenskyy’s too-true jibe about Trump living in a “Russian disinformation bubble” hit a nerve, recalling theMueller reporton 2016 election collusion with the Kremlin.Trump is also furious that Zelenskyy spurned his brazen attempt to extort billions of dollars,in rare minerals and reconstruction contracts, as “repayment” for US aid since 2022. This shakedown illuminates an ugly truth. Trump, a cowardly, amoral bully, respects only power and money. He reckons Putin is winning. He wants to be on the winning side. It’s that simple. He acts the same way with Benjamin Netanyahu and Gaza, conflating realpolitik and real estate.The independence and security of “frontline states” – Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania – and of Russia’s neighbours in Finland and Norway are fundamentally compromised by US appeasement. Unlike Keir Starmer, Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister,will not send troops to Ukraine. He needs everything he’s got to defend a homeland with bitter memories of Russian invasion and partition.All these countries are already under hybrid attack in Putin’s sabotage and cybershadow war. Those in Europe who characterise theUS-Russia tryst in Riyadh as Yalta 2have a point. Does Nato’s mutual defence guarantee still hold good with Trump at the helm? Britain went to war over Poland in 1939. Eastern Europe was sold out to Stalin in 1945. Is history repeating?Starmer faces a battle in Washington this week to stop Trump making Russia great again. Macron will precede him at the White House. The UK and France are considering sending a “reassurance force” to prevent future Russian attacks on Ukraine, should a peace deal be struck. But Starmer wants reassurance, too: a US military “backstop”. His defence of much-slandered Zelenskyy may queer his pitch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What can it do? Most agree defence spending must rise, financed by new borrowing. Expanded joint weapons production and procurement is essential; $300bn in frozen Russian assetsshould be seizedto fund Ukraine; bans on supplying Kyiv with advanced weaponry, such as Germany’sTaurus long-range missiles, should be lifted. But Europe also needs to develop collective, pooled military capabilities, as advocated by Macron; or turn Nato into a European-led, no longer US-led alliance. Of its 32 members, only the US and Canada are non-European. Given Putin’s nuclear threats, creating ajoint European nuclear shield, constructed around the UK and French deterrents, is an idea whose time has come.Trump and Putin, the tyrannical twins, deserve each other, but the world does not deserve them. They appear hell-bent on a return to the great power era, to imperial spheres of influence.

Go whistlePhillip InmanAs China’s cheap prices continue to dominate western markets, attempts to revive or invent UK brands has never been tougherSat 22 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareBritons might never again get the chance to buy an electric kettle made in the UK. Even a £150 kettle from Dualit, the company most famous for making its celebrated toaster in Crawley, West Sussex, is produced by Chinese workers 5,000 miles away.Most consumers think the whereabouts of the factory or assembly plant riveting their latest purchase together is irrelevant, but those who do want it to be produced locally do not have a choice.There have been “buy British” campaigns in the past, and supermarkets, under pressure to show their support for UK farmers, continue to plaster domestic produce with union jack labels.These days it might seem a bit Trumpian to talk about fostering homegrown kettle making.And Malcolm Featherstone, who wants his nascent company to be part of a manufacturing renaissance, stood as a Reform candidate in Harlow, Essex in last year’s general election.Yet, this seasoned business executive, one of three founders behind theBritish Domestic Appliance Company, is tapping into the climate change debate and the post-pandemic concern about economic security much more than he is a sense of nostalgia for a bygone age.Sadly, he has tried to drum up interest in his latest scheme – manufacturing kettles under the brand Chameleon – to no avail.Featherstone says his experience after three rounds of fundraising is that “no one is interested in putting their money into UK manufacturing”, adding “everyone who is looking to invest is only really interested in two things, green finance and fintech companies”.He hopes to keep his business alive with a prototype and a fresh round of visits to potential investors, but admits “we are stuck at this time”.The company’s pitch should appeal to people who want to reduce carbon emissions and cut waste as the would-be kettle will be made in the UK – reducing transport costs – and like a Dualit toaster, have replaceable parts, also made in the UK. (Consumers would have to be willing to pay a premium, however – at £80 to £90, Featherstone’s kettle would initially be more expensive than its Chinese rivals.)“I didn’t see why every kettle on the shelves in Britain is made inChina,” he says. “There are Italian and German kettles, but we seem to have given up.”Avoiding Chinese goods in favour of domestic producers under the America First banner was a feature of the US president’s rhetoric in his first term. Since taking office for a second time, Trump has revived the slogan and said he will impose wide-ranging import tariffs to give extra support.China’s cheap prices are viewed through an ethical lens that marks Beijing down for using slave labourFor instance, in the US there are a number of statutes that require firms receiving federal assistance to prefer goods, products and materials made within the country’s borders. The EU has rules on imports to prevent domestic producers being outrun by Chinese imports, something the UK has stepped back from implementing.Meanwhile, slogans urging UK consumers to buy British have never gained the same traction. In 2023, the UK rana trade deficit in goods of £188bn, offset by a surplus of £173bn on trade in services to leave an overall deficit of £15bn.Maybe, says Featherstone, consumers will begin to look more favourably on UK-produced goods when they consider how complicated supply chains stretching halfway round the world can easily be disrupted, sending prices rocketing in times of economic stress.Concerns about environmental damage from shipments of fast fashion and not-so-durable goods from the far east could also give consumers added impetus to buy British.China’s cheap prices are viewed through an ethical lens that marks Beijing down for using slave labour and pursuing pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong while plotting to subsume Taiwan into a vision of greater China.China, though, has made deep inroads into western domestic markets, making it difficult and costly to buy elsewhere. And attempts to invent or revive mass market British brands have a chequered history.According to official figures, factory output accounts for 8.2% of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP),down from about 30% in 1970, indicating the diminishing role manufacturing plays in the UK economy.Except, a recent report by OxfordEconomicsand Lloyds Bank argued that with all the add-ons and service contracts associated with the sector included, its impact is far greater than the official measure, concluding it was worth £518bn in 2022, or nearly a quarter (23%) of UK GDP.Labour’s long-awaited industrial strategy isexpected to appear this summerand is likely to give support to homegrown manufacturing.Tackling high energy prices should be a cornerstone of new policies when, according to government data, a small UK manufacturer pays 25p per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with 19p in France and Germany. The cost drops to 9p in the champions of renewable energy, Denmark and Finland, and 8p in the US. Chinese firms pay less than 1p per kWh.Maybe Featherstone and business people like him will find backers when the costs underpinning their enterprises are lower. It would benefit the nation if the manufacturing sector can claim more winners.Explore more on these topicsBusinessThe ObserverManufacturing sectorChinaDonald TrumpForeign policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder women are giving up on itMartha GillWhen contraception has stagnated for decades, it is hardly surprising it’s fallen victim to culture wars and a wellness cultSat 22 Feb 2025 14.30 ESTShareSomething is changing when it comes to contraception. Lots of people aren’t using it. Last week we heard that this includesa third of young Irish people. Meanwhile, there has been asignificant rise in abortionsin England and Wales. Prescriptions for the contraceptive pill in England dropped from 432,600 in 2014 to 188,500 in 2021. And this month data from abortion clinics found that demand is being fuelled bywomen coming off the pill and using natural methods instead.When the study compared contraception used by women seeking abortions in 2018 and in 2023, it found that the proportion using smartphones to track their menstrual cycle had increased from 0.4% to 2.5%. The use of hormonal contraception among this group fell from 19% to 11%, while the group not using any form of contraception when they became pregnant increased from 50% to 70%.Why? When it comes to the declining popularity of birth control, two factors are at play. One is a conservative backlash against it, starting in America.Alex Clark, a pro-Trump media personality, has called the birth control pill “poison” and said it will cause “issues with fertility” later in life. She has even suggested it can “falsely make women feel bisexual” – claims that are all untrue. And conservative commentatorCandace Owens has denounced the pilland intrauterine devices as “unnatural”. Elon Musk has tweeted that hormonal birth control“makes you fat, doubles risk of depression & triples risk of suicide”.Videos on TikTok and Instagram, many exaggerating the side-effects of the pill, gain millions of viewsColliding with this is thewellness movement, which has a history of advising people to treat themselves with “natural” rather than medically proven methods. As the media landscape splinters, individual voices gain power to persuade. Videos on TikTok and Instagram, many exaggerating the side-effects of the pill, gain millions of views. Then there are individual bad experiences that may gain disproportionate attention, giving the impression that birth control is more dangerous than it is.Public health leaders are trying to combat these forces – the NHS has warned thatmisinformation about the pillon social media, especially a false claim that it causes infertility, is putting women off. But there’s another, underlying problem when it comes to contraception: it needs to improve.Many are deeply dissatisfied with the contraceptives we have. Bad information aside, condoms fail, IUDs are invasive and can be painful to implant, hormonal methods have side-effects such as headaches, weight gain, acne and depression. Of women who take the contraceptive pill, about a third stop in the first year, many due to health concerns and worries about side-effects.The cultural battle over contraception is largely focused on whether people should abandon existing methods, or whether that is irresponsible advice. But there’s another question we should be asking. It’s common for women to be using the same methods as their mothers – or even their grandmothers. Why aren’t contraceptives getting better?There is certainly appetite for new ideas. New products are often greeted with excitement: when Lo Loestrin, a hormonal pill with lower oestrogen, was introduced in 2011, it quickly became popular. But, oddly, there seems to be little appetite for developing it. Research has centred on small improvements to existing contraceptives. There were just20-25 industry-funded clinical trials between 2017 and 2020, compared with 600 for cardiovascular drugs in 2019 alone. While pharmaceutical companies tend to plough 20% of their sales revenue back into research and development,for contraception it is 2%. Funding is limited, propped up by the public sector.Why isn’t more work being done to improve contraceptives? Part of the problem is that when you give a drug to a healthy population, the safety requirements and litigation risks are higher, which may put investors off. Worldwide, the contraceptive market is still growing, despite dissatisfaction; many women are just accepting the trade-offs. This means there has been no big market signal that things need to change.But the history of contraception reflects the culture at large. While conservative forces are trying to push women off the pill by claiming it is dangerous, it was they who stymied research in the first place. Underlying this, too, is an expectation that women will put up with significant side-effects. As long as contraceptives work, unhappiness is ignored or underplayed.There is hope on the horizon. While women’s contraceptives have stagnated, a new range of imaginative treatments is on the way – for men. One, for example, isa gel that works to block fertilitywhen smeared on the arms and shoulders, without affecting mood or libido.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2011,a male contraceptive trial was haltedwhen it emerged that side-effects included mood swings and depression – commonly experienced by women on the pill.Nevertheless, the arrival of better contraception for men could make things easier for their female partners who don’t like the options available. Innovations for men could also cross over into solutions for women, as the bar for safety and effectiveness is raised.There is the risk, too, that, as male contraceptives suck up airtime and funding, women’s will continue to fall behind:almost half of pregnancies around the world are unintended– a high proportion of them in places where birth control is accessible.

This should be the ultimate aim of all the housing and planning initiatives of this government – whether through “cutting red tape”, “kickstarting” the construction industry with publicly funded incentives, talking about far in the future new towns, or promising unfeasible numbers of new homes.So far, these haven’t worked. But Cyngor Gwynedd, by charging a 150% council tax premium on second homes, and requiring planning permission to use a property for holiday lets, has succeeded.Not everyone sees it this way. “Botched second homes crackdown,” declaimed theDaily Telegraph, “wipes £30k off house prices.” But I imagine that the many residents of Gwynedd who struggle with expensive housing will be delighted.Commercial senseView image in fullscreenThe Pfizer building in New York, which is to be converted into about 1,600 homes.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersIn other promising housing crisis news, the architectsGenslerare designing theconversion of a 33-storey office buildingin Midtown Manhattan, formerly the headquarters of the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, into homes. About 1,600 apartments are promised by Metro Loft Development LLC and David Werner Real Estate Investments, which own the building, 25% of them described as affordable, in this and an adjoining 10-storey tower.Given that there are too few homes and too much office space – in Britain as well as in New York – the making of the one out of the other should be a win for everyone. It limits the need to build on green fields and reduces the carbon impacts of new construction and demolition. It’s not easy, though, to turn big office blocks into multiple homes, so it’s good to see it treated as a serious commercial proposition.The lesser evil?View image in fullscreenPalace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, London, where neighbours are rowing over Jon Hunt’s plans for his basement.Photograph: Bjanka Kadic/AlamyWhat side to take in the 20-yearplanning battlebetween Jon Hunt, founder of the aggressive and obnoxious estate agents Foxtons, and the ambassadors of Russia and Saudi Arabia? The former wants to add a basement to his listed mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens, London, also known as Billionaires’ Row, in order to house his collection of classic cars. The latter, who live nearby, along with ambassadors of less vile regimes like France and Japan, objected under the UN 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which requires states to “protect the premises of a diplomatic mission against intrusion or damage”.Hunt’s original plans for the basement, 82ft deep, with a sort of indoor ferris wheel for displaying the cars and an infinity pool on the roof, have been scaled back, but its volume is still equivalent to many ordinary homes. However, although aBBC investigationonce accused Foxtons of lying, faking signatures and other dubious practices, they haven’t actually invaded countries, bombed civilians or tortured people. Hunt is controversial but, relative to some of his neighbours, you have to say that he and his basement occupy the moral high ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our boiler has packed up, the new one won’t be installed for a week, and though it’s only the central heating that’s down (the cooker’s fine), the freezing cold has turned me into a toast monster. It’s all I want, a feeling I haven’t had since I was a student and living in a house that was so badly insulated, we sometimes had to break the ice on the water in the loo. How many loaves can a person get through in a week? Come back to me in a few days for an answer. I’ll give you a tour of my chilblains at the same time.What is amazing about toast is the way it has lately become so pimped. This started a few years ago: I first noticed it inMoro Easyby Sam and Sam Clark, a cookbook that came out in 2022 and whose opening chapter is devoted to the matter (toast with pepper, anchovy and chopped egg; toast with chorizo, tomato and chilli; toast with crab, oloroso sherry and alioli). The Clarks’ book came out of the lockdown, so this fixation made a lot of sense; these were recipes born of enclosure and experimentation. But since then, it has become a thing. Go to a certain kind of restaurant, and something-on-toast is a dead cert as a starter.Toast is always hard to resist, especially if it’s smeared with garlic and piled with cockles and bacon, but I also feel a bit wary when I see it on a menu. (What’s the mark-up on a slice of bread? Can’t I do this at home?) But most restaurants are playing it pretty straight, I would say. It’s on the domestic front that the situation is getting out of hand, the range of outré spreads that are available to smear on your slice having grown exponentially since 2020. Last year, to take just one example, thePollen Bakerycroissant butter, which costs £10 a jar, went viral, and now you must join a waiting list if you want to get your hands on it. (In case you’re wondering, it’s made from flakes of caramelised pastry that are whipped into butter with toasted white chocolate.)Go to a certain kind of restaurant, and something-on-toast is a dead cert as a starterI have flirted with these spreads. After visiting the London Library the other day, I slid into Fortnum & Mason to pick up, and then to put down, a jar of Mada Mada’s famed pistachio and rose praliné (£8.99 for 170g); I do like the sound of Milk’s whipped halva and pumpkin seed tahini (£5.80 for 200ml), which is also supposed to be good on toast (I associate halva strongly with my Middle East childhood, so it has a Proustian quality for me). So far, though, I’m not sold enough to buy. I understand that in hard times like these, people adjust their concept of what constitutes a treat; that we may over-splash madly on the occasional foodstuff because we’re spending as little as is humanly possible on everything else. But I also fear buyer’s remorse. Is there a more guilt-inducing sight than a jar, opened but used only once, at the back of the fridge or cupboard? A tin of good anchovies will probably do just as well.Or jam, of course. As I write, I’m working my way through the jars of homemade jam that have been given to me by friends over several years, and it’s proving to be the sweetest magical mystery tour, these talented preservers sometimes being identifiable only by their handwriting. Who made the sublime fig jam I’m about to finish, a conserve whose deep, plum colour Farrow & Ball should replicate immediately? (Stone Fruit – perfect in a bathroom.) And what about the peach jam that was last week’s project? What golden nectar!I loved the way it slid companionably into the holes in toasted baguette, dripping on to the plate below to await a judicious finger. I fear I’ll never taste its like again; when I took the empty jar from the dishwasher, I had to take a moment to say goodbye. I may indeed be a horribly greedy toast monster, but I’m also a very grateful one, every last bite a contemplative way-station on the long, cold road to boiling hot radiators.Explore more on these topicsToastRachel Cooke on foodFoodBreadComfort foodRestaurantsJams, preserves and spreadscommentShareReuse this content"

We’ve just lived through a few weeks like that. We’ve known for decades that some American tech companies were problematic for democracy because they were fragmenting the public sphere and fostering polarisation. They were a worrying nuisance, to be sure, but not central to the polity.And then, suddenly, those corporations were inextricably bound into government, and their narrow sectional interests became the national interest of the US. Which means that any foreign government with ideas about regulating, say, hate speech on X, may have to deal with the intemperate wrath ofDonald Trumpor the more coherent abuse of JD Vance.The panic that this has induced in Europe is a sight to behold. Everywhere you look, political leaders are frantically trying to find ways of “aligning” with the new regime in Washington. Here in the UK, the Starmer team has been dutifully doing its obeisance bit. First off, it decided to rename Rishi Sunak’s AI Safety Institute as the AI Security Institute, thereby “shifting the UK’s focus on artificial intelligence towards security cooperation rather than a ‘woke’ emphasis on safety concerns”, as theFinancial Timesput it.But, in a way, that’s just a rebranding exercise – sending a virtue signal to Washington. Coming down the line, though, is something much more consequential; namely, pressure to amend the UK’s copyright laws to make it easier for predominantly American tech companies to train their AI models on other people’s creative work without permission, acknowledgment or payment. This stems from recommendation 24 of theAI Opportunities Action Plan, a hymn sheet written for the prime minister by a fashionable tech bro with extensive interests (declared, naturally) in the tech industry. I am told by a senior civil servant that this screed now has the status of holy writ within Whitehall. To which my response was, I’m ashamed to say, unprintable in a family newspaper.The recommendation in question calls for “reform of the UK text and data-mining regime”. This is based on a breathtaking assertion that: “The current uncertainty around intellectual property (IP) is hindering innovation and undermining our broader ambitions for AI, as well as the growth of our creative industries.” As I pointed out afew weeks ago, representatives of these industries were mightily pissed off by this piece of gaslighting. No such uncertainty exists, they say. “UK copyright law does not allow text and data mining for commercial purposes without a licence,” says theCreative Rights in AI Coalition. “The only uncertainty is around who has been using the UK’s creative crown jewels as training material without permission and how they got hold of it.”The aim of public policy should be building a copyright regime that respects creative workersAs an engineer who has sometimes thought of IP law as a rabbit hole masquerading as a profession, I am in no position to assess the rights and wrongs of this disagreement. But I have academic colleagues who are, and last weekthey published alandmark briefing paper, concluding: “The unregulated use of generative AI in the UK economy will not necessarily lead to economic growth, and risks damaging the UK’s thriving creative sector.”And it is a thriving sector. In fact, it’s one of the really distinctive assets of this country. The report says that the creative industries contributed approximately £124.6bn, or 5.7%, to the UK’s economy in 2022, and that for decades it has been growing faster than the wider economy (not that this would be difficult). “Through world-famous brands and production capabilities,” the report continues, “the impact of these industries on Britain’s cultural reach and soft power is immeasurable.” Just to take one sub-sector of the industry, the UK video games industry is the largest in Europe.There are three morals to this story. The first is that the stakes here are high: get it wrong and we kiss goodbye to one of “global” Britain’s most vibrant industries. The aim of public policy should be building a copyright regime that respects creative workers and engenders the confidence that AI can be fairly deployed to the benefit of all rather than just tech corporations. It’s not just about “growth”, in other words.The second is that any changes to UK IP law in response to the arrival of AI need to be carefully researched and thought through, and not implemented on the whims of tech bros or of ministers anxious to “align” the UK with the oligarchs now running the show in Washington.The third comes from watching Elon Musk’s goons mess with complex systems that they don’t think they need to understand: never entrust a delicate clock to a monkey.

Like all such parties, the hard-right Reform UK poses as patriotic while grovelling to foreign interests, and this could be its undoing.But we cannot bank on it. The UK government must do all it can to prevent the disaster that has befallen several other European nations. If itfails to meet people’s needsand keeps echoingfar-right talking points, we could go the same way as Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Finland, Sweden and Austria.As well as working more effectively to keep Reform out of office, the government should ensure that, if the worst happens and Nigel Farage and his Death Eaters win in 2029, the foundations of an authoritarian state have not already been laid for them. But here tooLabourseems perversely determined to prepare the ground for its traditional opponents.Here are three of the consistent features of authoritarian states: the extreme persecution of dissent, the use of parajudicial measures to shut down opposition movements, and the selective application of the law. All three are already widely deployed in the UK. Though they were introduced in their current form by the Tories, they have been sustained and defended by Keir Starmer’s party.What this means is that if a hard- or far-right government starts doing what they always do – persecuting minorities and opponents, ripping into public services and the enabling state – and if good citizens take to the streets to defend the people and institutions under attack, the government will be able to round them up and throw them in prison, without the need for a single new law or statute. It will also be able to license blatant disregard for the law by its own supporters, without breaking existing patterns of policing. And Labour will be unable to say a word against any of it, because all this has been happening on its own watch.Let’s examine these three elements, and how they are already embedded. Two groups in particular are now subject to the kind of legal sanctions and oppressive policing more familiar in countries like Russia and Belarus: environmental and pro-Palestine protesters. Using a combination of older legislation and remarkable new powers in the 2022Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Actand the2023 Public Order Act, the police have been able to shut down any demonstration that they, the government or the media deem unwelcome.The measures and penalties are extraordinary. People trying to prevent Earth systems collapse have been sentenced to six months in prisonfor walking down a street; or five years for discussing a proteston a Zoom call; or have been prosecuted for correctly reminding juries that they havea right to use their consciences; or for seekingto justify themselves in court. Hanging over all such peaceful dissenters is the possibility of 10 years in prison for the remarkably vague offence of “public nuisance”. That’s more than you’d get for most violent or sexual crimes.These are among the mostdraconian anti-protest measuresin any country with democratic features. They are also the most extreme measures in common use in the UK for the past 150 years. The longest sentence received by any of the suffragettes, who engaged in far spikier actions than today’s climate protesters,was three months.Those protesting on behalf of Gaza are subject to all these oppressive laws, and then some. The police have used measures in the Serious Crime Act 2015, which were never intended for this purpose, to arrest campaigners against the genocide on suspicion of participating in an organised crime group. It’s preposterous and deeply sinister.It’s not just that Starmer’s government hasfailed to repealthese grim instruments and applications: it has actively defended them. After her attempt to redefine even mild protest as “serious disruption” was thrown out by the Lords, the then Tory home secretary, Suella Braverman, did something unprecedented: she reintroduced the measure as a statutory instrument, bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. Liberty mounted a legal challenge, and the high courtruled Braverman’s action unlawful. The Tory government appealed. After the election, Labour was widely expected to drop the appeal. Instead it hascontinued the legal fightto uphold a disgraceful infringement of our rights and freedoms.These laws are accompanied by a wide range of parajudicial measures, such asthe injunctions taken outby public bodies and private corporations, which enable protesters to be punished twice for the same crime. This means they facepotentially enormous extra penalties. Extreme bail conditions have also been imposed, which can restrictprotesters’ movements, political freedoms and social livesfor years on end.Even worse is the complete abandonment of equality before the law. Whether or not you get prosecuted for protesting is now a function of who you are. If you are a climate protester, you can get away with nothing. If you are a farmer, you can get away with anything. Even when, earlier this month, farmers blocked the road with tractors where the prime minister was speaking, drowned his speech with their horns and forced him to flee, the police let them get on with it.Thames Valley police explained: “No arrests were made or necessary. The protest has reached its conclusion and the group are now dispersing from the area.” It is unimaginable that a climate protest of this kind would be allowed to reach this “conclusion”. It would have been immediately broken up, with mass arrests and long sentences.Again, this selectivity is ready-made for the hard right. Farage has been appearing at farmers’ protests, using them toadvance toxic conspiracy fictionsabout immigration, just assimilar movements did sosuccessfully in the Netherlands. For a century, farmers have beencelebrated by the rightand extreme right as the true soul of the nation, endlessly threatened by “cosmopolitans”, “globalists”, immigrants, environmental regulators and other “alien” forces. Farmers have a fundamental right to protest, as we all do. But the blatant double standards in the application of protest law – the real two-tier policing – help to pre-legitimise authoritarianism.It’s not just that the Labour government should repeal the draconian anti-protest laws because this would create a fairer society today. It’s also because, in failing to do so, it primes the country for authoritarianism. Labour has helped normalise a far-right legal framework. What if a hard-right government sought to capitalise on that? It doesn’t take a leap of imagination to see what will happen if the two things come together.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump’s desire both to upend and dominate the established international order, and in particular his undermining of the postwartransatlantic alliance, is feeding talk of a watershed moment akin to 1989, when the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled an end to the cold war.His behaviour has strengthened a consensus, current among western politicians, diplomats and analysts, that the world is reaching a turning point, that the UN-led, rules-based, multilateralist system is crumbling, and that a new era of great power imperialism fuelled by authoritarianism, hyper-nationalism and left- and rightwing populism is unfolding.Trump’s “America first” approach – self-interested, transactional, overtly commercial and untroubled by principled considerations of justice, international law and human rights – reflects and entrenches this changed world. When his ill-informed, consistently wrong-headed instincts collide with the harsh realities of specific international issues, problems predictably arise. Gaza is a case in point. Trump imperiously ordered thefreeing of all Israeli hostages, and was ignored. Then he set an arbitrary deadline, which jeopardised the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire. He also proposed a US takeover of Gaza and the mass expulsion of Palestinians – an illegal, unworkable idea supported only by the Israeli far right. His noisy posturing makes things worse. All key issues remain unresolved.The incoherence and disdain for facts that characterises Trump’s approach is seen again in his handling of Ukraine. He says he wants to end the war with Russia – a laudable aim that most people share. But instead of supporting impartial, independent mediation, the US president has turned against Ukraine’s leader, Volodymr Zelenskyy, labelling him a dictator, and falsely implying that he profits from the war. Such projection is revealing. Trump’s ire stems in large part from Zelenskyy’s rejection of a$500bn minerals dealTrump wants as “repayment” for US aid. He seemed at one point to issue a de facto ultimatum: “Give me the cash, or I’ll back Russia.” Facing a loss of US support, Kyiv is reconsidering the deal under duress. But the war is no closer to ending.With his erratic, irrational policy missteps, Trump marches up and down like the grand old Duke of YorkWhat is much closer, to the shock and dismay of European and Nato allies, is an American rehabilitation of Russia. A 90-minute phone conversation between Trump and Vladimir Putin was followed last week by bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia, which excluded Europe and Ukraine. This outreach effectively ended Russia’s international isolation, begun after its unprovoked, illegal invasion of Ukraine three years agoon Monday. The volte-face shattered Nato and EU solidarity. Now a Trump-Putin summit is planned. By slandering Zelenskyy while praising Putin, an indicted war criminal – and making a string of ill-judged concessions – Trump upended western policy for no gain. He hasgreatly boosted Putin, who, it is feared, may next turn his gunsights on Moldova, Poland or the three Baltic republics.With his erratic, irrational policy missteps, fed by personal grudges, narcissism and mercenary greed, Trump marches up and down like the grand old Duke of York. One minute he says Zelenskyy is irrelevant, the next that he and Putin must sit down and talk. Some officials, such as the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, attempt amore moderate, reasoned line. But they appear outgunned by hard-right figures who have the president’s ear. Europe saw this at first hand at this month’s Munich security conference, when JD Vance, the US vice-president,declared war on European values and governing traditions. A particular target was Germany, where Vance – demonstrating extreme arrogance –backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)ahead of this weekend’s national elections. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s improbable defence secretary, added his tuppence-worth, warning Europe that it was no longer a strategic priority, demanding it pay more to defend itself and hinting at US troop withdrawals.Opinion polls suggest that these attacks, when coupled with Trump’s threats to impose swingeing tariffs on Europe and seize Canada, Panama andDanish Greenlandby force, have led many to conclude that the US is now an adversary, not an ally. A gulf is opening up across the Atlantic. Vance, Elon Musk and hard-right agitators such as Steve Bannon have a vision of a Europe run not by elected liberal-progressive coalitions but by people like themselves: Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Germany’sAlice Weidel, France’s Marine Le Pen and Britain’s Nigel Farage. No matter that the vast majority of Europeansoppose their multiple bigotries, racism and misogyny.It is into this chaotic, poisonous, ever-shifting world that Keir Starmer must trepidatiously step this week, when hemeets Trump in Washington. Trying to make sense of it all, and repair the immediate damage, may be the height of the prime minister’s ambition. Yet he must be firm in restating Britain’s view: Ukraine is the victim, Russia is the predator; Zelenskyy is a democratically elected ally, Putin is the dictator; Russian aggression threatens all of Europe and the US, Nato must stand united in opposition; Britain will pay more for its own defence, so will the Europeans, but the US should not and must not walk away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is it going to hit us, or not? Every day, a different answer.Last Tuesday,Nasacalculated it had a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, and so some people set to worrying. Twenty-four hours later, however, the agency provided an update. New observations, made since the passing of the full moon, show it now has a 1.5% chance of impact. Time to exhale? Not necessarily.The asteroid is estimated to be 40-90 metres wide, about the same size as a large building. If it does hit, and doesn’t splash down into the sea, it could decimate a city. Scientists calculate that its impact could be similar to that of the Tunguska asteroid, whichflattened an areamore than double the size of New York in Siberian forest in 1908. If it landed in central London, windows 20 miles away in Slough would be broken – an event that would exceed the wildest dreams even of John Betjeman, who once wrote a rather mean poem about the town.How to feel about this lump of rock hurtling towards us at 38,000mph? To pinch fromTheSimpsons Movie,is it the pub or the church for you? (Faced with catastrophe, the patrons of Moe’s Tavern run from bar to church, while the congregation of the latter sprints in the opposite direction, desperate for a stiff drink.) Most of us will keep calm and carry on, whatever the percentages. Seven years is a long time: you’ll be a size 10 by then – that, or getting divorced.The key thing about Armageddon is that it’s always in the future, as the followers of myriad cults have found to their cost down the years. Let us trust the experts – remember them? – to sort it out. A few years ago, Nasa significantly changed the orbit of an asteroid. The Dart spacecraftslammed into a 150-metre asteroid moonat speed, changing its orbital period by more than 30 minutes – a result that could be replicated, if planning began now.A few, should the predictions get worse, may go full survivalist, filling their bunkers with tinned carrots. But their number will be small. The news cycle is hardly relaxing at the moment, the old order as frangible as digestive biscuits. A person has the capacity for only so much terror, and now may not be the time to start worrying what will happen to Birmingham if YR4 turns out to be West Midlands-bound.The year 1998 came with its share of global calamities, but the notion of a world war seemed far away compared with today, which may be one reason why two big films about asteroids then played to packed cinemas.InDeep Impact, a comet on a collision course with Earth hits, causing a tsunami that destroys the US east coast, a mission by the Messiah spacecraft having failed to alter its path. InArmageddon, a rogue asteroid is broken into fragments by a nuclear bomb that is somehow inserted into it by, among others, an oil driller played by Bruce Willis – though it’s not all good news: Shanghai is obliterated by another meteor strike along the way. No prizes for guessing which film did better at the box office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But two scientists exploring which items from our technological civilisation are most likely to survive for many millions of years as fossils have reached an ironic but instructive conclusion: fast food and fast fashion will be our everlasting geological signature.“Plastic will definitely be a signature ‘technofossil’, because it is incredibly durable, we are making massive amounts of it, and it gets around the entire globe,” says the palaeontologist Prof Sarah Gabbott, a University of Leicester expert on the way that fossils form. “So wherever those future civilisations dig, they are going to find plastic. There will be a plastic signal that will wrap around the globe.”Fast food containersdominate ocean plastic, but aluminium drinks cans will also be part of our legacy. Pure metals are exceptionally rare in the geological record, as they readily react to form new minerals, but the cans will leave a distinct impression.“They’re going to be around in the strata for a long time and eventually you would expect little gardens of clay minerals growing in the space where the can was. It’s going to be a distinctive, new kind of fossil,” says the geologist Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a leading proponent of the Anthropocene as a new geological epoch that reflects the impact of modern humanity on the planet, who with Gabbott has written a book on technofossils,Discarded.View image in fullscreenThe rise of mass-produced synthetic garments mean clothes will make an abrupt entry into humanity’s fossil record.Photograph: Sarah Gabbott and Jan ZalasiewiczAnother fast food staple, chicken, is also destined for immortality. Bones are well known as fossils, but while those of modern broiler chickens are fragile – they are bred to live fast, dying fat and young – the sheer volume will ensure many survive into the geological record.At any moment, there are about 25 billion live chickens in the world, vastly more than the world’s most abundant wild bird, say Gabbott and Zalasiewicz, making them likely to be the most abundant bird in all of Earth’s history. The sudden appearance of vast numbers of a monstrous bird five times bigger than its wild forebear will certainly strike future palaeontologists.Clothes will also make an abrupt entry into humanity’s fossil record. For millennia, clothes were made from natural and easily rotted materials such as cotton, linen and silk. Today, the world’s growing population often wears mass-produced synthetic garments that are rapidly dumped.“We are making them in ridiculous amounts,” says Gabbott – about 100bn garments a year, double the number 20 years ago. “People would be surprised just how many clothes are actually out there in the environment as well. I work to clean rivers in the city of Leicester and about a quarter of the stuff that we take out is clothing. We also stick them into landfills, which are like giant mummification tombs.” As the geologists say in their book: “It is already clear that much of modern fashion will end up being, in the deepest possible sense, truly timeless.”The last of the signature technofossils is also the most solid example: concrete. It is already essentially a rock, so it is readily preserved, and it exists in colossal quantities. Enough concrete is cast each year to provide four tonnes to every person on Earth, adding to the existing 500bn tonne stockpile.View image in fullscreenSinking cities such as New Orleans are ripe for fossilisation, say the scientists.Photograph: Brett Duke/APZombie citiesAll fossils require a bit of luck to be preserved. Usually that means being buried under sediments in lakes and seas. So sinking cities, such as New Orleans, are where colossal concrete fossils are likely to be formed.Half of the city is already below sea level and Gabbott and Zalasiewicz’s prognosis is stark: “It is a zombie city, which will die by drowning, probably later this century, and so it is ripe for fossilisation.” Skyscrapers, building foundations, paving slabs, sewer lining and the city’s sea walls will all be candidates for preservation.An unambiguous sign of a human civilisation will be our own bones, and those of us who are buried will have already taken the first step to fossilisation. But again, only those entombed in sinking places are likely to be preserved.After bronze and iron, welcome to the plastic age, say scientistsRead more“Mountain burial grounds won’t last very long,” says Zalasiewicz. “But if you’re in the Mississippi [River] delta, or the Netherlands, or the Yangtze delta, the burial grounds there will, by and large, survive.” Even so, future palaeontologists are more likely to find the remains of our farm livestock, whichvastly outweigh us.To assess which human detritus will survive, Gabbott and Zalasiewicz make frequent analogies with existing fossils. Graptolites, a long-extinct group of small filter-feeding marine animals and the organic tubes they lived in, are common fossils from about 500m years ago. “The tubes seem to have turned into something plastic and some, when you extract them from the rock, are still springy – it’s extraordinary,” says Zalasiewicz.The cell walls of green algae provide another plastic analogue. “Fossils that are nearly 50m years old are made of this stuff that is chemically indistinguishable from polyethylene,” says Gabbott. The geologists conclude: “Our throwaway plastics look likely to persist on Earth pretty much for ever.”For ever is a long time and in reality all fossils will only last as long as the planet does, but it will take about 5bn years for thesun to engulf the Earth.View image in fullscreenMines, boreholes and nuclear weapon test sites have left a ‘pretty much indelible’ mark on the planet.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianUnderground scarsFossils are not just objects left behind, but also the traces of life’s activity written into the rocks and humanity is leaving a gigantic footprint. For example, we have drilled more than 50m kilometres of oil and gas wells, each piercing down through geological strata.There have also beenabout 1,500 nuclear weapons tests conducted underground. While relatively rare, the results were geologically spectacular: large spherical caves lined with melted rock that collapsed into a mass of radioactive rubble and are surrounded by a complex web of fractures. Along with mines and other boreholes, “this global rash of underground scars is pretty much indelible”, say Gabbott and Zalasiewicz.Just as enduring but far more subtle will be the toxic chemical signal left by humanity, not least the aptly named “forever chemicals”, such as PTFE. The metal in a non-stick frying pan is likely to dissolve away over millions of years underground, say the geologists, but the PTFE coating will persist as a thin flexible film.Humanity has created many near-indestructible chemicals, such as dioxins and DDT. Given that similar molecules produced by bacteria have been found in rocks that are 1,600m years old in Western Australia, these chemicals appear to be here to stay. “These forever chemicals are literally everywhere,” says Gabbott. “Then they get into sediment, and then they just sit there.”Another part of the surreptitious signature of humanity is the presence of radioactive elements sprinkled around the world by nuclear bomb tests above ground, largely between 1952 and 1963. These form such a stark signal that they were judged the best candidate to indicate thedawn of the Anthropocene.View image in fullscreenWiring in electronic devices may well catch the eye, as the minerals that form from copper are bright and beautifully coloured.Photograph: Sarah Gabbott and Jan ZalasiewiczThese chemical signs may seem cryptic and unlikely to be unearthed in the far future. But geologists found a similar trace that accompanied the demise of the dinosaurs: thin sediments enriched in iridium, an element found in meteorites. “The iridium spike is not at all obvious, unless you’ve got a super-duper spectrometer and sample just the right level. And yet we found it,” says Zalasiewicz.Our digital age is likely to leave less of a trace than the centuries when knowledge was stored on paper. Ancient fossil leaves and trees show that paper has a surprisingly high ability to be fossilised, and the graphite used in pencils is also robust. “It is endearing to think that it may be the fossilised scribblings of children that may survive best of all: a portrait of a family outside a house, perhaps, with the sun shining and a rainbow arcing across the sky,” say Gabbott and Zalasiewicz.Computer chips, though numerous, are tiny, and silicon is highly reactive with oxygen, making them unlikely to be significant as future fossils. But the wiring in electronic devices may well catch the eye, as the minerals that form from copper are bright and beautifully coloured, from azurite to malachite tobornite. Solar panels may also achieve immortality thanks to their distinctive shape and the sheer volume being produced.Their exploration of future fossils has led Gabbott and Zalasiewicz to draw some conclusions. One is that understanding how human detritus could become fossils points towards how best to stop waste piling up in the environment.“In the making of fossils, it’s the first few years, decades, centuries and millennia which are really crucial,” says Zalasiewicz. “This overlaps with the time in which we have the capacity to do something about it.”Gabbott says: “The big message here is that the amount of stuff that we are now making is eye-watering – it’s off the scale.” All of the stuff made by humans by 1950 was a small fraction of the mass of all the living matter on Earth. But today itoutweighs all plants, animals and microbesand is set to triple by 2040.“This stuff is going to last millions of years, some releasing its toxins and chemicals into the natural world,” she says, raising serious questions for us all: “Do you need that? Do you really need to buy more?”Discarded:HowTechnofossilsWillBeOurUltimateLegacyis publishedbyOxford University PressExplore more on these topicsPalaeontologyFossilsPlastic bagsChickenFast foodGeologyWastenewsShareReuse this content"

Each performance of its centrepieceCinéscénieshow, which depicts 700 years of French history, features more than 1,000 actors, hundreds of horses and about 800 fireworks.Now the company has set its sights on bringing itsbrand of immersive historyto the UK via a £600m investment to build its mock medieval castles, hotels and restaurants on farmland just off the M40 in Oxfordshire. It has asked the upmarket property firm Savills to help with its planning applications and is expected to look for British co-investors for a project that it says will create thousands of jobs.Some who live near the site, however, are dismayed at the lack of attention given to what they see as the French company’s dark underbelly, including ties to the far right and a past flirtation with Vladimir Putin. They question who their prospective new neighbours really are and what version of British history they plan to tell.View image in fullscreenA mock-up of Puy du Fou’s plan for it theme park in Oxfordshire.Photograph: Puy du Fou/PAThe founder and patriarch of Puy du Fou is Philippe de Villiers, the scion of an aristocratic family who conceived the project in the 1970s after discovering a ruined and nettle-covered Renaissance castle in the Vendée region of western France. The park quickly flourished and now welcomes more than 2.8 million visitors a year, making it the second most popular theme park in France, after Disneyland Paris.De Villiers has devoted his remaining time to politics and he founded his own party, Mouvement pour la France, in 1994. MPF’s manifesto included a ban on the construction of new mosques and a prohibition on gay marriage and same-sex adoption.De Villiers still has a weekly political television show, on which he regularly rails against immigration and Islam.At the funeral last month ofJean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s National Front party, De Villiers sat among the most prominent guests, who also included his longtime associate and friend, the far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemmour.A Paris court found Zemmour guilty of hate speech in 2022, his third such conviction, after a tirade against unaccompanied migrant children whom he described as thieves, rapists and murderers.“What he defends is what I live for,” De Villierssaidshortly after Zemmour made the remarks. “It’s what I suffer for, the defence of civilisation.”Defending civilisation appears to have left De Villiers less time for Puy du Fou. These days it is his second son, Nicolas, who runs the park.View image in fullscreenPhilippe de Villiers at an anti-abortion rally in Paris last month.Photograph: Bastien Ohier/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty ImagesThe younger De Villiers has focused on business rather than politics, but he did play a part in one of the more controversial episodes in Puy du Fou’s history. Father and son travelled to Moscow in 2014 where they met Putin in the Kremlin to discuss building two theme parks in Russia under the brand Tsargrad.Putin’s tanks hadrolled into Crimeaearlier that year, annexing the territory in an act widely condemned by the international community. De Villiers Sr, however, declared himself a huge fan of his host and promised to help “promote the history of Crimea as a part of the long history of Russia” by building one of the two proposed parks in the region.Puy du Fou’s local investment partner would have been Konstantin Malofeyev, a billionaire oligarch who had already been put under sanctions in the US, UK and EU over his financing of Russia-friendly separatists in Ukraine.Nicolas de Villiers may have sidestepped his father’s far-right views, but they stood shoulder to shoulder when it came to relations with Putin and Malofeyev. In an interview in the trade publicationAttractions Managementin 2015, De Villiers Jr described Putin as having “sweet eyes and sweet words”, and insisted the international community had misunderstood him.He said sanctions would not affect plans to build a Crimean park, and Malofeyev was a man of “great moral power”.In the end, the two parks never materialised, but Philippe de Villiers’ politics and the family’s open flirtation with Putin have not gone down well inOxfordshire.A Puy du Fou spokesperson said the company was not alone in having explored investment in Russia at the time, but had been “caught off guard by the rapid deterioration of the geopolitical situation in Russia and Crimea”.“Quite properly we cancelled this initiative once the international sanctions regime was established,” they said. “Our Russia initiative never went beyond an outline concept. Once we had made the decision to withdraw from the project, we have had zero involvement in Russia since then.”View image in fullscreenThe main arena at the Puy du Fou theme park.Photograph: Frank Perry/AFPCharles Harman, a former banker who has set up two charities dedicated to helping Ukrainians and lives next to the site of the proposed Oxfordshire park, thinks the damage had already been done by that point.“They were playing right into Putin’s hands, providing a propaganda coup for him,” he said. “The idea that they could be welcomed here with open arms, I find deeply offensive.”Natalia, a Ukrainian refugee who has lived in Oxford since fleeing Kyiv in 2022, declined to give her surname for fear of reprisals. She said: “I do not support anyone who supports Russian invasions anywhere, not only Ukraine but Georgia and other countries. For me, it’s really hurtful if the park is allowed because it will show the weakness of Europe.”Natalia said the greater danger might be more subtle – that the De Villiers family’s political beliefs and connections could filter through into the park’s output. “People’s beliefs are a very powerful thing. Once they believe something, it’s hard to show them they were wrong.”French politicians and historians, particularly on the left, have raised similar concerns. Sceptics include a group of academics who publishedLe Puy du Faux,or The Peak of Falsehoods, a book documenting what they saw as the park’s Catholic traditionalist, and potentially misleading, slant on history.One of the authors, Guillaume Lancereau, described the park as offering a “nationalistic, religious and conservative political agenda”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Trigger Pond, the local pub where she shared her concerns, has been serving thirsty locals since 1637.Van Thor, a co-founder of the North Oxfordshire Residents’ Action group, set up to monitor local developments, fears the De Villiers’ political affiliations cannot be divorced from their attitude to history.“This is going to be part of popular culture and there are a lot of people who find it hard to distinguish between fact and fiction. You need to be careful with that,” she said. “Who gets to choose the history that’s getting told?”The answer, in the past at least, has been Philippe de Villiers, who wrote the original scripts for Puy du Fou’s centrepiece show.The company did not address the Guardian’s questions about De Villiers’ political beliefs but has previously told French outlets that he is not in charge of day-do-day operations.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron with Nicolas and Philippe de Villiers at Puy du Fou in 2016.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesFrench corporate documents seen by the Guardian suggest he retains a significant role within the group. They suggest he is still a director of Puy du Fou France, the company that operates the park. He is also a director of Puy du Fou Stratégie, which operates on a not-for-profit basis and acts as a holding company.This entity owns 47.2% of Puy du Fou France, according to aninvestigationby the French media outlet Mediacités published in September 2023.It increased its stake to this level by selling the rights to use De Villiers’ scripts to Puy du Fou France, apparently in exchange for shares, the investigation found. The company did not answer questions about whether this stake had since increased.Even if De Villiers no longer controls the park’s operations, he certainly appears to have wielded his political clout to its advantage. Puy du Fou was one of the first attractions to open its doors when France’s Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, welcoming visitors before even Disneyland Paris. According to reports in France, De Villiers had lobbied Emmanuel Macron, with whom he enjoys a cordial relationship.Puy du Fou was excluded earlier this year from the Culture Pass, a government-subsidised scheme providing young people with access to cultural experiences. De Villiers denounced the omission as a “scandal” and Puy du Fou was duly included within a matter of days.Lacking the same political heft in the UK, the company has begun wooing local people. Executives from Puy du Fou have been in Oxfordshire, giving presentations to their prospective neighbours and attempting to allay concerns.Some in the community say the company has invited local politicians to France to showcase what Puy du Fou has to offer as part of its charm offensive.Puy du Fou did not directly address Philippe de Villiers’ political affiliations in response to questions from the Guardian. Instead, it criticised certain “nimby” residents who “clearly believe the way to defeat our project is to attack Puy du Fou by bringing up matters entirely peripheral to the relevant town planning issues”.It said some of the local criticism was “simply untrue and some is gross distortion, trying to create a conspiracy where none exists to gain media attention for their campaign”.The company said its investors, as well as local and regional governments in France and Spain, where it also has a park, had carried out due diligence on the company and did not have any concerns.It said it would not “engage in an endless Q&A about spurious matters dreamt up by people who only wish to block this substantial investment which will create an outstanding cultural project celebrating British history”.The company said it had an excellent track record of working positively with government and civil society groups “from left to right”.Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureOxfordshireEnglandThe far rightFrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The breakthrough – by researchers at the John Innes Centre in Norwich,Norfolk– opens the door to the creation of crops requiring reduced amounts of nitrate and phosphate fertilisers, they say.“We can now think of developing a new type of environmentally friendly farming with crops that require less artificial fertiliser,” said Dr Myriam Charpentier, whose group carried out the research.Excess use of fertilisers has become a major ecological problem in recent years and has been linked to soil degradation, while run-offs from fields are causing major pollution in rivers wherealgae bloomsspread across the water, and kill fish and other aquatic life.However, the research has uncovered a route that could lead to the development of crops that could reduce this problem by helping them scavenge nutrients from the soil more effectively – by gaining a little help from soil microbes. The basis of this approach is a process known as endosymbiosis, in which one organism exists within another in a mutually beneficial relationship.This activity helps some plants to scavenge nutrients from nutrient-poor soil using the assistance of microbes in natural settings. However, in agricultural settings, where fertilisers are used to boost yields, these disrupt the natural interaction between crops and microbes.The team led by Charpentier has announced that it has discovered a mutation in the legumeMedicago truncatulawhich enhances partnerships with bacteria and fungi that supply the roots with nitrogen and phosphorus. This process improves the plant’s take-up of nutrients.Crucially, the team – whose research was recently published inNature– showed the same gene mutation in wheat enhances similar partnerships in field conditions. This opens the door to the creation of wheat varieties that can exploit soil microbes to provide nutrients and so reduce the need to use large amounts of artificial inorganic fertilisers.“This discovery is created in a wheat variety that is non-GM,” Charpentier added. This means that plant breeders can use traditional breeding methods to develop varieties that possess the trait.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They illegally occupied Palestine. Would u support Russia invading Ukraine? Israel kill Palestinians everyday, didn’t see anyone caring. Also there are no civilians in Israel.”The doctor, responding to a post on X by the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak, also wrote: “Just take all the Israelis to UK away from terrorist Palestine a win for everyone, no?”Elwan’s posts were referred to the Home Office, which moved to cancel her permission to stay, the tribunal in Manchester heard. The department said it was satisfied her continued presence in the UK “would not be conducive to the public good”.Elwan appealed against the decision, saying it breached her freedom of expression and family life, which are protected under the European convention on human rights (ECHR).Davies found that immediate cancellation of her leave to remain “was not reasonable or proportionate” under the ECHR or common law.He said her conduct was “short-lived” and a “one-off” in the context of her “overwhelmingly positive and otherwise blameless length of permitted leave within the UK”.The judge went on: “Even though Dr Elwan did not make a full or public retraction or apology, she had taken down the posts even before the media publicity occurred.“It is clearly possible to imagine far more egregious posts having been posted by persons not subject to immigration control on that day. The posts, read overall, did include protected expressions of political opinion.“The [Home Office] also had to consider the consequences to Dr Elwan and, indeed, to the wider community, of immediate cancellation, requiring her to leave her existing post.”The judge quashed the cancellation of her leave to remain in the country as a skilled worker until mid-2027 and asked the Home Office to “take the decision afresh”. However, he rejected Elwan’s appeal against a decision to refuse her indefinite leave to remain in the UK.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIsrael-Gaza warNHSLiverpoolEnglandHamasHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Rabbatts had founded Time’s Up UK in 2018 in the wake of the #Me Too movement. Smith was previously director of culture and inclusion at the British Film Institute and in the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein scandal helpeddraw up a set of standardsto combat harassment in the screen industries.View image in fullscreenGregg Wallace was the subject of complaints about inappropriate behaviour.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer“People don’t currently feel as safe as they should in the creative industries,” Smith said. “We needed clarity around what it meant to be in a safe working environment.”She added: “What came to light is that part of the infrastructure of the creative industries was missing. You’ve got a workforce that don’t have HR departments.“What people really needed was a safe, confidential place to raise ­concerns, seek advice, get help. For creative sectors, there was this gap. Where do you go? Who has … ­independent oversight and who can provide impartial advice?”In research carried out in May 2024 by Bectu, the union for workers in the creative industries,84% of respondents saidthe sector needed an ­independent body to investigate, report and prevent harassment.The fact that creative industries, especially film and television, are mostly made up of freelancers and small companies exacerbated issues of poor behaviour, Smith said. People feared that speaking out would cost them work, while freelancers who did want to speak up were often unclear about who to report concerns to.In theFilm and TV Charity’s Looking Glass report 2024,41% of respondents to a survey said they’d experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination in the previous 12 months. More than half said they didn’t report this to anyone – of those who did report, 21% said the situation got worse.CIISA will not have enforcement powers, so it will rely on the creative industries to commit to the standards. However, breaches can be reported to the organisation and it will offer legal advice, arbitration and mediation, as well as support for individuals to access criminal justice or employment tribunals where appropriate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, Nandy warned the industry it must address standards of behaviour,following recent allegationsagainst d’Acampo, the celebrity chef. “If the industry can’t get its own house in order, we are prepared to step in. The time for action is long overdue,” Nandy told ITV News.D’Acampo“categorically denies” allegations of inappropriate behaviour. A statement from his legal team says: “This is the first time, six years later, he has been informed of these alleged incidents, and he does not accept them.” Wallace’s lawyers have said the suggestion he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature was entirely false.Last year’s Strictly saw misconduct allegations, including against dancer Graziano Di Prima, who left the show following claims he mistreated Zara McDermott, the Love Island star and his dance partner.The CIISA will initially focus on the screen, stage and music sectors, but aims in future to cover others such as gaming, publishing and fashion.A cross-sector approach was vital in spotting patterns of behaviour, Smith said. Allegations made aboutWallace, the BBCMasterChef­presenter, ­suggested even where claims were reported to one individual or company, it was unclear if information was shared, or who had responsibility to act.There needs to be “one entity, where people can report confidentially and safely, and we can build up [a] picture of concerning behaviour and deal with it appropriately,” Smith said. “You shouldn’t be having historical issues that have gone on for so long.”The CIISA hopes the creative industries can learn from past failures. “We’re seeing repeated stories in the press,” Smith said. “When things go wrong, how do we prevent that from happening again?”Explore more on these topicsMediaThe ObserverTelevisionFilm industryBBCStrictly Come DancingHeather RabbattsTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It was supported by government-backed investment, and was forecast to secure 4,000 jobs in electric vehicle production.BMW will now review the plans to manufacture battery-powered Minis at its Cowley site. “Given the multiple uncertainties facing the automotive industry, theBMWGroup is currently reviewing the timing for reintroducing battery-electric Mini production in Oxford,” the company confirmed in a statement.BMW chief says EU combustion engine ban will shrink car industryRead moreThe carmaker said Plant Oxford was “at the heart of Mini production, manufacturing and exporting a range of models which are sought after in the UK and around the world”.It continued: “Much of the investment is progressing, with construction well underway to make the plant future-ready. One of the projects is a brand-new state-of-the-art logistics facility.”The company has informed the UK government of its decision to review the timeline, and has confirmed it will not take the previously announced grant. “We remain in close dialogue about our future plans,” the statement said.Oxford Plant will continue to produce Minis with internal combustion engines in the meantime. The site, which employs 4,500 people and dates back more than a century, is still due to become an electric-only plant by 2030. The halting of the investment has called its future into question, and means BMW will have to pay import duties for longer than expected.When the £600m investment was announced, production of the electric Mini Cooper and the electric Mini Aceman crossover SUV at the site was forecast tobegin in 2026, marking a U-turn for BMW who previously wanted to export production to cheaper factories in China. That deal was brokered by Rishi Sunak’s government and included £60m in taxpayer subsidies.The current Labour government pledged to reintroduce plans made by the former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Car manufacturers have been given strict quotas on sales of electric vehicles, or they could face fines of up to £15,000 a car.This year, 28% of UK car sales must be electric – and this quota is expected to increase annually. In 2024, the target figure was 22%.However, demand for electric vehicles has declined as consumers are concerned about a lack of charging infrastructure and the rising costs of switching over from petrol and diesel alternatives.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We recognise the global challenges car manufacturers face and have listened to their concerns by consulting on reinstating the 2030 EV deadline whilst also protecting jobs – a decision supported by a majority of manufacturers who have been working towards this date, and are on track to meet their ZEV mandate targets.“We’re investing over £2.3 billion to support industry and consumers make the switch, tapping into a multibillion-pound industry that will create high paid jobs for decades to come, make the UK a clean energy superpower and help deliver our Plan for Change.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsBMWMotoringOxfordInvestmentsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

People [are] admitting that they would not seek emergency help because they are too afraid of ending up on a trolley in a corridor in an overcrowded A&E.”Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: “These findings reveal a shocking level of public fear about accessing urgent and emergency care.“Patients experiencing a health emergency should never have to think twice about calling an ambulance or going to A&E, yet many now feel they have no choice but to delay seeking help or attempt alternative travel options.“This is not just a crisis of NHS capacity; it’s a crisis of public trust,” Power added. Ipsos interviewed a representative 1,087 adults online between 3 and 5 February.The NHS has been struggling for years to meet its waiting time targets for A&E care, routine hospital treatment and ambulances to respond to 999 calls. In addition, people needing mental health support often face a long wait while large numbers cannot get NHS dental care.“Corridor care” in A&Es has become so common that patients have died there but gone undiscovered, with others “routinely coming to harm”, because overwhelmed staff cannot keep up with the intense demand for care, theRoyal College of Nursing disclosedlast month.The findings come weeks afteran inquest heardthat 91-year-old Dorothy Reid died after refusing to seek help at A&E after being forced to spend the night on a chair there on a previous visit, despite having a broken back.She had been left “in discomfort for hours” on her visit last March to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent. When she suffered a fall soon after, she refused to go back, despite being advised to do so. Reid died of a blood clot.Catherine Wood, the coroner for North East Kent who heard the inquest, said that Reid might not have died if she had attended and been treated at A&E a second time as recommended.Dr Nick Murch, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “There is a growing concern among clinicians about people feeling sick at home but not coming to hospital as they are concerned about long waits to be seen, or possibly corridor care, and as a result coming to harm due to delayed – or even non-attendance – with urgent problems.”Prof Nicola Ranger, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said “public anger is palpable” about the NHS’s ability to provide speedy, high-quality care. Frustration with delays means “nurses bear the brunt of it with verbal and even physical abuse.“People are alarmed at the state of the NHS. Members of the public are worried about turning up at A&E when they may be most in need of care, genuinely frightened about the standard of care they might receive.”The government’s forthcoming ten-year NHS plan “must restore public confidence”, she added.Ipsos’s research also found that 81% said the state of the NHS makes them sad while 71% said it makes them angry. Fewer than half (47%) think the NHS offers taxpayers good value for money but 58% believe it provides a high standard of care.Asked what they think of most when they think of the NHS, “long waiting times” was cited by the largest number of people – 57%. Other responses included “understaffed” (51%), “delays” (27%) and “high quality of care” (22%).NHS England did not respond directly to the findings. A spokesperson said the service “has been under significant pressure, particularly so over the last few months, with staff experiencing one of the more challenging winter periods on record”.People who need care should always seek it, from their GP, the NHS 111 telephone service or by dialling 999 or attending A&E if it is a life-threatening emergency, they added.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “People are right to be angry. Patients are being let down and taxpayers’ money is being wasted. The NHS is broken but it’s not beaten.”Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSHealthHealth policyEmergency servicesnewsShareReuse this content"

The RAC said: “Without any government funding, it’s hard to see how any further progress can be made.”The DfT, however, said it was working with the parking industry to “explore options for taking forward delivery of a national platform” and that it understood the sector “is both willing and able to deliver it without taxpayer funding”.There are thought to be at least 30 different parking apps in the UK, and it is not unusual for someone to have a number on their phone. Among the biggest are RingGo, PayByPhone and JustPark.A survey published in 2024by Autocar, however, found that “more than four in five motorists dislike using car parking apps”, with 83% saying they preferred to use cash or contactless card payments.The charity Age UK said many older people had told it they were “at the end of their tether” when it came to paying for parking because they were unable to park when an app or mobile phone was required.The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said many people were overwhelmed by the multitude of apps they had to use, “when in reality you want one that you like and you’re happy using and that you can use everywhere”.The NPP was intended to bring this “one app fits all” vision to life by creating technology that sits behind the various apps and connecting up potentially thousands of council and privately-owned parking sites into a single system.Live trials have been taking place since 2021, andRishi Sunak’s government officially launchedthe initiative in September 2023. It was originally expected to be rolled out nationwide in late 2024, until the general election intervened.In answer to a written question earlier this month, thetransport minister Lilian Greenwood saidthe Labour government supported the NPP concept, but “we are of the view that it could and should be delivered without the need to rely on public funding”.The pilot version of the NPP would be funded until the end of March while discussions continued, she said.Williams said: “It’s very disappointing the government has decided to pull the plug on the NPP after more than five years’ work.”A DfT spokesperson said: “We support the NPP and we understand the parking sector is both willing and able to deliver it without taxpayer funding. We are working closely with them on how this can be achieved.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringAppsConsumer affairsTransport policynewsShareReuse this content"

For nothing.”Last month, Johnbacked Paul McCartney in criticising a proposed overhaulof the UK copyright system, and has called for new rules to prevent tech companies from riding “roughshod over the traditional copyright laws that protect artists’ livelihoods”.Similarly, Cowell said a failure to regulate AI properly risked artists and people working behind the scenes “being wiped out”.“The thought that anyone would believe they have the right to blindly give this country’s creative ideas away – for nothing – is just wrong,” he wrote in the Mail. “I passionately care about people’s personal creativity – and AI shouldn’t be able to steal the talent of those humans who created the magic in the first place.“Anyone who is able to create something they passionately care about deserves to have their work protected.”Other figures supporting the campaign include the singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading and the Bafta-winning composer Nick Foster.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A commentary warned that western civilisation was at a tipping point, in crisis because it had lost touch with its “Judeo-Christian foundations”.The message greeted those attending a sold-out conference for politicians, policymakers, businesspeople and “culture formers” organised by the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (Arc) at the ExCeL centre in east London, where non-discounted tickets cost £1,500.The Conservative leader,Kemi Badenoch, and the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, addressed the gathering in person. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, and the billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel joined via video link from the US.It was not explicitly a faith-based event, but a distinctly religious flavour ran through the proceedings. The Arc’s co-founders and principal faces are Philippa Stroud, a Tory peer and devout Christian, andJordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist whose lectures draw heavily on the Bible.Among the group’s known funders is the GB News investor Paul Marshall, a hedge fund boss and media tycoon whose worldview is shaped by his evangelical Christian faith. According to one well-connected former Conservative MP, Marshall’s influence on UK rightwing discourse is growing, not just through GB News but also his ownership of the Spectator magazine and the Unherd website.Marshall is not a member of any political party and said ina pre-conference interview last weekthat faith and politics were a “dangerous combination”. But some rightwingers – energised by Donald Trump’s victory and beguiled by the rhetoric of his Catholic vice-president, JD Vance – see populist potential in advocating for “Judeo-Christian values”.View image in fullscreenThe GB News investor Paul Marshall’s worldview is shaped by his evangelical Christian faith.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe meaning of this phrase, much repeated at the Arc conference, is the “moral foundation of western civilisation” based on the shared values of Christianity and Judaism,according to Dennis Prager, an American conservative talkshow host. He added: “The ultimate embodiment of Judeo-Christian values has been the United States of America.”The term, drawing on both faiths’ biblical roots, was first used in the early 19th century to refer to Jewish converts from Christianity. Much later, it was adopted by conservative Christians in the US. The former Trump adviser Steve Bannon hasfought court battlesin an attempt to set up an academy for the Judeo-Christian west – a“gladiator school for culture warriors”– in an Italian monastery.Some believe the phrase has become code for Islamophobia. During Trump’s first term as US president, Meredith Warren of the University of Sheffield said it was adog-whistle myth peddled by the far right“to draw a line between imagined Christian values and a perceived (but false) threat of Muslim immigration”.Farage, whose populist brand of politics has rarely made reference to the Christian faith, told this week’s conference that Britons should have more children to restore traditional Judeo-Christian culture. “We’ve kind of forgotten that what underpins everything is our Judeo-Christian culture and that’s where we need to start. And if we recognise that, and if we value that, then I think everything comes from that,” he said.Badenoch did not use the phrasein her speech to the conferencebut has often described herself as a “cultural Christian”. She understands the “importance of Christian values as the foundation of family and community life”, David Burrowes, a former Tory MP and co-founder of the Conservative Christian Fellowship,said last year.View image in fullscreenDanny Kruger and Miriam Cates have been prominent voices in the growing influence of evangelical Christianity in the Conservative party.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe influence of evangelicalChristianityin the Conservative party remains relatively marginal, but it has grown in recent years via two prominent voices: Danny Kruger, an MP since 2019 who has become a leading opponent to legalising assisted dying; and Miriam Cates, who was elected to parliament in 2019 but lost her seat last year, who is a vocal proponent of traditional family values. Kruger and Cates are on the Arc’s advisory board.Georgina Waylen, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester who has been researching the influence of evangelical Christianity on British politics, said it had “grown in recent years, and most notably in the Conservative party, following the election of a small number of rightwing socially conservative evangelical MPs who were well organised, knew what they wanted to achieve and oppose, and have been aided by the increasing influence of evangelical Christians in the rightwing ecosphere.”She added: “The evangelicals work effectively with others, including some rightwing populists, and have taken advantage of the chaos in the Conservative party. They have been active around gender identity issues and oppose assisted dying.”Evangelical conservative Christian groups have been active in lobbying MPs on issues such as abortion and assisted dying, although their involvement has not always been explicit. In November, anObserver investigationfound that Christian pressure groups were secretly coordinating and funding anti-assisted dying campaigns ostensibly led by grassroots healthcare workers and disabled people.Organisations on the US Christian right have beenaccused of “infiltrating” the UK, lobbying MPs to restrict women’s reproductive rights. Last year, the UK branch of the US-based Alliance Defending Freedom provided “briefing material and legal analysis” to MPs before a vote on introducing buffer zones to prevent anti-abortion activity outside abortion clinics.One reason for the sometimes covert involvement of such groups is the resistance of many people in a largely secular society to religious individuals or organisations seeking to impose their worldview on others. Evangelical Christians have fared poorly in UK politics whenever their views have come into conflict with principles fundamental to British liberal democracy.“Religion is much less of a factor in politics here than in the US,” said Nick Spencer of Theos, a Christian thinktank. “But the Christian right is gaining momentum. I don’t think the Arc conference would have got off the ground 10 years ago.”Those speaking at the conference appeared to be a mixture of conservative Christians, social conservatives, libertarians and “Maga-types”, he said. “It is clear what they’re against – internationalism, net zero, the denigration of national history – but these aren’t necessarily theological positions.”Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, said there was “no comparison whatsoever between the US and UK. Britain is one of the most secular societies in the world. Very few people go to church. The largest group are the people who say they have no religion at all. The kind of highly polarised debate that the Americans have had over abortion is inconceivable in the same way.”But he added: “At the level of political elites, that’s where you get the most interesting similarity that is also a difference. In the US, evangelical Christians are a huge part of politics because they are a huge part of US life. Here you have quite a remarkably high density of evangelical Christians in elite politics.”Some evangelical Christian organisations have sought to nurture potential high-flyers in order to ensure a Christian presence in the upper reaches of public life. Half a century ago, the Iwerne Trust’s Christian holiday camps, mainly for boys attending elite public schools, had precisely this goal. Holy Trinity Brompton, London’s foremost evangelical church, has counted many high-flyers among its congregation –including Marshall.Not all evangelical Christians share the same political views. Tim Farron, the former Liberal Democrat leader whoresigned in 2017saying the role was incompatible with his Christian faith, said the use of the term “Christian values” was sometimes “a proxy for things that aren’t very Christian at all”.He said: “People who talk about the loss of Christian values often have actually lost touch with Christian values themselves. It’s really dangerous when political parties seek to appropriate Christianity for their own ends.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsChristianityJudaismReligionUS politicsKemi BadenochNigel FaragefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also boasted that his administration had terminated temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Haitian immigrants and attempted to ban birthright citizenship for children of non-legal permanent residents.“We’ve begun the largest deportation operation in American history,” Trump said.In one of several digressions, Trump portrayed his return to office as a victory over what he called a “sinister group of radical informers, war-mongers and corrupt special interests” whom he claimed had previously controlled Washington. The president reserved particular ire for media outlets, labeling MSNBC a “threat to democracy” and mocking Rachel Maddow, whose show is watched bymore than 2 million viewers, for what he claimed were her low ratings.He also claimed Democrats had “lost their confidence” and possessed “the worst policy in history” while boasting about his administration’s first month in office.“Nobody has seen four weeks like we’ve had,” he said.Some of the other early moves he discussed included sweeping cuts to the federal workforce and regulations,baseless allegationsof massive social security fraud, withdrawal from international climate agreements and the imposing of new tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.He also addressed ongoing international conflicts, incorrectly claiming that US aid to Ukraine had exceeded European contributions, and saying the United States had sent $350bn to the war-torn country since the Russian invasion in 2022. That number isn’t close to the amount the US has allocated, with a government oversight officeputting that estimatecloser to $183bn. European nations have combined to contribute more.He noted the recent return of Israeli hostages while claiming that “Biden got back zero”, apparently forgetting that the US helped brokerthe return of 105 hostagesin November 2023.The annual conference has become a key venue for Republican politicians to connect with conservative grassroots activists, though it’s clear the event has abandoned traditional GOP policies to fully embrace Trump’s Maga-centric approach.Several international conservative politicians attended the speech, including the Argentine president, Javier Milei, who is currently facing a widespread crypto scandal; the Polish president, Andrzej Duda; and the British Reform party leader, Nigel Farage, all praised by Trump during his remarks.Explore more on these topicsCPACDonald TrumpMarylandTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the hospital was “secure”.UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through US hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make healthcare one of the nation’s most violent fields, with workers suffering more non-fatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper.

He subsequently specialised in crime films: Grosse Pointe Blank, which starred John Cusack and Minnie Driver, was his biggest commercial hit, and his final directorial credit was theElmore Leonardadaptation The Big Bounce in 2004.Born in Connecticut in 1942, Armitagemoved to California with his family in 1956, and got a job in the mailroom at 20th Century Fox. He quickly moved into production, and became an associate producer on Peyton Place in 1967. He was keen, however, to work on something more cutting edge, and after getting to know Corman was assigned a project with the concept: “Everybody over thirty died.” Armitage wrote the script that became Corman’s 1970 post-apocalyptic satire Gas! Or It Became Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It.Corman then gave him sexploitation thriller Private Duty Nurses to direct, and a year later he was asked to write and direct Hit Man, which Armitage said later he wasn’t initially told was a reworking of the Michael Caine thriller. Armitage also said he was reluctant to make the film as a black director would have done it better, but agreed to direct it after Corman felt the leading actor, Bernie Casey, was too inexperienced to take the job on.View image in fullscreenCusack, left, and Minnie Driver in Grosse Pointe Blank.Photograph: Buena Vista/AllstarIn 1976 Armitage wrote and directed action thriller Vigilante Force for Corman; it was about a group of mercenaries who take over a small town, and starred Kris Kristofferson and Jan-Michael Vincent. Aside from the 1979 TV movie Hot Rod, inspired by his teenage experiences in California, Armitage concentrated on writing for the next decade; his next opportunity to direct came via his former Corman compadre Jonathan Demme, who passed the Charles Willeford adaptation Miami Blues to him. Starring Alec Baldwin, Fred Ward and Jennifer Jason Leigh, Miami Blues was an indie hit and led to John Cusack, who had optioned Grosse Pointe Blank from writer Tom Jankiewicz,asking Armitage to direct.Released in 1997, Grosse Pointe Blank starred Cusack as a psychologically troubled hitman who returns to his hometown and attends his high school reunion; Armitage later said he insisted on cutting the script, which Cusack and his collaborators Steve Pink and DV DeVincentis had rewritten, down to 100 pages, but his improvisatory directing style allowed the cast to restore much of it. Armitage followed it up with The Big Bounce, which starred Owen Wilson and Sara Foster; he said he was disappointed with the result after cuts were made in postproduction – as was Leonard, whocalled it the worst movie ever made.The Big Bounce was Armitage’s final credit; he subsequently acted as an uncredited mentor and script doctor on other people’s projects.Armitage is survived by his son Brent Armitage, also a film-maker.Explore more on these topicsFilmJohn CusackFilm adaptationsElmore LeonardShareReuse this content"

Lunar Trailblazer’s two year mission is scheduled to begin on Thursday when the probe is blasted into space from Florida on aSpaceX Falcon rocket.Its goal – to seek out water on the lunar surface – may seem odd given that the moon has traditionally been viewed as an arid, desiccated world. However, scientists have recently uncovered strong hints that it possesses significant quantities of water. It will be the task of Lunar Trailblazer to reveal just how much water there is near the lunar surface and pinpoint its main locations.The probe’s progress will be followed with keen interest by space engineers and astronomers who believe lunar water could play a key role in plans to set up staffed colonies on the moon. Using power provided by solar power plants, water could be turned into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen. The former would then be used as fuel while the latter would allow astronauts to breathe.“This is primarily a scientific mission,” said Prof Neil Bowles, leader of the Oxford University team of physicists who built one of Lunar Trailblazer’s main instruments. “However, it should also tell us how water is transported across the lunar surface and that has implications for future lunar exploration by humans.”View image in fullscreenThe Lunar Trailblazer is to embark on a two-year mission.Photograph: Lockheed Martin Space/NasaUntil recently it had been assumed that water molecules brought to the moon by meteorites and comets would decompose quickly as sunlight broke them down into hydrogen and oxygen which would then have drifted into space. However, several robotic probes have recently found compelling evidence that water, mainly in the form of ice, exists in fairly large amounts in some deep, permanently shadowed craters, with the lunar south pole offering the most promising candidates.These discoveries were taken even further by India’s Chandrayaan-1 probe that found, in 2009, thattraces of watercould been seen on the moon’s surface far away from the poles. “It was a big surprise that changed our perceptions of what we might find on the moon,” said Bowles.However, the instrument on Chandrayaan-1 that made the discovery did not have the spectral range to fully map out water on the lunar surface and Lunar Trailblazer has been designed to get round that problem. It will carry two instruments. The first is an infrared scanner that will pinpoint water and other geological features. The second, designed by Bowles and his team, is a thermal mapper that is essentially a highly advanced heat camera.Working in tandem, these instruments should then be able to create a water map of the lunar surface. “We know there is water at the moon’s poles but we are not sure how it ended up there,” said Bowles. “We think there is a kind of lunar water cycle just as there is one on Earth although in the case of the one on the moon it has nothing to do with clouds or rain.”There are two main scenarios, he added. “Either water is delivered by comets or meteorites that hit the lunar surface and release lots of water which then condenses in cold traps at the poles. Alternatively very thin layers of water may be formed by reactions in the lunar soil.“However, we do not know how that water would move around and build up into ice deposits. That is what we are trying to find out. We are interested in understanding why there is water on the moon and how it behaves there and that is important not just for our understanding of the moon but in appreciating what might be happening on other worlds that are similar to the moon, such as Mercury.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The launch manifest also includes the rocket’s main mission, IM-2, a lunar lander built by the US company Intuitive Machines. It is destined to settle on to the moon where it will drill beneath the surface in a bid to find water there.In addition to these craft, there will be a probe – named Odin by its builder AstroForge – that will fly to a very different destination: asteroid 2022 OB5. Odin will take images there in preparation for a return mission which is planned to land on the asteroid and begin mineral extraction on its surface.These missions are all part of Nasa’s commercial lunar payload services programme which has been set up to encourage companies to send small robotic landers and rovers to the moon and other near Earth destinations. The main aim is to make preparations for the eventual colonisation of the moon.Explore more on these topicsThe moonThe ObserverSpaceNasanewsShareReuse this content"

Some audiologists are beginning to worrySome specialists suspect that constantly filtering out background noise may have unintended consequencesIan SampleScience editorSat 22 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 04.21 ESTShareThey are prized for making the commute more bearable and shielding against the din of daily life. But noise-cancelling headphones have come under scrutiny after audiologists raised concerns that overuse might impair people’s hearing skills.While the technology has clear benefits, not least in helping people listen to music at lower volume, some specialists suspect that constantly filtering out background noise may have unintended consequences.Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, has seen an uptick in adults coming to her clinic with hearing issues only for tests to suggest their hearing is fine.The problem is with their brain, not their ears. They might fail to locate where a sound is coming from, or struggle to follow a conversation on the train, in a bar or at a restaurant.The condition, known as auditory processing disorder (APD), is often diagnosed in children, so the rise in adults with similar issues struck Almeida as odd. Her hunch is that widespread use of noise-cancelling headphones could be the culprit.“The brain is used to dealing with thousands of different sounds at the same time and it’s always been able to figure out what is and isn’t worth listening to. If a dog barks outside, in a split second I recognise that it’s a dog barking and I don’t really care,” she says. “With noise cancelling, you’re giving your brain only one source of sound, be it a podcast or music. One source. There’s nothing else for your brain to worry about.”Excessive use of noise-cancelling headphones could impair the developmental process by which children learn to attend to sounds, Almeida says. For adults, it could make their brains lazy, just as muscles weaken without exercise. In both cases, she says, people could struggle to extract speech from the hubbub around them.There is no scientific evidence that noise-cancelling headphones cause APD. Nor is there any robust data showing a rise in the condition. But Almeida believes the question warrants attention. “Studies definitely need to be done,” she says. “The research should focus on the effects of extended use, especially in young people.”APD affects about three to five per cent of school-age children. It has been linked to low birth weight, but also chronic middle ear infections. In older adults, the condition can be triggered by stroke or head trauma. In many cases, the cause is never clear.Dr Cheryl Edwards, an audiologist at Boston children’s hospital, said children with APD could struggle to hear in classrooms, have difficulty working out where sounds are coming from, and miss nonverbal cues such as the shift in tone that flags sarcasm. Reading and spelling can also suffer. “We certainly see academic issues,” she says.Whether cases are rising is harder to say, however. Auditory processing has long been a speciality within a speciality, Edwards says. And while referrals have risen with better awareness, there aren’t reliable records to measure any trend against.According to Harvey Dillon, a professor of auditory science at the University of Manchester, there is no doubt that listening experience affects our ability to segregate “wanted speech” from background noise. He says children improve at using spatial cues to home in on sound sources from the age of five to 14 years old.But disrupting what is heard can be more problematic for children than adults. If a child has repeated ear infections before the age of five, they can find it hard, later on, to focus on sounds from one direction while suppressing those from another. Surprisingly, Dillon says, many don’t catch up once their infections are behind them. Instead, they need to learn the skill through intensive training on apps such asSound StormorSoundiverse.Adults seem to be different. If a person wears a single earplug for a week, they will gradually relearn how to locate where sounds are coming from. When the earplug is removed, their ability dips again, but quickly recovers to its previous level.For Dillon, the idea that noise-cancelling headphones might be driving APD is a hypothesis yet to be tested. “There is no research that I am aware of investigating a link between the use of noise-cancelling headphones and reduced auditory processing ability,” he says.Dillon cautions that loud music can damage neurons in the auditory system without affecting the thresholds measured in hearing tests. “It may be that listening to loud music is the cause of the auditory processing problem, not the noise-cancelling feature,” he says. “If so, noise cancelling could be a good feature, in that it allows one to listen to music, without interference from background noise, at a lower level.”Prof Dani Tomlin, the head of audiology and speech pathology at the University of Melbourne, says people who use noise-cancelling headphones for prolonged periods may find listening harder when they take them off. But she says “the benefits should not be overlooked”, for managing sensory inputs in neurodiverse people and helping individuals to listen to podcasts and movies on planes and trains.“Instead of suggesting abandoning noise-cancelling headphones, we need more comprehensive research studies,” she adds.For now, Almeida recommends bone conduction headphones and hearing training. She urges patients to listen to radio debates and to take down the lyrics of rap songs when they are playing. “There is immense plasticity in the brain,” she says. “Make an effort to listen to what’s being said.”Explore more on these topicsScienceHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 16 patients have been hospitalized as a result.The majority of reported measles cases were in children and teenagers; minors between the ages of five and 17 accounted for 51 cases.Childrenunder four made up 26 cases. Most patients’ parents either had chosen to not immunize them against the highly contagious illness through vaccines meant to prevent the potentially deadly illness and its spread, or their vaccination status was unknown.Experts have warned that additional cases are “likely to occur” in South Plains and neighboring communities, given measles’ contagious nature. At least nine measles cases have already been reported in Lea county, New Mexico, which borders the region where theTexasoutbreak is occurring.A DSHS spokespersontold ABC Newsthat the latest outbreak is the worst officials have seen in 30 years.Gaines county, located in rural western Texas, is the epicenter of the latest outbreak, with 57 reported cases. The county, with 22,523 residents, had one of the state’shighest immunization exemption ratesfor the 2023-24 school year, according to DSHS data. Nearly 18% of students opted out of vaccinations, which had all but eradicated measles and other contagious illnesses before skeptics undermined confidence in them among some in the US.Tonya Guffey, the chief nursing officer at Seminole hospital district,told NBC Newsmany unvaccinated people in Gaines county are Mennonite, a denomination of Christianity.“We have a high, high number of unvaccinated,” said Guffey to NBC. “It’s not that they’re not educated. It’s just what their belief is.”She added: “We educate, we encourage, we do what we can for the community, but it’s their choice.”Some school districts do make getting vaccinations against measles a mandatory attendance requirement.In 2024,the US had 285 measles cases, the highest number since 2019, when nearly 1,300 cases were reported. Children under age five accounted for 120 cases, or 42%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has 1.25 million subscribers and has featured guests from Reform UK’s Nigel Farage, to the centre-right Tory Rory Stewart and the Canadian psychology professor and culture warriorJordan Peterson.The podcast is known for its promotion of free speech and attraction to controversial subjects, with Kisin named in 2023 by the New Statesman as one of the top 50 rightwingers in British politics.But despite hosting many rightwing antagonists on his podcast, Kisin has long fought off the description of his politics – anti-woke, pro-west, in favour of defending borders and recently pro-Trump – as “right wing”.Kisin, who describes himself as a “politically non-binary satirist”, claims to be challenging the perception that defence of free speech should be a rightwing position, and has previously referred to himself as a centrist-liberal remainer who has only ever voted Labour or Lib Dem, and whose comedy heroes are Bill Hicks and George Carlin.He has also written a Sunday Times bestseller called An Immigrant’s Love Letter to the West, which identifies the west as suffering from guilt in discussions about the history of slavery and colonialism. In the book, which is part memoir, he recounts a family history of repression and persecution in SovietRussia, giving rise to his own commitment to defending free speech. His father served as a junior minister in one of Boris Yeltsin’s cabinets before coming to the UK.A repeated critic of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, he appeared on the BBC’s Question Time in 2022 to condemn Russia’s actions and recently called Trump’s description of Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator “absurd”.He is, however, a defender of Trump in other ways. On his own social media, Kisin is forthright on a number of hard-right talking points, posting on X in 2023: “Diversity = anti-white people, inclusion = exclusion, anti-racism = racism.”He does appear to acknowledge that he has been on something of a journey politically. Kisin recently recorded aYouTube video, in which he described his opposition to some Democratic policies on trans issues and relief that Trump had won the US election, saying: “If opposing this insanity makes me right wing, then so be it. The choice is between civilisation and people who think men can give birth. Everything else is fluff.”The video is entitled: “Fine, call me ‘right wing’.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsFreedom of speechSocial mediaRussiaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the four victims – who were all targeted in 2021 and 2022 – awoke from a coma after Phelps gave him prescription sedatives over the course of a week, Evans added.Previous victim of woman linked to death of journalist says he tried to warn publicRead moreIn one instance, Phelps is alleged to have kidnapped a victim by heavily sedating him and taking him across the US-Mexico border in a wheelchair – and then to aMexicoCity hotel room, where he was later found dead.After incapacitating her victims, Evans said, Phelps stole their cars, withdrew money from their bank accounts, used their credit cards to purchase luxury items and gold, and even tried to access social security and retirement accounts.According to the indictment, Phelps met one man in July 2021, went on lunch dates with him, ordered lunch to his house that November and slipped him a prescription drug.While he was “mostly unconscious” for about five days, Phelps gained access to his accounts and stole his iPhone, iPads, driver’s license and bank cards, according to the indictment. She also allegedly accessed his E-Trade account and sold Apple stock worth about $3.3m, though she was unable to withdraw that money.Authorities believe Phelps used popular dating apps including Tinder, Hinge and Bumble to find her targets. The men were lonely and looking for companionship and went on multiple dates with Phelps before she stealthily gave them sedatives, according to Evans.“It’s folks that are out looking for love that ran into something far more sinister,” Evans said.Phelps, a dual citizen of Mexico and the US, had been on the FBI’s radar for a couple of years, according to Evans. He declined to comment on her criminal history.Phelps does not have a US-based attorney who could speak on her behalf, a spokesperson for the justice department said. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment with Mexico’s foreign affairs ministry and attorney general’s office.Several of the victims’ relatives called authorities when they were unable to contact their loved ones, Evans said.One woman was unable to reach her father the day after he went on a date with Phelps in Guadalajara, Mexico, in May 2022, according to court records. The next day, Mexican police found him dead on the bathroom floor of his home. Phelps then used an account belonging to the victim to buy a gold coin, along with other transactions, the indictment alleges.The FBI is aware of more alleged victims in the US and Mexico, Evans said – and is making information about the case public, including suspected aliases, in hopes of identifying others who “fell victim to her scams and whose trust in her may have cost them their life”.The FBI is also working with the justice department and Mexican authorities to secure her extradition.If convicted on every charge, which include seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, six counts of bank fraud, three counts of identity theft and one count of kidnapping, Phelps faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, Fahami said.Explore more on these topicsLas VegasUS crimeFBIMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no way this is going to get contained” on its own, said Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine.US agriculture department says it accidentally fired bird flu officialsRead moreThe current outbreak is unlikely to end without intervention and needs close attention from theTrump administrationto prevent the virus from wreaking more havoc.Yet “we don’t seem to have a handle on the spread of the virus,” said Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease physician.Bird flu’s continued spread is happening against the backdrop of the worst flu season in 15 years, since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009-10.The spike in seasonal flu cases puts pressure on health systems, makes it harder to detect rare variants like H5N1, and raises the risk of reassortment, where a person or animal infected with seasonal flu and bird flu could create a new, more dangerous variant.Diagram showing the spread of bird flu“There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala said. There’s also the possibility of reassortment within animals like cows, now that there are multiple variants detected in herds, she pointed out.At the same time, the CDC’s seasonal flu vaccination campaigns were halted on Thursday as the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reportedlycalledfor “informed consent” advertisements instead. A meeting for the independent vaccine advisers was alsopostponedon Thursday.The US has also halted communication with the World Health Organization on influenza data.The new spillovers into dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona, detected through the new bulk milk testing strategy recently implemented in the US, are both related to the D1.1 variant of H5N1, which emerged in the fall and has come to dominate among North American birds. A teenaged girl in British Columbia suffered severe illness and a man in Louisiana died after infection with this variant.In Nevada, a dairy worker was infected after close contact with cows, and genomic sequencing revealed a mutation that has been associated in the past with more effective spread among people.“These are more opportunities for the virus to continue to adapt, and with adaptation, you worry that we’ll ultimately get to a point where we may have a virus that becomes capable of transmitting efficiently between humans, and that then really would change the dynamic of the outbreak,” Titanji said.Lakdawala raised three theories for how bird flu keeps spilling over into cows.The first would be a rare event in which fluids from a sick bird somehow came into contact with a cow’s udders – for instance, if a bird defecated into milking equipment. That was a working theory for the first spillover, detected nearly a year ago in Texas cows. But it’s rare for birds to have close contact with milking equipment, and for that to happen three times was “unlikely”, Lakdawala said.It’s much more common for birds to perch on feeding troughs, where their feces might mix with feed. Usually, cows infected through oral or nasal contact like this don’t see the virus spread to their udders.But it could happen in rare events – if a cow is unhealthy, for instance – that bird flu goes systemic and enters mammary tissue, where it replicates in enormous quantities, Lakdawala hypothesized.The third theory? People could be spreading the virus from birds, or another intermediate species, to cows.“Bird to human infections, we know happen more often,” Lakdawala said. “It’s more likely that somebody handling dead birds or chickens infected with H5 will become infected, and then it’s human to cow” transmission.All of these theories need more evidence and research, much of which is now threatened by halts in scientific funding from the Trump administration.Two studies temporarily halted in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report have now been released.Blood tests on 150 veterinariansrevealedthree of the vets showed recent infection with H5N1. One of the infected vets worked in a state with no cases among cows, and the two others did not realize they had had contact with an H5-positive animal, indicating continued gaps in monitoring spread.Astudyon two households in Michigan indicated that dairy workers may have spread H5N1 to their indoor cats.Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, unveiled the Trump administration’s new strategy on CBS’sFace the Nationon Sunday in a shift away from trying to contain the outbreak.Previously, officials “spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken”, Hassett said. Infected poultry are culled in this manner because they are very unlikely to survive infection, and containment like this can help halt the spread to other animals – and to the people who care for them.Hassett instead broached the idea, without providing more details, of using “biosecurity and medication” to “have a better, smarter perimeter”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationBird flunewsShareReuse this content"

If you’re the South Korean auteur, you make a sci-fi satire where Robert Pattinson dies over and over again. The director discusses the inspirational Loach and Mike Leigh and why it’s hard being a ‘middle-aged film-maker’Sat 22 Feb 2025 06.55 ESTShareWe are in the run-up to the release of Bong Joon Ho’s latest, Mickey 17, and Warner Bros has got the Oscar-winning Korean director stashed away in what appears to be some kind of basement storage room, with grey-painted brickwork and exposed wiring. In fact, this room could pass for one of the “gritty and kind of nasty” cargo-container-packed cabins of his film’s spaceship setting.Not that anyone is complaining. Bong, who speaks good English but prefers to conduct interviews via his longtime interpreter Sharon Choi, appears cheerful throughout our conversation, taking occasional sips from a takeaway coffee cup, while dressed in his usual arthouse auteur uniform of a slate-grey blazer over a black T-shirt. He is, for example, completely sanguine about the fact that this follow-up to2019’s Parasiteis only now reaching our screens, 12 months after its slated release date. Mickey 17wasn’t the only production delayed by 2023’s Screen Actors Guild strikes, he points out, and besides: “My films are quite complicated in terms of distributing and marketing. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how to package and when to release, because it’s a mix of so many different genres.”That is certainly true of Mickey 17, which might best be described as a blackly comic, satirical sci-fi-crime caper. It stars Robert Pattinson as the dopey and desperate Mickey Barnes, who signs up to work a dangerous job on a space-colonising mission, led by a despotic ex-congressman (Mark Ruffalo) and his unhinged wife (Toni Colette). Then, whenever one of Mickey’s assignments results in his death – which is often – he is simply cloned, using “reprinting” technology and sent straight back to work. This is a notion Bong seems to find particularly discomfiting. “Y’know, there’s an HP printer right here in this room, as we’re doing this interview,” he says, eyeing the machine warily. “To think that, like, my head and my arms and legs would just be printed out of this printer, like a piece of paper …”View image in fullscreenTaking the Mickey … Naomi Ackie and Robert Pattinson.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesConsidering Mickey 17 originated as an unpublished novel manuscript, optioned by Warner Bros – “The first time I accepted an offer that came to me,” Bong notes – it’s impressive how seamlessly another writer’s ideas have been absorbed into the director’s own creative sensibility. The mission, to the distant planet of Niflheim, is beset by plenty of Parasite-esque upstairs-downstairs discord: there’s a noirish, serial-killer subplot reminiscent of Bong’s breakthrough feature,Memories of Murder(2003), and Niflheim itself is a frozen dystopian landscape, just like that in 2013’sSnowpiercer, and populated by a species of creepy-cute beasts, not dissimilar from the title character in2017’s Okja.We all know that things are just getting worse and worse. I know it, you know it, everyone knows itNone of those previous films were made with the benefit of the three Academy Awards wins Bong has to his name, however. Parasite was a Hitchcockian class-war thriller of such elegant construction that even the notoriously parochial Hollywood establishment couldn’t ignore the achievement. After collecting the Palme d’Or at Cannes, it made history as the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for best picture, positioning Bong at the forefront of Korea’s current wave of international cultural influence, alongside the Netflix TV hitSquid Gameand K-pop stars BTS and Blackpink. When I ask how this has changed his experience of film-making, he fixes eye contact and declares – in English, for added effect – “It changes nothing.” OK, he later clarifies, the Oscars probably did help raise Mickey 17’s budget and ease along the casting process, particularly with regards to securing participation of Pattinson. “He was truly the nucleus of this story,” Bong says, “I can’t even imagine this film without Rob. I’m also quite proud of myself for thinking of him for this role.” He feels similarly about the casting of another Briton, Blink Twice’s Naomi Ackie, as Nasha, the one bright spot in Mickey’s otherwise wretched, expendable existence. “Without Nasha’s strength, this film would be so much more difficult to watch … And Naomi was the perfect actor for that. There’s a sense of purity in her eyes.”View image in fullscreenCopy that … Mickey 17.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesBut don’t these bigger budgets (Mickey 17 reportedly cost more than 10 times as much as Parasite) and higher profile, international casts also come with added pressure? Not really, says Bong: “The biggest thing [during production] was, as I’m getting older, I feel a bit weaker, and my stamina is not as strong, so I have to fight against my ageing body and mind.” He chuckles, shrugs and then adds, in English: “The middle-aged film-maker.”Bong will turn 56 in September, so he is, I suggest, but a babe in arms compared with still-active, octogenarian film-makers such as Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. The mention of these names seems to instantly take another 10 years off him: “I’ve always been inspired so much by Mike Leigh,” he says, sitting forwards in his chair. “I love his films – Naked, Secrets & Lies – particularly with his working-class characters and how lived-in they seemed. And I met Ken Loach in France a couple years ago, and he had so much energy.” He laughs again. “I wish I could take after them, but, y’know, I’m already just thinking about nap time.”The British social realists might not seem an obvious point of comparison for Bong Joon Ho, but his films do share a committed interest in inequality and the ordinary working stiff. In Mickey 17, the title character starts out with “this sort of dopey side to him that doesn’t reflect his reality”; then, as the story progresses, he experiences a dawning class consciousness: “He gets the chance to reflect on what it means to be repeatedly ‘reprinted’. And in that sense, you can say that Mickey 17 is a coming-of-age film.”View image in fullscreenClone wars … Mickey 17.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesBong Joon Ho himself came of age in a “relatively stable, middle-class family” in the Jamsil-dong neighbourhood of Seoul, where his father was a graphic designer and art professor, and his mother a homemaker. He was still a schoolboy in 1979 when Major General Chun Doo-hwan took power, and had just begun a sociology degree at Seoul’s Yonsei University by the time he was deposed. South Korea experienced an echo of this era last December, when President Yoon Suk Yeolattempted to declare martial lawduring a television address. Bong was among the 3,000 members of the Korean film industry who signed a letter in protest. Today, he summarises the effect of political turmoil on his work by explaining that the class divide grows wider under an oppressive military dictatorship. “And so, because I spent my most sensitive years in that environment, naturally I just internalised those issues. It’s not like, when I write a script, I open up my laptop and I have, like, the activist’s headband on …” Here, he mimes tying the traditional Korean protest-wear round his forehead. “Even with Parasite, my question would be: what makes them act that way? And, of course, you eventually touch upon class, but first and foremost, my interest is always with the individual and their environment.”In Mickey 17, that environment is dingy and chaotic – a far cry from the usual gleaming chrome of sci-fi’s futuristic visions. “I think new technology always brings a lot of excitement,” says Bong. “But I tend to feel a lot of fear about things.” This feeling is often manifest in the architecture of his film worlds, and the many staircases of Parasite have their Mickey 17 equivalent in the Cycler, an abyss-like incinerator chute down which ex-Mickeys are chucked, prior to reprinting. “I’m always fascinated by narrow, long corridors, and spaces that have vertical elements,” he says, referring to further examples in Snowpiercer and his 2006 monster film, The Host. “I think there’s a specific cinematic energy that those spaces give out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But Bong says his language choice is more practical than that: “Snowpierceris about the last survivors of humanity on a running train. And it would be really strange for the last survivors to only be South Korean and North Korean.” As for the strand of offbeat humour? That’s just how he is: “I think I’m really good at throwing people off; like it’s funny, but uncomfortable at the same time. I’ve heard responses like that to Parasite. They want to burst out laughing, but they feel a bit afraid of seeming rude. I think that’s just my sense of humour, even in my day-to-day life.”Does that explainTim Keyin a giant pigeon suit? The British standup, Alan Partridge sidekick and increasingly prolific film actor turns up in Mickey 17 as “this weird cheerleader-mascot-third-rate entertainer” known as Pigeon Man. “I’m so happy you asked about Tim!” Bong says, clapping his hands together in delight. “You’re the first person to ask about him!” Bong had never heard of Key until he was suggested by their UK casting director, but soon recognised a kindred spirit. “I found him so funny, smart and creative. I really wanted him to improvise a lot for the film. Early on, he gave us the book of poetry that he wrote, and I just thought it was one of the most amazing things I’d ever read.”So while Robert Pattinson may be Mickey 17’s “nucleus”, it’s in Key that the film’s spirit resides. For all its bleak prognostications about climate collapse and humanity’s future, there is a Pigeon Man-like absurdist optimism that persists. “We all know that things are just getting worse and worse. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. We keep seeing incredibly advanced technology come out, AI and everything, but so much fear and anxiety surrounds that too.” The film’s primary goal was to express this, he says. “But at the same time, I wanted to show that amid such anxiety, fear and pessimism, people like Mickey – just, y’know, everyday people – somehow get through.”Be it the love of a good woman like Nasha, a new book of bizarre poems, or the prospect of going to see Bong Joon Ho’s latest film at the cinema, we find reasons to dive back into the incinerator and reprint once more. “That’s a piece of optimism amid the suffering that I wanted to ultimately deliver,” Bong says. And, believe it or not, he’s still smiling.Mickey 17 is in cinemas on 7 March.Explore more on these topicsBong Joon-hointerviewsShareReuse this content"

The wild-eyed composer is in a cart, West tells us energetically, his latest piano sonata getting ruined by the rain, after throwing some coins at the driver and growling his preferred destination. West relishes every syllable of it: “Vi-ennnn-a!”New 10-part Radio 3 podcastFacing the Music, according to the BBC blurb, offers “a fresh perspective on some of classical music’s most established composers”. On paper it sounds a bit luvvie-ish – here’s Michael Sheen on Shostakovich’s terrors during the Stalinist 1930s, Kit Harington on Rachmaninov’s fear of failure, Toby Jones on how Sibelius’s anger freed him from his musical torment; famous names adding extra drama to the swoosh of batons.But it’s more than that. Wrapped around the actors’ words are the voices of experts in psychology, gerontology and more, as well as ordinary people facing situations similar to those experienced by the featured composers – to give their stories a modern-day impact, which requires a delicate balancing act. Thankfully, this counterpoint works a treat. Lesser-known lives, such as those of the English suffragette composer Ethel Smyth (read animatedly by Maxine Peake) and Florence Price, the first African American woman to have her music performed by a major US orchestra, who battled prejudice against her gender and colour, hold as much power as the tales of the big boys.Audrey Gillan has made another great programme, brave, fearless and trueThat said, my favourite episode so far (I’ve heard about half the series) has David Suchet recounting the last week of Joseph Haydn’s life in war-torn Vienna, a French soldier coming to his house to sing him one of his arias. The fact that Suchet is 78, a year older than Haydn, who, at 77, was very old for the time, wasn’t lost on me as I sat in the car, listening to the end, a blubbering wreck. This is powerful, symphonic storytelling; not for the faint-hearted, but I loved it.More emotional radio could be found on Radio 4, with the return of award-winning journalistAudrey Gillan. You may remember her powerful 2018 seriesTara and George, about two rough sleepers, neighbours of hers (“of sorts”, she said, in her lovely Glaswegian accent), who she got to know curiously but kindly over 18 months. It deservedly won Radio Programme of the Year at the 2019 Broadcasting Press Guild awards.George and Tara in 2018.Tara and George: Last Rightsupdates the story sadly. Tara died, the circumstances unknown. Her brother, Shaun, who Gillan hasn’t met before, emails for help to find out what happened. The next 28 minutes are a whirlwind, including a shocking second death and the arrival of Tara’s youngest daughter, Paige, who was taken into care, then adopted into a loving family. There’s a sweet moment when she chats on the phone to her “mum mum”, but we discover she also spent years trying to get back in touch with her “tummy mummy”.This is a programme about complicated families, and a state system that struggles with depleted resources to support people, or show sensitivity. Tara died with no next of kin noted, with one person at her funeral, despite having so many connections. The moment when Tara’s name is read out at a funeral for homeless people who died that year – she is one of 126 – is deeply affecting.We also find George, too, by chance, but I’ll leave that moment for you to encounter. Gillan has made another great programme, brave, fearless and true.A couple of lighter shows to leave you with this week. The first is the bizarre but oddly compelling podcastWhy Is Amy in the Bath?, presented by American journalists Brandon R Reynolds and Gabby Lombardo. Inspired by Reynolds noticing film actor Amy Adams’s many bath scenes (and no, he doesn’t tackle the perviness behind that observation from the off), it delves deep into the history of bathtub and shower scenes in cinema, bathing data for Oscar best actress nominees, and whether Adams has a hidden agenda as she lurks in the foam.View image in fullscreenAmy Adams and Henry Cavill in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016).Photograph: LMKThe presenters are too arch and self-satisfied at times, but I’m enjoying how the podcast format still allows mad ideas like these to swirl into new wormholes (rather than disappearing down plugholes). Three episodes are out, with three more to come. I’m desperate for Adams herself to make a bubbly appearance.View image in fullscreenFinally,Between the Ears: A Symphony of Cicadasfinds radio producer Mark Burman experiencing an event not seen, nor crucially heard, for 221 years. This is the simultaneous emergence of two broods of cicadas whose 13- and 17-year life cycles rarely cross over. Billions of them were mating and noise-making until they die two months later.Burman’s use of historical quotes to sum up their magic is beautiful (“a few brief weeks of life, in the open air, in the fellowship of their kind” runs one, by the fabulously named entomologist RE Snodgrass), as is his exploration of their percussive melodies and rhythms. What a sound they make too, loud and almost electronic (Between the Earsis definitely a programme for headphones). This is slow radio turned up to 11, fizzing with life.Explore more on these topicsRadioThe ObserverPodcastsHomelessnessClassical musicAmy AdamsInsectsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ceechynaa is a young UK drill rapper, and the narrator of this rap is a dominant, aggressive sex worker who humiliates men – Peggy is a word play on pegging – in a way that I feel would make a lot of men genuinely quite terrified. A lot of the music I’ve been listening to has been about female vulnerability, so it was refreshing to hear something that is the antithesis of that, and absolutely not for the male gaze.View image in fullscreen2.BookRecognising the Stranger: On Palestine and NarrativebyIsabella HammadHammad originally delivered this essay as the Edward Said memorial lecture, days before 7 October. It looks at the idea of recognition scenes in fiction – what Aristotle called anagnorisis – when a character recognises something they already knew at some level, but they fully recognise the truth and it confronts them with the limitations of their own knowledge. She takes this idea and expands it to people coming to recognise the personhood of Palestinians. I listened to the audiobook recently and was astonished at the ferocity of Hammad’s intellect.3.PlaceProcida, ItalyView image in fullscreenThe colourful houses of the village of Corricella on Procida island off Naples.Photograph: AlamyThis is an island off the coast of Naples where I wrote a lot of my book. I twice went there to work on my own – when I’m doing a first draft I tend to struggle in London because there are so many distractions. Procida is captivating for the imagination. I was watchingThe Talented Mr Ripley– since it’s the older, better version ofSaltburn– and I recognised that it was all filmed there. I took a lot of walks, and you become intimately aware of this small island and its landmarks.4.RestaurantBrutto, LondonView image in fullscreen‘Simple Italian dishes’: Brutto in London.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWhen I’m at a party and someone tells me to put on a song, I immediately become fearful that my music taste is terrible and everyone’s gonna laugh at me – I feel like that about restaurant recommendations because I have so many friends who are foodies. But what I love about Brutto is that it’s all Florentine, simple, Italian dishes. It’s charming, it’s unpretentious, and it’s in Clerkenwell, so it’s perfectly located. My friend Monica Heisey, the novelist, suggested it once for dinner in September, and I’ve become totally obsessed with it. Now it’s my go-to spot.5.FilmPedro AlmodóvarView image in fullscreenGael García Bernal as Zahara in Bad Education.Photograph: Sony Pictures/AllstarI’m a huge Almodóvar fan – I enjoyed his new filmThe Room Next Door, but I’ve been thinking recently about 2004’sBad Education. I first saw it when I was a teenager, and there’s a section where Gael García Bernal plays a transgender woman called Zahara. Now it’s quite problematic, because he’s a cis man, but he looked so beautiful, and I wasn’t used to seeing representations of trans women in that way. I love that Almodóvar integrated trans characters in quite a humanised way, especially for the time. Anglophone cinema still has a way to go to catch up with Spanish-language cinema on this.6.FashionDilara FindikogluView image in fullscreenJulia Fox in her Dilara Fire dress.Photograph: Gotham/GC IMAGESI don’t impulsively spend as a rule, but the last time I felt a little bit heartbroken over a man, I went to a Dilara sample sale in east London. They had this Fire dress –Julia Fox wore one– which is heavily corseted, and I ended up walking out with one that, to be honest, I’ve only really worn on one occasion. It was pure: “I want to make myself feel better using a bit of consumerism.” I love that Dilara’s designs espouse a kind of gothic femininity: high cinching but also hard and strong, like a warrior.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarRestaurantsPodcastsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I saw a poster saying £20 for life modelling and when you’re living on beans on toast you think: ‘Well, I can do that.’ So I gave it a go.It’s the strangest thing in the world when you do it for the first time. I remember my heart was pounding and the adrenaline was rushing and the back of my head was prickly because I was thinking: ‘What on earth am I doing? This is crazy!’You don’t know what to do with your limbs, you have no idea how to place yourself and it all feels so strange. But I did it a few times and I got into it and I just found I absolutely loved it.That was 13 years ago and I’m really good, I would say, because I’ve got a few years under my belt. I have a repertoire of poses. I can see myself doing it for the rest of my life.There’s a thousand reasons why I enjoy it and why I love it. In terms of the artistry it is absolutely gorgeous seeing what people come up with. There’s such a variation of talent and such a variation of ideas in the room given everyone is presented with the same thing to draw.It’s wonderful going around and seeing all of the different things that people come up with. One person will see something completely different to the next.There’s nothing like finishing a class and going around the room and just looking at all of these beautiful pieces of art. People are bursting with pride and can’t wait to show you what they’ve done and what they’ve tried this week.View image in fullscreen‘I have never felt uncomfortable. I have never felt unsafe. I have never thought anyone is being voyeuristic.’ Ellie Heney.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverSometimes you’ve got to take it on the chin when maybe somebody isn’t very good and they come up with a picture that’s not the most complimentary. You’ve got to remember it’s not about you.I never find it strange seeing myself. People often say: ‘Oh, would you like this?’ So I’ve got a huge roll of pictures upstairs, which I think is such a gift to myself as an old woman because when I’m 80 and wrinkly I can look back at all this art and think what a lovely experience it was.My partner thinks it’s great, but he has vetoed any more pictures on the walls. There’s definitely an upper limit of how many naked pictures of yourself you can have on your own walls.There’s no denying that for me it’s a huge esteem boost as well – I don’t think it’s bad to admit that. It is nice being looked at. It is nice being seen. It’s nice to be admired. After you’ve finished a class you’re on a bit of a high and people are so complimentary.I don’t feel I’m being brave … I’m a real exhibitionist. I love getting my kit off. It is such a brilliant way to feel a rush and to feel confidence. I feel so confident.I have a full-time job [working for the Stroke Association] so the life drawing is a side gig. I might do six or seven classes a month across the north-west.The people who organise the classes will always bend over backwards to make you feel comfortable, to make sure you’ve got everything you need, to make sure you’re warm enough.

You can tell that they are there to be artists and they’re there to perfect their craft and to train.I feel very, very passionately that the naked human body is not fundamentally and automatically a sexual thing. I think that there’s a world of difference between a life picture and pornography. It’s not the same thing at all.I am surprised by the fuss over life classes in Hampstead [in London, where models have been told to cover up]. I do feel we can be too prudish about things.

The recipient is his erstwhile best friend Pádraic (Colin Farrell). An easygoing man, Pádraic is generally acknowledged as a bit dull but a despairing Colm’s attempts to shun him turn surprisingly bloody.

My goal is to give the reader the feeling that you – and by you, I mean me – have when you’re going for a long walk with a close friend, and the friend says: “The craziest thing just happened to me.”What?!You think and possibly say.Tell me immediately!And then what happened, and then what happened? As a writer, this is the urgency I’m chasing, this is the investment, the richness of emotion, the confiding and closeness andcaring.A line in Miranda July’s 2024 novelAll Fours, a book I’ve discussed with many friends, perfectly captures for me this sense of participating in a bottomless conversation: “I was often two or three hours late because I had trouble admitting that I was planning to talk to Jordi for five hours.”That intersection of a juicy story and a real connection is one of the very best parts of being a person. I’m 49 now, and I’m profoundly grateful for the intensity and centrality of friendship in middle age.There are the friends I take literal and regular long walks with: Carolyn, with whom I went to college, and Erin, who I connected with in 2019 over lunch at a Cuban restaurant. There’s my graduate school friend Susanna, whom I text with anywhere from three to seven million times a day. There’s the group I think of as my lady writer friends, with whom I have Friday lunches to talk about how weird and isolating and wonderful it is to write fiction. There’s the crew that talks mostly about sex and the body – if an Instagram post about vagina exercises goes viral, there’s a 110% chance one of these women will send it to the group chat – and there’s Kathryn and Sara, two women I began having dinner with after we realised we each had two children at the same two schools.And yes, I do have some male friends: Ernesto, or, as one of my kids dubbed him, “your new bestie Ernestie”, who’s a journalist, and Will, who’s also a writer, and Jeff who, when my kids started at the school his daughter attends, met me at a uniform store because I didn’t know which items or how many of them to buy. If it seems at this point like I’m just bragging about how popular I am, I confess it wasn’t always so. In 2007, when my husband and I were engaged, we moved from Philadelphia, where he’d attended graduate school, to St Louis, Missouri. He was a professor and got along with his new colleagues, but I didn’t make a close friend for more than a year. I was working from home on my third novel, untethered to any institution, and I spent enormous amounts of time alone. Data shows that the number of close friends people have tends to decline in our late 20s and early 30s; as it was for me, the situation is often linked to pairing up as a couple and moving around geographically.The self that I am with my friends wears a sports bra while not exercising, and a fleece hat while indoorsEventually, after having kids, I made “mom friends”, and I still hold a place in my heart for the women with whom I exchanged complaints about sleep deprivation, recommendations for baby carriers, and wonder over the little creatures we were raising. But in terms of time and emotions, the years when my two children were very young were ones in which I was less available to other adults and other adults were less available to me.Now that my kids are teenagers, it’s true that my schedule is more flexible: not only can I go out for dinner without worrying that anyone in the house will cry about my absence, but it’s possible my absence won’t even be noticed. Yet schedules alone don’t account for the friendship renaissance I feel so fortunate to experience. The essential ingredient of middle-aged friendships, I believe, is openness. And the reality is that by the time you’re middle-aged, you inevitably have lots to be open about.While some people experience dramatic challenges, disappointments and sorrows at a young age, by the time you’re 40 or 50,everyonehas faced them. Everyone has experienced setbacks – the deaths of family members or close friends, estrangement from family, divorce, health struggles – as well as more ordinary daily problems, like perimenopause and surly kids. When we can be honest about these sorrows and challenges, it’s a powerful point of bonding. Again, research backs me up: the psychological term to explain why divulging personal information creates intimacy is known as social penetration theory, which is definitely a phrase my sex-focused group chat friends would make jokes about.More colloquially, there’s the phenomenon of giving no fucks. On the podcastThe Shift, which features women over 40 discussing being over 40, the journalist Sam Baker concludes each interview by asking the subject how many fucks she gives. The implication, obviously, is that the more we’ve all learned, the less we give. (I said I give three. I have no idea if I meant out of 10, a thousand, or some other number because Baker doesn’t say what the upper limit is.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It would be insincere not to acknowledge that a disproportionate number of women I meet who are demographically similar do already know who I am. But while there is a poised, professional self that I can be at my public events, this is performative. And the point of friendship, I’m pretty sure, is not to need to perform. Writing fiction is central to who I am, but being a writer in public, discussing into a microphone where I get my ideas or what it’s like when Reese Witherspoon picks one of your books for her book club, isn’t a reciprocal conversation.The self that I am with my friends wears a sports bra while not exercising, and a fleece hat while indoors, and is far more interested in discussing waxing v shaving v laser hair removal v au naturel than anything in the New York Times Book Review. I mostly have my shit together as a writer, which mostly makes talking about being a writer feel peripheral. I want to talk with my friends about the areas where Idon’thave my shit together, and where they don’t either: the difficult and confusing topics of family and relationships. Also I want to gossip with them, and exchange opinions on Cowboy Carter songs and recipes for coconut lentil curry.The importance of authenticity in friendships was illustrated for me recently at a party to kick off a literary festival. While holding a drink in one hand and a paper plate with hummus and pieces of pitta bread in the other, my friend Erin asked if I could hold her plate so she could dip the pitta bread in it.Is it weird that this request made me feel seen and understood in a beautiful and moving way? I knew that others at the party might perceive me as Curtis the writer, but Erin and I were close enough that she knew that at certain moments – in fact, at more moments than not in this life – my highest purpose was to be a hummus plate holder.In my new collection, one of the stories is called The Patron Saints of Middle Age. The story contains references to the patron saint of selling houses – Saint Joseph – but I suspect that anyone who reads the story will understand what the title really means. The patron saints of middle age are (spoiler alert) our friends.Show Don’t Tell by Curtis Sittenfeld is published by Doubleday on 27 February.To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a small child, my dream was to open an underwater restaurant (no, me neither), and the short menu I painstakingly wrote out for said venture started with chicken and vegetable soup. Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.For me, chicken and vegetable soup suggests a chunky broth, rather than a creamy puree, but both types are represented here and have their merits in the comfort department – though, personally, having been reminded how much I like the stuff, I’m now more inclined to make my own. Should you be less fussy, you’ll find some decent alternatives below.The best supermarket chicken soupBest all-rounderWaitrose hearty chicken & vegetable brothView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 600g at Waitrose★★★★★Attractive looking and bursting with both vegetables (I liked the sweetness of the peas more than the overcooked spinach) and meat. It has a distinctly chickeny flavour, but I’d like to know where it came from. This one feels like it’s doing me good.Best bargainCo-op chicken & vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£2.45 for 600g at Co-op★★★★☆Generous British chicken content (though I’d prefer pieces of leg to dry strands of breast). In common with many of the soups tested, the base tastes more of vegetables – of which, to be fair, there is a great range: potato, carrot, cabbage, onion, peas, leek, swede, celery and parsnip. Commendably clean ingredients list.Best splurgeCully & Sully chicken & vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£2.40 for 400g at Ocado£2.40 for 400g at Tesco★★★★★This feels more like a soup that you might serve in little cups at a dinner party than something you’d microwave for lunch. Oddly, it has the lowest chicken content of all those I try (again, origin unspecified), and I’d have preferred them to leave the pieces out of the silky, creamy base. But this has a full flavour, and is sweet with root vegetables, savoury with alliums and rich with cream and butter. Delicious.And the rest …M&S chunky chicken and root vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 600g at Ocado★★★★☆The base is comfortingly creamy, but it always feels odd to me to find bits in a thick puree. Nice pieces of chicken thigh, though, and a sweet, soothing root-vegetable flavour.Yorkshire Provender roast chicken with traditional vegetables soupView image in fullscreen£2.58 for 560g at Asda£3.45 for 560g at Sainsbury’s★★★★☆This has a winningly chunky, almost-homemade feel, with generous hunks of vegetable and chicken, and a pronounced, pleasing taste of green leek. The chicken is more of a texture than a flavour, and weirdly, though Yorkshire Provender proudly declares it sources its parsley from Yorkshire (from May to October), there’s no mention of the meat’s provenance. But it’s tasty nonetheless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s tasty enough, but with no particularly distinctive flavour. Inoffensive, but unmemorable.New Covent Garden Soup Co classic chickenView image in fullscreen£2.20 for 560g at Sainsbury’s£2.20 for 560g at Tesco★★★☆☆I’d describe this more as a potato soup with pieces of chicken, which is no bad thing – I love a starchy spud soup. This one’s a bit salty, though, and if you’re going to include bits in there, it would be nice to have some other, sweeter vegetables along with the chicken. But I can imagine this might hit the spot if I was feeling under the weather.Tesco chicken & vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 600g at Tesco★☆☆☆☆A bit flat – more like underseasoned vegetable stock than chicken, which is a shame, given that the meat came all the way from Thailand to end up in this faintly disappointing soup. I like the chewy pearl barley, though.Sainsbury’s chicken & vegetable brothView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 600g at Sainsbury’s★☆☆☆☆The star is for using British chicken at this price point, although the strands are so small that they’re difficult to pick out, both in the bowl and from my teeth afterwards. What with that, the small pieces of vegetable and the murky rags of kale (leafy greens don’t really lend themselves to being reheated), it’s not very exciting to look at or eat; more like vegetable cooking water than stock.Morrisons chicken & vegetable brothView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 600g at Morrisons£2 for 600g at Amazon★☆☆☆☆Although this describes itself as a broth, it’s more stew-like, with the peculiarly gloopy consistency of a bad Chinese chicken soup. “Even the carrots don’t taste of anything, which is quite a skill,” observes one friend disconsolately. On the plus side, I like the pearl barley, the list of veg and the fact that they’ve used juicy (British!) chicken thigh.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe FilterSoupChickenVegetablesMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then an Ancestry DNA test seemed to prove her right. Now in her 90s, she is in a race against time. Can she find her missing child?ByJenny KleemanSat 22 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareWhen Sue bought her mother and younger brother Ancestry kits for Christmas in 2018, she knew that they were never going to be fun gifts. A lingering doubt had always cast a shadow over their family, a question that had gnawed at them for decades. Sue hoped that, if she, Joan and Doug took DNA tests together, they might finally have the answer they craved.Their results came in a few weeks later. Ancestry listed Sue and Doug as full siblings, with Joan as their mother. Their father, Tom, had died in 2016. Sue felt certain that William – her parents’ first child, the older brother she and Doug had grown up with, a man they hadn’t seen for years – had already taken a DNA test with Ancestry. But he didn’t appear anywhere on their genetic family tree.“We could see we were all as we should be, and he was nowhere,” Sue explains in the living room of Joan’s home in Weymouth. “Then I rang Ancestry, and said he hadn’t pulled through as a match. They just said: ‘Very sorry for your results, but DNA doesn’t lie.’”The news that William was not biologically related to any of them didn’t come as a shock to Sue, Joan or Doug. “It felt like confirmation of what we’d always known,” Sue tells me. William had always seemed so different from the rest of the family. And something strange had happened at the hospital after he was born, something that had always played on Joan’s mind, even though for years she kept her worries to herself.The DNA results turned out to be only the beginning of a quest for answers that would come to consume their family. Joan had given birth to a son in the West Midlands in April 1951. If William wasn’t that baby, then who was? The question has become an obsession that has taken over Sue’s life, and cost Joan thousands of pounds.Cases where babies have been accidentally switched at birth are supposed to be unheard of in the UK. In response to a 2017Freedom of Information request, the NHS replied that there were no records of babies being accidentally brought home from hospital by the wrong set of parents in recent years. But I have discovered that, at a time before babies were routinely tagged with wristbands and were kept apart from their mothers in creches overnight, mistakes happened – with unimaginable consequences.Last November,I reportedon the story of two women who discovered they had been accidentally switched at birth in a West Midlands hospital in 1967 – all due to an Ancestry DNA test, received as a Christmas gift and casually taken on a rainy day in 2022.It was devastating news for both families, and the two women had to question everything they thought they knew about their heritage and identity. The NHS has admitted liability in this case, and agreed to pay compensation – although, three years on, the final sum is still yet to be agreed. The NHS trust told the families it was the first documented case of its kind in the history of the health service.Since November, my inbox has been filled with stories of other accidental baby swaps, recently discovered through people taking at-home DNA tests out of idle curiosity. A Norwegian lawyer got in touch with news of her client, Mona, who had taken a MyHeritage DNA test in 2021,only to discoverthat she had been switched at birth in 1965; she was fighting for compensation from the Norwegian government after it was revealed that her birth mother had known about the mistake for decades but had been discouraged from looking for Mona. Another case, in Barcelona in 1972, had also recentlycome to lightbecause of someone taking a MyHeritage test. The Spanish government has agreed to pay compensation in what will be the third case of its kind in the country.I didn’t have the chance to cuddle him. I never held him. It’s a terrible feelingSeveral people have sent me stories about near misses in the UK. A man described how he had been handed to the wrong woman a few hours after his birth in 1953; he was already being breastfed by the time his mother realised the mistake. A woman who had worked for Hampshire social services in the 1990s pointed me towardsa casewhere two babies were taken home from a Southampton hospital by the wrong sets of parents in November 1992 and spent two weeks with the wrong families. One of the mothers had had suspicions, but the other had been convinced she had the right baby until DNA testing confirmed the mixup.All of which is to say that accidental baby swaps are more common than any of us previously imagined. But Sue, Doug and Joan’s case is different from all of these stories. Joan had always secretly suspected she had been given the wrong baby more than 70 years ago, and while the Ancestry test appeared to confirm this, the DNA results have not yet been able to tell her who the right baby was. With Joan now in her mid-90s, Sue feels she is in a race against time to find the biological son her mother never even got to hold.It only takes a few moments in Joan, Doug and Sue’s company to sense that they share DNA: they echo each other, in their faces and mannerisms. Joan is ensconced in a reclining chair in her living room, surrounded by pictures of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren and stacks of novels. She can’t move around the way she used to, but her mind is as sharp as ever. The family moved from Warwickshire to Dorset 50 years ago when Joan’s husband, Tom, decided to set up a greengrocer’s shop in a seaside town where they used to take holidays. Tom died almost nine years ago; Joan’s wedding ring remains on her finger. Doug moved in with his mother four years ago, and he and Sue are her carers. Sue lives a few minutes’ drive away.Joan describes herself as being “a young,young21” when she went to the West Midlands hospital to give birth to her first child. Married the previous year, she and Tom were living with her parents on the Warwickshire farm where her father raised pigs and cows. Joan’s waters broke late on a Sunday night. Tom was nervous when he rang the hospital. “I said: ‘Don’t panic, we’ll be all right,’” she tells me. “He ran all the way down the drive in front of the ambulance to open the field gate. He waved to me. I thought, you should be coming with me.” In the 1950s, men stayed away when women gave birth. “I imagined him shutting the gate after the ambulance. And we went on our way.”The baby arrived at about two in the morning. “They said: ‘It’s a boy.’ And I thought, Tom will be pleased.” Tom had grown up with five sisters, and had been desperate for a son. “I said: ‘Oh, that’s my baby, then. That’s lovely.’ And I was holding my hands out ready to cuddle him, and they took him away.”View image in fullscreenJoan with her husband Tom and their younger children Sue and Doug photographed on holiday. The siblings are now helping their mother try to find their older brother.Photograph: Courtesy of the familyShe extends her arms, as if still reaching for the newborn who was taken from her. “I didn’t have the chance to cuddle him. I never held him. It’s a terrible feeling. And even after all these years, you feel it’s not right.” Her eyes brim with tears. “You just followed instructions, and that’s how it was.” Her son was washed and taken to the creche for the rest of the night, which was routine practice in those days. Joan went to sleep.A few hours later, the ward sister came into the room Joan shared with three other mothers, carrying four babies in her arms. Joan remembers it vividly – because of what happened next. The sister appeared to lose her grasp on one of the newborns as she approached Joan’s bed. “I thought, gracious, she’s going to drop one,” Joan remembers. “This baby slipped out of her hands and dropped on my legs, and it cried out. If she hadn’t have come quickly to me, she would have dropped him on the floor. I grabbed the baby and pulled him to me, because he was crying.”The sister told Joan to feed the baby, and then continued to distribute the other three. “I just kept looking at him and thinking, I wonder if you’remybaby?” Joan says. But, exhausted after the birth and unwilling to challenge a nurse, Joan kept quiet once again. And then Tom came to the hospital, full of excitement that he had a baby boy. She felt she couldn’t say anything.The nagging doubts continued when Joan returned home from hospital. She did what she knew she was supposed to do – bathing the baby in a bowl of warm water on the kitchen table, dressing him in the clothes she had knitted for him – but things never felt right. “I didn’t have that motherly feeling.” Many new mothers feel that way, of course. “It was my first baby, and I was getting used to it, so I just ignored that and got on with it.” But the unease lingered. “It was almost like a feeling of: one day they’ll bring me the right baby.”Determined never to give birth in hospital again, Joan had Sue and Doug at home. As her three children grew up, the youngest two were always close, but William liked to keep to himself. “I thought, if I’ve got a family, it has to be afamily. But he seemed different from the other two,” Joan says. She pauses. “He was totally,totallydifferent.”Joan is choosing her words carefully. William has been estranged from the family he grew up in for nearly 20 years; their relationship had been very fraught, and Joan is anxious about speaking about him. He did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. William is not his real name.The older we’ve got, the more you can see which bits are like which parent. But he just didn’t look like either of themAs the years passed, Tom expressed bewilderment about how their first child could be so different from the rest of the family; it was as if they were growing different seeds in the same soil. Joan told him about how William had fallen into her lap at the hospital where he was born. “Tom said: ‘I think we brought the wrong one home.’ He made up his mind it was the wrong one. Something wasn’t right.”Sue says she never had any idea that either of her parents questioned whether William was their biological son. “We had brilliant parents. All of our family – a huge family, on both sides – everybody was lovely,” she says. “We were always brought up to be very close to each other, but where it came naturally to Doug and I, it didn’t come naturally to the older one.”“Cousins and friends would comment, saying: ‘Oh, he’s not like you,’” Doug adds. “There’s always been something distant.”Despite their differences, Sue tried to maintain a relationship with William, visiting him when he was at university, sometimes staying over. “But it was hard work.” As she became an adult, she started to ask questions. “We didn’t look alike. Doug and I do: we’ve got the same sort of features, and the older we’ve got, the more you can see which bits are like which parent. But he just didn’t look like either of them.”View image in fullscreenJoan with Doug and Sue.Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianWhen Sue was 19 or 20, Joan finally told her about what had happened at the hospital. It made sense to her. So did the DNA results. When she broke the news to old friends and the wider family, it didn’t come as a surprise, she says. “Nobody’s shocked.”Ancestry had been selling kits in the UK since 2015, but Sue had chosen to wait until she had retired and had the time and headspace to process whatever a test might reveal. William had been into genealogy for years, Sue tells me: he had had an Ancestry profile since before the company sold test kits. She knew he would have taken a DNA test once they came on the market.And when their results came in, in early 2019, William sent Joan a text, out of the blue, asking whether they had done Ancestry tests; a cousin had been in touch trying to work out why Sue had appeared as a genetic match to him, but William had not. Joan confirmed that they’d tested. “Sue’s not a match,” William replied. “You’re not my mother.” It was the last contact any of them have had with William.Joan was devastated. William was still the son she’d raised, after all. “When he said: ‘You’re not my mother,’ it wentthroughme,” she tells me, her fists clenched across her chest. “I thought, so he’snotmine. It pulls you apart. It’s a dreadful thing: a child is not yours.”How soon did she start thinking about who her biological son could be? “Straight away.”“Igot heavily into it then,” Sue tells me. “You get on to Ancestry and start searching for somebody … I think, I’ll just do an hour tonight. Five hours later, I’m thinking, you’ve got to get to sleep. This has been going on ever since I took the test.” It has dominated her thoughts for the past six years.DNA results can take over people’s lives. Sue is not the first to get lost trying to find someone after a revelation reframes a family. There are scores of Facebook groups run by genealogists – sometimes called “Search Angels” or “DNA Detectives” – who offer to decode DNA results or track down missing people, often for nothing, but sometimes for a fee. An entire industry has sprung up of companies that offer similar services.At first, Sue did her own detective work. There were no unexpected connections in her Ancestry results that could reveal who this missing brother might be. But Sue’s Ancestry subscription allowed her to access birth records, so she immediately downloaded the names of all the people whose births were registered in the relevant area in spring 1951. She deleted the girls, and put the 130 remaining possible candidates on a spreadsheet, colour-coding the ones that looked most promising. “A work of art,” she says proudly.Next, Sue scoured the internet for any possible clue about exactly when the men on her spreadsheet were born, and whether it could be at the hospital where they believe the swap took place. “I found one guy on Facebook. I was thinking, he doesn’t look like us. I went through looking where everybody had said ‘Happy Birthday’ to get the date. And he flippin’diedthe day after I found him,” she says, ruefully. She began to search death records, too, marking down those on her spreadsheet who were no longer alive in a different colour.This isn’t a TV show where everyone’s happy to have contact and everyone sits in a lovely tea shop having scones togetherShe wrote to the hospital, asking for any information about who was born at the same time as Joan gave birth, but the hospital told her they couldn’t help. (In a statement, the managing director of the hospital NHS Trust involved said: “While we sympathise with [Joan], NHS organisations are legally required to destroy birth registers after 25 years. The Trust has complied with this requirement and there are no records at the hospital NHS Trust to be able to assist with this matter.”) Then, Sue contacted the General Register Office (GRO), which said it did have records of babies born at the hospital around the time Joan gave birth, but it would not release them without a court order. “There’s 33 different kinds of court orders,” Sue sighs. “You’ve got to pay a solicitor to deal with it all. I wouldn’t know where to start.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

These are the birth certificates she has ordered so far, at huge expense. She got them from Ancestry at first, at £25 each, until she realised she could order them for £12.50 if she went direct to the GRO. “I’ve probably got about 60 or 65 more to get,” she tells me. She’s getting them in batches of 10, because that’s all Joan’s budget allows. “Doug and I aren’t in a position to be paying for it, and Mum’s got limited funds – she’s living off a pension.” This is all on top of Sue’s Ancestry subscription, which costs her £13.99 a month. She’s been subscribing for the past six years.View image in fullscreenJoan looks through some of the birth certificates she has ordered so far.Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianAnd this is only the beginning of their spending. Joan has always known the last name of the woman who was in the bed next to her at the hospital in 1951 – it was the same as her own maiden name. They hired a people-tracing firm, Relative Connections, to track down the son that woman gave birth to. The company managed to find him, and passed on Joan’s offer to pay for him to take a DNA test that would rule him in or out of their family, but he refused. In the end, his daughter and niece both agreed to take Ancestry tests, at Joan’s expense. “It turned out they were first cousins, and neither of them pulled through as a match to us. So we knew it wasn’t him,” Sue explains. Crossing his name off the spreadsheet had cost Joan another £1,147. This has left two possible candidates: the men who, as babies, were given to the women in the two beds opposite Joan.Their hopes are now pinned on another man whose date and place of birth match up. Relative Connections made contact with him a few months ago, Sue says. The company has spoken to him on the phone, and passed on a letter from her, Joan and Doug, explaining how much it would mean to them if he took the test. They followed up the letter with emails and voicemails. But he has neither agreed to take the DNA test nor refused.“I am 99.9% sure he was one of the babies the nurse was carrying. Whether he’s the one that should have been with Mum, we won’t know unless he does a DNA test,” Sue says, frustration rising in her voice. They’ve even offered to pay for him to have a more expensive test with a private lab, in case he’s wary of being on Ancestry’s database: he’d give his DNA, Joan would give hers, they’d get the results within 24 hours, and it would remain between the two of them.But there has been no response from him since the initial phone call.Sue gets out her phone again, this time to show me the picture she’s taken from this man’s Facebook and placed next to pictures of her family for easy comparison.“He looks like Doug. Dad’s shape face. The nose looks like Mum’s.”“He’s got a big nose like me!” Joan chips in.I look over to Doug, and hedoeslook quite a bit like this stranger from Facebook. But then Sue shows me another picture of the same man, this time with the woman he thinks is his mother, and I thinktheylook alike.“That is supposed to be his older brother,” Sue continues, pulling up another photo. “Now, I thinkhelooks like …” and she brings up a picture of William. “He has got the ears the same as that guy, who’s supposed to be the older brother to that one.” You could lose your mind, scrutinising faces like this.Sue found Relative Connections on Google. “When I spoke to them on the phone, they were very good, and said they do it for television programmes as well. I thought, we’vegotto find him.But obviously, we have to give themanother£1,000 to find this one who hasn’t agreed to test yet. I’m very conscious that it’s Mum’s money.”Why not just contact him directly, instead of using an intermediary? “I know his address. I could have done it myself,” Sue concedes. “I didn’t want him to think that some crazy stalkers had come after him. I wanted him to feel that it wasn’t just some crackpot – this genuinely happened.”“This isn’t a TV show where everyone’s happy to have contact and everyone sits in a lovely tea shop having scones together,” says Sue Harrison, Sue’s contact at Relative Connections. “That’s not reality. There are variable outcomes and they’re not always going to be what you want.”Harrison is telling me about the importance of expectation management in her line of work. Her background is in customer service – she had no experience of people-tracing before she started at Relative Connections a decade ago. Her goal, she says, is to bring her clients closure.There are a huge range of reasons why people hire her: sometimes they are looking for a beneficiary named in a will, or old school friends, or people they met on holiday. “One of our most popular searches is for old sweethearts.”Familyestrangements keep them busy, with parents looking for grownup kids, and vice versa.Now thatone in 20 British peoplehas taken a DNA test, andmore than 26 millionAmericans, an important new dimension has been added to their business. Harrison has come to understand the amount of shared DNA that makes a sibling, a parent or a cousin. They have a dedicated team member who specialises in decoding results from Ancestry, 23andMe and MyHeritage.I’ve called Harrison because I want to understand the value professional services such as hers could bring to families like Joan’s. What do they do that their customers can’t on their own?“Most people come to us after years of trying to find a person themselves,” Harrison says. “You would think that with social media it would be easier now than it was years ago, but it’s actually harder.” These days, we have the option of choosing not to be on the public electoral register, and fewer of us have landlines; there’s no reliable phone book to look people up in any more. Relative Connections has access to paid databases that aren’t in the public domain, Harrison says, with verified addresses. But the real value they bring, she continues, comes from taking on the role of intermediary: “Having someone who’s a step back, who’s not related, who’s not emotionally involved with either side.”It’s not uncommon for people to believe they have been switched at birth, Harrison tells me; for some, that is less far-fetched than the idea that they share DNA with the family that raised them. But Joan’s story stands out as the first case the company has handled where there’s every reason to believe a baby swap has actually taken place.View image in fullscreenJoan, Doug and Sue.Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The Guardian“The human inside of me is incredibly frustrated,” she says. “I don’t want Joan to leave this Earth not knowing what happened.” The man Sue has identified as very likely to be one of the babies given to a mother opposite Joan in April 1951 seemed friendly and amenable on the one occasion when Harrison spoke to him on the phone, she tells me. He verified that he was born on the right date, and at the same hospital. “I’m at the point where I have to assume at this stage he’s choosing not to get back in touch,” she says.They will send a final letter, and if that goes ignored, Harrison says she will ask his daughter to take a DNA test. “Had he contacted us and said: ‘I don’t want to know at my time of life,’ then I probably wouldn’t have agreed to contacting the daughter. But he hasn’t, and I don’t know why. I have to balance that between what Joan and Sue need. Time is running out.”Sue is painfully aware that had William’s attitude been different, they could have quickly found the answers they sought by looking through their genetic family trees together. “If we find who should have been with us, he’s going to find where he should have been.”Beyond the text to Joan saying she wasn’t his mother, William has never discussed his DNA results with the family he grew up with. Joan’s memories of the hospital, and the differences between the siblings, mean Joan, Doug and Sue are all convinced the switch must have happened. And Joan has invested too much in the search to give up now.Now in his late 60s, Doug doesn’t really care about finding his older brother. “For me, personally, it doesn’t matter one way or the other. I don’t need anyone else in my life now to start another relationship with. That’s not to say that the person wouldn’t be welcomed – it’s just, that time’s gone, for me. But from mum’s point of view, I’d definitely like it sorted,” he tells me.Sue has submitted her DNA to five other sites to maximise her chances. She checks Ancestry every day for new matches. “When I go to bed, I’ve got my phone, I’ve got my spreadsheet, and I have to get on it. It’s just a huge mystery to solve.”I hope he’s had a good life – that’s the main thing, isn’t it?She and Joan believe that if they could find this person, then their family will finally make sense. But what if they do, and he doesn’t want to be part of it? “We won’t know unless we find him,” Sue replies. “I need to find him, and I need to get the answers – and then work out the rest of it from there.”As the years go on, Joan is ever more troubled by the idea that she may never find out what happened at the hospital. “Before I go, it would be lovely to know,” she tells me. “I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I can’t sleep.” She wipes her eyes beneath her glasses. “I hope he’s had a good life – that’s the main thing, isn’t it?”Given the money and hours spent searching, and the mental anguish of believing that the son she brought up was not her own, and that her firstborn child – a baby she never got to hold – was raised in another family, is Joan glad she took the DNA test in the first place?“Oh yes. Yes,” she replies, immediately. “Everybody wants the truth, don’t they?”Jenny Kleeman’s interview with Joan and family will be aired inThe Gift: Bonus Episode – Searching,on Radio 4 at 3pm on Tuesday 25 February and on BBC Sounds from today.Explore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a famous dish from there called bagna cauda. It’s a meeting of the garlic from the area of Piedmont, the mountains, with the anchovies coming from the sea in Liguria. It’s a very simple dish, a bit like a broth, perfect in winter, and you eat it with raw vegetables of the season. But there’s so much garlic in it that, when you eat it, you need a couple of days away from other people.There is a connectionbetween how you eat and how you make music:the way you blend the elements that you eat, the colours, it’s similar to composing a piece of music. If I take my solo piano repertoire, I would associate it with a very simple food, with few elements and few colours, not overelaborate. If I think of a piece of mine with more instruments, more orchestral, I would associate it with a dish, maybe a soup, that is made of different elements that were cooked for hours, and you can taste the different layers and ingredients in your mouth.I’m a maniac about hot peppers,the red ones. I am very happy that in March I’m going to India, where I can expand my collection.If I had to choose, I would go to a local pub in the UK with a fireplace and a lady that has prepared a stewMy father was a publisher.Every Wednesday they had a meeting in the publishing house and he would bring home some writers – sometimes important writers like Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Primo Levi. When I was about 16 years old, I was alone for a few months with my father, and he would call me at 5pm on Wednesdays and say, “Tonight, we are six!” And after a few months of experimenting, I was able to prepare a dinner for six, eight people. I learned a lot in those years. And it was nice to have those intellectuals coming there and saying, “We love this.”In general, I like more simple food,the local food and traditional food, more than the 10 stars.I’ve been to incredible restaurants, but if I had to choose, I would go, for example, to a local pub in the UK, where you have the fireplace and there’s a lady that has prepared a stew that is beautiful. I like more that style.My family produces wine in Piedmont.My grandfather bought some land at the end of the 19th century. Everybody in the area was making wine, but he was the first one to bottle a specific wine called dolcetto that, before him, you could only buy in big amounts. It started as a little winery, but now is quite big, and it’s very well respected. Every year it’s a different taste, and that is very beautiful. It’s a very special connection that you have with the land, with the wine that comes from there; waiting for the harvest and hoping that it doesn’t rain.I have quite a collection of teas now.I keep buying new, different flavours to try. My favourite, which I have almost every morning, is an assam from Fortnum & Mason that’s from a little garden called Dikom. Then I also like very much the greens, and Oolong from China, specifically tieguanyin, that’s very good for working, for concentration, for your brain.I enjoy very muchbuying different pans. Sometimes when I finish work and I don’t know what to do, I go to a certain shop and buy a new pan, and I’m very happy. I imagine all the food that I can cook in it.My favourite thingsFoodI have to say bagna cauda. When you are in the countryside, it’s beautiful to have it. It’s very tasty and very specific, and I love it.DrinkI will go for tea. Even though I like wine, at this time of my life, tea gives me the same wide range of tastes that I can have with wine, but without alcohol.Place to eatThe last time I was in London, there was a fantastic vegan restaurant called Farmacy in Notting Hill. It had an estate in the countryside where they produced all the vegetables that you could eat there. It’s closed now, unfortunately, but I think they would like to reopen.Dish to makeLast year I bought a Moroccan tagine and I very much enjoy making a tagine with vegetables or sometimes with fish and all the proper spices, like turmeric. Then, of course, my selection of hot chillies.Ludovico Einaudi’s new album The Summer Portraits (Decca) is out now. He tours the UK and Ireland from 30 June.

Keeping feet warm and dry can be partly achieved with thicker socks: “just make sure there’s enough space in your running shoes to accommodate them”. He recommends theSoar All Weather Sockdue to its “hollow yarn that traps an insulating layer of heat to keep you warm and a water-resistant coating to guard against saturation in the wet”.If you’re looking for running shoes that will ensure dry feet whatever the weather, a Gore-Tex upper is a good idea, “as it’s waterproof, lightweight and breathable”.

It’s not interesting.’Hayley MyersThe designer, 83, talks about her troubled childhood, love of art, and how she persuaded David Bowie to drop the dodgy brown suitsSat 22 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareDuring World War TwoI remember standing in total darkness in a corridor at our home in Versailles, listening to the bombs. I was two years old. The sound scared me so much that my parents sent me to their dear friends’ farm in Normandy, where I stayed for a long time. They called me “Lamb” and I called them “Shepherd’ and ‘Shepherdess”.Mother was complicated:strict, sometimes very nervous, often furious for no reason. She fought a lot with my father. Inside and outside the house, she was two different people. The life she wanted was with her lover, but back then you didn’t get divorced.Everyone in the familyknew I was my father’s preferred daughter. My sisters accepted it because they could see how alike we were. Bruno Troublé, my funny, interesting brother, was known as “le ravissant” – “the ravishing” – by my mother. He was her favourite.When I left my first marriageto Christian Bourgois, aged 20, I had no money. He paid my rent; the rest I had to manage. I sold my wedding jewellery and some furniture so I could feed our two children. Christian was an important literary publisher, but not a great husband. I kept the “B” for my surname, though.Nice girls are always in danger.I broke my leg when I was 12 and had to stay at home for a month. My uncle came to see me every night and abused me. He was a great man, with three children, but he loved me too much. It inspired my film,My Name Is Hmmm, about a girl who was abused by her father.The first Agnès Bstorein Paris was full of birds. We had two in a cage, then opened the door once they had babies. They added stray threads from the clothes to their nests and were very happy. In the end we had 35 birds, flying around to the sounds of Bob Marley and Roxy Music on the stereo.David Bowie worean awful brown pleated suit when I saw him in concert. I sent him a pair of black leather jeans with a note in the pocket that said “You should stick to a rock ’n’ roll style.” He bought more pieces from me, then I dressed him for 25 years including his 50th birthday at Madison Square Garden.I love artists.In 1984 I opened my own gallery; many of my friends are artists and photographers. When I’m in London I visit Gilbert and George at their house in Fournier Street in Spitalfields and Jay Jopling from the White Cube. Tracey Emin and Martin Parr, I adore. For me, there’s a natural connection between art and designing clothes.I hate fashion.It’s not interesting. I’ve never looked at what other designers are doing, I don’t go to shows, I don’t go shopping. I have no time for it. We never advertised Agnès B; advertising makes people silly. I still have my communist vision from the 60s.Pierre Bergé[co-founder of Yves Saint Laurent] and I lay down in the middle of Rue de Rivoli to raise awareness of the Aids epidemic. We lost friends to the disease; it was a terrible time. Still now, we have a bowl of condoms in our shops. People help themselves without buying anything, but that’s OK.Memories are good, but I’m not nostalgic. At 83, I don’t feel older than I did 10 years ago. I have interesting people around me: grandchildren and great-grandchildren, musicians, models, colleagues who keep me young. I’m never bored.The new fragrance from Agnès B launches this autumn.

Welcome to the sycophancy stakes.On 23 January the congressman Addison McDowell of North Carolinaintroduced legislationto rename Washington Dulles international airport as Donald J Trump international airport.Love, rockets and media attacks: Trump and Musk bring their toxic bromance to Fox NewsRead more“We have entered the golden age of America largely thanks to President Trump’s leadership,” McDowell said. Alluding to Ronald Reagan Washington National airport, he added: “It is only right that the two airports servicing our nation’s capital are duly honored and respected by two of the best presidents to have the honor of serving our great nation.”Not to be outdone, on the same day the Tennessee congressman Andy Oglesproposed a House of Representatives joint resolutionto amend the constitution so that a president can serve up to three terms – provided that they did not serve two consecutive terms before running for a third.This would continue to bar Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama from running again but enable Trump, elected in 2016 and 2024, to seek a third term in 2028.Ogles explained: “He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation’s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal.”On 28 January Anna Paulina Luna, a congresswoman from Florida,put forward legislationto arrange the carving of Trump’s face on the Mount Rushmore national memorial in South Dakota. Such a move would put him alongside the former presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.Luna said: “President Trump’s bold leadership and steadfast dedication to America’s greatness have cemented his place in history. Mount Rushmore, a timeless symbol of our nation’s freedom and strength, deserves to reflect his towering legacy – a legacy further solidified by the powerful start to his second term.”On 14 February the New York congresswoman Claudia Tenneyintroduced legislationto officially designate 14 June as a federal holiday to commemorate Trump’s birthday, along with the date in 1777 when the US approved the design for its first national flag. The holiday would be known as “Trump’s Birthday and Flag Day”.Tenney explained: “Just as George Washington’s birthday is codified as a federal holiday, this bill will add Trump’s birthday to this list, recognizing him as the founder of America’s Golden Age. Additionally, as our nation prepares to celebrate its 250th anniversary, we should create a new federal holiday honoring the American flag and all that it represents.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many conservatives would be reluctant to tamper with an American icon such as Mount Rushmore, which took 14 years to carve and was completed in 1941.Ogles’s stunt faces the biggest obstacle of all. A constitutional amendment must receive a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate. If that is achieved, three quarters of the states – 38 – must ratify the amendment for it to become part of the constitution.Still, the unsubtle exercises in ring-kissing and genuflection demonstrate that, buoyed by election success, Trump’scontrol over the Republican partyis now all but absolute. From Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” to the upending of US policy on Ukraine, few Republicans are willing to speak out against the president-cum-monarch.“We’ve gone from ‘Make America Great Again’ to make ‘America Great Britain Again’,” saidKurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional aide. “You might as well have an image of Donald Trump staring at a portrait of King George and then turning around and putting a crown on his head, a robe around his suit and a sceptre in his hand.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRepublicansUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amid wider concerns about the health of Europe’s stagnating largest economy, the state of its trains has become something of a metaphor for a more general sense of malaise.On Sunday Germans will go to the polls in one of the most important elections in recent times, with an emboldened far right hoping to more than double its share of votes. In the run-up, the Guardian travelled more than 850 miles on trains across Germany to hear what its citizens have to say about the state of their nation.map of train tripIn conversations with more than 50 people across five cities and over six days, we heard their hopes, fears and aspirations. Some spoke of increasing polarisation, of worries that a country that has spent decades undoing the evils of nazism could be heading back to the populist far right. Others complained about bureaucracy, energy costs – and, yes, about the trains.These, from a journey that took in Berlin, Magdeburg, Bremerhaven, Gelsenkirchen and Dresden, are their voices.View image in fullscreenMagdeburg, where a Christmas fair in the city last year was attacked by a doctor who drove his car into the crowd of revellers.Magdeburg:‘It feels like we’ve lost our way’In this city, south-west of Berlin, an erstwhile baroque jewel that was heavily bombed in the second world war, a cold winter mist hangs in the morning air and an accordion player in a trilby squeezes out the notes to the theme tune of the Godfather. Polish workers are up ladders in the city centre dismantling golden Christmas decorations.An attack on theChristmas markethere in December, in which a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia drove an SUV into crowds, killing six and injuring nearly 300, thrust Magdeburg into the political debate and prompted calls for tightened security, deportations and more border controls. It took place a month after the “traffic-light” Social Democrat (SPD)-led coalition that had ruled Germany since 2021 collapsed, precipitating Sunday’s snap vote.View image in fullscreenBernd Katterfeld, 84, a retired steel engineer.In a campaign subsequently dominated by questions of migration and security, key issues for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, the attack proved pivotal.“When I was a child there were no safety worries when we went to the Christmas market,” says Bernd Katterfeld, 84, whom we meetclose to the square where the attack took place. “For some years now it’s been secured by barriers and chains, but even that wasn’t enough to stop someone from carrying out a murderous attack.”The attack, the retired steel engineer predicts, will boost the success of the far right “because the government is not undertaking enough measures to stop such incidents”. He does not understand why recent demonstrations had focused on “protesting against the right, rather than against those who carry out dreadful attacks on us”.“It feels like we’ve lost our way,” he says. “I’ve always thought of Germany as a good and rich country, which had the important things in life under control.”He brings the conversation to an abrupt end with a broad smile. His wife is waiting at home with a lunch of pork chops, broccoli and potato and he cannot be late.At the nearby Johanniskirche, people have left their messages of condolence to the victims, in particular the youngest to be killed, nine-year-old André. “You live on in our hearts,” reads one. Another vows: “Justice will be sought in your name.”View image in fullscreenA studio audience watches the main parties prepare for a TV debate in Bremerhaven, hosted by the TV anchor Anke Götz.Bremerhaven:‘We need to protect our democracy’On our way to the port city on a bustling regional commuter train we meet Faradis Youdi, an engineer from Kabul who went to Ukraine 33 years ago as a 12-year-old orphan, studied at Kharkiv University and fled three years ago to Germany, where he works as a cleaner.“Life isn’t easy, but I do my best,” he tells us with a smile through a translator app, before alighting swiftly with a friendly wave.In Bremerhaven,Diab Bransi, who cameto Germany from Palestine in 1989, is waiting for notification on his application for citizenship.An assistant at theAuswanderer Haus– a museum that tells the stories of the millions of people who left Europe from the port city between 1830 and 1974 – he cannot vote in Sunday’s election, but recognises that “much is at stake”.View image in fullscreenDiab Bransi, a Palestinian who works at the museum of German Emigration.“I hope that everyone comes to their senses.Europeneeds Germany, but not a far-right Germany,” he says.The two parties leading in the polls – the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led by Friedrich Merz, and the AfD, co-led by Alice Weidel – have proposed the imposition of drastic restrictions at Germany borders. If this were to happen, Bransi says, “we can close up Europe, forget free trade, the single currency”. Migrants, he adds, are “increasingly being viewed with suspicion”.Across town, Buten un Binnen, a regional TV programme, is setting up a studio in a former cinema and candidates for the SPD, CDU, AfD, Greens and far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) gather for a live discussion on migration.Renate Petersen, 66, an anaesthetic nurse who has recently retired after 47 years in the job, is in the audience. “I’m already decided I’ll vote for the SPD but I wanted to hear what the others had to say,” she says. “What’s most important for me is that we stop the slide towards the brown swamp of nazism. How can we be so dumb as to risk falling into that again? We need to protect our democracy.”View image in fullscreenRenate Petersen, 66, a retired nurse and SPD voter.Petersen escaped communist East Germany in 1986, aged 27, where she had been spied on by colleagues and friends. “Not a day goes by when I don’t feel happy to be free,” she says. “It’s all the more reason I’m proud to live in a democracy where everyone can shape their own lives, where we can go anywhere we want, and live together in Europe. It’s time we started talking these things up.”She does not trust Merz over his“collaboration” with the AfD– the conservative leader recently relied on far-right support to try to get his border tightening plan through parliament. “He’s a liar – he’ll continue to lie,” she says.Germany risks becoming increasingly less attractive to migrants, she fears, “even though we desperately need them, due to our ageing population”.

Stefan Dettmann, 62, is unsure how he will vote, but says he would like Germany to be governed by a coalition between the AfD and the CDU.“Which we could get if it weren’t for theBrandmauer”,the car mechanic says,referring to the consensus between parties that they will retain a “firewall” between them and the far-right: “I have little hope this will happen in the next four years but next time round I think they’ll have little choice as the pressure on them will only grow.”Migration is far from the only thing on Bremerhaven’s collective mind. In the fisheries quarter, Felix Ahlers,the CEO of FRoSTA, a producer of preservative-free, frozen ready meals,is more concerned about Germany’s notorious red tape and says many of his biggest challenges stem from overregulation.View image in fullscreenFelix Ahlers, the CEO of FRoSTA, a ready meal producer.Keen to embrace renewables, Ahlers appointed a dedicated person to obtain permission to build a wind turbine with a view to the output covering 10% of the factory’s electricity needs “at our own expense and on the company’s own land”. But 18 months in, the project is far from complete.“So many different authorities are involved. It’s complex and very slow,” he says. “If they think the turbine will cast a shadow, however briefly, on the eyes of the workforce, that is a reason to disallow it.“So much is laborious, and very frustrating, particularly if you’re trying to do something innovative.”View image in fullscreenA worker making frozen meals at FRoSTA in Bremerhaven.Red tape, or, as Merz has termed it, the “bureaucracy monster”, has been a persistent theme in the election campaign, with the pro-business and small-government Free Democrats (FDP) proposing closing more than 100 government agencies to streamline the administration and save billions. Merz once famously argued a tax return should fit on to a beer coaster.Their concerns have found a vocal mouthpiece in the US billionaire Elon Musk who, in an online chat with the AfD’s Alice Weidel, claimed that the approval documents for a Tesla plant near Berlin had stretched to a truckload of paper and that each page had had to be stamped by hand.Ahlers says he had expected more from the Olaf Scholz’s government, and in particular from his coalition partners, the Greens. “They promised a lot but have not delivered. Their impact could have been much bigger. After all, when Germany makes the first step, as such a big power in Europe, others follow. If it doesn’t, nothing happens.”View image in fullscreenTTZ Bremerhaven scientists.Down the road atTTZ Bremerhaven, an independent research institute, the technical head, Markus von Bargen, 52, is also critical of Scholz’s coalition; its three years, he says, have been “catastrophic”. The forthcoming election does not fill him with optimism, either. He watched a debate between Scholz and his likely successor, Merz, which he found “quixotic – unworldly”: “Two men who don’t understand everyday life.”Gelsenkirchen: ‘The AfD will deport people like me’From Bremerhaven to Germany’s poorest city, with one of the country’s highest unemployment rates.

He does not want the CDU to work with the AfD “because they are my arch enemy”.

The in-house (that Ruth built) rule that denied New York Yankees players the right to wear beards on baseball diamonds from the 1970s on is done and dusted, not unlike likeThe Bosshimself,who died at 80 back in 2010. It’s the latest move showing that the new boss, George’s son Hal, who axed the 49-year-old rule on Friday, will do everything he can to differentiate himself from the old Boss, his dad.“In recent weeks I have spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees – spanning several eras – to elicit their perspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy, and I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback,” Steinbrennersaid in a statement. “These most recent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue that dates back several years.“Ultimately the final decision rests with me, and after great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.”It’s a sensible decision by Hal, even if it may lead some fans to bemoan that the Yankeesjust aren’t the Yankees anymore. And those fans, who surface after every mini-losing streak, may actually have a point. After all, Hal does not spend foolishly like a drunken sailor. Hal doesn’t treatmanagers and general managers like Tinder dates. Hal hasn’t made anyillegal campaign contributions to sitting presidents. Hal hasn’t sent a mob-tied unsavory character to follow around Aaron Judge to dig up dirt,like his dad did to the franchise player Dave Winfield. Hal has yet to nearly cancel dental insurance for his Yankee Stadium employees. Hal hasn’t threatened tomove the team to New Jerseyevery time something goes wrong with their new stadium. Hal doesn’t override the general manager and trade their best prospects on whims. Hal doesn’t ask his managers to play every one of 162 regular season games like an NFL game, as the football-obsessed George always wanted. And Hal didn’t ask his equipment manager to withhold a uniform to one of his players until they shaved off their afro,as was done to Oscar Gamble in 1976. Neat hair was also part of the rule.And now Hal won’t forcehisplayers to shave, just because his father may have wanted to mask the daily chaos happening in and around Yankee Stadium by forcinghismen into a clean-shaven, prim, proper and professional look. Talk about irony.If anything it’s a wonder that in this era of Instagram individualism, where everyone tries to look different despite mostly looking the same, that the rule to keep Bronx ballplayers beard-free lasted this long. Now, for clarity, if you think you’re going to be seeing long, gruff, twisty,Brian Wilson-type beardsflirting with diamond dust any time soon, guess again. Remember, Hal says beards must be “well-groomed”.Why now? Well, this move is further proof that theLos Angeles Dodgersand the New York Mets have overtaken the Yankees. You may be able to institute juvenile policies on your ballclub when you have the highest payroll in baseball, decade after decade. But when that’s no longer the case, players may be less inclined to put up with such nonsense. If you’re a bearded ballplayer with a similar offer from Queens or Chavez Ravine, well, you’re that much less inclined to sign in the Bronx.Devin Williams is a case in point. The closer, who is now known for his handsome beard as much as his fastball, was most definitely unhappy about having to shave upon his arrival in Tampa where the Yankees train each spring. Williams, who was acquired by New York from Milwaukee this offseason, is a free agent after this year. So why would a guy so in love with his thick, rich beard, who is clearly miserable and who clearly sneaked some stubble into his team picture just two days ago, come back to a ballclub that laid him bare for all to see? Answer? He wouldn’t, and that’s precisely why this is a business move more than anything else.The repeal of this Boss-era rule means that we’ll never again get those little Yankees rebellions that gave us Goose Gossage’s Fu Manchu style mustache, which he grew to “to piss Steinbrenner off”, and we’ll never again see anything resemblingThe Simpsons’ Don Mattingly moment. Jarring transformations, like Johnny Damon as the thick bearded, long haired “idiot” Red Sox star, to the clean cut Wall Street-looking outfielder, and the brutally savage trimming of Randy Johnson’s marvelous mullet, are also out for good.Instead, Yankees fans will now watch and wait for any growth signaling the ultimate reversal: Aaron Judge as a newly bearded baseball menace, batting clean-up in the Bronx.Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBUS sportsLos Angeles DodgersNew York MetsMilwaukee BrewersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One, titled the Great German Art Exhibition, featured art viewed by the regime as appropriate and aspirational for the ideal Aryan society – orderly and triumphant, with mostly blond people in heroic poses amid pastoral German landscapes. The other showcased what Adolf Hitler and his followers deemed “degenerate art” (“Entartete Kunst”). The works, chaotically displayed and saddled with commentary disparaging“the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil”, were abstract, profane, modernist and produced by the proclaimed enemies of the Reich – Jewish people, communists or those suspected of being either.The Degenerate Art exhibition, which later toured the country, opened a day after Hitler declared “merciless war” on cultural disintegration. The label applied to virtually all German modernist art, as well as anything deemed “an insult to German feeling”. The term and the dueling art exhibitions were part and parcel of Hitler’s propaganda efforts toconsolidate powerand bolster the regime via cultural production. The Nazis used culture as a crucial lever of control, to demean scapegoated groups, glorify the party and “make the genius of the race visible to that race”, argued the French scholar Eric Michaud in The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany. Political control and suppression of dissent were one thing; art,saidHitler’s propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, was “no mere peacetime amusement, but a sharp spiritual weapon for war”.Artists demand National Endowment for the Arts roll back Trump restrictionsRead moreEarlier this month,Donald Trumptook theunprecedented stepof naming himself as chair of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, one of the nation’s premier cultural centers, after purging the board of Biden appointees and installing a slate of unqualified donors and loyalists. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA”, the US president wrote on Truth Social. (The center hosted a nominal amount of acts with drag elements.) Days later, Trump was formallyvoted inby the board – “unanimously”, he noted on Truth Social in a Putin-esque flourish. “There’s no more woke in this country,”he told reporters.The movedrew outcryfrom performers, artists and more, but still went through. The Kennedy Center’s trustees arepresidential appointees, so technically it is vulnerable to such flexes of control, as are other federally supported institutions such as the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian Institution and DC’s consortium of national museums. Some of Trump’s cultural decrees trend ridiculous, such as an executive order calling for a “national garden of American heroes”, or the continued presence of Kid Rock. Others are more insidious – after long threatening to defund the National Endowment for the Arts during his first term, Trump hasimposedrestrictions on its terms, barring federal grants for projects concerning Maga’s favorite targets – diversity and “gender ideology”.View image in fullscreenJoseph Stalin.Photograph: Culture Club/Getty ImagesWhile the takeover of the Kennedy Center may seem less dire and court less furor than, say, hisdismantling of the civil service, Trump’s efforts to exert control over art typify the strategy of a dictator. Comparisons of the Trump presidency to Nazi Germany may be overdone and easily dismissed – even with Republican efforts to ban books in schools deemed “inappropriate”, among many other parallels, Maga and the Third Reich are not the same – but the new administration’s cultural decrees are very much a part ofthe authoritarian playbookto suppress dissent, scapegoat select groups and seize power.Pick your oppressive regime throughout time and you will find efforts to control the arts. Some of the most renowned artefacts from ancient Rome, from Virgil’s Aeneid to Trajan’s Column, were commissioned by emperors to vivify their divine right to power, celebrate military conquests and cement preferred narratives. The Stalinist regime in the 1930s Soviet Unionabolishedall independent artistic institutions, required cultural production to exist in absolute allegiance to the party, and systemically executed all of the country’s Ukrainian folk poets. Mao Zedong’s cultural revolution identified “old culture” as one of the four threats to be eradicated as part of his reshaping of Chinese society, which killed more than a million people. After Augusto Pinochet took over Chile in 1973, the regimearrested, tortured and exiledmuralists. In her 2012bookBrazilian Art Under Dictatorship, the art historian Claudia Calirman recalls how the museum director Niomar Moniz Sodré Bittencourt hid artworks and advised artists on how to leave the country after officials from the country’s military regime entered her museum and demanded the removal of “dangerous” images – a claim not far removed from theTrump administration’s fearmongering around “gender ideology” and “threats” to children.Stars pull out of shows and positions at Kennedy Center after Trump takeoverRead moreThese tactics continue in the present, carried out in some cases by Trump’s expressed allies. The same Brazilian dictatorship that overtook and blocked art exhibitions between 1968 and 1975 is today championed by the Trump allyJair Bolsonaro, who worked during his time as president to rewrite the regime’s reputation. On his first day in office in 2019, Bolsonaro dissolved Brazil’s ministry of culture. He alsohalvedfunding for the Rouanet Law, a measure that publicly supports artists, and appointed rightwing cultural figures with little relevant experience to prominent cultural positions. In Poland, the rightwing Law and Justice party has tried to rewrite history at the second world war museum in Gdańsk and dismissed its director, Paweł Machcewicz; in recent years, Italy’s rightwing minister of culture, Alberto Bonisoli, threatened to not renew the contracts of non-Italian museum directors. Much ado was made in the western press when Cuba jailed theperformance artist Danilo Maldonadofor criticizing the Castro regime in 2017, or when China’s ruling party placed the renowned artist Ai Weiweiunder house arrest.View image in fullscreenViktor Orbán and Donald Trump.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APBut perhaps no one models what Trump aspires to be, and hopes to do, more than Hungary’sViktor Orbán, who since his election in 2010 has rewritten the constitution, changed electoral law to favor his Fidesz party, positioned allies as heads of most media outlets and overhauled the justice system. And as part of his consolidation of power intofull dictatorship, he has takencontrol of the country’s cultural institutions, managing their output and enshrining censorship. Starting when Fidesz first gained municipal power in 2006, the party has purged the boards of local theaters and installed Fidesz loyalists. In 2010, Orbán took over public institutions via appointment of governing bodies that could grant or withhold funds according to the organization’s willingness to heed demands. In 2013, hedismissedthe artistic director of the National Theatre in Budapest, Róbert Alföldi, on account of his resistance to political interference and his sexuality, viewed as offensive by the homophobic regime.Trump chairing a major arts institution would be laughable if it weren’t so deeply troubling | Charlotte HigginsRead moreBy 2019, Orbán could feasibly declare an era “of spiritual order, a kind of prevailing mood, perhaps even taste … determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is the task we are now faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era.” His government subsequently banned funding for gender studies at universities and passed a “culture law” tying funding of theaters to their ability to “actively protect the interests of the nation’s survival, wellbeing and growth”, a censorship measure thatsignificantly chilledthe country’s art scene.Such a measure is not dissimilar, in intent and execution, from Trump’s takeover of the Kennedy Center, nor his new mandates on the National Endowment for the Arts, which has already beensubject to decades’ worth of US culture wars. Those wars are heating up – if history and very recent precedent are anything to go by, then Trump and his party’s efforts to chip away at US cultural autonomy, at individual and institutional creative expression, will be one of his most corrosive and anti-democratic legacies.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationAdolf HitlerArtGermanyViktor OrbánHungaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Cook Islands is small, and when you sign deals with economic giants likeChina, you have to question the long-term consequences.”Cook Islands releases terms of deal with China amid protests about lack of transparencyRead moreThe agreement with China marks the first time the Cook Islands has struck a major deal with a country outside its traditional partners, former colonial rulerNew Zealandand Australia. The agreement centres on economic, infrastructure and maritime cooperation and seabed mineral development, among other areas. It does not include security or defence.But a lack of consultation with New Zealand led to adiplomatic row with Wellingtonand protests in the Cook Islands this week. Cook Islands operates in “free association” with New Zealand and while the country of about 17,000 people governs its own affairs, New Zealand provides assistance with foreign affairs, disaster relief and defence. Its citizens hold New Zealand citizenship.Syme-Buchanan was one of more than 400 Cook Islanders who took part in the protest prompted by the deal causing harm to relations with New Zealand, as well as perceived attempts to cut ties with Wellington after the Cook Islands proposed creating its own passport. The plan was later abandoned.View image in fullscreenFe’ena Syme-Buchanan: ‘You have to question the long-term consequences.’Teariki Heather, an opposition member of parliament and the leader of the Cook Islands United party, organised Tuesday’s rally to “assure” New Zealand that “we love to keep our passport, that we care about our relationship as well”.“The prime minister has misled the whole country without consulting the agreement with the people and with our closest ally and constitutional partner, New Zealand, who has looked after us for the past 60 years,” Heather says.“The relationship with New Zealand means a lot to us Cook Islanders and the reaction from New Zealand about the lack of consultation and its impact is a cause for concern for us.”Concern over ‘vague’ dealIn addition to upsetting relations with Wellington, the deal has been criticised by politicians and residents for lacking detail – and casting doubt over what long-term impacts it may have in the Cook Islands.On Thursday, Brown said the lack of detail was deliberate“because the detail will be in any negotiations that will take place for any potential future projects”. He said there were “no projects or no actual engagements that have been signed up to”. Cook Islands has secured a NZ$4m ($2.3m) grant from China, which Brown said would be primarily used on renewable energies.Chinese premier Li Qiang, who met Brown before the deal was signed, said China was committed to equality among all countries, big or small, and supported the Cook Islands in choosing a development path suited to its national conditions. Li also said China was ready to push for deeper and mutually beneficial cooperation on oceans, infrastructure, agriculture and fisheries.The agreement also aims to attract more Chinese visitors to the Cook Islands to boost the country’s tourism industry, which contributed over half a billion NZ dollars to the economy last year.Map of RarotongaRarotonga is the main island of the Cook IslandsLiana Scott, the general manager of the Muri Beach Club Hotel, a boutique property located in Rarotonga’s tourism district, says the “vague document” might look enticing but the Cook Islands needs to be cautious of its long-term impacts.“While investment and bilateral relationships may seem appealing, China or any other superpower country for that matter often comes with long-term economic and political dependencies.”Scott says the China deal could undermine local businesses, and the focus should be on reducing debt dependence to “free us from foreign influence, secure financial stability and prioritise local development”.‘Best for our country’Not all Cook Islanders are apprehensive about the country drawing closer to China. Some see it as an opportunity to seek better support, particularly in shipping and agriculture.Puna Vano is the executive officer of the island government on Penryhn, which is the northernmost and most remote island in the Cook Islands group and one of the 15 islands that make up the country. The combined total land area of all the islands is about 236.7 sq km, but the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) covers about 2m sq km of ocean.Vano welcomed Chinese support for an inter-island shipping vessel to help transport goods and people from Rarotonga to other islands.“Shipping is a major issue for us in the northern group. We get a vessel here every four to five months and by that time we are out of basic goods. Things are also very expensive – almost twice the price from Rarotonga – and hopefully the government shipping service will lower the freight costs so things will be a bit cheaper,” Vano says.“It’s difficult for us living in the northern group. There is nothing here for us, the grass is greener elsewhere in Rarotonga, New Zealand and Australia, but it’s the love for the island that keeps the people here.”While Vano is wary of the ongoing diplomatic rift between the Cook Islands and New Zealand, he believes Cook Islands leaders should be “trusted” to do what is best for the nation.Trawl the sea or mine for metals? Pacific nations wrestle with how to protect oceans - and livelihoodsRead more“It is easy to stand outside and point at things unless they come in and sit and live the realities that we face on the ground every day,” he says.“I feel the prime minister is hearing our concerns and he is going out to find some assistance. We voted for him and his government so that they would represent us in the best interest of the nation, while balancing the pros and cons of any decisions they make.”Danny Mataroa, a traditional leader and grower from Rarotonga, says that just like New Zealand, the Cook Islands had every right to seek the best for its people.“This China deal could be easy money but I’ve confidence in our leadership that they have negotiated the best for the country, the people and our future.“We have learned from the experiences of other Pacific countries that may have rushed into agreements without careful consideration,” Mataroa says. “I’m sure our government has learned from those experiences and is not making the same mistakes.”Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsCook IslandsChinaNew ZealandAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This could get messy…Jane MartinsonSat 22 Feb 2025 07.50 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareWhen some of the mind games and manoeuvres that turned a Murdoch family “retreat” into an ordeal appeared inSuccession, the TV dramaabout squabbling family members of a right-wing media company, members of the real-life family started to suspect each other of leaking details to the writers. The truth was more straightforward.Succession’s creator,Jesse Armstrong, said that his team hadn’t needed inside sources – they had simply read press reports.Future screenwriters have been gifted a whole load of new Murdoch material in the past few days, after two astonishing stories in theNew York Timesand theAtlanticlifted the lid on the dysfunction, paranoia and despair at the heart of the most powerful family in global media.The stories followed the end of the secret trial involving the fate of theMurdoch family trust. The mogul’s four eldest children – Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence – were set to inherit the family firm following Rupert’s death. But four years ago, just after turning 90, Rupert had tried to cut James, Liz and Prue out of their inheritance and hand the businesses over to Lachlan, his favoured heir who also happens to share his increasingly right-wing politics.The lawsuit was brought by the three errant offspring, and in December a Nevada commissioner ruled in their favour, accusing Rupert and Lachlan of acting in “bad faith”. The trial took place in secret, but the fallout – thanks to theNew York Timesinvestigation and a 13,000-wordAtlanticinterview with James – has been anything but.View image in fullscreenRupert Murdoch with his sons Lachlan, left, and James, right, who called his father a ‘misogynist’.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersAmong the highlights – or the lowlights if you’re a Murdoch – were the revelation that Rupert’s plan to disinherit three of his four eldest children was dubbed “Project Family Harmony”, that Rupert’s lawyer had accused the three children of being “white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies”, and thatJames now viewed his father as a “misogynist”. As Jesse Armstrong might have said, he didn’t need to make it up.The fallout from this family saga will not just be felt by Rupert’s six children (two by histhird wife, Wendi Deng, inherit an economic rather than controlling stake) but by a vast business empire which includes Fox News in the US, HarperCollins and news titles, including theTimesand theSunin the UK.WhileNews UKmade no comment, a former adviser was furious at the potential impact. “It’s hard to overstate how uncertain everyone associated with the company feels right now. You’ve got some great journalists doing great work while squabbling billionaires fall out over even more money.”The decision by the Nevada family court judge is still to be approved after Rupert and Lachlan lodged an appeal, but few lawyers believe they will succeed. If the dispute is to be settled before the trust dissolves in 2030, the most likely scenario is for a sale of parts of the business valued at a combined $43bn. Such disposals could end decades of Murdoch family influence in the US and British political systems.The timing of this very public washing of the family linen comes just as the businesses themselves are enjoying a political and legal boom. The anti-environmentalist, right-wing causes espoused by Murdoch’sFoxNews may be loathed by some of his children but are very much in tune with the new US president. About a week before the NYT exposé, a withered-looking Rupert was pictured in the Oval Office alongside President Trump.Meanwhile, in the UK,News Corp has finally settled with Prince Harry, effectively ending a phone hacking scandal which kicked off in 2011. At a time when the news should be good for the future of the business, family members are at loggerheads over their share in the future. A dysfunctional family presiding over a functioning business.Claire Enders, who has studied the Murdoch empire for 40 years, is among many analysts who see little logic in the recent developments. “As a business analyst, I don’t see what the purpose was. I don’t see what they’re in such great disagreement about, since they’ve all contributed hugely to the value created since the nadir of the company only 13 years ago.”Author Michael Wolff tells me that the latest shenanigans simply “confirm” the hypothesis of his latest book on the family, which he calledThe Fall:The End of the Murdoch Empire. “I think that we’re clearly heading toward that [collapse]…Lachlan will be fired and the rest of the company will be dismantled.” Following the excoriating court ruling, Rupert has to either survive until he turns 99 in 2030 when the trust expires, or reach a settlement with James, Liz and Prue, dubbed the “objecting children” in court. With figures of $1bn for each beneficiary being mentioned in court and time running out, rumours of a sale of part of the business have multiplied, adding further uncertainty.Although the businesses are riding high politically, Fox News still faces a $2.7bn defamation claim from Smartmatic after on-air comments suggested the electronic voting systems helped rig the 2020 US presidential election. In April 2023, Fox reached a $787.5msettlementin a similar defamation lawsuit by voting technology company Dominion Voting Systems.Yet Fox News is the most profitable part of the Murdoch empire and likely to be the easiest to sell in the short term. It is separately traded and valued at $25bn, and there will be no shortage of billionaires willing to pay for its access and influence.That the company brings profits and political clout is likely to also make it attractive to the Murdoch heirs, including his 13 grandchildren, whatever their politics. One family adviser was incredulous at the suggestion that the more liberal-minded children would want to change its politics entirely: “the idea that the three siblings gang up and set up Guardian TV is ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenCauses espoused by Murdoch’s Fox News are in tune with the new US president.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesContinued financial dependence on the family businesses was no doubt behind the scathing comment from a spokesperson for Rupert and Lachlan who decried the “litany of falsehoods” in theAtlanticinterview coming “from someone who no longer works for the companies but still benefits from them financially”.Both Dow Jones (which includes theWall Street Journal) and HarperCollins, the world’s second biggest consumer book publisher (whoseauthors include vice-president JD Vance), could be disposed of but influence and anti-trust regulations are hurdles, unless removed in any upcoming Trumpian bonfire of regulations.At the less financially viable end of the scale are the News UK assets. While Murdoch’s British newspapers have long brought him huge political influence in Westminster – Rupert used the back door entrance to No 10 long before he was an Oval Office regular – there is a question mark over their contribution to the bottom line.TheTimesandSunday Times, theSunand its Sunday sister, could prove tough to sell because of both circulation revenues and regulatory hurdles. Total losses at theSunover the last five years reached £515meven before the settlement with Prince Harry, amid declining print sales and the high cost of paying damages to victims of illegal information-gathering.In 2021,the title’s overall value was slashed to zeroamid the payouts and the difficulty of adapting to a digital-only world.TheTimesand its Sunday sister title are performing far better, but the continuing saga of theTelegraph Media Group suggests that selling a UK newspaper is far from straightforward. Last year’s Foreign State Influence rules, brought in to stop a member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family buying the Barclay-ownedTelegraph, has added another hurdle to a potential takeover.Enders said: “You wouldn’t even be able to put a valuation on those companies [the UK newspapers] because of the rules in place on foreign ownership.” While the radio assets are admired, the companymoved its upstart news channel TalkTV onlinebecause of losses.The UK assets are also possibly the least loved by every Murdoch except Rupert. Although Rebekah Brooks, long-serving chief executive of News UK, has been described by some insiders as “Rupert’s seventh child”, she remains very much an employee. Liz Murdoch, the only scion who has made her life in the UK, has also long focused on TV assets such as successful production company Sister. News UK declined to comment.In his interview with theAtlantic, which at times makes excruciating reading, James calls his father a “misogynist” unable to see the abilities of his older sisters, Liz and Prue. While critical of his brother’s “reactionary” and “white nativist” ideas, he seems more shocked that his father is not the “devoted free-marketeer” and “believer in immigration as a source of industry and ingenuity” he had long thought he was.Although he has largely kept his counsel sinceresigning from the News Corp board in 2020, James has been happy to talk to journalists. In 2000, when he had just joined the family firm, Iinterviewed him for theGuardianin New York. There was a poster of Chairman Mao and an icon of Jesus above a framed picture of James with Rupert behind his desk. “My father’s politics and mine, which I think I understand better than many do, are probably reasonably close,” he said. “I think he is vastly misunderstood politically.”James was about to be sent out to Asia to run Star TV. When I asked to whom he will turn for advice in his new job, he says: “I know it sounds hokey, but I speak to my father.”In court, amid a welter of evidence that at one point saw James weep in the witness box, it emerged that he had not talked to his father for years. The fate of the Murdoch business will have a huge influence on global politics – but, as the writers ofSuccessionunderstood, it is also a brutal family drama.Jane Martinson is the author ofYou May Never See Us Again: The Barclay Dynasty.Explore more on these topicsRupert MurdochThe ObserverJames MurdochNews UKHackingThe SunPrince WilliamFoxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Medical service of Third Assault BrigadeLike the soldiers they battle to save, combat medics in Ukraine are under constant attack. Three years after the invasion, one NHS doctor bears witnessByRachel ClarkeSat 22 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShare“The frontline here is cold, hard, true war. My comrades and I had more than 40 bombs dropped on us by drones over two hours. You can’t hide from drones in a trench, but you can’t outrun them either. Your only hope to live is to zigzag, to be cleverer than the drone.”A gaunt 28-year-old former IT worker sits patiently beneath a window barricaded with sandbags, awaiting his turn on the operating table, cloaked in dust. Now an infantryman in the Ukrainian army’s Third Assault Brigade, “Sasha” (not his real name) has shrapnel embedded in his shoulder after the Russian assault on his foxhole. “When you hear a drone, you run as fast as you can and see if you can reach any trees,” he says. “If you’re out in the open, you try to get the drone behind you, so it won’t destroy your face. It’s not panic, this running; it’s a professional response. You know what you have to do to save your life and you do it.”The war inUkraineis dominated by drone use on an unprecedented scale. Some of the largest and most expensive drones in use are the winged Shahed attack devices bought by Russia from Iran, capable of flying more than 1,000km before smashing, kamikaze-style, into buildings. Much more common are the improvised drones that went for Sasha – tiny, adapted commercial quadcopters that used to be popular for filming weddings, yet which, once armed with explosives, become diminutive killing machines. Sasha made it to the trees, but not out of danger. He was hunted initially by nimble, first-person view devices controlled by operators using headsets and joysticks. These are usually aimed directly at their targets, killing them on impact, but they cannot follow fleeing troops through undergrowth. So Sasha’s pursuers switched instead to higher altitude drones, armed with explosives, that can lock on to targets from above the tree line.Having saved his own life by following his training and wrapping his limbs around a tree trunk, Sasha dismisses his injuries with a shrug. “This is a scratch,” he says. It takes a young civilian paediatric surgeon turned frontline trauma surgeon over an hour to extract the metal embedded in Sasha’s shoulder, using only a local anaesthetic as he burrows and probes. Sasha doesn’t make a sound. Medical equipment for the army’s walking wounded is often rudimentary. In this case, the surgeon resorts to a first world war technique of shrapnel extraction: inserting a magnet into the incision to drag the metal out. Even as his shoulder is being sutured shut, Sasha begins negotiating with the doctors to get back to his platoon without delay. Later, one of the doctors says to me, “Infantry, these guys are the guts of war. They go into hell every day. I’ve seen guys injured for the tenth time and they still go back, because this is their land they are fighting for.”View image in fullscreenA patient whose lung was punctured by shrapnel has a chest drain fitted …View image in fullscreen… from which blood and air bubble into a flask on the floor. Photographs: Rachel ClarkeFor security reasons, I cannot reveal the precise location of this field hospital, a few kilometres from Ukraine’s eastern front. Military medics and patients are regularly targeted by Russian forces, in violation of the Geneva conventions. I have travelled here with the Third Assault Brigade from Kharkiv – the country’s second largest city, located just 30km from the border with Russia – to join combat medics for 24 hours. It has taken two overnight trains, a 4x4 and more than 48 hours to reach this point from the Polish border, 1,000km to the west. We crossed empty plains, blank horizons. There is little to check either tanks or troops on this bare, steamrollered land. “Geographically, we are made for invasion,” observes my friend Andrii Myzak, a civilian neurosurgeon from Kyiv with whom I am travelling.This is my fourth visit to Ukraine since Putin launched his full-scale invasion three years ago. As an NHS palliative care doctor, I have been supporting and helping train local hospice teams. The more I learn about the ferocious resolve of Ukrainian healthcare workers to keep looking after their patients, the greater my respect for their efforts and my desire to bear witness. Adult, paediatric and maternity hospitals have all been targeted, including, in July 2024, Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital,Okhmatdytin Kyiv, where a missile strike killed two members of staff. Last August, the World Heath Organization reported1,940 confirmed attacks on Ukrainian healthcare, the highest number recorded in any humanitarian emergency globally to date.View image in fullscreenAndrii Myzak, a civilian neurosurgeon, outside bombed flats on the eastern front.Photograph: Rachel ClarkeFor Andrii, 54, operating in Kyiv means balancing the risks of opening up a patient’s skull with those of getting trapped above ground when a bombardment starts. “We have a rule when we hear the sirens,” he says. “If you’ve started, you don’t stop, not once the patient is anaesthetised.” Every time Andrii and his team continue a neurosurgery during an air raid, they risk their own lives to save their patient. It sounds dauntingly selfless, yet for Andrii, it’s still not enough. Last year he tried to join the Third Assault Brigade’s company of combat medics. Its chief medical officer, Viktoriia Kovach, a 31-year-old former obstetrician from Kyiv, permitted Andrii to spend a few days working in a field hospital before telling him bluntly, “Your skills are needed in Kyiv. I won’t employ a doctor who can do more good in their specialty back home.”By late afternoon, we finally reach the field hospital, an abandoned building in which a dozen doctors and nurses live and work together under fire. When not treating patients on operating tables and bloodstained stretchers, staff snatch rest on bunks in the basement, trying to ignore the sounds of battle above. There is an autoclave to sterilise instruments, a blood gas machine to analyse patients’ biochemistry and portable freezers full of blood and plasma, 50 or so units of which are used every week. Dozens of similar “stabilisation points” have been set up along the length of the front. They serve as critical first stops for wounded soldiers needing emergency treatment before being rushed onwards to major city hospitals for definitive care. About 30 wounded soldiers pass through this field hospital every day, but when the fighting intensifies that number can double or even triple.Something died  inside me. Too  much horror.  I stopped being able to feelFor now, it’s eerily quiet. Two wounded soldiers lie cocooned in foil to stave off hypothermia. A couple of doctors are slumped at desks. Hand-drawn pictures sent in by Ukrainian schoolchildren are taped to the walls to boost morale. “Everyone is waiting for the grey zone,” explains Viktoriia, who inspires palpable respect and affection from those she commands. She is alluding to the devastating impact on combat medicine of drone warfare. Drones have rewritten the rulebook on battlefield survival. They prevent military medics from doing the one thing, above all else, that helps keep the injured alive: treating them as quickly as possible.“When someone is hit, we can see them on the screen from our drones, but so can the Russians,” Viktoriia says. “Our troops have to try to drag the casualty into cover, otherwise they’ll be killed by drones. If a medical team tries to evacuate them, they will be hunted and killed, too.” The day’s grey zones – the murky half-light of dawn and dusk – give medical evacuation teams the best chance of reaching the injured without being attacked. But too often, the density of drones along the front leaves casualties stranded in no man’s land for hours or even days, with medics unable to reach them. Out here, there is no taking advantage of the “golden hour” – the vital window in which trauma teams are most likely to save critically injured patients. Sometimes, they can only bear witness as a casualty slowly bleeds to death.View image in fullscreenWalking wounded soldiers arrive at the field hospital from the frontline.Photograph: Ruslan BatytskyiNight falls and still everything is quiet at the field hospital. Shortly before midnight, I’m escorted out into subzero temperatures and taken to an underground tactical command centre even closer to the front. Inside the concrete bunker are a dozen soldiers and, on trestle tables, a vast map of the local territory, the frontlines marked in black ink. Vlad, the head of reconnaissance, uses a wooden pointer to show the pinch points. It could be a scene from a second world war film, until you glance up at the banks of computer screens showing real-time drone footage of the Russian frontline. Vlad, 35, was a senior executive in a multinational IT company in Kyiv before he volunteered to fight. “I brought some of our best coders to the brigade, too,” he says. “This is a tech war and algorithms are key.” A kind of nerd war, then? He grins. “Yes, down here it’s a war of the nerds.”Though the technology of killing has radically advanced, soldiers are dying just as they have for centuries. They bleed out. Their brains are battered. Organs fail. Vlad describes his team’s efforts, earlier in the afternoon, to direct combat medics to a casualty with a traumatic pneumothorax – a lung punctured by shrapnel embedded in the soldier’s chest wall. “But no one with that has made it to the stabilisation point,” I say. We exchange glances. A pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency. In the hours that drone fire has rendered him unreachable, the casualty may have died.When we return to the field hospital, an operating room is in full swing. The patient with the pneumothorax has just arrived, caked in mud and blood. A vascular surgeon daubs his chest with coppery Betadine, to prevent infection. He takes his scalpel at speed through skin, fascia and pleural membrane, then directly into the lung itself. Swiftly he inserts a large-bore chest drain – a plastic tube the diameter of a small hosepipe. Blood and air start to bubble from the lung into a flask on the ground beside the surgeon’s blood-soaked clogs. The soldier’s oxygen saturations climb up. He is going to live.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Three medevac ambulances arrive at once, each bearing two patients. So dishevelled and bone-weary are the combat medics, it’s hard to distinguish them from the walking wounded. The two most seriously injured have life-threatening leg wounds from drone blasts. They are alive only because their comrades staunched major haemorrhages with military grade tourniquets. There’s a catch, though. One of the men was pinned down on the battlefield by drones for 36 hours; the other, a 35-year-old called Mykola, for three days. To prevent bleeding out, a tourniquet must encircle a limb so tightly that the arteries are crushed flat against bone. After six hours, lack of oxygen begins to turn living flesh necrotic. Each man’s injured leg is visibly swollen, deep purple and horribly misshapen. Amputation looks inevitable.View image in fullscreenA soldier called Mykola is treated by anaesthetist Jenya …View image in fullscreen… after being pinned down on the battlefield by drones for three days, with his leg in a tourniquet. Photographs: Rachel ClarkeView image in fullscreenA surgeon cuts from knee to ankle to perform a last-ditch diagnostic procedure. The news is bad: Mykola’s leg is entirely dead and amputation looks certain.Photograph: Ruslan BatytskyiMykola has lost much blood. An anaesthetist called Jenya administers drugs to keep him lightly unconscious while the team, working with wordless precision, cut off his clothes, wrap him in foil and insert a large line into his jugular to administer blood, plasma and antibiotics. You don’t give up on a limb lightly. The surgeon makes a sweeping incision from knee to ankle to perform a last-ditch diagnostic fasciotomy. The procedure, exposing all the muscles surrounding the shin, allows him to directly apply an electrode to the muscles, searching for the tiniest flickers of life. Mykola’s leg is entirely dead. Leaving the tourniquet on – it is too dangerous to remove it this close to the front – the surgeon packs the wound and bandages it shut. A nurse wraps Mykola in thick woollen jumpers, donated by local residents. Half-awake now, he struggles to raise his head, frantically trying to ascertain if he still possesses two legs. With gentle authority, Jenya presses Mykola back down. “Easy, comrade. Easy.”Just before an ambulance rushes him to Kharkiv for the amputation he doesn’t yet know is coming, Mykola is able to tell me what happened. “Three drones went for me. Two missed me and the third hit me. I was able to run into the trench and yell, ‘My leg!’ and then I lost consciousness. My comrades put the tourniquet on, but the drones trapped us in the trench for three days.” I ask what his hopes are. “For my leg to be better as soon as possible, so I can come back here and fight again.”A night with the drone squad targeting Russian forces in micro battlesRead moreShortly before dawn, I talk with Jenya – who signed up to defend his parents and young daughter – about the impact of this work on his state of mind. “I have very bad sleep. You have to be in a state of always being prepared, tense, always ready for action. I loved being an anaesthetist. When this is over, all I want is to sleep for a month and see my daughter.” He appeared sensitive and gentle when treating Mykola, but insists he feels nothing any more. “I am quite introverted. I tried not to take all this pain inside myself, but it’s such a struggle. In the early days I found it very hard to see so much suffering. Then I was sent to Bakhmut.” The frontline city was shelled so relentlessly that in 2023, President Zelenskyy told the G7 in Japan that its devastation reminded him a little of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb. “Nothing alive is left,”he said simply. Jenya estimates that over nine months in Bakhmut, he treated between 6,000 and 7,000 civilian and military casualties, including children. “Something died inside me. Too much horror. I stopped being able to feel,” he says.He hesitates. Then, doctor to doctor, and with an expression that tells me he knows how wrong it is for a clinician to utter these words, he adds, “I want to strangle Russians. They have brought so much suffering here, it is impossible to forgive. I have seen children die and doctors die and nurses die, so many friends die. I want to kill Russians.” Like many of the staff I speak to in the field hospital, Jenya worries that even if he survives the war, he will never be the same again. Three years in, Ukrainian combat medics are often taking antidepressants, receiving online therapy, fighting to sleep and experiencing traumatic flashbacks, all while continuing to work and knowing they are targets themselves. “It is hard to keep on, but we will because we have no choice,” Jenya says. “We are defending our homes, our land, our children. We can’t stop.”Where first names only are used, this is at the request of the individual, for security reasons.

Instead, Richard Chambury took it in the spring of 2013, in London’s Victoria Park.“My daughter was 11 and to get her out and about on the weekends we used to go cycling,” Chambury says. “We eventually discovered this was not her favourite pastime; she’s a reader, and likes the warmth. But we always saw odd things going on, people doing the morning walk of shame dolled up from the night before, or wild birds and swans knocking about.”‘A lovely opportunity to capture a funny moment’: Lorraine Poole’s best phone pictureRead moreOn this particular Sunday afternoon, it was cold and raining, and the pair were in a hurry to get home. Chambury took just one shot of this person as they passed by, on his phone. “It was so fleeting, yet weirdly they were almost posing. Londoners can be like that in some respects, or they can be quite aggy! Of course, wearing a bag on your head is an obvious thing for someone to photograph,” Chambury says. “Having zoomed in a few times, I am quite sure they are looking straight down the lens. But they said nothing and kept walking.”And what of the identity of the subject of the photo – who is the man behind the bag? “I have no idea. Perhaps it was a celebrity? It could be Lord Lucan.

But to find a second is the stuff of dreams.Last week British archaeologist Piers Litherland announced the find of the century – the firstdiscovery of a rock-cut pharaoh’s tomb in Egypt since Tutankhamun’s in 1922.His team found the pharaoh Thutmose II’s tomb underneath a waterfall in the Theban mountains in Luxor, about 3km west of the Valley of the Kings. It contained almost nothing but debris, and the team believe it was flooded and emptied within six years of the pharaoh’s death in 1479BC.Now Litherland has told theObserverhe believes he has identified the location of a second tomb belonging to Thutmose II. And this one, he suspects, will contain the young pharaoh’s mummified body and grave goods.Archeologists believe this second tomb has been hiding in plain sight for 3,500 years, secretly buried beneath 23 metres of limestone flakes, rubble, ash and mud plaster and made to look like part of the mountain.“There are 23 metres of a pile of man-made layers sitting above a point in the landscape where we believe – and we have other confirmatory evidence – there is a monument concealed beneath,” he said. “The best candidate for what is hidden underneath this enormously expensive, in terms of effort, pile is the second tomb of Thutmose II.”While searching close to the first tomb for clues about where its contents were taken after the flood, Litherland found a posthumous inscription buried in a pit with a cow sacrifice. This inscription indicates the contents may have been moved by the king’s wife and half-sister Hatshepsut – one of Egypt’s greatest pharaohs and one of the few women to rule in her own right – to an as-yet undiscovered second tomb nearby.View image in fullscreenThe Valley of the Kings in Luxor, Egypt, near where Thutmose II’s tomb was found.Photograph: Image by Ramesh Thadani/Getty ImagesLast week the New Kingdom Research Foundation, a British independent academic body, and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities revealed that a project led by Litherland had found the first tomb in 2022, after more than a decade of work.For about a year, he and his team of Egyptian archaeologists – “discoveries like this are not made by individuals”, he says – have been investigating ways to get access to the second tomb by excavating the 3,500-year-old human-made layers of rock and plaster that surround it.At the top of layers of thick limestone plaster, limestone flakes “the size of a dining room table”, tufa (a flaky limestone which forms a cement) and rubble, is a layer of mud plaster with ash on top, Litherland said. “Among that ash, we found the remains of beer jars and chisel ends used by workmen who made tombs. So there’s no doubt these layers are man-made.”At that point, any tomb underneath the layers would have been well covered. But a further step was taken “and that is what is slowing everything down” on the dig, said Litherland. The ancient Egyptians then “levered away large portions of the cliff and made them come crashing down on top”. These large rocks – some of which are the size of a car – were then “cemented in place using limestone plaster”.Now Litherland’s team is trying to detach those rocks and the limestone plaster by hand: “We’ve tried to tunnel into it, we’ve tried to shave away the sides, but there are overhanging rocks, so it’s too dangerous,” Litherland said.He, his foreman, Mohamed Sayed Ahmed, and his archeological director, Mohsen Kamel, took the difficult decision to remove the entire structure – which stands out from the cliff – three weeks ago, and are about halfway there. “We should be able to take the whole thing down in about another month,” Litherland said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By covering the tomb with layers of plaster and limestone flakes, Ineni protected it from water while simultaneously sealing and concealing the site from robbers. “Ineni says in his biographies that he did a lot of clever things to hide the locations of tombs, including covering the tombs with layers of mud plaster, which he says has never been done before. This has not been remarked on ever, to my knowledge.”It is a strategy that appears to have worked. While grave goods from the ransacked tombs of pharaohs from the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties are commonplace in museums, “there are no burial goods of any sort relating to the burial of Thutmose II in any museum or private collection”, Litherland said.The body of a 30-year-old, found in 1881 in Deir el-Bahari and previously identified as Thutmose II, is too old to belong to the pharaoh, Litherland said. “He is described in Ineni’s biography as coming to the throne ‘the falcon in the nest’ – so he was a young boy.” Some Egyptologists believe he reigned for just three to four years and died shortly after fathering Thutmose III.For Litherland, who became fascinated with ancient Egypt as a young boy, the thought of finding Thutmose II’s final resting place is breathtaking. “You dream about such things. But like winning the lottery, you never believe it will happen to you.”View image in fullscreenArtefacts found during excavations that discovered the tomb of Thutmose II.Photograph: Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsEgyptologyThe ObserverEgyptTutankhamunMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaArchaeologyHistorynewsShareReuse this content"

One of the four victims – who were all targeted in 2021 and 2022 – awoke from a coma after Phelps gave him prescription sedatives over the course of a week, Evans added.Previous victim of woman linked to death of journalist says he tried to warn publicRead moreIn one instance, Phelps is alleged to have kidnapped a victim by heavily sedating him and taking him across the US-Mexico border in a wheelchair – and then to aMexicoCity hotel room, where he was later found dead.After incapacitating her victims, Evans said, Phelps stole their cars, withdrew money from their bank accounts, used their credit cards to purchase luxury items and gold, and even tried to access social security and retirement accounts.According to the indictment, Phelps met one man in July 2021, went on lunch dates with him, ordered lunch to his house that November and slipped him a prescription drug.While he was “mostly unconscious” for about five days, Phelps gained access to his accounts and stole his iPhone, iPads, driver’s license and bank cards, according to the indictment. She also allegedly accessed his E-Trade account and sold Apple stock worth about $3.3m, though she was unable to withdraw that money.Authorities believe Phelps used popular dating apps including Tinder, Hinge and Bumble to find her targets. The men were lonely and looking for companionship and went on multiple dates with Phelps before she stealthily gave them sedatives, according to Evans.“It’s folks that are out looking for love that ran into something far more sinister,” Evans said.Phelps, a dual citizen of Mexico and the US, had been on the FBI’s radar for a couple of years, according to Evans. He declined to comment on her criminal history.Phelps does not have a US-based attorney who could speak on her behalf, a spokesperson for the justice department said. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment with Mexico’s foreign affairs ministry and attorney general’s office.Several of the victims’ relatives called authorities when they were unable to contact their loved ones, Evans said.One woman was unable to reach her father the day after he went on a date with Phelps in Guadalajara, Mexico, in May 2022, according to court records. The next day, Mexican police found him dead on the bathroom floor of his home. Phelps then used an account belonging to the victim to buy a gold coin, along with other transactions, the indictment alleges.The FBI is aware of more alleged victims in the US and Mexico, Evans said – and is making information about the case public, including suspected aliases, in hopes of identifying others who “fell victim to her scams and whose trust in her may have cost them their life”.The FBI is also working with the justice department and Mexican authorities to secure her extradition.If convicted on every charge, which include seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, six counts of bank fraud, three counts of identity theft and one count of kidnapping, Phelps faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, Fahami said.Explore more on these topicsLas VegasUS crimeFBIMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

And, among other maneuvers, Trump unilaterally ordered that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America while seeking administrativeretribution against the Associated Pressfor not changing its style to comply with that directive. Sheinbaum, for her part,threatenedthe creators of Google Maps with a lawsuit after they caved to Trump and renamed the international waters in the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.Crockett attributed her stance on Trump’s feuds withCanadaand Mexico to those who voted for him in November’s election despite his being convicted in New York state months earlier on 34 felony charges.Those charges involved hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels right before the Republican’s victory in the 2016 presidential election. He avoided substantial punishment for his conviction in that case by defeating then vice-president Kamala Harris in the fall to retake the Oval Office after losing it to Joe Biden in 2020.“Y’all knew who he was when y’all elected him, so don’t act surprised,” Crockett, 43, said of Trump, 78. “You elected somebody who was actually convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 felony [counts].“I … got no convictions, no arrests, no nothing. And I would never be qualified for president in this country in the eyes of the vast majority of them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Early in February, she was among about a dozen Democratic lawmakers who joined hundreds of demonstrators toprotestagainst Trump’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and its access to federal financial systems that process trillions of dollars in annual transactions.“We are not going to sit around while you go and desecrate our constitution,” Crockett said while addressing the crowd that day. “We are going to be in your face and on your asses.”Despite Crockett’s address, most Democrats don’t trust those in Congress to offer much resistance to Trump, according to a SurveyUSApollof more than 1,700 registered voters that was published on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsUS politicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpCanadaMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The group had been ousted from power in 1979.Muo Lisa and her cousin, Thum Yen, lived in neighbouring homes in the remote village of Kranhuong. Their parents were doing farm work when the two toddlers apparently came across the unexploded ordnance and it detonated.Old unexploded munitions are especially dangerous because their explosive contents become volatile as they deteriorate.“Their parents went to settle on land that was a former battlefield, and they were not aware that there were any land mines or unexploded ordnance buried near their homes,” said Heng Ratana, the director general of Cambodian Mine Action Center, which determined it was a rocket-propelled grenade after analysing the fragments. “It’s a pity because they were too young and they should not have died like this.”An estimated 4m-6m land mines and other unexploded munitions were littered in Cambodia’s countryside during decades of conflict that began in 1970 and ended in 1998.Since the end of the fighting in Cambodia, nearly 20,000 people have been killed and about 45,000 injured by leftover war explosives. The number of casualties has declined over time; last year there were 49 deaths.“The war is completely over and there is fully peace for more than 25 years, but the blood of the Khmer (Cambodian) people continues to flow because of the remnants of land mines and ammunition,” Ratana said on his Facebook page.Cambodian deminers are among the world’s most experienced, and several thousand have been sent in the past decade under UN auspices to work in Africa and the Middle East.Cambodia’s demining efforts drew attention earlier this month, when US financial assistance for it in eight provinces was suspended due to president Donald Trump’s 90-day freeze on foreign assistance.Heng Ratana said on Thursday he had been informed that Washington had issued a waiver allowing the aid – $6.36m covering March 2022 to November 2025 – to resume flowing.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Being selected is an extraordinary honour, and to strip the chosen artistic team of this opportunity is unacceptable.“Indeed it signals a fundamental disregard for the role of artists in our society – especially by the very institution meant to defend them.”That institution, the Australian government’s principal arts investment and advisory body, Creative Australia, is scheduled to appear before a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday.However, it will be up to the Greens and independents to interrogate Creative Australia’s chief executive Adrian Collette, over allegations the body came under political pressure to rescind the Venice contract.It was a Coalition senator, Claire Chandler, whofirst raised objections to Sabsabi’s selection as Australia’s representativealmost two weeks ago during question time, on the grounds the Lebanese-born Australian artist represented former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Osama bin Laden, and depictions of the 11 September terrorist attacks in earlier artwork.The Labor senators Jenny McAllister and Tim Ayres will be expected to answer questions about who knew what and when, as both the arts minister, Tony Burke, and Labor’s special envoy for the arts, Susan Templeman, are in the House of Representatives.Burke has admitted he called Collette immediately after question time, but has insisted he played no role in pressuring Creative Australia’s board, which met a few hours later, to disendorse Sabsabi and Dagostino.“I made clear to Adrian Collette, who I have known for more than a decade, I said to him whatever you decide, I will support you and I will support Creative Australia,”Burke said last Monday.Collette has not responded to repeated requests from the Guardian to comment but toldan all staff meeting last Thursdaythat Sabsabi and Dagostino would not be reinstated, sources said.

As of Friday they were all under control.Bushfires have also been burning in Tasmania’s north-west since early February, with the popular Overland hiking route closed to visitors due to ongoing fires, and a number of other blazes still active near the west coast.A total fire ban was declared for the state for Sunday, due to what State Fire Commander Matt Lowe on Saturday called “a dynamic weather situation forecast for the next 48 hours” and significant resources already dedicated to fighting the complex of fires in the west.Lowe advised residents in Tikkawoppa, Pieman Heads, Colonial Rocks and surrounds to review their bushfire safety plans and be prepared to take action.“At this stage the Canning Peak bushfire remains our main concern. Water-bombing activities are continuing today on the fire, and the combined area burnt is more than 94,500ha,” Lowe said.“We have more than 150 firefighters, eight bulldozers and 14 aircraft. 41 interstate and international remote area firefighters, and aircraft specialists are also continuing to assist, and we have strike teams pre-positioned at strategic locations across the state ready for a rapid response if required. We will relocate resources as conditions and situations change.”Hines said on Saturday that relief from the heat would move through SA late on Saturday before crossing Victoria and Tasmania on Sunday morning.“By lunchtime on Sunday, milder weather will have set in for these southern states, although NSW and ACT will still experience above average temperatures until early next week,” Hines said.Meanwhile, tropical lows off the coasts ofQueenslandand WA threaten to develop into cyclones, one of which could bring more rain to already flood-affected areas along the Queensland coast.Missing Australian member of Islamic State found alive in Syrian prisonRead moreA low a few hundred kilometres east of Cairns over the Coral Sea was drifting slowly eastwards away from the Queensland coast as of Saturday morning.“This system has a high chance of developing into a tropical cyclone on Sunday night or early next week,” Hines said. “If it does develop, it’s not likely to move anywhere quickly, lingering in the Coral Sea for several days. This could bring some gusty conditions, showers and increased swell to the central and northern Queensland coast, but otherwise, will have minimal impact on our weather.”Later in the coming week the system may move to the south-east, away from Australia, with its impact weakening.“But there is definitely still a chance that late in the weekit could veer towards Queensland, bringing stronger weather impacts to parts of the Queensland coast,” Hines said.A second tropical low was sitting more than 500km north of the WA coastline in the Indian Ocean and moving west, away from the country.“This system has a high chance of tropical cyclone development from Monday onwards,” Hines said. “If it forms into a tropical cyclone, it’s highly likely to continue moving west for several days, meaning little to no impact for mainland Australia and even the offshore islands in the Indian Ocean.”It was most likely to veer south and weaken, well away from the WA coast.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherVictoriaSouth AustraliaQueenslandNew South WalesWestern AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

The aim would be to agree a broad European position on the Trump-led effort to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Starmer also spoke yesterday to the European Commission’s president,Ursula von der Leyen, and agreed that Europe must “step up” to ensure Ukraine’s security.Starmer’s meeting with Trump is being described in Westminster as possibly career-defining for the prime minister. Former UK foreign secretary William Hague said it was the most important first bilateral between a prime minister and a president since the start of the second world war.After a week of extraordinary anti-Zelenskyy and pro-Russian rhetoric from Trump and his team, the US president issued another dismissive assault on Zelenskyy’s leadership and relevance to a peace deal on Friday, saying: “I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you. When Zelenskyy said: ‘Oh, he wasn’t invited to a meeting,’ I mean, it wasn’t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.”View image in fullscreenUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has so far refuse to sign a $500bn minerals deal with the US.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAs well asdismissing the democratically elected Zelenskyy as a dictator, the White House has been pressuring Ukraine’s president tosign a $500bn minerals dealin which he would give the US half of his country’s mineral resources. The Trump administration says this is “payback” for earlier US military assistance.Zelenskyy has so far refused to sign, arguing that the agreement lacks clear US security guarantees.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An under-pressure Zelenskyy has signalled his willingness to accommodate Washington’s demand, but he has stressed he cannot “sell out” his country.Ukrainian officials are scrambling to find alternatives to Starlink in the event that Trump’s threat is carried out. Ukraine’s armed forces depend on the system to provide real-time video drone footage of the battlefield and to conduct accurate strikes against Russian targets.The Russian military uses Starlink too. Ukrainian commanders are now contemplating a nightmare scenario, in which Musk’sSpaceXcompany switches off Ukrainian access while continuing to offer it to the Russians – with the White House in effect helping Moscow to win the war.A senior Ukrainian official said his country’s armed forces need American satellite intelligence data. If intelligence sharing were to stop, Ukraine would struggle to continue its successful campaign of long-range strikes against targets deep inside Russia, he said.Asked if the US threat to turn off Starlink was blackmail, he replied: “Yes. If it happens, it’s going to be pretty bad. Of that we can be sure.” Frontline troops used the internet system continuously and it was fitted on advanced naval drones used to sink Russian ships in the Black Sea, he noted.Trump’s savage attack on Zelenskyy shaped by pro-Russian coterieRead moreSpeaking on Friday, Trump rowed back on some of his earlier comments, which included a false claim that Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular, with a “4%” rating. Trump told Fox News that Russia did invade Ukraine but said Zelenskyy and the then US presidentJoe Bidenshould have averted it. “They shouldn’t have let him [Putin] attack,” he declared.Trump’s aggressive remarks have consolidated support for Zelenskyy among Ukrainians, with 63% now approving of him, according to the latest opinion poll before the third anniversary on Monday of Russia’s full-scale invasion.An Opinium poll for theObserverfinds more than three times as many UK voters (56%) disapprove of the Trump’s administration handling of Ukraine as approve (17%).About 55% think it likely the UK will need to participate in a large military conflict over the next five years, compared with a fifth (20%) who think it unlikely. A majority (60%) of people believe the UK should increase defence spending.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverDonald TrumpForeign policyUkraineRussiaUS politicsVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Three other police officers were lightly wounded.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the knife attack was “without any doubt an act of Islamist terrorism”. The suspected attacker, an Algerian male who has been arrested, is on a terror prevention watchlist, according to the anti-terrorism prosecution office (PNAT).He has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, and was under an expulsion order from France, according to union sources.Shortly before 4pm, he attacked local police officers shouting “God is greatest” in Arabic, PNAT said in a statement. Witnesses confirmed to Agence France-Presse that the suspect had several times shouted the phrase.One of the seriously wounded police officers sustained an injury to the carotid artery, and the other to the thorax.The passerby, who is understood to have been a Portuguese national, was killed trying to intervene, the PNAT said.View image in fullscreenFrench municipal police officers collect evidence at the site of an attack where one person was killed and two municipal police officers wounded in Mulhouse on 22 February.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty Images“Horror has seized our city,” Mulhouse mayor Michèle Lutz said on Facebook. The incident was being investigated as a terror attack, she said, but “this must obviously still be confirmed by the judiciary”.The French interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, is expected to travel to the scene of the attack on Saturday evening. Police have established a security perimeter after the attack, as forensic scientists searched for evidence. Military units have been sent to the scene as backup.The government was determined to continue doing “everything to eradicate terrorism on our soil”, Macron said. The “solidarity of the nation” was with the attack victim and his family, he added.France’s terror prevention list compiles data from various authorities on people to prevent terrorist radicalisation.

He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, theVaticansaid in a late update.The pope has been hospitalised for a week with a complex lung infection.The statement said the “Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday. At the moment the prognosis is reserved.”Earlier, doctors said his health remains touch and go and he is expected toremain in hospital for at least another week.They have warned that the main threat facing the pope would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia.As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he was taking, the pope’s medical team said.Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal.Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the US National Institutes of Health.Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on 14 February after a week-long bout of bronchitis worsened.Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs.They prescribed “absolute rest” and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it.Dr Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Gemelli hospital, said: “He knows he’s in danger,” Alfieri added. “And he told us to relay that.”The Vatican hierarchy tried to tamp down speculation that the pope might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated.Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working.The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to rumours about a possible resignation.It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret.Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat out denied that any such meeting occurred.Parolin said such speculation seemed “useless” when what really mattered was the health of the pope, his recovery and return to the Vatican.“On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumours can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,” Parolin was quoted as saying.“However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyEuropeThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

Even the syllables of the composer’s name beat out the rhythm of a waltz, as all Austrian dance teachers know. In their lessons, the words “Jo-hann Strauss” are often swapped in to replace the conventional “one, two, three” step count.Viennese children learn to waltz just like they learn to ride a bike, so the muscle-memory never leaves them. Just as well, because the city is still famous as the home of a 19th-century dance craze that shaped its international image. In this 200th anniversary year of the birth of the “waltz king”, there are rival bids jostling to become the focus of the swirling celebrations.“His music was for everyone, of every class and background. People danced to it at grand balls but also at private parties and at home,” said Eduard Strauss, the composer’s great-grand-nephew. “He really was the first pop star.” As a descendant of Johann’s youngest brother, also Eduard, he’s batting for the Strauss bicentenary venue he thinks has more authenticity than most: a museum set up inside a small dance hall, or casino, where the musician conducted his own hit waltzes for his fans. “It is an original and I am an original,” Eduard says, adding that the building, now the House of Strauss museum, was important not just for its lively music, but as a place to keep warm and meet people in bright lights on dark evenings.This coming weekend, the exclusive 67th Vienna Opera Ball takes place amid the vast grandeur of the State Opera house, with tickets at €395. Hundreds of similar balls, at varying scale, dominate Viennese social life from November to March every year. Formal and lavish, they’re a bit of nostalgic play-acting, with tailcoats, tuxedos and long swishy dresses, and yet staged in deadly cultural earnest. The city’s guilds, professionals and tradespeople, from the cake-makers to the scientists, host glittering events. This weekend, the Viennesekaffeesieder, or coffee brewers, transform the Vienna Hofburg into the “largest and most beautiful coffee house in the world” in tribute to the heritage of another Viennese tradition. Strauss may be best known for theBlue Danube, Austria’s unofficial national anthem, but there are about 500 pieces by him played each ball season. All this comes on top of the New Year’s concert, brimful of his waltzes, beamed out across the world from the Golden Hall of the Musikverein. Before this, at midnight, theBlue Danubeis played to the nation after the chimes of Vienna’s cathedral sound. Each January, the gilt auditorium of the opera house sells out for a performance of Strauss’s comic operettaDie Fledermaus.View image in fullscreenMore than 500 Johann Strauss compositions are played during Vienna’s ball season.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesSo it seems odd the city has waited for this major anniversary to work out how to honour its most on-brand composer. Vying for the role alongside the House of Strauss, the museum housed in the refurbished Casino Zögernitz, is a new, permanent, immersive exhibition in the city centre displaying his life and work to a musical accompaniment, theJohann Strauss Museum: New Dimensions. Vienna’s Theatermuseum is also running a bicentenary exhibition, hailing the composer as “the first international superstar”, until June. More conventional historic sites for Strauss pilgrimage remain his former apartment in the PraterstraßeStrauss apartment, the goldStrauss monumentin the Stadtpark and theStrauss tombin the Central Cemetery. Further out, the Dommayer Cafe is billed as the place where he first picked up a baton in public. The delayed response to the Strauss legacy is probably due to the complexity of the real story. The “waltz king” title originally belonged to his father, Johann Strauss I, who toured Europe with an entourage of 18 to 20 carriages before his son ever stepped into the limelight as the next master of the dance. And then there were Johann II’s younger musical brothers, Josef and Eduard. “People should not just say ‘Strauss’,” says his great-grand-nephew. “They should say which one.”The arrival of the waltz, condemned for immorality like all new crazes should be, was the birth of the modern music industry. Each tune was sold to a music manuscript publisher, who took a photograph or commissioned a portrait of the composer to help sell the sheet music.The catalyst for the trend is thought to have been the Congress of Vienna of 1814, when politicians and monarchs came together in the Habsburg capital to decide on the borders of the continent after the defeat of Napoleon. Entertainments, adhering to the rules of court ceremony, were set up for the dignatories and new dance music commissioned.Within a decade or two there were more than 60 dance halls in the city, and Strauss senior set up financially risky, festival-like outdoor events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wearing a wristwatch is not encouraged and neck ties are forbidden. Each male dancer must also bow and kiss the hand of any woman he asks to dance.At 3am this morning, the guests at the House of Strauss’s anniversary ball were set to spill out on to the cold pavements of Vienna, many in search of a Wiener sausage stand, the traditional street food. But there are still many nights of waltzing to go, with ball directors all over the city calling out “Alles Walzer!” to start dances into the early spring.Explore more on these topicsDanceThe ObserverAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Raped,” they replied.“I couldn’t think they were talking about me. It’s like cancer, you think it only happens to other people,” she said. “And how could I have forgotten that?”Faced with the blank in Marie’s memory, the police showed her handwritten notes in Le Scouarnec’s “black books” from 1996, when she was 10 years old and he removed her appendix.“There was my family name, my first name, age, the address of my parents, everything he did and how he felt. It was disgusting. The word ‘raped’ was hard enough, but here were these obscene phrases of what happened.”Le Scouarnec, now 74, will appear in court on Mondayaccused of the rape or sexual abuse of 299 patients – 158 male and 141 female and the majority under the age of 15 – while they were under anaesthetic or recovering from operations between 1989 and 2014. The average age of his alleged victims was 11.The surgeon, who entitled one document “my paedophile letters”, denies penetration with his penis. Under French law, rape is an act of sexual penetration by any body part or object.During the four-month trial, local health and hospital authorities will also face difficult questions over why the surgeon, employed in a dozen public and private medical establishments across Brittany and westernFrance, was allowed to continue practising for almost a decade after a conviction for accessing online child abuse images.“There was an omertà. People knew but said nothing. If there hadn’t been this silence, then he’d have been banned from seeing children in 2004 and there would have been far fewer victims,” Mauricette Vinet, whose grandson Mathis was one of Le Scouarnec’s patients, told theObserver.View image in fullscreenRoland and Mauricette Vinet hold a photo of their grandson Mathis.Photograph: Manuel Ausloos/ReutersMathis was 10 when he was admitted to hospital with appendicitis in June 2007. In 2019 he also received a visit from the police who told him what they had found in Le Scouarnec’s notebooks. Two years later, aged 24, he died of an overdose.Mauricette and her husband, Roland Vinet, believe the alleged abuse was the deep-rooted cause of their grandson’s chaotic life and drug addiction. “When the police told him what they knew, it was hell for him. The sky fell on his head,” she said. “We tried to support him, but he refused to talk about it. It killed him.”The trial comes as France is still reeling from theMazan hearinglast autumn that saw 51 men convicted of raping or sexually assaulting Gisèle Pelicot, including her husband, Dominique, who had drugged her and invited strangers to abuse her.Francesca Satta, the lawyer representing Marie, the Vinet family and other alleged victims, has described Le Scouarnec as “extremely perverse” and a “monster” who used his workplace as a “hunting ground”. Satta believes there could be as many as 400 victims. At least 12 cases were dropped because the allegations were out of time for prosecution.Satta said the investigation had opened a “Pandora’s box” for those treated by Le Scouarnec, most of whom are today in their 30s and 40s and only now learning about the alleged abuse. It was not they who went to the police, but the police who came to them. “It has caused real distress. Many of the victims were five to 10 years old at the time, many were anaesthetised and incapable of knowing what happened. Most had absolutely no idea. In any case, they were children who wouldn’t have recognised the difference between a medical act and sexual abuse. And he was a doctor. They and their parents trusted him,” Satta said.The children may not recall what happened to them, but Le Scouarnec’s meticulously handwritten notes will form the basis of the prosecution’s case. Stéphane Kellenberger, the Lorient public prosecutor, said: “At the time, the victims were asleep and sedated. They were not in a position to perceive the facts or to report them. I also note that Mr Le Scouarnec emphasised the stealth of his actions and the strategies he used to conceal them.”Amélie Lévêque, 43, only ­discovered she featured in Le Scouarnec’s notebooks after reading an article in her local newspaper about the surgeon in 2019 and contacting her GP, who checked her medical records and discovered he had removed her appendix in 1991. During a consultation with a psychotherapist, she said the suppressed memories resurfaced. “In a few seconds, I was back to being nine years old again in the recovery room at the clinic. Everything came back: the feelings, the smells, the cold, the heat, the rape. All of it,” Lévêque toldLa Montagnenewspaper.View image in fullscreen‘Everything came back – the feelings, the smells, the cold, the heat, the rape. All of it’: Amélie Lévêque, who was operated on by Le Scouarnec when she was 9.Photograph: Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty ImagesLe Scouarnec, born in Paris, quali­fied as a surgeon at the medical faculty at Nantes in 1983, married his wife, Marie-France, a health worker, and moved to Loches, south-east of the city of Tours. In 1994, he was hired by the private Sacré-Coeur clinic at Vannes in Brittany. For 10 years, the surgeon, specialising in digestive surgery, worked at a dozen hospital across the west of France. In 2004 he moved to the public hospital at Lorient and then Quimperlé.That year FBI agents investigating an international network circulating child sexual abuse images alerted French intelligence services that Le Scouarnec’s bank card had been used to access a dark web Russian child sexual abuse site. He was arrested, convicted for possession of child sexual abuse images in 2005 and given a four-month suspended sentence. His employers were alerted but, facing a shortage of surgeons and recruitment difficulties, did not suspend him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn 2006, a concerned colleague reported Le Scouarnec to the L’Ordre des Médecins, the professional body for doctors, which requested his criminal record. The ministry of health was informed, but no action was taken. In 2008, Le Scouarnec was hired by the Jonzac hospital in the Charente-Maritime where he informed the director of his previous conviction. Again, no action was taken and he continued to practise.Frédéric Benoist, lawyer for the child protection association La Voix de l’Enfant (Child’s Voice), a civil party in the case, told theObserverthere had been a “chain of structural failures” in the country’s justice and health systems that had allowed Le Scouarnec to continue.When the surgeon was convicted in 2005 for accessing child abuse images the court failed to order him to undergo psychological treatment and the health authorities failed to understand the seriousness of his crime. “If these institutions had acted properly, they could have stopped Le Scouarnec long before. But each professional at the heart of these institutions, be they legal or medical, did nothing and because of their inaction he was able to continue for 30 years,” Benoist said.The extent of France’s latest sexual scandal has raised the question of why those aware of Le Scouarnec’s paedophile conviction and alleged abuse – including members of his own family and colleagues – either failed to speak out or were ignored when they voiced concerns.The scale of Le Scouarnec’s alleged abuse was uncovered in April 2017 when his neighbour’s six-year-old daughter told her parents “the man with a crown of white hair” had exposed himself and sexually touched her through a broken garden fence.View image in fullscreenJérôme and Laura Loiseau, the parents of the little girl who Le Scouarnec abused while he was their neighbour.Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty ImagesThey went to police who, a week later, searched his home and found hard disks containing more than 300,000 photos and videos featuring child sexual abuse under a mattress, as well as notebooks recording details of the alleged abuse of child patients. Officers also discovered a collection of dolls, some life-sized, under the floorboards.In one note, Le Scouarnec is alleged to have written: “I am a paedophile and I always will be.”In December 2020, Le Scouarnec was sentenced to 15 years for the sexual abuse of four girls: his six-year-old neighbour, a four-year-old patient and two of his own nieces, who were just four years old when the abuse started.At the time of this conviction, police were already investigating the further 299 counts of alleged rape and sexual abuse on young patients to be heard during the trial opening this week .Le Scouarnec’s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told French journalists: “He is waiting to be judged, to express himself, to say what he has to say to each of his victims. From the beginning he’s been ready to confront reality, to accept his responsibility.”In his bookPiégés(Trapped), the journalist Hugo Lemonier trawled Le Scouarnec’s notebooks, linking entries to victims’ statements to police. Lemonier also spoke to the surgeon’s colleagues and victims.In 70% of cases, the surgeon acted in the morning, during a visit to the rooms; some acts were carried out under the pretext of medical examinations; others, a minority, in the operating theatre when patients were unconscious. Most had no memory of the abuse, Lemonier found.“They were often alone at the time of the visit, a few instants were enough. There were no obstacles, nobody asked him any questions,” Lemonier writes, adding that Le Scouarnec’s profession made him “untouchable”. “Nobody was able to stop him because nobody imagined he was a predator.”The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The last time they had seen each other, they were hiding in a shelter with relatives and friends after attending the Nova festival.Anemotive videotaken by the Israeli Defense Forces shows them embracing and bursting into tears when they first see each other.Abud, who can barely speak through her tears, tells Cohen he is her love, her life and her darling. Then they gaze into each other’s eyes and, in between kisses, Cohen asks her how she is.While campaigning for Cohen’s release last year, Abud told the Guardian: “Hamas threw nine grenades into our shelter and I heard Eliya screaming and he told me that he was hurt and after two minutes I felt his hands slipping away as they pulled him away.”She was buried under bodies for six hours. When she was rescued, she found that Cohen was missing and that her nephew and his partner had been shot dead next to her in the shelter, which is now referred to as the “death bunker” in Israel.Of the 27 who hid there, 16 were killed by Hamas, four were taken hostage and the rest were rescued by Israeli soldiers.When she discovered that before his abduction, Cohen had bought an engagement ring and had been planning to propose to her, Abud started to call herself his fiancee.In January 2024,she told the Guardian: “I don’t feel alive now. I’m just waiting. Every day I’m just waiting for him, for all of the kidnapped. We can’t just go on when they’re not home,” she said.She wrote on Instagram: “I often think about the moment you return. How will you react when you find out that I’m alive?” Some of their friends died on 7 October and she worried about how she would tell him what happened. “What will I tell you? How will I tell you about Amit, Yonatan, and [the] hundreds of our friends who are no longer alive?”Cohen was reportedly held chained in a tunnel for most of his captivity together with Or Levy and El Sharabi, who has been released, and Alon Ohel, who has not.Hamas hands over six hostages but Israel delays release of 600 PalestiniansRead moreSo far, 25 Israeli captives have been released in a fragile ceasefire deal that began last month.

Vehicles apparently carrying Palestinian prisoners eventually left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in.The delay imposes further strain on the precarious truce, which is at a particularly vulnerable moment, between first and second phases. The first phase is due to end next Saturday, but negotiations on the second phase have yet to begin.Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou issued a statement accusing Israel’s prime minister of “procrastination and stalling tactics”.“The [Israeli] occupation’s failure to comply with the release of the seventh batch of prisoners in the exchange deal at the agreed-upon time constitutes a blatant violation of the agreement,” al-Qanou said.While a majority of Israelis want the release of the remaining hostages to be the government’s priority, there is resistance from the right wing of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which wants the war to resume with the aim of obliterating Hamas.The hostages released by Hamas on Saturday included an Ethiopian-born Israeli and a Bedouin man, both with a history of mental illness, who had been held captive for a decade after they wandered into Gaza on foot.Avera Mengistu, aged 39, crossed a barbed wire fence on the Gaza beach in September 2014.“Our family has endured 10 years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today,” Mengistu’s family said in a statement.Hisham al-Sayed, 36, a Bedouin from the Negev desert, walked into Gaza from the east in April 2015 and was detained by Hamas.“Why were they holding someone like that who did nothing wrong? He’s a man of peace, a man who wanted to reach Gaza. He loves Gaza, he did not go there as an aggressor,” Sayed’s father, Shaaban, told Israeli public radio earlier in the week. “This was more painful for us than everything else.”Five of the hostages released on Saturday were handed over in ceremonies that Hamas has used for propaganda and that have been condemned as cruel and disrespectful by the Red Cross.View image in fullscreenOmer Shem Tov, a hostage held since the 7 October 2023 attack, kissed two Hamas militants on the head when he was released in Nuseirat.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersIn one ceremony, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside armed and masked Hamas fighters in front a large propaganda poster. An overjoyed Shem Tov kissed two militants on the head and blew kisses to the crowd assembled to watch the release.Under the terms of a ceasefire deal, Israel was supposed to free 602 Palestinians from its prisons, of which 445 had been captured in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of the war. They were due to be released inside Gaza. Of the remaining 157 Palestinians freed, some were due to be deported while others were transferred to the West Bank. Of them, 50 had been serving life sentences.The head of the Israeli prison service, Kobi Yakobi, has sought to use the exchanges to make political points. Palestinians freed in an exchange the previous week had been made to wear T-shirts with an Arabic inscription: “We will not forget and we will not forgive”.On Saturday, Yakobi prepared sweatshirts for the Palestinians being handed over that said: “I will pursue my enemies and overtake them, and I will not return until they are destroyed”, as well as bracelets inscribed: “The eternal people do not forget. I will pursue my enemies and overtake them.”The release of six Israelis yesterday brought to 25 the number of hostages freed by Hamas in the first phase of the ceasefire. They also handed over four bodies of hostages who had been killed during the conflict, and are due to hand over four more in the coming week.Among the bodies handed over on Thursday were those of two small boys from the same family, Ariel Bibas, four, and his brother Kfir, nine months old, who were kidnapped in the surprise Hamas attack on Israel’s western Negev region on 7 October 2023. The remains of their mother, Shiri Bibas, were also handed over, but only after the body of another woman, presumed to be a Palestinian, was transferred. Hamas claimed it was a mistake but it caused outrage in Israel.1:07Avera Mengistu's family celebrate his release by Hamas after more than a decade – videoThe US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has encouraged the parties to move forward to a second phase, which would involve the release of the remaining 60 or so hostages (at least half of whom are believed by Israeli authorities to be dead), as well as hundreds more Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and the complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.Donald Trump has however continued to offer Netanyahu support should he choose to go back to war, pointing to the incident involving Bibas’s body.“He is not torn. He wants to go in,” Trump told Fox News Radio on Friday. “He is just so angry at what happened yesterday and he should be.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warThe ObserverHamasGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

They illegally occupied Palestine. Would u support Russia invading Ukraine? Israel kill Palestinians everyday, didn’t see anyone caring. Also there are no civilians in Israel.”The doctor, responding to a post on X by the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak, also wrote: “Just take all the Israelis to UK away from terrorist Palestine a win for everyone, no?”Elwan’s posts were referred to the Home Office, which moved to cancel her permission to stay, the tribunal in Manchester heard. The department said it was satisfied her continued presence in the UK “would not be conducive to the public good”.Elwan appealed against the decision, saying it breached her freedom of expression and family life, which are protected under the European convention on human rights (ECHR).Davies found that immediate cancellation of her leave to remain “was not reasonable or proportionate” under the ECHR or common law.He said her conduct was “short-lived” and a “one-off” in the context of her “overwhelmingly positive and otherwise blameless length of permitted leave within the UK”.The judge went on: “Even though Dr Elwan did not make a full or public retraction or apology, she had taken down the posts even before the media publicity occurred.“It is clearly possible to imagine far more egregious posts having been posted by persons not subject to immigration control on that day. The posts, read overall, did include protected expressions of political opinion.“The [Home Office] also had to consider the consequences to Dr Elwan and, indeed, to the wider community, of immediate cancellation, requiring her to leave her existing post.”The judge quashed the cancellation of her leave to remain in the country as a skilled worker until mid-2027 and asked the Home Office to “take the decision afresh”. However, he rejected Elwan’s appeal against a decision to refuse her indefinite leave to remain in the UK.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIsrael-Gaza warNHSLiverpoolEnglandHamasHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement on Saturday, the Bibas family said: “After the identification process at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, this morning we received the news we feared the most. Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home to her sons, husband, sister, and all her family to rest.”The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement on Friday afternoon that autopsy results and military intelligence concluded that members of Hamas “used their bare hands” to kill Ariel Bibas, four, and his 10-month-old brother, Kfir, when they were seized in October 2023.“Their father, [the recently released hostage] Yarden Bibas, looked me in the eyes and asked that the whole world know and be shocked by the way they murdered his children,” the military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said in a video address.In Israel and around the world, the fate of the Bibas family has come to embody the trauma of the Hamas attack that ignited the war inGaza.Hamas said early in the conflict that the boys and their mother, Shiri, 32, were killed in an Israeli bombing in November 2023. There was no immediate comment from the militant group on the IDF’s allegation of murder.1:35Israel demands return of Shiri Bibas’s body as Hamas claims it is mixed with other remains – videoIsrael’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, was quick to capitalise on the crisis, accusing Hamas of breaking the truce’s terms. “We will work with determination to bring Shiri home together with all our hostages – both living and dead – and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and malicious violation of the agreement.”However, relatives of the family accused the Israeli leader of abandoning their loved ones. They also warned against using their fate as a pretext for a return to fighting amid uncertainty over implementation of the next phase of the deal, which is due to begin in early March.In the second stage, Hamas is supposed to return the remainder of the hostages in exchange for Israel ending the war, but Netanyahu has long resisted pressure to end the hostilities: much of his far-right coalition government opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside the Gaza Strip. The third phase is supposed to address the exchange of bodies, a reconstruction plan for Gaza and future governance.“It was Israel’s responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive,” said Shiri’s sister-in-law, Ofri Bibas, in a statement released on behalf of the family through the Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.“Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment.”In the statement, which came prior to the identification of Shiri’s body, Ofri Bibas continued: “Our painful journey, which has already lasted 16 months, is not over. We are still waiting for Shiri … For Ariel and Kfir’s sake, and for Yarden’s sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri.“Their cruelty only emphasises the urgent need to bring Shiri back to us, save the lives of the living hostages and return all the fallen for burial.”The truce in the war in Gaza came into effect on 19 January, pausing 15 months of brutal fighting that killed about 48,000 Palestinians and triggered a devastating humanitarian crisis. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack that ignited the war, and 250 were taken hostage.On Friday, Hamas released the names of the six living hostages it plans to release at the weekend under the terms of the ceasefire. The Palestinian prisoners media office said more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were also to be freed.The announcements are a sign that the fragile deal remains on track despite the tensions caused by the furore surrounding the Bibas’s fate.Also on Friday, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered the country’s military to ramp up its operations in the occupied West Bank after a series of bus explosions near Tel Aviv the previous day. There were no casualties in the blasts, which a group identifying itself as a branch of Hamas’ military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, stopped short of taking responsibility for in a Telegram post.Israel’s latest operation in the West Bank, launched immediately after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, has wreaked widespread damage, killed more than 50 Palestinians, caused thousands to flee their homes and ripped up roads and infrastructure in refugee camps.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The figure is almost four times higher than the46,700 deathsthat Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry have reported.Prof Nizam Mamode, a retired British transplant surgeon from Hampshire who last yearworked at Nasser hospitalin southern Gaza said the number of “non-trauma deaths” could ultimately be considerably higher than 186,000. One factor, he said, was the targeting of healthcare workers during the war.He said that of six vascular surgeons who once covered the north of the strip, just one had remained. There were no cancer pathologists left alive.Abu-Sittah said entire teams of medical specialists had been eradicated from Gaza, and the training required to replace them would take up to 10 years.View image in fullscreenDoctors said it was likely that irreversible damage had already been done to large numbers of children.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“Certain specialities have been eviscerated,” he said. “There are no more nephrologists [a doctor specialising in kidney care] left. They’ve all been killed. There are no more board-certified emergency medicine physicians.”The 55-year-old plastic surgeon from London said the long-term health of people in Gaza depended on how quickly the territory and its infrastructure were rebuilt.Last week, thousands of Palestinians began returning to northern Gaza to scenes of utter destruction after thewithdrawal of Israeli troopsfrom a strategic corridor that divides the north and south of Gaza.“But to get doctors to move back to the north, you need to house them. Where are they going to live? Where are their families going to live?” said Abu-Sittah.He said irreversible damage had already been done to large numbers of children.“Studies on people who survived the second world war showed they are more likely to get NCDs [non-communicable diseases] if they had malnutrition as children. They’re also more likely to become diabetics, more likely to have hypertension, more likely to have diabetes in old age. You don’t recover.”Last month, the UN estimated that more than 60,000 children in Gaza wouldneed treatment for acute malnutritionin 2025. Some had already died, said the organisation.Another concern is the spread of disease, helped by the destruction of infrastructure such as sewage facilities.Abu-Sittahhasprovided evidence to Scotland Yardand the international criminal court over what he witnessed working in Gaza. He described the prevalence of disease there as a catastrophe.“Hepatitis,diarrhoeal disease, respiratory disease, polio that re-emerged in the war, will all continue because there’s still no sewerage and clean drinking water, still no housing, no primary-care clinics. You’re not going to be able to stop, or even stem, infectious diseases.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mamode, whogave evidence to MPson the British parliament’s international development select committee inquiry into Gaza’s healthcare, said up to 70% of those he operated on were children.Israel insists it is going ahead with Unrwa ban – what it may mean for PalestiniansRead more“You’d have a three-year-old in intensive care for a week and we’d be told, ‘The parents are killed, the siblings are killed. Wait and see whether anyone is going to turn up for them.’ That was quite common.”Abu-Sittah said that half of his patients were children and that despite working in numerous conflict zones including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, he had never performed as many amputations each day as he had in Gaza.Mamode, a former clinical lead of transplant surgery at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London, warned that another vital long-term health issue was the psychological scarring on a population after 15 months of fighting.“In the coming months, those issues will start to come to the fore, because people have just been focusing on day-to-day survival. When that pressure comes off [the psychological impacts] are going to manifest themselves in all sorts of ways.”A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) said it had been “well documented that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centres for its terror activities”.They added: “If not stopped, under certain conditions, this illegal military use can make the hospital lose its protection from attack.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelGlobal healthHuman rights (Global development)newsShareReuse this content"

The M48 has also been closed both ways between junction 1 and the M4, and links from M5 to the M4 are also shut.The closures, which are expected to cause significant delays in and out of Wales, are likely to remain in place until the early hours of Sunday morning, police said.The force said: “Enquiries are under way to identify the deceased and notify next of kin, while an investigation to establish how the person came to be on the motorway continues.“Police are keen to hear from anyone who was travelling along that stretch of the M4 and has any relevant information or dashcam footage.”The road closures start on the English side of the Prince of Wales Bridge and the Severn Bridge.Explore more on these topicsBristolRoad transportPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Of 98 cases concluded in the magistrates courts in England and Wales in the past six months, just three resulted in a deprivation order.In other cases involving digital devices, such as offences regarding indecent images of children, these orders were made consistently.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) this weekend said more must be done to “stop ­perpetrators retaining these images and continuing to take gratification from their crimes”.In one case earlier this month, a man was rebuked by magistrates for “thoroughly disgraceful” and “deeply disturbing” behaviour “designed to emotionally blackmail and control” his victim. The 35-year-old from Swansea was given a six-month suspended sentence, a rehabilitation order and a three-year restraining order – but no deprivation order, leaving the police with no legal power to retain and wipe his devices.In another case last October in Crawley, West Sussex, a 32-year-old man was jailed for 26 weeks after sharing private sexual photos of his ex-girlfriend. He was given a ­restraining order until 2029 – but no deprivation order.The findings point to a systemic failure of courts to impose the orders, and of prosecutors to request them in the first place.View image in fullscreenCampaigners said the failure to force deletion of intimate images shared without consent was leaving victims ‘living in fear’.Photograph: Microgen Images/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RFA spokesperson for the CPS said: “While courts already have the power to deprive convicted offenders of nonconsensual intimate images and videos, we accept there is more we can do.” It is reviewing its guidance for prosecutors. The Sentencing Council, which produces guidelines for magistrates and judges in England and Wales, will also consider whether updates are needed.Campaigners said the failure to force deletion in every case was ­leaving victims “living in fear” that the images could be shared again.Sophie Mortimer, who runs theRevenge Porn Helpline, said that even if there was no such threat, just ­knowing the perpetrator still had access to them was a “vile thought”.Mortimer said she also knew of cases where images obtained ­illicitly, such as through voyeurism, were not destroyed. One man who secretly recorded a woman was convicted and given a suspended sentence – only to be handed back devices containing the imagery afterwards.When the victim challenged the decision, police said they had no legal power to act because there was no court order. “They told her: ‘Our hands are tied,’” Mortimer said.She called for urgent changes to ensure content was destroyed in every case – from cloud storage, hard drives, and social media accounts, as well as physical devices. “The ­government says the courts already have powers to order this, but it’s pointless if it’s never used,” she said.Elena Michael, of the campaign group#NotYourPorn, said ­allowing perpetrators to keep images and devices sent the message that they were “untouchable”. “You’re ­handing back the weapon that caused the crime and rolling out the carpet for them to do it again,” she said.She said the group had worked with 450 victims and found there was “no consistent approach” to the issue. “Sometimes the police try really hard to hold on to devices or find a way of getting rid of ­content. But they’re in a situation where the law is not supporting them even if morally they know it’s right,” she added.A victim in a case where the ­perpetrator was not made to delete sexual videos said: “It makes my skin crawl to know that he could still be watching these, let alone uploading them on the internet again.”Emma Pickering, head of technology-facilitated abuse at the charity Refuge, said: “This critical loophole needs to be urgently addressed.”TheObserver’s analysis looked at cases of sharing or threatening to share intimate photos of a ­person without consent that have been heard in the magistrates courts since August 2024, using records from the Courtsdesk database of hearings in England and Wales.It also looked at people convicted in the past six months of an earlier version of the offence: “disclosing or threatening to disclose private sexual photos with intent to cause distress”.Of about 600 defendants who appeared before magistrates charged with the crimes, many were awaiting further hearings. The cases considered most serious were referred to the crown court for trial or sentencing.For the defendants who were sentenced by magistrates, punishments varied widely. They ranged from 50 to 250 hours of unpaid work, rehabilitation orders requiring them to attend “building better relationships” courses, fines of between £100 and £450, and suspended or immediate custodial sentences.Of the 98 defendants, 54 were also given restraining orders lasting from one to five years that, in 17 cases, explicitly prohibited posting about their victims online. The three cases where ­prosecutors did request deprivation orders included one in December in Bromley, southeast London, where ­magistrates ordered a 27-year-old man be “deprived of the photographs used in the course of the offence”. He was also given an eight-week suspended sentence and a five-year restraining order.In another case in September, Hull magistrates jailed a man for 22 weeks and ordered that his phone be destroyed. In both cases the men had also been convicted of a further offence – harassment – as well as the intimate image crime.In a third case, court records show prosecutors requested a deprivation order from Chester magistrates for a man convicted of sharing intimate photos. He was also given a 12-month suspended sentence and 200 hours of unpaid work in October. It is not clear whether the order was made.The inconsistencies are revealed as the government prepares to introduce its new crime and policing bill to parliament, which seeks to tighten the law on sharing intimate images without consent.Charlotte Owen, a Conservative peer, said she was “appalled” that content was being destroyed in so few cases. “No one should have to suffer from the ongoing trauma of knowing their abuser still owns intimate images of them,” she said.Lady Owen previouslyintroduced a private member’s billthat included a line on forced deletion of imagery, “including physical copies and those held on any device, cloud-based ­program, or digital or messaging ­platform they control”.The government responded that there was already provision under the Sentencing Act 2020 for courts to deprive offenders of their rights to any property linked to the crime. TheObserver’sfindings show the power is not consistently being used.Owen subsequently requested amendments to her data bill, suggesting the creation of a code of practice for the courts.On 28 January, the government responded that it would be “constitutionally inappropriate” to do so but that the Sentencing Council was conducting a review.The Sentencing Council told theObserverit was monitoring the government’s plans for new intimate image legislation and would look at “what new guidelines or changes are required” when that came into force.Owen said clear guidance was “urgently needed” for both the ­judiciary and prosecutors. It does not currently advise the use of deprivation orders in intimate image abuse cases. For other offences, such as those involving indecent images of children, prosecutors are told they should always request forfeiture and take a “robust approach” requiring “complete hard drives of any device”.Online forums being used to trade explicit images of local women, says charityRead moreClare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University and an expert in image-based abuse, said it was a “real injustice” that deprivation orders were not routinely being made.She said changes were also needed to protect the thousands of victims who “don’t want to go down the criminal route”, to enable them to request orders for the deletion of explicit images without going through a criminal process. “The law currently is failing to deal with these issues,” she said.The Revenge Porn Helpline and #NotYourPorn are also calling for content linked to intimate image abuse to be made illegal, such as indecent images of children and terrorist content, to make it easier to require internet providers to block or remove it.The act of sharing or threatening to share content without consent is illegal, but the content itself is not, even if it was used in a criminal offence.They also want all images used in offences to be given unique digital identifiers – known as hashing – to make it easier to detect if someone tries to upload them again, and say the police response must improve to ensure devices are seized promptly, before suspects can delete evidence.Data obtained by Refuge showsonly about 4%of intimate image abuse cases reported to police currently result in the perpetrator being charged. The Revenge Porn Helpline has dealt with 60,000 casessince it was founded 10 years ago, with reports rising on average 57% each year.The Ministry of Justice declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseThe ObserverViolence against women and girlsCrimeInternetSocial mediaChild protectionPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

Lunar Trailblazer’s two year mission is scheduled to begin on Thursday when the probe is blasted into space from Florida on aSpaceX Falcon rocket.Its goal – to seek out water on the lunar surface – may seem odd given that the moon has traditionally been viewed as an arid, desiccated world. However, scientists have recently uncovered strong hints that it possesses significant quantities of water. It will be the task of Lunar Trailblazer to reveal just how much water there is near the lunar surface and pinpoint its main locations.The probe’s progress will be followed with keen interest by space engineers and astronomers who believe lunar water could play a key role in plans to set up staffed colonies on the moon. Using power provided by solar power plants, water could be turned into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen. The former would then be used as fuel while the latter would allow astronauts to breathe.“This is primarily a scientific mission,” said Prof Neil Bowles, leader of the Oxford University team of physicists who built one of Lunar Trailblazer’s main instruments. “However, it should also tell us how water is transported across the lunar surface and that has implications for future lunar exploration by humans.”View image in fullscreenThe Lunar Trailblazer is to embark on a two-year mission.Photograph: Lockheed Martin Space/NasaUntil recently it had been assumed that water molecules brought to the moon by meteorites and comets would decompose quickly as sunlight broke them down into hydrogen and oxygen which would then have drifted into space. However, several robotic probes have recently found compelling evidence that water, mainly in the form of ice, exists in fairly large amounts in some deep, permanently shadowed craters, with the lunar south pole offering the most promising candidates.These discoveries were taken even further by India’s Chandrayaan-1 probe that found, in 2009, thattraces of watercould been seen on the moon’s surface far away from the poles. “It was a big surprise that changed our perceptions of what we might find on the moon,” said Bowles.However, the instrument on Chandrayaan-1 that made the discovery did not have the spectral range to fully map out water on the lunar surface and Lunar Trailblazer has been designed to get round that problem. It will carry two instruments. The first is an infrared scanner that will pinpoint water and other geological features. The second, designed by Bowles and his team, is a thermal mapper that is essentially a highly advanced heat camera.Working in tandem, these instruments should then be able to create a water map of the lunar surface. “We know there is water at the moon’s poles but we are not sure how it ended up there,” said Bowles. “We think there is a kind of lunar water cycle just as there is one on Earth although in the case of the one on the moon it has nothing to do with clouds or rain.”There are two main scenarios, he added. “Either water is delivered by comets or meteorites that hit the lunar surface and release lots of water which then condenses in cold traps at the poles.

It is destined to settle on to the moon where it will drill beneath the surface in a bid to find water there.In addition to these craft, there will be a probe – named Odin by its builder AstroForge – that will fly to a very different destination: asteroid 2022 OB5. Odin will take images there in preparation for a return mission which is planned to land on the asteroid and begin mineral extraction on its surface.These missions are all part of Nasa’s commercial lunar payload services programme which has been set up to encourage companies to send small robotic landers and rovers to the moon and other near Earth destinations.

Rabbatts had founded Time’s Up UK in 2018 in the wake of the #Me Too movement. Smith was previously director of culture and inclusion at the British Film Institute and in the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein scandal helpeddraw up a set of standardsto combat harassment in the screen industries.View image in fullscreenGregg Wallace was the subject of complaints about inappropriate behaviour.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer“People don’t currently feel as safe as they should in the creative industries,” Smith said. “We needed clarity around what it meant to be in a safe working environment.”She added: “What came to light is that part of the infrastructure of the creative industries was missing. You’ve got a workforce that don’t have HR departments.“What people really needed was a safe, confidential place to raise ­concerns, seek advice, get help. For creative sectors, there was this gap. Where do you go? Who has … ­independent oversight and who can provide impartial advice?”In research carried out in May 2024 by Bectu, the union for workers in the creative industries,84% of respondents saidthe sector needed an ­independent body to investigate, report and prevent harassment.The fact that creative industries, especially film and television, are mostly made up of freelancers and small companies exacerbated issues of poor behaviour, Smith said. People feared that speaking out would cost them work, while freelancers who did want to speak up were often unclear about who to report concerns to.In theFilm and TV Charity’s Looking Glass report 2024,41% of respondents to a survey said they’d experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination in the previous 12 months. More than half said they didn’t report this to anyone – of those who did report, 21% said the situation got worse.CIISA will not have enforcement powers, so it will rely on the creative industries to commit to the standards. However, breaches can be reported to the organisation and it will offer legal advice, arbitration and mediation, as well as support for individuals to access criminal justice or employment tribunals where appropriate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, Nandy warned the industry it must address standards of behaviour,following recent allegationsagainst d’Acampo, the celebrity chef. “If the industry can’t get its own house in order, we are prepared to step in. The time for action is long overdue,” Nandy told ITV News.D’Acampo“categorically denies” allegations of inappropriate behaviour. A statement from his legal team says: “This is the first time, six years later, he has been informed of these alleged incidents, and he does not accept them.” Wallace’s lawyers have said the suggestion he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature was entirely false.Last year’s Strictly saw misconduct allegations, including against dancer Graziano Di Prima, who left the show following claims he mistreated Zara McDermott, the Love Island star and his dance partner.The CIISA will initially focus on the screen, stage and music sectors, but aims in future to cover others such as gaming, publishing and fashion.A cross-sector approach was vital in spotting patterns of behaviour, Smith said. Allegations made aboutWallace, the BBCMasterChef­presenter, ­suggested even where claims were reported to one individual or company, it was unclear if information was shared, or who had responsibility to act.There needs to be “one entity, where people can report confidentially and safely, and we can build up [a] picture of concerning behaviour and deal with it appropriately,” Smith said. “You shouldn’t be having historical issues that have gone on for so long.”The CIISA hopes the creative industries can learn from past failures. “We’re seeing repeated stories in the press,” Smith said. “When things go wrong, how do we prevent that from happening again?”Explore more on these topicsMediaThe ObserverTelevisionFilm industryBBCStrictly Come DancingHeather RabbattsTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, has been put in alternative accommodation while police carry out their inquiries.Clive was last seen alive in the Coronation Street area shortly after 11pm. A man matching Clive’s description was last seen in the early hours of the following morning near the banks of the River Tyne.Det Insp Mark Atherton said: “We are doing everything we can to provide Scott’s family with the answers they deserve.“Upon receiving new information, we have taken the decision to arrest two men and a woman in relation to Scott’s disappearance. They remain in custody while our inquiries are ongoing. However, we still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community.“I am again urging anybody who lived on Coronation Street at the time of his disappearance, or has information about Scott’s movements that night, to come forward. The information you have could prove key in our investigations.”Police said they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to witnesses since they launched their investigation more than 20 years ago.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now you don’t want to look in my eyes, you fucking cowards.”Fanone, a former Capitol police officer, then turns and tells him: “You’re a traitor to this country.”In 2023, Tarrio received a sentence of 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to the January 6 attack. Donald TrumppardonedTarrio and roughly 1,500 other insurrection participants when he took office last month, an act that prompted outcry from many lawmakers,includingsome Republicans.Gonell, a former Capitol police sergeant who defended the Capitol on January 6, acknowledged the confrontation with Tarrio as he accepted his “profile in courage” award from Principles First. A spokesperson for Principles First, which isconsidereda center-right alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on the confrontation with Tarrio.“A few moments ago, we were upstairs, and Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys were upstairs,” Gonell told conference attendees, prompting surprised gasps from the crowd. “How they got into the building, I don’t know, but it’s insane that we had to be subjected to their harassment now because they feel emboldened and empowered because of the pardons that they received.“We shouldn’t be harassed for doing the right thing, for telling our story, for telling the truth, for speaking against them in court and in public. They’re the traitor. They’re the one who attacked the Capitol.”The confrontation at the conference came one day after Tarrio wasarrestednear the Capitol for simple assault after he allegedly struck the cellphone and arm of a woman who was protesting an event he was attending with other January 6 insurrectionists.At a panel discussion held at the summit a couple of hours before the confrontation with Tarrio, four police officers who protected the Capitol on January 6 – Daniel Hodges of the Metropolitan police department and former Capitol police officers Gonell, Fanone and Dunn – expressed outrage over the pardons offered to the insurrectionists.“He pardoned them because he wants people to know that, if you commit crimes on his behalf, he’s got your back,” Fanone said.Fanone described far-right groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, who played an instrumental role in executing the January 6 attack, as “Donald Trump’s personal brownshirt militia”, referring to the German Nazi party’s paramilitary storm troopers of the 1920s and 1930s.“They are operating under the assumption that, if they commit violent criminal acts on Donald Trump’s behalf, that he will pardon them for future violence,” Fanone said. “These are insurrectionists, let’s be very clear.”A member of the audience appeared to agree with Fanone’s assessment, yelling in response to his comment: “Traitors!”Fanone replied: “Yes, fucking traitors.”He later urged conference attendees to forcefully push back against Trump’s “Make America Great Again” political movement, telling them: “That is what we are up against: the indecency, the cruelty, the inhumanity of this movement that needs to be purged – purged – from America.”Dunn, who moderated the discussion, applauded his fellow officers for keeping a spotlight on the January 6 attack, reminding the audience: “History is going to remember us for what we did or did not do.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCThe far rightUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He also boasted that his administration had terminated temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Haitian immigrants and attempted to ban birthright citizenship for children of non-legal permanent residents.“We’ve begun the largest deportation operation in American history,” Trump said.In one of several digressions, Trump portrayed his return to office as a victory over what he called a “sinister group of radical informers, war-mongers and corrupt special interests” whom he claimed had previously controlled Washington. The president reserved particular ire for media outlets, labeling MSNBC a “threat to democracy” and mocking Rachel Maddow, whose show is watched bymore than 2 million viewers, for what he claimed were her low ratings.He also claimed Democrats had “lost their confidence” and possessed “the worst policy in history” while boasting about his administration’s first month in office.“Nobody has seen four weeks like we’ve had,” he said.Some of the other early moves he discussed included sweeping cuts to the federal workforce and regulations,baseless allegationsof massive social security fraud, withdrawal from international climate agreements and the imposing of new tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.He also addressed ongoing international conflicts, incorrectly claiming that US aid to Ukraine had exceeded European contributions, and saying the United States had sent $350bn to the war-torn country since the Russian invasion in 2022. That number isn’t close to the amount the US has allocated, with a government oversight officeputting that estimatecloser to $183bn. European nations have combined to contribute more.He noted the recent return of Israeli hostages while claiming that “Biden got back zero”, apparently forgetting that the US helped brokerthe return of 105 hostagesin November 2023.The annual conference has become a key venue for Republican politicians to connect with conservative grassroots activists, though it’s clear the event has abandoned traditional GOP policies to fully embrace Trump’s Maga-centric approach.Several international conservative politicians attended the speech, including the Argentine president, Javier Milei, who is currently facing a widespread crypto scandal; the Polish president, Andrzej Duda; and the British Reform party leader, Nigel Farage, all praised by Trump during his remarks.Explore more on these topicsCPACDonald TrumpMarylandTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 16 patients have been hospitalized as a result.The majority of reported measles cases were in children and teenagers; minors between the ages of five and 17 accounted for 51 cases.Childrenunder four made up 26 cases. Most patients’ parents either had chosen to not immunize them against the highly contagious illness through vaccines meant to prevent the potentially deadly illness and its spread, or their vaccination status was unknown.Experts have warned that additional cases are “likely to occur” in South Plains and neighboring communities, given measles’ contagious nature. At least nine measles cases have already been reported in Lea county, New Mexico, which borders the region where theTexasoutbreak is occurring.A DSHS spokespersontold ABC Newsthat the latest outbreak is the worst officials have seen in 30 years.Gaines county, located in rural western Texas, is the epicenter of the latest outbreak, with 57 reported cases. The county, with 22,523 residents, had one of the state’shighest immunization exemption ratesfor the 2023-24 school year, according to DSHS data. Nearly 18% of students opted out of vaccinations, which had all but eradicated measles and other contagious illnesses before skeptics undermined confidence in them among some in the US.Tonya Guffey, the chief nursing officer at Seminole hospital district,told NBC Newsmany unvaccinated people in Gaines county are Mennonite, a denomination of Christianity.“We have a high, high number of unvaccinated,” said Guffey to NBC. “It’s not that they’re not educated. It’s just what their belief is.”She added: “We educate, we encourage, we do what we can for the community, but it’s their choice.”Some school districts do make getting vaccinations against measles a mandatory attendance requirement.In 2024,the US had 285 measles cases, the highest number since 2019, when nearly 1,300 cases were reported.

Law enforcement agencies could use the NLEAD to check if an officer applying for a law enforcement position had committed misconduct, such as excessive force.Several experts celebrated the NLEAD when Joe Biden first created it by an executive order issued in 2023, the third year of his presidency.“Law enforcement agencies will no longer be able to turn a blind eye to the records of misconduct in officer hiring and offending officers will not be able to distance themselves from their misdeeds,” the Legal Defense Fund president and director-counsel, Janai Nelson, said of the databaseat the time.But Trump has since rescinded Biden’s executive order as part of an ongoing effort to slash federal agencies down. Trump himself initially proposed the database after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, months before Biden defeated him in the presidential election that November.In an emailed statement to the Washington Post, the White House confirmed the database’s deletion.“President Trump believes in an appropriate balance of accountability without compromising law enforcement’s ability to do its job of fighting crime and keeping communities safe,” read the statement. “But the Biden executive order creating this database was full of woke, anti-police concepts that make communities less safe like a call for ‘equitable’ policing and addressing ‘systemic racism in our criminal justice system.’ President Trump rescinded the order creating this database on Day 1 because he is committed to giving our brave men and women of law enforcement the tools they need to stop crime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no way this is going to get contained” on its own, said Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine.US agriculture department says it accidentally fired bird flu officialsRead moreThe current outbreak is unlikely to end without intervention and needs close attention from theTrump administrationto prevent the virus from wreaking more havoc.Yet “we don’t seem to have a handle on the spread of the virus,” said Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease physician.Bird flu’s continued spread is happening against the backdrop of the worst flu season in 15 years, since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009-10.The spike in seasonal flu cases puts pressure on health systems, makes it harder to detect rare variants like H5N1, and raises the risk of reassortment, where a person or animal infected with seasonal flu and bird flu could create a new, more dangerous variant.Diagram showing the spread of bird flu“There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala said. There’s also the possibility of reassortment within animals like cows, now that there are multiple variants detected in herds, she pointed out.At the same time, the CDC’s seasonal flu vaccination campaigns were halted on Thursday as the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reportedlycalledfor “informed consent” advertisements instead. A meeting for the independent vaccine advisers was alsopostponedon Thursday.The US has also halted communication with the World Health Organization on influenza data.The new spillovers into dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona, detected through the new bulk milk testing strategy recently implemented in the US, are both related to the D1.1 variant of H5N1, which emerged in the fall and has come to dominate among North American birds. A teenaged girl in British Columbia suffered severe illness and a man in Louisiana died after infection with this variant.In Nevada, a dairy worker was infected after close contact with cows, and genomic sequencing revealed a mutation that has been associated in the past with more effective spread among people.“These are more opportunities for the virus to continue to adapt, and with adaptation, you worry that we’ll ultimately get to a point where we may have a virus that becomes capable of transmitting efficiently between humans, and that then really would change the dynamic of the outbreak,” Titanji said.Lakdawala raised three theories for how bird flu keeps spilling over into cows.The first would be a rare event in which fluids from a sick bird somehow came into contact with a cow’s udders – for instance, if a bird defecated into milking equipment. That was a working theory for the first spillover, detected nearly a year ago in Texas cows. But it’s rare for birds to have close contact with milking equipment, and for that to happen three times was “unlikely”, Lakdawala said.It’s much more common for birds to perch on feeding troughs, where their feces might mix with feed. Usually, cows infected through oral or nasal contact like this don’t see the virus spread to their udders.But it could happen in rare events – if a cow is unhealthy, for instance – that bird flu goes systemic and enters mammary tissue, where it replicates in enormous quantities, Lakdawala hypothesized.The third theory? People could be spreading the virus from birds, or another intermediate species, to cows.“Bird to human infections, we know happen more often,” Lakdawala said. “It’s more likely that somebody handling dead birds or chickens infected with H5 will become infected, and then it’s human to cow” transmission.All of these theories need more evidence and research, much of which is now threatened by halts in scientific funding from the Trump administration.Two studies temporarily halted in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report have now been released.Blood tests on 150 veterinariansrevealedthree of the vets showed recent infection with H5N1. One of the infected vets worked in a state with no cases among cows, and the two others did not realize they had had contact with an H5-positive animal, indicating continued gaps in monitoring spread.Astudyon two households in Michigan indicated that dairy workers may have spread H5N1 to their indoor cats.Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, unveiled the Trump administration’s new strategy on CBS’sFace the Nationon Sunday in a shift away from trying to contain the outbreak.Previously, officials “spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken”, Hassett said. Infected poultry are culled in this manner because they are very unlikely to survive infection, and containment like this can help halt the spread to other animals – and to the people who care for them.Hassett instead broached the idea, without providing more details, of using “biosecurity and medication” to “have a better, smarter perimeter”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationBird flunewsShareReuse this content"

The answers are not as predictable as one might thinkPhillip Inman, Economics editorSat 22 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 13.32 ESTShareAs Ukrainians prepare to enter their fourth year dealing with the harsh daily realities of life during conflict with Russia, few will be musing on the comparative economic health of the warring nations. However, inflation figures released either side of the border showed the continued toll the conflict has had on citizens of both countries – with price rises running at 9.5% in Russia and 12% inUkraine.Russia GDPThree years on since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, economists are examining the relative health of each country.Standard measures of economic growth favour Moscow, as do the outstanding costs of rebuilding damaged infrastructure should thetalks in Saudi Arabiabetween Vladimir Putin’s team of negotiators and Donald Trump’s bring forward an unlikely - at least in terms of being long lasting – peace deal.Rusia’s gross domestic priduct (GDP) slumped to -1.3% at the outset of the war but has since recovered to post 3.6% in each of the last two years, according to the IMF. Ukraine’s GDP had sunk 36% by the summer of 2022 befoe finishing the year down 28.3% before rebounding to 5.3% in 2023 and 3% in 2024.Despite wide ranging sanctions, Russian factories have continued to source the components and raw materials needed to keep the war machine going. An influx of funds from the illicit sale of oil, and to a lesser extent natural gas, nickel and platinum, has allowed for an expansion of a state apparatus that 18 months ago looked on its knees.Reconstruction hopesDespite Russia’s lengthy offensive, Ukraine has a brighter future as an independent nation than Moscow propaganda would have anyone believe.Christopher Dent, a professor of economics and international business at Edge Hill university’s business school, says the Russian president’s best efforts to cause the kind of devastation needed to subdue Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelenskyyand Ukraine’s population have failed, making Ukraine the better bet for an investor should the war end.View image in fullscreenIt is estimated that at least $500bn will be needed to reconstruct Ukraine once the fighting stops.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesAn example of Ukraine’s resilience can be found in its electricity market, which has strengthened despite the bombs that have rained down on power stations and transmission cables.In 2023, an alleged Russian terroristblew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. The gaping hole in the dam sent millions of litres of water rushing through towns and villages, causing at least $2bn in damages to the surrounding economy.Since then, a recovery has been under way. While imports of electricity have jumped by a half from 123GWh to 183GWh from January 2024 to last month, exports have soared from just 5GWh to 85GWh over the same period.“This reflects Ukraine’s growing role in the European super grid,” Dent says, with exports of electricity sent mainly to Moldova, Hungary and Romania.Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea are still functioning and trade is flowing west along the Danube, and to a lesser extent by train. Meanwhile, agriculture has staged a major recovery.Ukraine GDPLittle about the country functions as it did in 2021, but the resilience is remarkable, says Dent.Looking to the next 10 years, Ukraine has a wealth of metal deposits, many of them rare, that some estimates put at $11tn.The country’s tax system continues to function, too. December’s tax revenues registered a 50% improvement on the previous year as corporations paid more tax and income tax recovered by about 60%. Another boost came from a 150% increase in excise duty receipts, filling the state’s war chest while most welfare and public service spending was, and still is, paid for by overseas agencies, including loans from the International Monetary Fund.The labour market remains less vibrant than before the full-scale invasion, according to Maksym Samoiliuk at the Centre for Economic Strategy inKyiv. Data on the number of people out of work from the Info Sapiens research agency estimates that the unemployment rate was 16.8% in January, which Samoiliuk says still leaves employers short of workers “not least due to Ukrainians’ migration abroad and mobilisation into the defence forces”.The manufacturing of iron and steel remains a fraction of its prewar level. Before the war, factories were producing about 1.5m tonnes of steel a month compared with an average 0.6m last year.It’s one of the major reasons, along with lower food experts, that Ukraine’s annual national income remains about 20% lower than its prewar level.A conference in Rome this summer to discuss Ukraine’s recovery is expected to hear that at least $500bn will be needed to reconstruct the country once the fighting stops.Uncertainty over sanctionsLiam Peach, a Russia expert at the consultancy Capital Economics, says the Trump/Putin talks are on a course that would probably lack sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine, increasing the likelihood of the conflict reigniting at some point in the future.“That could limit the amount of capital that investors may be willing to commit to Ukraine’s reconstruction. It could also have negative effects on economies in the region if the perceived risk of doing business on Nato’s eastern border increased. The need for higher defence could put pressure on already stretched fiscal positions,” he said.Reports that Russia may be willing to sacrificethe $300bn of frozen assets locked up in European financial centresas part of deal to end sanctions may offset the lack of international donors, but still seems unlikely at this stage.Peach says: “For Russia, the [economic] implications of any peace deal would depend in large part on the extent of sanctions relief.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This would be positive for the Russian economy and Russian assets.“While Europe may be less willing to appease Putin if a deal is less favourable for Ukraine, some leaders (such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán) may take the US’s lead and veto the rolling over of sanctions.”Russia business investment surveyHe adds: “The nature of any peace agreement may also play a key role in shaping how quickly Russian energy flows return.”A failure by the US and Europe to give Zelenskyy the strongest of signals about their financial and military commitment to Ukraine is one reason for Russia’s resilience, says Mark Harrison, emeritus professor of economics at Warwick University.Sanction-busting agents, who might have feared being forced out of business permanently, have bet that a deal would be round the corner, wiping away all criminal charges.“There has been some sanctioning of people who have made sure ‘grey ships’ get illicit Russian oil to its destination, but this will have been considered worth it, knowing that one day a deal would need to be done,” he said.Russia has managed to ramp up military production and pay high levels of compensation to Russian families affected by conscription mostly from those illicit oil revenues.India hasproved to be the surprise customer for Russian oil, and with China has become the source of many billions of dollars to Putin’s administration.The move has kept Russia’s national income growing throughout the war period, even if much of the output is no longer dedicated to consumer goods and services, but military hardware.Richard Connolly, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute, argues against those who believe Moscow’s war machine, and the economy behind it, is running out of steam.View image in fullscreenAnalysts believe the US and Europe must give Volodymyr Zelenskyy the strongest of signals about their financial and military commitment to Ukraine.Photograph: The Guardian“The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives.”“For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised,” he says.Trump’s push for a dealA worry for Putin is that Trump’s ultimate aim is not just to reduce Washington’s aid bill to Ukraine, but also to bring down oil prices permanently.Russia’s inflation rate may be lower than Ukraine’s but the interest rate needed to prevent it going any higher is more punishing at 21%. Ukraine’s cost of borrowing is 14.5%, down from 22% in 2022.The Kremlin has failed to end the country’s dependence on the volatile price of oil and gas to pay for public services.Europe’s biggest users, even if it accepts a Trump-inspired peace deal, are unlikely to reopenshut gas pipelinesor buy Russian oil.That leaves the Kremlin relying on the likes of China and India to buy its oil and gas over the longer term, which is unlikely to be sufficient.Harrison says any deal is unlikely to last because Putin will always want more. He says his political and economic objectives are only fulfilled by getting the US out of Europe and controlling countries on Russia’s borders.The fear must be that Trump is satisfied with such an outcome.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropeNatoEuropean UnionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This could get messy…Jane MartinsonSat 22 Feb 2025 07.50 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareWhen some of the mind games and manoeuvres that turned a Murdoch family “retreat” into an ordeal appeared inSuccession, the TV dramaabout squabbling family members of a right-wing media company, members of the real-life family started to suspect each other of leaking details to the writers. The truth was more straightforward.Succession’s creator,Jesse Armstrong, said that his team hadn’t needed inside sources – they had simply read press reports.Future screenwriters have been gifted a whole load of new Murdoch material in the past few days, after two astonishing stories in theNew York Timesand theAtlanticlifted the lid on the dysfunction, paranoia and despair at the heart of the most powerful family in global media.The stories followed the end of the secret trial involving the fate of theMurdoch family trust. The mogul’s four eldest children – Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence – were set to inherit the family firm following Rupert’s death. But four years ago, just after turning 90, Rupert had tried to cut James, Liz and Prue out of their inheritance and hand the businesses over to Lachlan, his favoured heir who also happens to share his increasingly right-wing politics.The lawsuit was brought by the three errant offspring, and in December a Nevada commissioner ruled in their favour, accusing Rupert and Lachlan of acting in “bad faith”. The trial took place in secret, but the fallout – thanks to theNew York Timesinvestigation and a 13,000-wordAtlanticinterview with James – has been anything but.View image in fullscreenRupert Murdoch with his sons Lachlan, left, and James, right, who called his father a ‘misogynist’.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersAmong the highlights – or the lowlights if you’re a Murdoch – were the revelation that Rupert’s plan to disinherit three of his four eldest children was dubbed “Project Family Harmony”, that Rupert’s lawyer had accused the three children of being “white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies”, and thatJames now viewed his father as a “misogynist”. As Jesse Armstrong might have said, he didn’t need to make it up.The fallout from this family saga will not just be felt by Rupert’s six children (two by histhird wife, Wendi Deng, inherit an economic rather than controlling stake) but by a vast business empire which includes Fox News in the US, HarperCollins and news titles, including theTimesand theSunin the UK.WhileNews UKmade no comment, a former adviser was furious at the potential impact. “It’s hard to overstate how uncertain everyone associated with the company feels right now. You’ve got some great journalists doing great work while squabbling billionaires fall out over even more money.”The decision by the Nevada family court judge is still to be approved after Rupert and Lachlan lodged an appeal, but few lawyers believe they will succeed. If the dispute is to be settled before the trust dissolves in 2030, the most likely scenario is for a sale of parts of the business valued at a combined $43bn. Such disposals could end decades of Murdoch family influence in the US and British political systems.The timing of this very public washing of the family linen comes just as the businesses themselves are enjoying a political and legal boom. The anti-environmentalist, right-wing causes espoused by Murdoch’sFoxNews may be loathed by some of his children but are very much in tune with the new US president. About a week before the NYT exposé, a withered-looking Rupert was pictured in the Oval Office alongside President Trump.Meanwhile, in the UK,News Corp has finally settled with Prince Harry, effectively ending a phone hacking scandal which kicked off in 2011. At a time when the news should be good for the future of the business, family members are at loggerheads over their share in the future. A dysfunctional family presiding over a functioning business.Claire Enders, who has studied the Murdoch empire for 40 years, is among many analysts who see little logic in the recent developments. “As a business analyst, I don’t see what the purpose was. I don’t see what they’re in such great disagreement about, since they’ve all contributed hugely to the value created since the nadir of the company only 13 years ago.”Author Michael Wolff tells me that the latest shenanigans simply “confirm” the hypothesis of his latest book on the family, which he calledThe Fall:The End of the Murdoch Empire. “I think that we’re clearly heading toward that [collapse]…Lachlan will be fired and the rest of the company will be dismantled.” Following the excoriating court ruling, Rupert has to either survive until he turns 99 in 2030 when the trust expires, or reach a settlement with James, Liz and Prue, dubbed the “objecting children” in court. With figures of $1bn for each beneficiary being mentioned in court and time running out, rumours of a sale of part of the business have multiplied, adding further uncertainty.Although the businesses are riding high politically, Fox News still faces a $2.7bn defamation claim from Smartmatic after on-air comments suggested the electronic voting systems helped rig the 2020 US presidential election. In April 2023, Fox reached a $787.5msettlementin a similar defamation lawsuit by voting technology company Dominion Voting Systems.Yet Fox News is the most profitable part of the Murdoch empire and likely to be the easiest to sell in the short term. It is separately traded and valued at $25bn, and there will be no shortage of billionaires willing to pay for its access and influence.That the company brings profits and political clout is likely to also make it attractive to the Murdoch heirs, including his 13 grandchildren, whatever their politics. One family adviser was incredulous at the suggestion that the more liberal-minded children would want to change its politics entirely: “the idea that the three siblings gang up and set up Guardian TV is ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenCauses espoused by Murdoch’s Fox News are in tune with the new US president.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesContinued financial dependence on the family businesses was no doubt behind the scathing comment from a spokesperson for Rupert and Lachlan who decried the “litany of falsehoods” in theAtlanticinterview coming “from someone who no longer works for the companies but still benefits from them financially”.Both Dow Jones (which includes theWall Street Journal) and HarperCollins, the world’s second biggest consumer book publisher (whoseauthors include vice-president JD Vance), could be disposed of but influence and anti-trust regulations are hurdles, unless removed in any upcoming Trumpian bonfire of regulations.At the less financially viable end of the scale are the News UK assets. While Murdoch’s British newspapers have long brought him huge political influence in Westminster – Rupert used the back door entrance to No 10 long before he was an Oval Office regular – there is a question mark over their contribution to the bottom line.TheTimesandSunday Times, theSunand its Sunday sister, could prove tough to sell because of both circulation revenues and regulatory hurdles. Total losses at theSunover the last five years reached £515meven before the settlement with Prince Harry, amid declining print sales and the high cost of paying damages to victims of illegal information-gathering.In 2021,the title’s overall value was slashed to zeroamid the payouts and the difficulty of adapting to a digital-only world.TheTimesand its Sunday sister title are performing far better, but the continuing saga of theTelegraph Media Group suggests that selling a UK newspaper is far from straightforward. Last year’s Foreign State Influence rules, brought in to stop a member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family buying the Barclay-ownedTelegraph, has added another hurdle to a potential takeover.Enders said: “You wouldn’t even be able to put a valuation on those companies [the UK newspapers] because of the rules in place on foreign ownership.” While the radio assets are admired, the companymoved its upstart news channel TalkTV onlinebecause of losses.The UK assets are also possibly the least loved by every Murdoch except Rupert. Although Rebekah Brooks, long-serving chief executive of News UK, has been described by some insiders as “Rupert’s seventh child”, she remains very much an employee. Liz Murdoch, the only scion who has made her life in the UK, has also long focused on TV assets such as successful production company Sister. News UK declined to comment.In his interview with theAtlantic, which at times makes excruciating reading, James calls his father a “misogynist” unable to see the abilities of his older sisters, Liz and Prue. While critical of his brother’s “reactionary” and “white nativist” ideas, he seems more shocked that his father is not the “devoted free-marketeer” and “believer in immigration as a source of industry and ingenuity” he had long thought he was.Although he has largely kept his counsel sinceresigning from the News Corp board in 2020, James has been happy to talk to journalists. In 2000, when he had just joined the family firm, Iinterviewed him for theGuardianin New York. There was a poster of Chairman Mao and an icon of Jesus above a framed picture of James with Rupert behind his desk. “My father’s politics and mine, which I think I understand better than many do, are probably reasonably close,” he said. “I think he is vastly misunderstood politically.”James was about to be sent out to Asia to run Star TV. When I asked to whom he will turn for advice in his new job, he says: “I know it sounds hokey, but I speak to my father.”In court, amid a welter of evidence that at one point saw James weep in the witness box, it emerged that he had not talked to his father for years. The fate of the Murdoch business will have a huge influence on global politics – but, as the writers ofSuccessionunderstood, it is also a brutal family drama.Jane Martinson is the author ofYou May Never See Us Again: The Barclay Dynasty.Explore more on these topicsRupert MurdochThe ObserverJames MurdochNews UKHackingThe SunPrince WilliamFoxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fourteen months after they last put a major dent in Arsenal’s title aspirations, Jarrod Bowen secured West Ham’s second successivePremier Leagueaway win over their north London rivals as Mikel Arteta’s side saw their hopes of maintaining the pressure on Liverpool evaporate.To compound Arteta’s misery, the substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly was shown a straight red card in the second half asArsenal– who had toiled all afternoon with Mikel Merino again filling in as a makeshift attacker – struggled to find an equaliser against a defence that would have done Graham Potter’s predecessor David Moyes proud. Yet while this was a welcome triumph for Potter, it also laid bare the deficiencies in Arsenal’s squad caused by so many injuries to forward players that has made their task of overhauling Arne Slot’s side almost impossible. A first defeat in 15 league games – a run that had stretched back to the start of November – almost leaves them needing snookers, regardless of the fact Liverpool have to play Manchester City and Newcastle in their next two matches.Arteta says Arsenal’s performance was below the mark needed to win the titleRead moreArteta had hinted Merino would start after his heroics off the bench against Leicester and it still was a damning snub – if unsurprising given his struggles of late – for Raheem Sterling to be the player who made way. Spain’s Euro 2024 winner has enjoyed mixed success since joining in August for €32m from Real Sociedad and hadn’t been selected in a Premier League lineup since playing in his more conventional midfield role against Aston Villa here five weeks ago. A measure of his sudden importance was that Merino’s name received an extra loud cheer when it was read out before kick-off, although his performance didn’t live up to the hype.Potter insisted this past week that there has been an increase in intensity on the training pitch since he succeeded Julen Lopetegui last month, even if results on the pitch have been disappointing. Four points from his first five league matches and an early exit from the FA Cup hardly constituted the start the former Chelsea and Brighton manager would have hoped for. But he got the response he wanted here in a committed display and they took a surprise lead during the first half.The teenager Ollie Scarles was one of four changes from their defeat at home to Brentford last week and he managed to keep Ethan Nwaneri quiet on his first Premier League start at left wing-back at the ground where he helped West Ham win the FA Youth Cup two years ago. “He was amazing – it was some performance,” said Potter. “It’s a big thank you for our academy.”View image in fullscreenA distraught Myles Lewis-Skelly after his dismissal.Photograph: Ian Kington/IKIMAGES/AFP/Getty ImagesNwaneri and Lewis-Skelly both also played in Arsenal’s 5-1 thumping that night and have already progressed to become key members of Arsenal’s title challenge, although Riccardo Calafiori was preferred to the latter at left-back from the start. The Italian was involved in an early move when Leandro Trossard whipped in a dangerous ball to the near post and all three of West Ham’s central defenders were fortunate there was no one attacking the six-yard box. While he will never be a natural No 9, at least Merino gave Arsenal’s attack a focal point as Calafiori’s drive stung the gloves of Alphonse Areola midway through the first half.West Ham’s only sight of goal until then had been a Tomas Soucek header that just cleared the bar after he was picked out by James Ward-Prowse. A surging run down the right flank from Aaron Wan-Bissaka set up Bowen but he could not direct his shot on target with his right foot.Arsenal did not heed their warning and disaster struck on the stroke of half-time when they lost the ball on the edge of West Ham’s area. Bowen fed Wan-Bissaka and the next time the West Ham captain touched the ball it was to guide his header into an empty net to leave an already jittery home crowd fearing the worst.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bowen was inches away from doubling West Ham’s lead just as Lewis-Skelly and Oleksandr Zinchenko were about to come on and the decision to withdraw their former captain Declan Rice only increased the volume in the jubilant away end. “You should have signed for a big club,” they sang as Rice trudged off.Zinchenko’s last league appearance came in the win over Tottenham here last month but suddenly the Ukrainian was thrust into an attacking midfield role and only a block from Soucek denied his goal-bound shot before Areola saved well from Trossard.Lewis-Skelly initially seemed to have earned a reprieve when he brought down a flying Mohammed Kudus on the halfway line but the video assistant referee had other ideas and West Ham were able to see out their victory with relative ease as many of the home fans slipped away before the final whistle to drown their sorrows.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverArsenalWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Approaching the 89th minute, Villa’s season appeared to be stalling, a third consecutive draw incoming. Then the Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jörgensen made a mess of a routine save, allowing Marco Asensio’s lukewarm volley from Marcus Rashford’s cross to squirm through his gloves.Rashford’s half-time arrival proved inspired given he also laid the ball on for Asensio to cancel out Enzo Fernández’s early strike. This was a big result for Villa after taking four points from their previous five matches and one that squeezes the order towards the top.Chelseacan vouch for that. Villa are now seventh, a point behind fifth-placed Bournemouth and sixth-placed Chelsea, though those above and below Emery’s side have at least one game in hand.West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen delivers major blow to Arsenal’s title hopesRead moreFor Chelsea, this was another ominous takeaway. Their last away win came in Kazakhstan, against Astana in mid-December, and their form has been wayward for a while, having beaten only West Ham, Wolves and Morecambe since Christmas. After successive defeats at Brighton, one in the FA Cup, one in the league, this was another difficult result for Enzo Maresca, whose side are flagging. At the same time Chelsea will wonder how they left empty-handed given Pedro Neto and Cole Palmer missed golden chances to regain the lead in the second half. Neto was the architect for Fernández’s goal, skinning the former Chelsea defender Ian Maatsen before crossing for Fernández, pushed into an advanced role, to finish.Palmer’s miss was symptomatic of Chelsea’s form. Palmer, so often such a cold-blooded finisher, was unusually bereft of composure. Moisés Caicedo threaded Palmer through one on one with Emiliano Martínez, the England forward wandering behind Lamare Bogarde to latch on to a straight ball. What happened next was a touch slapstick, a Martínez slip spooking Palmer, who then slipped himself at the pivotal moment. By the time Palmer sent a tame shot at goal, the fit-again Ezri Konsa was able to clear. Palmer sat on the turf in frustration. “On one hand we can be almost happy with this reaction because it means he feels bad about the chance he missed,” Maresca said. “Cole is a top player and belongs in that category.”View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio of Aston Villa (left) watches as Filip Jörgensen fails to stop his shot.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAThousands of Villa fans spent the previous 24 hours plotting their second trip to Brugge in four months but reaching the Champions League last 16 has undoubtedly damaged their league form. Emery conceded he had mixed feelings on their season so far. Villa won six points from a possible 24 after midweek exertions in Europe in the league phase and an enthralling duel with Liverpool on Wednesday appeared to drain Emery’s side here. Villa were weary and discombobulated for much of the first half, though Ollie Watkins saw a couple of chances to level blocked in quick succession, first by Jörgensen and then Marc Cucurella.Emery had been bullish about the need to register victory to avoid widening the gap to the top five and recognised something had to change at half-time. That something came in the shape of Rashford, who entered in place of Jacob Ramsey at the interval. The early signs were encouraging, Rashford driving into the box but up the other end Neto flashed another shot wide after Tyrone Mings’s misguided attempt to waltz upfield between Palmer and the Portuguese.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea, who lost Trevoh Chalobah to a back injury, did not respond to Villa’s increased pressure and approaching the hour, Asensio’s close-range finish, initially ruled offside, was awarded following a check by the video assistant referee, Paul Tierney. Malo Gusto’s attempt to cut out Matty Cash’s cross inadvertently served to control the ball for Rashford, who, played onside by Fernández, prodded the ball across the six-yard box for Asensio.Jörgensen saved superbly to deny the substitute Donyell Malen, after Rashford slipped the Dutchman through on goal, but Chelsea paid a hefty price for his error seconds later. Chelsea have now dropped 15 points from winning positions this season – 13 since Boxing Day. “This is probably for me personally the toughest defeat of the season, because the reaction from Brighton was brilliant, the performance very good but at this moment it is not enough,” Maresca said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverAston VillaChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The in-house (that Ruth built) rule that denied New York Yankees players the right to wear beards on baseball diamonds from the 1970s on is done and dusted, not unlike likeThe Bosshimself,who died at 80 back in 2010. It’s the latest move showing that the new boss, George’s son Hal, who axed the 49-year-old rule on Friday, will do everything he can to differentiate himself from the old Boss, his dad.“In recent weeks I have spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees – spanning several eras – to elicit their perspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy, and I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback,” Steinbrennersaid in a statement. “These most recent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue that dates back several years.“Ultimately the final decision rests with me, and after great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.”It’s a sensible decision by Hal, even if it may lead some fans to bemoan that the Yankeesjust aren’t the Yankees anymore. And those fans, who surface after every mini-losing streak, may actually have a point. After all, Hal does not spend foolishly like a drunken sailor. Hal doesn’t treatmanagers and general managers like Tinder dates. Hal hasn’t made anyillegal campaign contributions to sitting presidents. Hal hasn’t sent a mob-tied unsavory character to follow around Aaron Judge to dig up dirt,like his dad did to the franchise player Dave Winfield. Hal has yet to nearly cancel dental insurance for his Yankee Stadium employees. Hal hasn’t threatened tomove the team to New Jerseyevery time something goes wrong with their new stadium. Hal doesn’t override the general manager and trade their best prospects on whims. Hal doesn’t ask his managers to play every one of 162 regular season games like an NFL game, as the football-obsessed George always wanted. And Hal didn’t ask his equipment manager to withhold a uniform to one of his players until they shaved off their afro,as was done to Oscar Gamble in 1976. Neat hair was also part of the rule.And now Hal won’t forcehisplayers to shave, just because his father may have wanted to mask the daily chaos happening in and around Yankee Stadium by forcinghismen into a clean-shaven, prim, proper and professional look. Talk about irony.If anything it’s a wonder that in this era of Instagram individualism, where everyone tries to look different despite mostly looking the same, that the rule to keep Bronx ballplayers beard-free lasted this long. Now, for clarity, if you think you’re going to be seeing long, gruff, twisty,Brian Wilson-type beardsflirting with diamond dust any time soon, guess again. Remember, Hal says beards must be “well-groomed”.Why now? Well, this move is further proof that theLos Angeles Dodgersand the New York Mets have overtaken the Yankees. You may be able to institute juvenile policies on your ballclub when you have the highest payroll in baseball, decade after decade. But when that’s no longer the case, players may be less inclined to put up with such nonsense. If you’re a bearded ballplayer with a similar offer from Queens or Chavez Ravine, well, you’re that much less inclined to sign in the Bronx.Devin Williams is a case in point. The closer, who is now known for his handsome beard as much as his fastball, was most definitely unhappy about having to shave upon his arrival in Tampa where the Yankees train each spring. Williams, who was acquired by New York from Milwaukee this offseason, is a free agent after this year. So why would a guy so in love with his thick, rich beard, who is clearly miserable and who clearly sneaked some stubble into his team picture just two days ago, come back to a ballclub that laid him bare for all to see? Answer? He wouldn’t, and that’s precisely why this is a business move more than anything else.The repeal of this Boss-era rule means that we’ll never again get those little Yankees rebellions that gave us Goose Gossage’s Fu Manchu style mustache, which he grew to “to piss Steinbrenner off”, and we’ll never again see anything resemblingThe Simpsons’ Don Mattingly moment. Jarring transformations, like Johnny Damon as the thick bearded, long haired “idiot” Red Sox star, to the clean cut Wall Street-looking outfielder, and the brutally savage trimming of Randy Johnson’s marvelous mullet, are also out for good.Instead, Yankees fans will now watch and wait for any growth signaling the ultimate reversal: Aaron Judge as a newly bearded baseball menace, batting clean-up in the Bronx.Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBUS sportsLos Angeles DodgersNew York MetsMilwaukee BrewersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fixture has become significant around the world but in one north African nation it has a new edge as their rising star and their national hero come face-to-face.Omar Marmoush arrived in Manchesterin January after City paid £59m to buy him from Eintracht Frankfurt. The Egypt forward built his reputation in Germany and has added to it in the Premier League after ahat-trick against Newcastlefollowed some promising performances to indicate he is up to Guardiola’s high standards. Marmoush is a beacon in a disappointing season for City but has some way to go to match his compatriot Mohamed Salah, the man leading Liverpool towards a second Premier League title. From Alexandria to Zagazig, eyes in Egypt will be on the Etihad on Sunday as the country’s heroes do battle.Ageless Salah remains driving force behind Liverpool quest for trophiesRead more“Everyone is excited to watch the match, especially since it’s a big showdown between the two biggest teams in England,” says the Egyptian sports journalist Hamed Wagdy. “Salah has faced Mohamed Elneny at Arsenal and Trézéguet at Aston Villa with Ahmed Elmohamady, but this match is between two teams competing for thePremier Leaguetitle, even if Manchester City’s performance has declined. Marmoush is performing well, and there is much talk in Egypt and the Arab world about Marmoush as Salah’s successor in the Premier League and capable of surpassing Salah’s achievements in the future.”Egypt has a population of 114.5 million and Salah has an Instagram following of more than 64 million, while Marmoush has a relatively paltry 2.9 million. Football is big business in Egypt and producing two of Europe’s leading forwards is an exciting moment in the country’s progress in the sport. City and especiallyLiverpoolshirts are becoming commonplace there.“The match comes the day after the Cairo derby between Al Ahly and Zamalek, which will provide an opportunity for the largest possible number of Egyptian fans to watch,” says Wagdy. “In the past, cafes were crowded for all competitions due to Salah’s brilliance, and now the numbers will double due to Marmoush’s presence. I believe the viewers in Egypt will not be less than 10 million, especially since the population exceeds 100 million and the people love football.”Considering Sky Sports’ record viewing figures for a Premier League match stand at 4.5 million, the numbers expected in Egypt are impressive but they are not surprising. Salah put in plenty of hard yards as a child, making a nine-hour round journey from his birthplace in Nagrig three times a week to training in Cairo. When Salah returns to his hometown he is mobbed by locals, eager to get a glimpse of the man who worked his way up to global stardom. Marmoush was born and raised in Cairo and his commute was not as lengthy but he too showed great commitment and dedication. Sunday’s game will be evidence that the endeavour has more than paid off.“This is great, and we are proud of it as Egyptians in general and football fans in particular,” Wagdy says of Marmoush and Salah spearheading two of the world’s biggest clubs. “It provides an opportunity for many young football players to replicate Salah and Marmoush’s experience in European leagues, especially the strongest league in the world, the Premier League. Salah has been at Liverpool for eight years and, because of his brilliance, the number of Liverpool fans in Egypt has increased significantly.”Marmoush turned 26 this month and has 35 caps, 26 alongside Salah. Egypt have lost only twice in 90 minutes in the matches when the pair have combined and there is hope that they can take the team to new heights. Egypt are yet to win a World Cup finals game and want to secure a first Africa Cup of Nations title since 2010. Salah at 32 is showing no signs of decline and with him captaining the national team from the right wing and Marmoush on the left, the continent, at least, is fearful of the attacking options available to Egypt.View image in fullscreenFootball is big business in Egypt and the nation has produced two of Europe’s leading forwards in Mohamed Salah (left) and Omar Marmoush.Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images“Salah is considered the greatest Egyptian and Arab player and one of the greatest African players in history,” Wagdy says. “This is a result of what he has accomplished in recent years, whether in the Premier League or with the Egyptian national team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Basel and Wolfsburg respectively provided the next step in their schooling but both feel a strong bond with their homeland.“Marmoush will be the future of Egyptian football, especially as he is currently training with Pep Guardiola,” Wagdy says. “Everyone sees him as the one to bring back the Africa Cup of Nations title that Egypt has missed for 15 years, in addition to participating in the World Cup and achieving Egypt’s first-ever win in World Cup competitions.”English domestic matters, however, will be the focal point on Sundaytoday. Friendship will be put aside on the pitch. Whatever the result, Egypt will celebrate. Regardless of the rivalry between the clubs, Salah and Marmoush are uniting a nation in front of their TV screens.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverManchester CityLiverpoolEgypt football teamMohamed SalahfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It leaves Arsenal still eight points behind Liverpool, with Arne Slot’s side having an opportunity to extend their lead when they face Manchester City on Sunday.West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen delivers major blow to Arsenal’s title hopesRead moreArteta admitted that West Ham were worthy winners against his toothless side but refused to blame the number of injuries to attacking players that forced him to start with Mikel Merino as a makeshift centre‑forward.“We are very disappointed and very, very angry as well,” he said. “I never felt that we were at the level that is required and I am very much responsible for that. We have to look in the mirror at ourselves of what we can do better, what we have done and the will and the desire and the way we run and the way we want it, zero question about that.”Asked whether their poor performance was down to the lack of options in attack, he added: “No, I refuse that completely. We’re talking about the standards of the players and the team that played today, me included. And that was nowhere near the levels that we have to hit to have the opportunity to win the Premier League. Today no, we were very consistent, yes, but football is about what you do today and today, nowhere near.”Lewis-Skelly was shown a red card in the second half for bringing down Mohammed Kudus after a review by the video assistant referee in a similar incident to when he was sent off against Wolves last month.That decision was overturnedbut another reprieve appears unlikely after VAR intervened, with the teenager now set to miss the trip to third‑placed Forest on Wednesday through suspension.“First of all suffer, 24- 48 hours, suffer,” said Arteta when asked how his team will prepare for that game.”And feel the pain. And make sure that we come back on Monday with that bite and that anger still in the stomach for Wednesday.”West Ham’s win was only their second since Graham Potter was appointed last month and he paid tribute to his side’s dogged approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a fightback that could have been rendered redundant but for referee Andrew Madley overturning his decision to award Everton a 96th-minute penalty. The video assistant referee did not show the full offence on the pitchside monitor. No wonder Alejandro Garnacho patted the match official on the back afterwards.Ruben Amorim’s team produced a dire first-half performance. Beto and Abdoulaye Doucouré took advantage to setEvertonon course for a fifth win in seven league games under David Moyes. The hosts remained comfortable until United captain Bruno Fernandes curled in a 72nd-minute free-kick. Amorim’s side, improved by the introductions of Garnacho and Chidozie Obi, suddenly sensed an escape and levelled through Manuel Ugarte’s first goal for the club.West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen delivers major blow to Arsenal’s title hopesRead moreThe real escape came in stoppage time when André Onana parried Idrissa Gueye’s shot and Ashley Young was prevented from reaching the rebound by Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire. De Ligt pulled the former United man’s shirt before he theatrically dived to the ground. Maguire grabbed him too. Madley pointed to the spot but was advised to review the decision by VAR. Only the Maguire incident was shown on repeat and Madley deemed that no foul had been committed. The shirt pull by De Ligt was not shown, much to Moyes’s bewilderment.“So they only mentioned the bit they needed to mention and not the shirt pull?” asked the Everton manager when informed of Professional Game Match Officials Limited’s official version of events. “You shouldn’t be getting away with pulling jerseys. The referee made the correct decision at the time and should have stuck with it.” Amorim had a different take, unsurprisingly. “It was a soft touch and I think it was clear to overturn the decision,” the United manager said.Not up for debate was Amorim’s admission that United “didn’t exist” in the first half. The visitors were woeful, showing no attacking intent, no ideas, no energy, no spirit and little defensive cohesion. The central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Ugarte were comfortably outplayed by their opposite numbers Gueye and James Garner, a former United academy graduate, and Everton dictated proceedings for almost 70 minutes. Moyes’s bigger regret was not establishing a three-goal cushion in that time.View image in fullscreenAshley Young (centre) argues with referee Andrew Madley at full time after the late penalty controversy.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesEverton took the lead when United failed with five attempts to clear a Jack Harrison corner. Beto swept Doucouré’s header beyond Onana from close range and after a VAR check lasting three minutes, for offside against the striker and Jesper Lindstrøm, the goal eventually stood. It was Beto’s fifth goal in four games, as many as Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirkzee have scored all season. The United forwards appeared out of their depth at Goodison.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doucouré nodded home Everton’s second after Lindstrøm and Beto combined to carve open United. Harrison stepped inside Maguire and, though his shot was pushed skywards by Onana, Doucouré reacted quicker than the United defender to score from two yards out.

From that base level the only way was up. Garnacho and Obi injected overdue urgency into the United performance but the quality required of a club with high ambitions remained absent.Everything changed when Fernandes reduced the arrears. The United captain struck one free-kick into the Everton wall – Doucouré’s raised arm to be exact – after Gueye was penalised for a foul on Garnacho. Fernandes curled the second, closer attempt, into Jordan Pickford’s left-hand corner with the Everton goalkeeper rooted.Goodison was suddenly consumed by nerves when United took possession. The fear of throwing away a comfortable lead was justified eight minutes later when the visitors scored from another set piece. A Fernandes free-kick was again the source, this time floated in from deep for Beto to head clear to Ugarte. The midfielder had time on the edge of the penalty area to control with his chest and volley beyond Pickford from 18 yards. Pickford saved superbly to deny Fernandes in the final minute before United were saved themselves by VAR and Madley.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverEvertonManchester UnitedVideo assistant referees (VARs)match reportsShareReuse this content"

Beating Wolves could have taken Andoni Iraola’s team up into fourth but next season’s Champions League remains a dream some way from being realised.Under a different kind of pressure – expectation – Bournemouth lost to an organised, muscular and determined Wolves, the talismanic Matheus Cunha ­scoring the winner. Even before Illia Zabarnyi’s disputed red card, the Bournemouth machine had shown defective signs, previous ­football from the gods deserting them. If ­officialdom took public blame, Wolves deserved credit. “It affects the game, absolutely,” said Iraola of his defender’s dismissal. “Physically it becomes difficult to keep the quality.”Rampant Brighton thrash sorry Southampton to boost hopes of EuropeRead moreSincereplacing Gary O’Neilin December, Vítor Pereira has added control and defensive rigour. Here were the results of a slow process. The strategy was as simple as ­averting mistakes and supplying Cunha plenty of the ball but it bore results. “I have seen a lot of teams beaten here,” said Pereira. “We came here with the spirit to get three points.”As an expectant home crowd urged on a team beatenonly by Liverpoolsince the start of 2025, Wolves were forced to defend deep in the early stages but they also issued ­warning signs. Nélson Semedo hit a post before Jean-Ricner Bellegarde forced a fine save from Kepa Arrizabalaga.Iraola appeared to recognise the danger of both Wolves and of his ­players slackening. José Sá ­smothered well when Justin Kluivert was sent through but the visitors were ­otherwise holding their lines tightly, even without Emmanuel Agbadou, the January signing a significant absence.Then came the flashpoint that tilted the game in Wolves’s favour. Zabarnyi’s tackle took the ball first but also tanked through Rayan Aït-Nouri. A pantomime stand-off had both benches up in arms before Stuart Attwell, the video assistant referee, recommended Michael Salisbury’s initial yellow card be upgraded.Such is Wolves’s bitter case history with officialdom their fans still led the choruses decrying video ­protocol. “If there are six angles, instead of ­showing six, they showed the worst angle,” said Iraola, protesting his Ukrainian defender’s innocence. “And they showed the worst angle in slow motion.”View image in fullscreenThe referee Michael Salisbury shows a yellow card to Illia Zabarnyi before upgrading to a red after a VAR review.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersBournemouth were discombobulated. Cunha’s ­predatory finish came after Dean Huijsen and the full-back James Hill, shuffled inwards as an emergency centre-back, both ­misread a bouncing ball. “We had to be very clever and do what was important to win,” said Cunha. “We had to be kind of lucky because [Zabarnyi] was imprudent with the action but this can happen.”For Wolves, victory and safety in clear sight. Could they in turn deal with expectation? “The team showed emotional balance,” said Pereira. Iraola improvised with Dango Ouattara, recently star striker, at left wing-back. That allowed Semedo a chance that might have clinched ­victory, only for Kepa to gratefully accept a poorly hit shot. Marshall Munetsi would miss a better chance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only are Oliver Glasner’s side unbeaten on their travels in the Premier League since October, they are also on a run of five consecutive 2-0 away wins in all competitions after their calculated dismissal of a blunt and irritable Fulham.Matheus Cunha shocks 10-man Bournemouth to ease Wolves relegation fearsRead moreIt is testament to Glasner’s coaching that Palace’s defensive discipline did not come at the cost of attacking ­adventure. Although the first goal was a scruffy affair, Joachim Andersen turning a corner into his own net against his former employers, and the second from a rampaging Daniel Muñoz run on the counterattack, this was no smash and grab. “Credit to the players,” Glasner said. “We know when we are disciplined like today it is tough to play against us.”The frustration with Fulham, who could have gone seventh, is that they tend to be at their least inspired when they are expected to dominate. Is it a mental block? How else to explain their inability to build onbeating Nottingham Forest?Perhaps it had something to do with Palace’s expertise on the road. Their 3-4-2-1 system poses awkward tactical questions and they are skilled in stifling opponents. Fulham created nothing despite having plenty of the ball during an angry, anxious first half. Adama Traoré had no joy against Tyrick Mitchell on the right and there were few moments when Palace’s outstanding back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guéhi were pulled out of position.Fulham soon looked uncertain. Palace were more incisive, Jean-Philippe Mateta shooting just wide in the third minute. It was a sign of Fulham’s discomfort that they were reduced to complaining about the ­referee, Robert Jones. Palace, who were assured and methodical in possession, threatened again when Eberechi Eze drew two saves from Bernd Leno from long range.View image in fullscreenMaxence Lacroix’s shot is deflected off Joachim Andersen to open the scoring.Photograph: Alex Broadway/Getty ImagesEze was in delightful form after returning to the starting XI. Will Hughes and Jefferson Lerma also impressed in midfield and it was no surprise when Palace went ahead in the 37th ­minute. Lacroix darted to the near post in an attempt to meet Hughes’s corner and the ball went in off Andersen, who was unable to adjust after being given a ­little shove by Ismaïla Sarr.Fulham fans were still ­grumbling about the non-award of a foul moments before the corner. In truth, though, it was easy to tell where this game was heading long before Palace’s opener. “We were solid and stayed patient,” Glasner said. “I liked in the first half how confident we were, how quickly we moved the ball.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He talked about a lack of intensity in possession and was unhappy with Palace’s goals. He could not understand why no one brought down Mateta when the striker broke forward and released Muñoz after Fulham failed to make the most of an attacking free-kick.Fulham, who did not have a shot on target until the 95th minute, were muted. Palace were more aggressive and inventive. They did not feel sorry for themselves after Mateta had a goal disallowed for offside at the start of the second half. They pushed again in the 66th minute, Mateta seizing possession in his own half and driving past flimsy ­challenges from the Fulham ­substitutes Andreas Pereira and Tom Cairney. The ball went to Muñoz on the right and the wing-back crashed a shot past Leno after beating Calvin Bassey.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverFulhamCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The former Oxford loan midfielder Alex Mowatt’s 11th-minute goal and the substitute John Swift’s strike deep into second-half stoppage time returned Tony Mowbray’s side to winning ways and moved them up to fifth.

But for some wasteful finishing and a brilliant performance from the Saints goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, the scoreline might have been even more impressive for Hürzeler’s Europe-chasing side.Muñoz seals another masterful away day win for Crystal Palace at FulhamRead moreHe said: “Overall we are very happy with the performance. The only thing that we can really regret today is that we didn’t score more goals. Ramsdale had an outstanding performance today, he made several really, really good saves.”Brighton have now won three games in a row but Hürzeler was quick to dampen talk of Europe with high-flying Bournemouth next up at the Amex Stadium on Tuesday.He said: “For us it’s very important to stay grounded and to understand why we have this momentum. It only comes from hard work every day on the training ground. We must take it game by game.”João Pedro opened the scoring when he coolly scooped the ball over the advancing Ramsdale to give Hürzeler’s side a deserved lead after 23 minutes.After Cameron Archer had an equaliser chalked off for offside for Southampton, Brighton upped the intensity to take the game away from them.Joe Aribo was adamant that he had been fouled by Rutter in the buildup but the referee, Darren Bond, waved away the protests and Yankuba Minteh was left with the simple task of rolling the ball across the six-yard box for Rutter to prod home his fifth league goal of the season.View image in fullscreenJack Hinshelwood shows his delight after scoring Brighton’s fourth.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesAnother brilliant touch from João Pedro sent Mitoma clear and the Japanese forward dinked the ball past Ramsdale to score Brighton’s third goal of the match and his fifth in seven games to cue a mass exodus in the home stands.Those who had remained saw Brighton add a simple fourth as Brajan Gruda’s corner fell to the unmarked Hinshelwood at the far post from where the 19-year-old scored his second goal of the season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Simeone said he was delighted with Álvarez’s maturity and humility as well as his determination to work hard and stay focused despite a slow start in his debut season in the Spanish capital.The coach said his 25-year-old Argentinian compatriot was everything they needed him to be when Atlético signed him in the close season in a deal worth €75m (£62m) plus €20m in potential add-ons from Manchester City.“When he still couldn’t reflect with facts what we were looking for when we signed him, I said that I was sure he had Atléti’s DNA,” Simeone said. “That’s why we were so excited then and we are now. Especially because of the way he does things. He won everything by the age of 25 – the World Cup with Argentina, the Champions League and the Premier League with Manchester City, and he continues in the vein of that humility that makes him different from everyone else.”Álvarez struck a rebound in the 12th minute to open the scoring and headed home an Antoine Griezmann cross in the 30th to extend Atlético’s lead.

The New Zealander had been scheduled to challenge Daniel Dubois for his IBF world heavyweight title but, afterthe champion fell ill with a virus on Thursday, Bakole flew to Saudi Arabia from the Democratic Republic of Congo as an emergency replacement.The odds against Bakole were underlined by the fact that he had only landed in Riyadh at 3am on the morning of the fight. Less than 22 hours later, at 1.10am local time on Sunday morning, Bakole ambled calmly to the ring. He hopped over the ropes, in his tartan trunks, with admirable alacrity. Parker followed, wearing a bright red tunic and a relaxed smile despite the sudden change of adversary.Joseph Parker: ‘This will mean something different. I’m doing it for myself now’Read moreBakole, looking fleshy and far from in prime condition, banged his black gloves together when he was introduced. Parker raised his fists in warning before referee Steve Gray summoned them to the centre of the ring for their final instructions.They touched gloves at the opening bell and Parker landed first with a couple of left jabs to Bakole’s corpulent body. The static substitute stayed in the centre of the ring while Parker circled and feinted. But the New Zealander showed respect for Bakole’s undoubted power as he backed away watchfully. A scything left was the first threatening punch from the African, on the bell, but he missed by a considerable margin.Bakole, who has been based in Airdrie under experienced Scottish trainer Billy Nelson for nearly 10 years, began to rumble forward with more intent early in the second – only to be tagged by a hard right hand. Parker had his opening and he then stopped Bakole in his tracks with a crunching straight right. The punch made Bakole shake his suddenly clouded head as a dazed expression crossed his face. He fought back and cuffed Parker with a couple of punches on the inside but, as they broke, a massive overhand right ended his night.The impact of the heavy blow against the top of his head was delayed and Bakole, staggering away in shock and confusion, went down in stages. He finally hit the blue canvas hard. Bakole was stretched out on his back, his legs in the air as Parker walked to a neutral corner.View image in fullscreenJoseph Parker comiserates with Martin Bakole after winning their fight in Riyadh.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersThe stricken fighter managed to sit up and then, eventually, haul himself unsteadily to his feet with the help of the ropes. But he looked out blankly at the crowd before Gray wisely waved the fight over. Nelson gently removed the gumshield from Bakole’s mouth.Across the ring, Parker was hoisted on the shoulders of his jubilant cornermen. It was not long before the two fighters met again in the middle of the ring for a respectful embrace.The potential threat of Bakole, who can punch extremely hard, was negated by the class, experience and raw power of Parker. The ending was brutal and Bakole’s only compensation will be the large purse he was paid to step in as a late opponent.“When I came back to the corner,” Parker said, “[his trainer] Andy Lee gave me the instructions just to be patient. And when the overhead right comes, when he walks in and attacks, that’s when you have to take your shot. That’s the best way – to catch them when they’re coming in.”Parker, an amiable and polite man, turned to the boxer he had just bludgeoned to such a concussive defeat. “Martin Bakole, thank you very much for accepting the challenge and flying all the way here on short notice to give me a good fight. I just went out there and listened to Andy, stayed calm, structured, composed, and got the victory.”Parker can now look ahead to his rearranged world title bout against Dubois with still more confidence after his authoritative victory – even if he will be sharply aware that the IBF champion will provide far more imposing company than a woefully unprepared Bakole.Earlier on the undercard of an extraordinary bill, Callum Smith outpointed Joshua Buatsi in an all-British light-heavyweight showdown full of grit and pain. Smith deservedly won a clear victory on the three scorecards but, for all the hurt he brought down on Buatsi, he was also tested during a gruelling battle.In the sixth round, as Smith punished Buatsi, it looked as if the older man might force a stoppage. Buatsi was reeling but, dredging deep into his reserves of will, he rocked Smith as they shared a compelling round. They stayed in the trenches, sharing brutal exchanges while Smith edged ahead to lead by three rounds as they reached the final quarter. But, in the 10th, a tiring Smith was shaken and hurt to the body – only to respond with heavy artillery of his own.Smith was marked up, cut above the right eye and swollen beneath it, and Buatsi poured on the pressure in the 11th. The Londoner was told by his corner he needed a stoppage before the final round but Smith landed the more damaging punches, sending the gumshield flying from Buatsi’s mouth. Back came Buatsi and, at the bell, they were still trading fiercely. But the decisive victory belonged to Smith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the outset Kabayel moved fluidly and landed sapping body shots. Zhang looked every one of his 41 years but, in the fifth round, he scored a sudden knockdown. Kabayel appeared undeterred and, in the next round, he pummelled his despondent rival to the body. Zhang began to sag and then, as the punches hammered into his gut and flanks, he toppled over. There is little fire left in Zhang but Kabayel can look forward to more lucrative bouts at a higher level.Vergil Ortiz Jr unanimously won his hotly anticipated super-welterweight showdown with Israil Madrimov. The pale Uzbek expended so much energy in the opening rounds, but Ortiz, the gifted Mexican-American from Texas, was more effective in short bursts. In the sixth, a frustrated Madrimov was warned for using his head and then sinking a shoulder into Ortiz. The round ended with Ortiz backing up Madrimov, whose swollen right eye needed attention on his stool.Urged on by his corner, Madrimov came out with fresh intent and shaded the seventh and eighth. A dogfight broke out in the last nine minutes and the referee gave the Uzbek two more warnings for excessive use of the head midway through the 10th and 12th rounds. The faces of both men showed the marks of battle at the final bell but the decision belonged to Ortiz by scores of 117-111 and 115-113, twice.Hamzah Sheeraz, the promising British middleweight with a flawless 21-0 record, faced the toughest opponent of his career. Carlos Adames, the WBC world middleweight champion from the Dominican Republic, is a tough and dangerous operator. But the cagey first four rounds were shaded by the challenger. Adames abruptly cranked up the intensity in the fifth and, at the bell, he gesticulated pointedly at the crowd. He was finally in the fight and Adames won the next round too with eye-catching bodywork.The Dominican settled into a percussive rhythm, switching between the head and body, as he imposed himself more and more effectively. Sheeraz, concentrated and wary, sensed the momentum drifting away from him as his face looked increasingly bruised. He seemed tentative as they entered the championship rounds and his promoter, Frank Warren, shouted urgent advice for him to pick up the pace as his hopes for the title were slipping away.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A blistering left hand gave Sheeraz renewed hope and he won the 11th round. But, as an ice pack was pressed down against his swollen eye, Sheeraz’s trainer told him in bluntly profane words that he needed a knockout to wrest the title away from the champion. But Adames hurt Sheeraz and pressured him with persuasive menace. He seemed to have sealed victory – and one judge gave the victory to Adames by 118-110.But, shockingly, the first official ruled wrongly that Sheeraz had won by a margin of 115-114. The third scorecard, read out to widespread disbelief, was a 114-114 draw. It was still a sobering night, full of regret, for Sheeraz. The harsh truth was that he had failed to close the gap between potential and hard-won championship pedigree.Adames shook his head dismissively at the poor decision, for he knows Sheeraz’s popularity in Saudi Arabia, but he remains the rightful champion.Josh Padley, a part-time electrician from Yorkshire, fought bravely against Shakur Stevenson, the WBC world lightweight champion. Padley was working on site in his day job earlier this week when he was called in as a late replacement, like Bakole, to fly to Riyadh to face the celebrated American. He put up a creditable performance but, after being knocked down three times in round nine, his corner threw in the towel with merciful good sense.Explore more on these topicsBoxingThe ObservernewsShareReuse this content"

The Norwegian was an unused ­substitute in Spain after telling Guardiola he was unfit to take any part because of a knee injury suffered against Newcastle.Haaland is a doubt for Sunday’s home game against Carragher’s ­former clubLiverpool. Carragher said on CBS’s Champions League coverage on Wednesday that the striker might be suffering from “Rüdiger-itis” and that is why he told Guardiola he was not available for selection.Does Pep Guardiola have drive to rebuild broken Manchester City?Read moreWhen it was put to the City head coach that Haaland did not want to play, Guardiola responded, after a long pause: “Oh, God. Did he say that?Jamie Carraghersaid that? Oh God. Don’t laugh. I don’t know why he makes that ­suspicious, you know that? Did he say that Haaland didn’t want to play the game? It’s not nice – and it’s not true. He was crazy to play the game. He had a problem with his knee and he could not play.”Guardiola will be without the centre-backsJohn Stones and Manuel Akanjifor Liverpool’s visit and will have to wait on Haaland’s fitness. Both defenders are likely to be out for up to three months after being injured in Madrid.City’s Champions League exit allows them to focus on ­domestic matters and securing a place at Europe’s top table next season. They are 17 points behind Liverpool, the leaders, and long ago gave up the prospect of a fifth straight title.Asked if finishing in the top four would be a proud achievement, Guardiola said: “Unbelievable.

Gregor Townsend feels his team were unlucky to concede the crucial second-half penalty kicked by Fin Smith that ultimately proved decisive and doubts have also been raised over the solitary English try, scored by Tommy Freeman.Townsend was particularly unhappy about the crucial penalty given against Rory Darge and Tom Jordan for lifting Ben Curry out of a ruck. “I’m going to go through the game two or three times to see whether we could have got better decisions,” said Townsend, the head coach. “I did feel the decision that counted against us for the winning three points where we cleared someone out of the ruck … I just don’t know how that’s a penalty.Agony for Finn Russell after missed kick hands England win over ScotlandRead more“We’ve moved someone off the ruck and they’re two feet off the ground and there was no moving [his] legs above the horizontal. That was an interesting call for us to end up going six points behind.”Members of his management team were also unconvinced that Freeman’s early try should have been awarded. “I heard the [other] coaches say it wasn’t grounded but I was on to the next thing, which was a kick-off,” said Townsend. Freeman was adjudged to have touched the ball down beneath a heap of Scottish bodies but smiled broadly and chose his words carefully about his try afterwards.“The referee awarded it – therefore I grounded it,” said Freeman. “He awarded it so that’s the end of it really. I’m not going to say anything different. You take the points and stop asking questions. He must have seen it on the ground.”Townsend, however, was at pains to stress that the French official Pierre Brousset had also played his part in ensuring a gripping contest. “I thought the referee did well. It was a very good game to watch, which would mean that the referee’s had a big part to play in that. Sometimes you’re going to get those decisions and sometimes you’re not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s what we probably should be looking to do with the chances we had.”Steve Borthwick preferred to focus on his team’s second-half resilience after they had trailed 10-7 at half-time. England’s head coach said: “I’m obviously delighted that the endings have gone our way in the last two games and the team worked exceptionally hard for that. In many ways, it wasn’t pretty, and there were things we’d obviously want to do differently and better.

He also tipped Ben Duckett, 165 from 143 balls in a total of 351 for eight, to become the first Englishman to score a double-century in ODI cricket.Inglis inspires Australia to record win over England despite Duckett hundredRead moreDuckett doing so against Afghanistan or South Africa next week would be pretty handy for Buttler, it must be said. The two remaining Group A games – first here in Lahore, before a switch to Karachi – have now become must-win affairs, for England’s semi-final hopes and possibly his own continuation as captain.Asked whether, after a ninth defeat in their last 12 ODIs, England were struggling to remember how to win, Buttler replied: “The longer it goes on, the closer you get to winning. The optimism and the belief is very much there in the team.“I think you have to be proud of the way we played and performed and give credit to the opposition for just being a little bit better and getting over the line. We’ll plan well, keep the boys upbeat, dust ourselves down and go again.”On Duckett, who stitched England’s innings together but only found genuine support from Joe Root’s 68, Buttler said: “There won’t be too many times you score 165 and end up on the losing side. His game is perfectly suited to scoring big runs. I said before the tournament he could be the first Englishman to score a double in ODI cricket.“At innings like this one should really prove to him how consistent he can be and how many runs he can score in this format. It is a big year for English cricket and he’s going to be at the forefront of it. To start as he has done, and looking ahead, I’m sure England fans will be excited to watch him bat for the rest of the year.”In mitigation, it was a tough toss to lose, the pitch slowing up in the first innings before dew fell late on and saw the ball skid on. “I liked the balance of the team that we went with,” added Buttler, regarding the batter-heavy selection. “I thought Root and Liam Livingstone bowled really well and built some nice pressure together.“You’ve got to sometimes credit the opposition – Inglis played a fantastic innings.”Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyThe ObserverEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketJos ButtlernewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the first time I’ve won the same title twice,” the delighted Russian said. “I’m really happy. I don’t know what else to say.”The opening set went with serve for the first 11 games, with Rublev serving to love on four occasions and Draper twice doing likewise, before the Russian finally broke the Briton to take the first set.WTA urges social media companies to do more after Raducanu’s Dubai ordealRead moreThe second set appeared to heading towards a tie-break when Draper broke for a 6-5 lead and served out to level the match.Draper had never beaten Rublev in their three previous meetings, and went into the deciding set with the wind in his sails, but Rublev showed no mercy. Rublev broke twice early on to storm into a 5-0 lead and while Draper avoided a bagel, the Russian fired down two aces to wrap up the win.“I really like Jack as a person and I really like his game. He has a really, really great career and future ahead. He will win many great things,” Rublev said.Draper failed in his attempt to win his third ATP title after winning in Stuttgart and Vienna last year, but the 23-year-old’s run to the final lifts him to a career-high 12th in the world rankings.“I want to congratulate Andrey. He was too good today. Outlasted me,” Draper said. “We played some really tough matches this week. In the third set he was a bit too strong for me.”Mirra Andreeva became the ­youngest player to win a WTA 1000 title when the 17-year-old beat Clara Tauson 7-6 (1), 6-1 in the DubaiTennisChampionships final on Saturday.The Russian, who beat three grand slam champions – Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina – to reach the final, will make her top-10 debut in the world rankings next week.“I’d set a goal for myself to be in top 10 by the end of the year. Now it’s the end of February and I’ve already made it, so this is something incredible for me,” Andreeva said. “I’m just super happy with the way I was playing today. I was hella nervous.

And now it just feels amazing… this is something I dreamt of and now my dream came true so I’m just, I’m speechless right now.”Tauson raced into an early lead on the back of a strong service game while Andreeva made two ­double faults to find herself 2-0 down but the Russian quickly recovered and began playing her shots, breaking back to level at 2-2. Both players soon found their range with some heavy hitting, using the full width of the court to enthral the crowd. With nothing to separate the pair, the opening set went to a tie-break.Andreeva has yet to lose one this year and she was near-perfect as she won the first six points before taking the opening set when Tauson sent a return long.Tauson took a medical timeout before the second set and she was frustrated to lose the first game, throwing her racket on the ground. Despite a couple of sublime drop shots from the Danish player, Andreeva grew in confidence to take a 4-1 lead.Andreeva, who is coached by former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, then dictated rallies and began grinding down her opponent, firing winners with emphatic overhead smashes that left Tauson deflated as the Russian teenager went 5-1 up.Andreeva smelled victory as she served for the title and sealed it when another Tauson return went long on her second championship point.Andreeva also broke new ground as only the second teenager – male or female – to win the Dubai event since its inception in 1993, after Rafa Nadal in 2006.“Lastly, I want to thank me for never quitting and always believing in myself,” a beaming Andreeva said after she lifted up the trophy.Explore more on these topicsTennisThe ObserverJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

Wales led 18-10 in the second half before a Jamie Osborne try and three Sam Prendergast penalties for Ireland settled the contest.Prendergast kicks Ireland to triple crown success against spirited WalesRead more“We asked for two things: show the crowd some emotion and ambition,” Sherratt said. “And I think within [the playing] structure, which was important, we did that.”Sherratt had four training sessions with his squad before their third match of the championship, after defeats by France – in which they did not score a point – and in Italy, where they scored just 15 points.The dynamism and fluency of the Welsh attack in comparison to recent performances under Warren Gatland was clear from the start, as Jac Morgan and Tom Rogers tries helped to push Ireland all the way.“I think we got a little bit more of the training week on to the field than I’d imagined,” Sherratt said. “Credit to the players. We’ve really had three days training, so to replicate what we did Tuesday‑Thursday, I was pretty pleased. It shows it’s a good group.”Ellis Mee, the 21-year-old debutant Scarlets wing, was denied a potentially decisive late score for what the officials ruled was a knock-on. “That was a big moment,” Sherratt said. “A very tough call [for the officials]. You could tell that from the length of time it took.”View image in fullscreenMatt Sherratt, the interim Wales coach, takes in defeat by Ireland in his first game in charge.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty ImagesAsked if he will consider taking the Wales job full-time, Sherratt said he was “pretty certain on his next steps”, meaning a return to his permanent Cardiff role.Simon Easterby, the interim Ireland head coach, said Garry Ringrose’s 20-minute red card for a first-half tackle on Ben Thomas would “possibly” have been a straight red card before the introduction of the current system.

Crypto, AI and social media companies, many of which made donations to Trump, are all expecting to benefit.At the center of the administration’s moves is Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. Over the past week, federal agencies under the president’s authority dropped legal fights against his rocket company and the US’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. The White House also issued a “deregulatory initiative” aimed at loosening tech-sector regulation by empowering Musk’s Doge.Musk is the CEO of several tech companies that have been sued by federal agencies in recent years. The billionaire CEO poured nearly $300m into the president’s re-election campaign and now is in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which is tasked with cutting federal spending and regulations.The administration’s moves fall into a pattern of friendliness towards the tech industry and its billionaire leaders.On Friday, Coinbase said the Securities and Exchange Commission had communicated plans to dismiss its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange. The same day, the justice department announced that it was dropping its discrimination case against Musk’s SpaceX.Trump is also cutting regulatory safeguards on artificial intelligence, whichSilicon ValleyCEOs have long said are overly burdensome. The body charged with testing the safety of cutting-edge AI models is bracing for layoffs after probationary employees received notice Wednesday. Two weeks ago, the White House rolled back an executive order by Joe Biden meant to ensure AI safety.Silicon Valley has cozied up to TrumpIn addition to Musk, several other tech CEOs have also found favor with Trump, including Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and TikTok’s Shou Zi Chew. They all donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural committee and have had closed-door meetings with the president.In the early days of the first Trump administration, some tech companies had contentious relationships with the president. They protested against his initiatives, including a ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and his stance on abortion. With Trump’s second time around, things have changed.“The striking image at the inauguration of so many leaders in attendance who had taken more aggressive stances towards Trump in his first term shows that they hope for more favorable treatment,” said Gautam Hans, law professor and director of the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Clinic at Cornell. He added that Trump’s recent actions on the tech front “reflect a litany of long-term conservative grievances and aggressive deregulatory arguments”.Coinbase notches a win after donating to TrumpA month before the SEC dropped its suit against Coinbase, the crypto company donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund, a move many tech companies and their CEOs made to cozy up to Trump. The crypto industry writ large supported a wide swath of Republican candidates, and Trump’s re-election sparked a rally in crypto prices.How Trump’s victory sparked a crypto boom – podcastRead more“SEC staff has agreed in principle to dismiss its unlawful enforcement case against Coinbase, subject to commissioner approval – righting a major wrong,” Paul Grewal, the company’s chief legal officer, wrote in a blogpost. “We’vealways maintainedthat we were right on the facts and the law, and today’s announcement confirms that this case should never have been filed in the first place.”The SEC sued Coinbase in 2023, alleging the exchange traded 13 tokens that should have been registered with the SEC as securities. But the Trump administration is taking a friendlier approach to crypto. On the campaign trail, Trump said he would be the “crypto president” and nominated crypto-friendly commissioner, Paul Atkins, toleadthe SEC, replacing Gary Gensler, who took an adversarial stance towards the industry.The decision to withdraw lawsuits against companies such as Coinbase is not unexpected. In the first few weeks of the new administration, the SEC established a crypto taskforce that experts expect will review and possibly reverse the previous administration’s policies and cases.Consumer protection advocacy group Public Citizen says the SEC’s decision would be “proof positive that the crypto industry’s flood of campaign spending has paid off”.“The now-abandoned lawsuit against Coinbase involved the most basic assertion of SEC authority: Coinbase cryptocurrency offerings are actually securities and must be registered and regulated as such,” Public Citizen co-president said in a statement.“Retreat from this basic assertion is a massive gift to the industry, which can only be understood in light of its massive political spending in the last election.”Trump issues order that empowers Musk and DogeTrump signed a sweepingexecutive orderon Wednesday aimed at cutting back on regulations. The order, called a “deregulatory initiative” in a White House press release, directly echoes Musk and Doge’s stated mission to cut federal spending and regulations – and could greatly benefit the tech industry.The order will “commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state”, the order reads. “Ending federal overreach and restoring the constitutional separation of powers.”The order dictates that Doge, along with the director of the office of management and budget, will “rescind unlawful regulations” by going through a review process that examines “all regulations”. The timeline to do this is 60 days. The list of “unlawful regulations” is expansive and includes regulations that give too much power to Congress, impose significant costs on private parties, and that impede tech innovation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSilicon Valley has long complained about the federal government’s regulations, many of which are aimed at anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior and impose labor and consumer safety standards. Google, Apple and Meta have been sued by the justice department in antitrust and discrimination cases. And the Federal Trade Commission has brought suits against many of those same companies, along with Amazon, Uber and Snapchat.Some lawyers are questioning the legality and feasibility of this new deregulatory executive order.“If Trump thinks Doge is going to be able to just cancel regulations under these vague criteria the way it has attempted to just cancel agencies, he’s going to be disappointed,” said Daniel Walters, an associate law professor at Texas A&M University.“There’s a little law called the Administrative Procedure Act standing in the way.”The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to rescind existing regulations through the same process as creating regulations, Walters said. These processes can take years and existing regulations are considered binding until they’re complete.Deregulating AIAdministration officials have repeatedly signaled their belief that previous administrations have over-regulated the technology industry and created obstacles to innovation, especially with regards to AI. Vice-President JD Vance started a speech at the global AI Action Summit by emphasizing the administration’s focus on “AI opportunity” rather than “AI safety”.“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,” Vance said at the conference.Trump has already made several moves to gut the guardrails around the development and use of AI that the Biden administration put in place. Shortly after taking office, Trump rescinded a sweeping AI executive order that Biden issued to ensure AI would be used and developed safely. Trump called the order a “barrier to American leadership in artificial intelligence”.Now, the non-regulatory body that was charged with testing the industry’s most-powerful AI models is facing layoffs. About 500 probationary employees of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which establishes standards of safety and reliability for various sectors including AI, manufacturing and cybersecurity, are expecting to be fired, according to multiple reports. Some of those employees received verbal notices as of Wednesday, according toBloomberg. Members of the AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was created within the NIST in response to Biden’s AI executive order, are particularly concerned they will be fired,according to Wired.Eliminating the AISI would do nothing to make American AI companies more competitive and would instead “undermine efforts” to ensure AI tools are safe, according to Alexandra Reeve Givens, the chief executive of digital rights non-profit the Center for Democracy and Technology.“The AI Safety Institute was designed to play a basic, common-sense role coordinating the kind of work that needs to happen for the entire industry to succeed,” Givens said in a statement.The FTC’s threatsThough Trump has thus far made tech-friendly moves, his administration is also using its regulators to make threats against the tech industry, should Silicon Valley CEOs stop being so close to the president. The new chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Andrew Ferguson,went on Elon Musk’s Xon Thursday with a promise to go after “big tech censorship” saying it’s “un-American” and “potentially illegal”.He launched an official inquiry into the matter, which will scrutinize how tech platforms may be banning or shadow banning various users. Trump was temporarily banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after the January 6 attack on the Capitol.“Tech firms should not be bullying their users,” Ferguson said in astatement.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyDonald TrumpSilicon ValleynewsShareReuse this content"

Now we’re all at it, recording everything from menstrual cycles and mobility to toothbrushing and time spent in daylight. Is this just narcissism redesigned for the big tech age?Tom FaberSat 22 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareIfirst heard about my friend Adam’s curious new habit in a busy pub. He said he’d been doing it for over a year, but had never spoken to anyone about it before. He had a furtive look around, then took out his phone and showed me the product of his burning obsession: a spreadsheet.This was not a record of his annual tax return or numbers he was crunching for work (Adam is a data scientist). Instead, it was a spreadsheet recording the minutiae of his life, with dozens of columns tracking every element of his daily routine. It all started, he told me, because of a recurring argument with his boyfriend. His partner didn’t think they spent enough time together, but Adam thought that they did. There was only one way to settle this, he decided: cold, hard data. So he began keeping a note of the days they saw each other and the days they didn’t.“It started with just that one element,” he told me, “but then you’re like, is there more stuff to track?” The spreadsheet expanded; soon, he wastracking his sleep, social engagements, exercise regime and cultural intake. He even started to record, on a scale of one to eight, how much cheese he had eaten that day (it’s worth pointing out here that Adam is French – I can only imagine the carnage of a day that notches up the maximum eight out of eight on the cheese scale).While gathering data about our lives might once have been a fringe pursuit for Silicon Valley tech nerds, now it’s just an everyday activity for many of us. We track our step counts, calories consumed, exercise completed, menstrual cycle or hours slept. We list books we’ve read on Goodreads, our top films on Letterboxd, or share our most-played music via the data presented by Spotify Wrapped.Today an average smartphone has a host of self‑tracking tools built in – the iPhone Health function can help you keep track of your mood, mobility and nutrition, but also sexual activity, toothbrushing and time spent in daylight. Then there are the tracking tools: smartwatches on wrists, smart rings on fingers, Zoe glucose monitoring patches on arms, fitness trackers turning every step of that parkrun into thousands of data points. The latest is a£210 devicethat promises to monitor blood pressure, 24/7. In a recentYouGov poll, almost 40% of Britons surveyed said that they own a wearable device.Beneath all this is a promise: understand your life better with data, and you can improve it. The idea is seductive, especially when tech companies offer tools that they say will make it easy. But can a human life be reduced to a dataset? Can a body be tuned up like a machine? Or is this explosion of self‑tracking simply narcissism redesigned for the age of big data, by a society that has internalised the tech industry maxim that more data is always better?To investigate self-tracking, it felt only right to conduct my own experiment. Over three months, I tracked 15 variables about my life every day, recording my sleep, exercise and screen time, health complaints, spending, cultural consumption and social plans, and rating my mood and my work productivity out of 10. I mostly used a spreadsheet and my phone to record data, though I also included an Oura smart ring (which records sleep, heart rate, temperature and activity) in the mix halfway through the project.The quest for self-knowledge is a story as old as time: in the 18th century, at the age of 20, Benjamin Franklin identified 13 essential values he wanted to cultivate, many of which seem very remote from the aspirations of today’s 20-year-olds. They were temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquillity, chastity and humility. Dividing the day into six time periods, Franklin put a black mark in his notebook each time he violated a virtue.The promise was that self-tracking could give us more ability to solve our problems and to answer our questions in daily lifeReflecting on the process later in life, he decided that it had been helpful, writing in his autobiography: “Though I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it.”Widespread self-tracking only became a realistic prospect for ordinary people in the early 2010s, when a confluence of new technologies including mobile data, wearable tech, GPS and biosensors significantly lowered the barriers to entry.A few years earlier, two editors for Wired magazine, Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly, had coined the term “quantified self”. Data had transformed the worlds of economics, government, science and technology, they argued, so why not bring its power to bear on our bodies and daily lives? They fostered a community of artists, academics and early tech adopters who began to meet regularly in the Bay Area of California, before expanding into an international network. “The promise was that self-tracking could give us more ability to solve our problems and to answer our questions in daily life,” Wolf tells me.Rather than using commercial tools to track common metrics like calories or running speed, the members of theQuantified Self communityoften pick hyperspecific attributes to track, and build their own tools for the purpose. On their online forums, people discuss their tracking of headaches, outbursts of anger, longevity of nail polish and rate of hairline recession. “How much fish oil is right for me – 2 years of testing” trumpets one thread (the answer was half a tablespoon a day).Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianOne tracker looked for a relationship between their anxiety levels during the Covid-19 pandemic and the number of times they burped each day. The graphs show that the two rose and fell in tandem, but this might also be a lesson in not mistaking correlation for causation. For example, it is possible to point todata that shows that more peopledrown in swimming pools in the years when more Nicolas Cage movies come out, but that doesn’t mean Cage’s acting causes the drownings.Some trackers successfully solve specific problems using data. In a bid to cure serious allergies, the Danish tracker Thomas Blomseth Christiansen made an app wherehe trackedevery time he sneezed over five years, trying to find the triggers. After rigorous analysis and experimentation, he reported that he was able to stop sneezing almost entirely.While this kind of data-driven approach to the messy business of living may seem cold and analytical to some, it only takes a casual look at trackers’ datasets before you start observing deeply human moments, like short stories buried in the spreadsheets. A woman calledValerie Lanardtracked her excuses for not exercising, which included a column detailing whether she was suffering from a cold at the time, and, intriguingly, the probable cause of the virus. Often this was work or family, but in one solitary cell the suspected reason for illness reads “Kissing”. When I saw this, I felt strangely pleased for Valerie.Not everybody finds their tracking experiments useful. For three years,Felix Krause, a 30-year-old tech worker who lives in Austria, ran a website where he constantly shared his live location as well as daily data about his exercise, sleep and mood. He ended up with some mildly interesting insights. In warmer climates he was more likely to go to the gym. He was less happy on days with more video calls. On days where he consumed more than four alcoholic drinks he was 21 times more likely to dance. Despite the work of collecting data, he appreciated that the process made him pause and reflect regularly: “When the bot asked me four times a day how I was feeling, it was good to have that little check-in and think, how am I really feeling?”But, ultimately, there were no revelations. He abandoned the project in 2022, adding a note to his site: “When I first started building this project three years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts … retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.” When I speak to him, he tells me that his life has recently improved for a very non-quantifiable reason – he fell in love. “I’m in a good relationship, so I’m feeling way better than I did back then,” he says. “It’s not about the food I eat, or the CO2levels in our bedroom, but being in this relationship is overshadowing all those other factors.”For people whose symptoms are undiagnosed, unrecognised or disbelieved, self-tracking can be a really important way of finding validationWith time, the term “quantified self” faded from use. Wolf argues that this isn’t because the idea was wrong, but that it’s become such a common part of daily life that it no longer needs a name. “I think, as a phrase, ‘quantified self’ has done what it had to do,” he says.One group that benefits significantly from self‑tracking is those with long-term health conditions. People living with chronic fatigue syndrome or long Covid have found tracking tools useful for understanding their symptoms, “often in the face of gaslighting by their doctors and being told it’s psychosomatic”, says Prof Deborah Lupton, a sociologist with a focus on health, at the University of New South Wales. “So for people whose symptoms are undiagnosed, unrecognised or disbelieved, self-tracking can be a really important way of finding validation.”Meanwhile, for people living with diabetes, arm‑worn blood glucose monitors can be connected to a phone app. Ellie, a 31-year-old postgraduate researcher who was diagnosed two years ago, tells me that self‑tracking technology is “a total gamechanger”, making blood sugar management much easier. There can be tension, however, between people who track for different reasons. Ellie met people at her local yoga studio using a blood glucose monitor from the wellness company Zoe, which is intended to help users improve their nutrition. “I have had someone say, ‘Oh my God, are you doing Zoe?’ And I’m like, ‘No, babe, I’m doing type 1 diabetes.’”Despite a wealth of scientific literature on the topic, there is no consensus on how helpful self-tracking technologies are. Several studies show that fitness trackers can help motivate people to exercise, but the evidence is inconclusive on whether they can help them lose weight. There isas yet no scientific consensusthat personalised nutrition programmes like Zoe are any better than standard advice. In many cases, the effectiveness of digital tracking tools is not shown to be any better than analogue methods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

One therapist I spoke to who works with patients living with obsessive-compulsive and eating disorders told me that patients can become fixated on their tracking data, punishing themselves if they haven’t walked enough steps in a day or have eaten more than a certain number of calories.One scientific studyflagged that calorie trackers can feel “oppressive and punishy” to their users.This type of thinking can also affect neurotypical trackers. Turning your life into data creates the illusion that there is a perfect version of yourself that you’re forever chasing. For a few weeks of my self-tracking experiment I had an injured foot. I found it demoralising to write “None” every day in the exercise column of my spreadsheet. Btihaj Ajana, a professor of ethics and digital culture at King’s College London, says: “There’s always this feeling of, I could do better, I could do more – and it’s never-ending. That’s a recipe for anxiety, distress and never being content.”And there’s another potential pitfall: data privacy. Users frequently share sensitive data about their health, location and finances with private companies without a clear understanding of where it is stored and how it might be used. Tracking and wearables companies often have vague wording in their privacy policies that obfuscates where your data might be going – theoretically, it could be used to tailor targeted ads, affect your insurance rates, or for identity theft.These services are vulnerable to hacking. In 2018, thedata of 150 million users of the MyFitnessPal appwas exposed in a breach. In 2021, a hack of the company GetHealth exposed the records of 61 million users of platforms including Apple Health and Fitbit. A 2023 hack of DNA testing site23andMe exposed the data of 6.9 million users, a 98% fall in its share value a year later and leaving some customers nervously attempting todelete private datastored on its servers.Even without data breaches, your tracking data could find its way to places you’d would never expectAnd some of the companies are downright shady. While planning my own self-tracking experiment, I looked into analysing my body’s microbiome with a service called uBiome. After some Googling, however, I learned the company’s founders had had their offices raided, beencharged with fraud and money laundering,fled to Germany, and are now considered fugitives by the FBI. I therefore opted not to send them genetic samples from my mouth, gut and genitals.Even without data breaches, your tracking data could find its way to places you would never expect – like a court of law. In 2015, a woman in Pennsylvaniaalleged to policethat she had been sexually assaulted, but the police ended up chargingherwith the crime of filing a false report, in part because her Fitbit showed she was awake at the time of the crime, when she claimed to be asleep. “When she bought her Fitbit, she didn’t realise one day it would become a witness against her,” says Ajana. Later, when the federal right to abortion was overturned in the US in 2022, women were advised to delete their period tracking apps for fear that data concerning their menstrual cycle could be used to accuse them of having illegal abortions in a criminal case. This has not happened yet, but is thought to posea real danger.After three months of tracking my life, I enjoyed some of the observations from analysing my data, but didn’t discover anything wildly new about myself. I took an average of 6,737 steps a day. My average mood was 7.4 out of 10. My average screen time on my phone was three hours and 30 minutes, or 20% of my waking hours – this felt excessive, but the vague interventions I made to reduce it were unsuccessful. My Oura ring once correctly predicted I was getting sick a day before I realised it myself, and also revealed that I sleep less than I expected – closer to six hours a night than eight. Calculating my average daily spending was a horrifying experience that I’m not keen to repeat. The spreadsheet’s “Health” column was full of minor grievances relating to hangovers, skin irritation or back pain. One recurring entry simply says, somewhat mysteriously: “Still on the mend.”At the beginning, I had enjoyed filling in the spreadsheet and felt that by tracking I was taking control of my life. But as it went on, I realised that I was simply creating busywork for myself. Did I need an app to tell me that I was feeling bloated after stuffing myself with pizza? Or that I felt good on days where I exercised or saw my friends? Why did I need to outsource these observations to a phone, watch or ring, when there was another piece of sophisticated technology – my body – that could provide the answers?The limitations of my tools were also clear. My phone told me that on 7 December at 2am I’d walked 587 steps, but I know I was asleep in bed. Clearly it was wrong: even if I had been sleepwalking, I wouldn’t have taken my phone along. If you look at my Oura smart ring app on the night of the 12 January, you will see my heart rate spike dramatically at 11pm, then flatline completely. You would have to assume that I’d had a heart attack and died. In fact, I was running a fever and, frustrated by the weight of the ring on my finger, tore it off and threw it across the room.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianWithout any data expertise, I struggled to extract much meaning from the data I’d gathered. So what good was this data doing me? “Western society thinks in a very quantitative way, believing that more is more, and more data is better than less data,” says Ajana. “But that’s not necessarily the case, because data in itself is just noise. It’s the analysis that goes into it, the fine‑grained study of it, which makes it useful.”As we track every run on Strava and every heartbeat on our smartwatches, we usher in a society where the quantitative outweighs the qualitative. It’s an ideology we’re surrounded by, as modern governments promote data-driven approaches for social problems, and banks, healthcare systems and even national borders increasingly rely on digital systems and biometrics.I asked experts why my self-tracking regimen yielded so few revelations. These days, Wolf is focused on a related field called “personal science”, which focuses on how to make self-tracking data meaningful to your life. “If you spend a little time thinking and refining your questions, you’ll be better able to judge what tools you actually need,” he says. If, by contrast, you start with the tool, you may be buying into metrics that might not be relevant to you.How I beat overwhelm: Tracking my heart rate left me feeling like a frustrated failureRead moreThere is no need to accept a tech company’s rules for what is the right amount of exercise, calories or sleep for your particular body. If your body is telling you one thing and the app another, trust your body – it’s unlikely that a mass-produced tech product can know you better than you know yourself.I catch up with my friend Adam to see how his spreadsheet is going, six months after I first saw it. He tells me that he’s still using it, but in a more targeted way. He has found it helps to motivate him to go swimming regularly, but has decided to stop tracking data on his romantic relationship. “If you’re lost in life,  you won’t find answers in the data you’re collecting,” he says. “If you’re asking yourself tough questions, a therapist is going to be more useful.” One clear decision he has made, however, is to stop tracking how much cheese he is eating each day – and he says he is happier as a result. Perhaps there are some things that it’s better not to know.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleWearable technologyFitnessHealth & wellbeingData and computer securityiPhoneApplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t download them for security reasons.”Apps have burrowed their way into seemingly every aspect of our lives and there are lots of reasons why companies are pushing us to use them. With an app, it is often “one click and you’re in”, rather than having to faff around online finding the website and remembering passwords. It is also for the “push notifications” that mobile apps send to grab our attention and get us to buy stuff. Many tech experts also argue that apps are generally more secure than websites and allow banks and others to carry out sophisticated ID verification using face, voice and fingerprint biometrics.But millions of people who cannot afford a smartphone or have an older device that does not support some services are increasingly being locked out of deals, discounts and even some vital services, say digital exclusion and pro-cash campaigners.They are missing out on everything from savings on their weekly shop, to some of the best interest rates for their cash. And not signing up to the app revolution is making activities including paying for parking and going to concerts increasingly challenging.“It’s the tyranny of the apps,” says Ron Delnevo, the chair of the campaign committee at lobby group thePayment Choice Alliance. “In this country we’re being treated like sheep,” he says. “We’re always being told there’s no alternative.” But when a new smartphone can set you back hundreds of pounds, it is “an expensive passport to participate”, Delnevo says.According to the latest data from the telecoms regulator Ofcom, 8% of people aged 16 or over do not have a smartphone, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people. Among those aged 75-plus, the proportion is said to be 28%. Add in all those who don’t or can’t use apps and the total number of people affected is a lot bigger.ShoppingLots of retailers offer enhanced or exclusive deals to their app users, and some run loyalty schemes through them. This is potentially a big deal as those schemes often give you access to discounts that are not otherwise available.“Some people are missing out on lower prices offered by loyalty schemes as they do not have access to phones or smart devices to download apps,” Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at Which? says.The consumer group is among those to have highlighted Lidl’s loyalty scheme, Lidl Plus, as one that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the “big savings” available via the scheme’s weekly offers – at the time of writing these included 25% off tinned tuna and 20% off microwave rice and grain pouches – plus various coupons and rewards, are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital.Delnevo says Lidl is “disenfranchising” many of its customers, adding: “The people who probably need the discounts most are the people who can’t afford or don’t have a smartphone.”In response, the supermarket chain says the Lidl Plus scheme “forms part of our commitment to providing customers with the best value. Nonetheless, we remain mindful of those who don’t have access to a smartphone or tablet and continue to offer in-store promotions through our ‘pick of the week’ offers.”Rival supermarket Asda also runs a scheme, Asda Rewards, where you have to download an app and there is no physical card available. This scheme does not offer price promotions – instead, you earn Asda “pounds” when you shop, which you convert into vouchers to spend in-store and online.Some retailers have gone further down the app path than others. The Boots Advantage card scheme, one of the UK’s most popular, still lets you use a physical plastic card, although there are “tailored offers” available via the app.View image in fullscreenAt Greggs you get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAnd at the bakery chain Greggs, you can collect loyalty “stamps” for free food and drink and get “exclusive app-only gifts”. You currently get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.Meanwhile, the online clothes retailer Asos and the tools and hardware specialist Screwfix are just two of those that are or have recently been running “app exclusive” campaigns. Asos was this week offering 20% off “1,000s of styles,” while Screwfix’s Stacks of Rewards promotion let you collect coins and earn rewards by spending via the app.ParkingIf there is one area of life where many people probably feel the app revolution has got out of hand, it is parking. In the UK there are thought to be at least 30 different parking apps, and it is not unusual for an individual to have eight to 10 different ones on their phone.Many older people have told the charity Age UK that they are “at the end of their tether” when it comes to paying for parking because they cannot park if an app or mobile is required. “In some cases this has meant missing important appointments like seeing their GP,” it adds.View image in fullscreenMany older people have told Age UK they cannot park if an app or mobile is required.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, says many people are overwhelmed by the multitude of apps they have to use, “when in reality you want one that you like and you’re happy using and that you can use everywhere”.Six years ago the Department for Transport started developing a “national parking platform” (NPP) designed to enable drivers to use one app of their choice to pay for all their parking. It has been trialled by a number of councils, but a big question mark hangs over its future as public funding for the project looks likely to be withdrawn.Some councils are now permanently getting rid of parking ticket machines that accept debit and credit cards in order to save money (many stopped accepting cash a long time ago).The London borough of Barnet is one area where all the council pay and display machines at car parks have just been taken out of service. As of last month, motorists have been greeted with signs telling them to use the PayByPhone app.“Withdrawal of the ability to pay by card, following the removal of the payment by cash facility, will disappoint some drivers, especially the elderly, who find it difficult to use the PayByPhone app,” according toan article on the Barnet Society website.A Barnet council spokesperson says: “Pay and display machines were declining in use and in 2023-24 accounted for less than 7% of overall transactions. There are easy alternatives … including the PayByPhone app, phone or text, and cash payments at over 100 local PayPoint retailers.”EntertainmentIncreasingly with gigs and other events, you need to download an app to access your tickets.For example, tickets for some events at the O2 arena in London are delivered as a “mobile ID” via the venue’s own app, and you get a barcode which is scanned to let you in.This type of app-based mobile ID system is also billed as the only admission method at venues including Ovo Arena Wembley in London and University of Wolverhampton at The Halls.View image in fullscreenJames Bay at the OVO Arena in London, where an app-based system is billed as the only admission method.Photograph: Gus Stewart/RedfernsThat said, the venue websites do usually provide details of how people who do not have a smartphone or cannot download the app can gain entry to their event – but it might involve bringing photo ID and your confirmation email to the box office perhaps 90 minutes before the doors open.When it comes to theatre, popular services such as TodayTix offer savings on tickets and can be accessed online, although to take advantage of some of the benefits and offers, such as discounted same-day “Rush” tickets, you need to have the app.Eating and drinkingThose who cannot or do not use apps are missing out on some of the best deals for meals, takeaways and pub grub.McDonald’s is running a high-profile promotion called Deal Drop, where it offers items at “bargain” prices, such as a classic Big Mac for £1.49 (normally £4.99) and a children’s Happy Meal for £1.99 (normally £3.59) – but all of the discounts are available exclusively with thecompany’s app.The fastfood chain Subway runs a loyalty scheme where you earn points that you can convert into “Subway Cash” that can be spent on anything on the menu – but again it is app-only. If you were a member of Subway’s previous rewards scheme, which closed last May, your plastic membership card “is no longer usable”.Similarly, many pubs have apps that offer big discounts or let you earn rewards. The more than 200-strong Sizzling Pubs chain has recently been promoting eye-catching app-only deals such as 40% off main meals at some locations.Some coffee shop chains, such as Harris + Hoole, have also gone app-only with their loyalty schemes. With the Harris + Hoole one, you get a free drink for every six coffees you buy.View image in fullscreenWith the Harris + Hoole app, you get a free drink for every six coffees you buy.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBankingSome of the best savings rates are offered by app-only providers – made up of banks and “electronic money institutions” (EMIs), which do not have their own banking licence, but put your money in a bank that does.At the time of writing, the Moneyfacts list of top-paying easy access accounts included products from the app-only providers Atom Bank, Chip and Plum paying 4.6%, 4.58% and 4.38% respectively.“App-only accounts are the new ‘online-only’ accounts,” says Anna Bowes, savings expert at the financial advisory firm The Private Office. “While not for everyone, apps are becoming far more popular with savers, especially as they can often be found paying some of the best rates.”To give you an idea of how apps have taken over savings, she says the current top five easy-access cash Isas are all provided by EMIs. “The next five top paying cash Isas are all with regulated banks or building societies but two must be opened via a mobile banking app,” she says.Some of the providers aimed at smartphone users are not entirely app-based. For example, saving and investing firm Moneybox primarily provides its services via its app, but says you can access them through other means, including its website.Meanwhile, the high street banks sometimes have products or services that are app-only – for example, HSBC’s Global Money service, which lets you convert, spend and send multiple currencies with no bank fees, is only available via the HSBC app.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsAppsSmartphonesTablet computersMobile phonesComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve just lived through a few weeks like that. We’ve known for decades that some American tech companies were problematic for democracy because they were fragmenting the public sphere and fostering polarisation. They were a worrying nuisance, to be sure, but not central to the polity.And then, suddenly, those corporations were inextricably bound into government, and their narrow sectional interests became the national interest of the US. Which means that any foreign government with ideas about regulating, say, hate speech on X, may have to deal with the intemperate wrath ofDonald Trumpor the more coherent abuse of JD Vance.The panic that this has induced in Europe is a sight to behold. Everywhere you look, political leaders are frantically trying to find ways of “aligning” with the new regime in Washington. Here in the UK, the Starmer team has been dutifully doing its obeisance bit. First off, it decided to rename Rishi Sunak’s AI Safety Institute as the AI Security Institute, thereby “shifting the UK’s focus on artificial intelligence towards security cooperation rather than a ‘woke’ emphasis on safety concerns”, as theFinancial Timesput it.But, in a way, that’s just a rebranding exercise – sending a virtue signal to Washington. Coming down the line, though, is something much more consequential; namely, pressure to amend the UK’s copyright laws to make it easier for predominantly American tech companies to train their AI models on other people’s creative work without permission, acknowledgment or payment. This stems from recommendation 24 of theAI Opportunities Action Plan, a hymn sheet written for the prime minister by a fashionable tech bro with extensive interests (declared, naturally) in the tech industry. I am told by a senior civil servant that this screed now has the status of holy writ within Whitehall. To which my response was, I’m ashamed to say, unprintable in a family newspaper.The recommendation in question calls for “reform of the UK text and data-mining regime”. This is based on a breathtaking assertion that: “The current uncertainty around intellectual property (IP) is hindering innovation and undermining our broader ambitions for AI, as well as the growth of our creative industries.” As I pointed out afew weeks ago, representatives of these industries were mightily pissed off by this piece of gaslighting. No such uncertainty exists, they say. “UK copyright law does not allow text and data mining for commercial purposes without a licence,” says theCreative Rights in AI Coalition. “The only uncertainty is around who has been using the UK’s creative crown jewels as training material without permission and how they got hold of it.”The aim of public policy should be building a copyright regime that respects creative workersAs an engineer who has sometimes thought of IP law as a rabbit hole masquerading as a profession, I am in no position to assess the rights and wrongs of this disagreement. But I have academic colleagues who are, and last weekthey published alandmark briefing paper, concluding: “The unregulated use of generative AI in the UK economy will not necessarily lead to economic growth, and risks damaging the UK’s thriving creative sector.”And it is a thriving sector. In fact, it’s one of the really distinctive assets of this country. The report says that the creative industries contributed approximately £124.6bn, or 5.7%, to the UK’s economy in 2022, and that for decades it has been growing faster than the wider economy (not that this would be difficult). “Through world-famous brands and production capabilities,” the report continues, “the impact of these industries on Britain’s cultural reach and soft power is immeasurable.” Just to take one sub-sector of the industry, the UK video games industry is the largest in Europe.There are three morals to this story. The first is that the stakes here are high: get it wrong and we kiss goodbye to one of “global” Britain’s most vibrant industries. The aim of public policy should be building a copyright regime that respects creative workers and engenders the confidence that AI can be fairly deployed to the benefit of all rather than just tech corporations. It’s not just about “growth”, in other words.The second is that any changes to UK IP law in response to the arrival of AI need to be carefully researched and thought through, and not implemented on the whims of tech bros or of ministers anxious to “align” the UK with the oligarchs now running the show in Washington.The third comes from watching Elon Musk’s goons mess with complex systems that they don’t think they need to understand: never entrust a delicate clock to a monkey.

Some audiologists are beginning to worrySome specialists suspect that constantly filtering out background noise may have unintended consequencesIan SampleScience editorSat 22 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 04.21 ESTShareThey are prized for making the commute more bearable and shielding against the din of daily life. But noise-cancelling headphones have come under scrutiny after audiologists raised concerns that overuse might impair people’s hearing skills.While the technology has clear benefits, not least in helping people listen to music at lower volume, some specialists suspect that constantly filtering out background noise may have unintended consequences.Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, has seen an uptick in adults coming to her clinic with hearing issues only for tests to suggest their hearing is fine.The problem is with their brain, not their ears. They might fail to locate where a sound is coming from, or struggle to follow a conversation on the train, in a bar or at a restaurant.The condition, known as auditory processing disorder (APD), is often diagnosed in children, so the rise in adults with similar issues struck Almeida as odd. Her hunch is that widespread use of noise-cancelling headphones could be the culprit.“The brain is used to dealing with thousands of different sounds at the same time and it’s always been able to figure out what is and isn’t worth listening to. If a dog barks outside, in a split second I recognise that it’s a dog barking and I don’t really care,” she says. “With noise cancelling, you’re giving your brain only one source of sound, be it a podcast or music. One source. There’s nothing else for your brain to worry about.”Excessive use of noise-cancelling headphones could impair the developmental process by which children learn to attend to sounds, Almeida says. For adults, it could make their brains lazy, just as muscles weaken without exercise. In both cases, she says, people could struggle to extract speech from the hubbub around them.There is no scientific evidence that noise-cancelling headphones cause APD. Nor is there any robust data showing a rise in the condition. But Almeida believes the question warrants attention. “Studies definitely need to be done,” she says. “The research should focus on the effects of extended use, especially in young people.”APD affects about three to five per cent of school-age children. It has been linked to low birth weight, but also chronic middle ear infections. In older adults, the condition can be triggered by stroke or head trauma. In many cases, the cause is never clear.Dr Cheryl Edwards, an audiologist at Boston children’s hospital, said children with APD could struggle to hear in classrooms, have difficulty working out where sounds are coming from, and miss nonverbal cues such as the shift in tone that flags sarcasm. Reading and spelling can also suffer. “We certainly see academic issues,” she says.Whether cases are rising is harder to say, however. Auditory processing has long been a speciality within a speciality, Edwards says. And while referrals have risen with better awareness, there aren’t reliable records to measure any trend against.According to Harvey Dillon, a professor of auditory science at the University of Manchester, there is no doubt that listening experience affects our ability to segregate “wanted speech” from background noise. He says children improve at using spatial cues to home in on sound sources from the age of five to 14 years old.But disrupting what is heard can be more problematic for children than adults. If a child has repeated ear infections before the age of five, they can find it hard, later on, to focus on sounds from one direction while suppressing those from another. Surprisingly, Dillon says, many don’t catch up once their infections are behind them. Instead, they need to learn the skill through intensive training on apps such asSound StormorSoundiverse.Adults seem to be different. If a person wears a single earplug for a week, they will gradually relearn how to locate where sounds are coming from. When the earplug is removed, their ability dips again, but quickly recovers to its previous level.For Dillon, the idea that noise-cancelling headphones might be driving APD is a hypothesis yet to be tested. “There is no research that I am aware of investigating a link between the use of noise-cancelling headphones and reduced auditory processing ability,” he says.Dillon cautions that loud music can damage neurons in the auditory system without affecting the thresholds measured in hearing tests. “It may be that listening to loud music is the cause of the auditory processing problem, not the noise-cancelling feature,” he says. “If so, noise cancelling could be a good feature, in that it allows one to listen to music, without interference from background noise, at a lower level.”Prof Dani Tomlin, the head of audiology and speech pathology at the University of Melbourne, says people who use noise-cancelling headphones for prolonged periods may find listening harder when they take them off. But she says “the benefits should not be overlooked”, for managing sensory inputs in neurodiverse people and helping individuals to listen to podcasts and movies on planes and trains.“Instead of suggesting abandoning noise-cancelling headphones, we need more comprehensive research studies,” she adds.For now, Almeida recommends bone conduction headphones and hearing training. She urges patients to listen to radio debates and to take down the lyrics of rap songs when they are playing. “There is immense plasticity in the brain,” she says. “Make an effort to listen to what’s being said.”Explore more on these topicsScienceHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

This could get messy…Jane MartinsonSat 22 Feb 2025 07.50 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareWhen some of the mind games and manoeuvres that turned a Murdoch family “retreat” into an ordeal appeared inSuccession, the TV dramaabout squabbling family members of a right-wing media company, members of the real-life family started to suspect each other of leaking details to the writers. The truth was more straightforward.Succession’s creator,Jesse Armstrong, said that his team hadn’t needed inside sources – they had simply read press reports.Future screenwriters have been gifted a whole load of new Murdoch material in the past few days, after two astonishing stories in theNew York Timesand theAtlanticlifted the lid on the dysfunction, paranoia and despair at the heart of the most powerful family in global media.The stories followed the end of the secret trial involving the fate of theMurdoch family trust. The mogul’s four eldest children – Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence – were set to inherit the family firm following Rupert’s death. But four years ago, just after turning 90, Rupert had tried to cut James, Liz and Prue out of their inheritance and hand the businesses over to Lachlan, his favoured heir who also happens to share his increasingly right-wing politics.The lawsuit was brought by the three errant offspring, and in December a Nevada commissioner ruled in their favour, accusing Rupert and Lachlan of acting in “bad faith”. The trial took place in secret, but the fallout – thanks to theNew York Timesinvestigation and a 13,000-wordAtlanticinterview with James – has been anything but.View image in fullscreenRupert Murdoch with his sons Lachlan, left, and James, right, who called his father a ‘misogynist’.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersAmong the highlights – or the lowlights if you’re a Murdoch – were the revelation that Rupert’s plan to disinherit three of his four eldest children was dubbed “Project Family Harmony”, that Rupert’s lawyer had accused the three children of being “white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies”, and thatJames now viewed his father as a “misogynist”. As Jesse Armstrong might have said, he didn’t need to make it up.The fallout from this family saga will not just be felt by Rupert’s six children (two by histhird wife, Wendi Deng, inherit an economic rather than controlling stake) but by a vast business empire which includes Fox News in the US, HarperCollins and news titles, including theTimesand theSunin the UK.WhileNews UKmade no comment, a former adviser was furious at the potential impact. “It’s hard to overstate how uncertain everyone associated with the company feels right now. You’ve got some great journalists doing great work while squabbling billionaires fall out over even more money.”The decision by the Nevada family court judge is still to be approved after Rupert and Lachlan lodged an appeal, but few lawyers believe they will succeed. If the dispute is to be settled before the trust dissolves in 2030, the most likely scenario is for a sale of parts of the business valued at a combined $43bn. Such disposals could end decades of Murdoch family influence in the US and British political systems.The timing of this very public washing of the family linen comes just as the businesses themselves are enjoying a political and legal boom. The anti-environmentalist, right-wing causes espoused by Murdoch’sFoxNews may be loathed by some of his children but are very much in tune with the new US president. About a week before the NYT exposé, a withered-looking Rupert was pictured in the Oval Office alongside President Trump.Meanwhile, in the UK,News Corp has finally settled with Prince Harry, effectively ending a phone hacking scandal which kicked off in 2011. At a time when the news should be good for the future of the business, family members are at loggerheads over their share in the future. A dysfunctional family presiding over a functioning business.Claire Enders, who has studied the Murdoch empire for 40 years, is among many analysts who see little logic in the recent developments. “As a business analyst, I don’t see what the purpose was. I don’t see what they’re in such great disagreement about, since they’ve all contributed hugely to the value created since the nadir of the company only 13 years ago.”Author Michael Wolff tells me that the latest shenanigans simply “confirm” the hypothesis of his latest book on the family, which he calledThe Fall:The End of the Murdoch Empire. “I think that we’re clearly heading toward that [collapse]…Lachlan will be fired and the rest of the company will be dismantled.” Following the excoriating court ruling, Rupert has to either survive until he turns 99 in 2030 when the trust expires, or reach a settlement with James, Liz and Prue, dubbed the “objecting children” in court. With figures of $1bn for each beneficiary being mentioned in court and time running out, rumours of a sale of part of the business have multiplied, adding further uncertainty.Although the businesses are riding high politically, Fox News still faces a $2.7bn defamation claim from Smartmatic after on-air comments suggested the electronic voting systems helped rig the 2020 US presidential election. In April 2023, Fox reached a $787.5msettlementin a similar defamation lawsuit by voting technology company Dominion Voting Systems.Yet Fox News is the most profitable part of the Murdoch empire and likely to be the easiest to sell in the short term. It is separately traded and valued at $25bn, and there will be no shortage of billionaires willing to pay for its access and influence.That the company brings profits and political clout is likely to also make it attractive to the Murdoch heirs, including his 13 grandchildren, whatever their politics. One family adviser was incredulous at the suggestion that the more liberal-minded children would want to change its politics entirely: “the idea that the three siblings gang up and set up Guardian TV is ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenCauses espoused by Murdoch’s Fox News are in tune with the new US president.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesContinued financial dependence on the family businesses was no doubt behind the scathing comment from a spokesperson for Rupert and Lachlan who decried the “litany of falsehoods” in theAtlanticinterview coming “from someone who no longer works for the companies but still benefits from them financially”.Both Dow Jones (which includes theWall Street Journal) and HarperCollins, the world’s second biggest consumer book publisher (whoseauthors include vice-president JD Vance), could be disposed of but influence and anti-trust regulations are hurdles, unless removed in any upcoming Trumpian bonfire of regulations.At the less financially viable end of the scale are the News UK assets. While Murdoch’s British newspapers have long brought him huge political influence in Westminster – Rupert used the back door entrance to No 10 long before he was an Oval Office regular – there is a question mark over their contribution to the bottom line.TheTimesandSunday Times, theSunand its Sunday sister, could prove tough to sell because of both circulation revenues and regulatory hurdles. Total losses at theSunover the last five years reached £515meven before the settlement with Prince Harry, amid declining print sales and the high cost of paying damages to victims of illegal information-gathering.In 2021,the title’s overall value was slashed to zeroamid the payouts and the difficulty of adapting to a digital-only world.TheTimesand its Sunday sister title are performing far better, but the continuing saga of theTelegraph Media Group suggests that selling a UK newspaper is far from straightforward. Last year’s Foreign State Influence rules, brought in to stop a member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family buying the Barclay-ownedTelegraph, has added another hurdle to a potential takeover.Enders said: “You wouldn’t even be able to put a valuation on those companies [the UK newspapers] because of the rules in place on foreign ownership.” While the radio assets are admired, the companymoved its upstart news channel TalkTV onlinebecause of losses.The UK assets are also possibly the least loved by every Murdoch except Rupert. Although Rebekah Brooks, long-serving chief executive of News UK, has been described by some insiders as “Rupert’s seventh child”, she remains very much an employee. Liz Murdoch, the only scion who has made her life in the UK, has also long focused on TV assets such as successful production company Sister. News UK declined to comment.In his interview with theAtlantic, which at times makes excruciating reading, James calls his father a “misogynist” unable to see the abilities of his older sisters, Liz and Prue. While critical of his brother’s “reactionary” and “white nativist” ideas, he seems more shocked that his father is not the “devoted free-marketeer” and “believer in immigration as a source of industry and ingenuity” he had long thought he was.Although he has largely kept his counsel sinceresigning from the News Corp board in 2020, James has been happy to talk to journalists. In 2000, when he had just joined the family firm, Iinterviewed him for theGuardianin New York. There was a poster of Chairman Mao and an icon of Jesus above a framed picture of James with Rupert behind his desk. “My father’s politics and mine, which I think I understand better than many do, are probably reasonably close,” he said. “I think he is vastly misunderstood politically.”James was about to be sent out to Asia to run Star TV. When I asked to whom he will turn for advice in his new job, he says: “I know it sounds hokey, but I speak to my father.”In court, amid a welter of evidence that at one point saw James weep in the witness box, it emerged that he had not talked to his father for years. The fate of the Murdoch business will have a huge influence on global politics – but, as the writers ofSuccessionunderstood, it is also a brutal family drama.Jane Martinson is the author ofYou May Never See Us Again: The Barclay Dynasty.Explore more on these topicsRupert MurdochThe ObserverJames MurdochNews UKHackingThe SunPrince WilliamFoxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of this has been positive, some negative and, for much of it, the jury is still out. But as the first generation of social media natives start to have children of their own, there is increasing unease about tech’s impact on children. These concerns prompted Australia topass legislationlast November banning access to social media for under-16s.“So many things are happening at once,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and a specialist in children and social media. “We clearly have a silent problem of parents at home struggling with social media and feeling unsupported. We have a small number of parents whose children have come to serious harm, or died, who have become mobilised. We have politicians worried about complaints in their constituencies and also looking for a good news story in gloomy times. And we have big tech outrunning regulation in all directions.” It is a perfect storm, she says, into which discussion of an outright ban on social media for under-16s has come as a supposed saviour.The UK government has twisted itself into a torturous position: Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, said last November that a ban was “on the table”, before then telling theGuardianit was“not on the cards”for now. In January, he said: “I don’t have any plans to ban social media for under-16s.”While the UK government seems to be deciding that a ban is not for them, some big names have signalled their support. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently said of Australia’s ban, “There’s a good chance that that’s a smart thing”. The UK’s head of counter-terrorism policing said a ban “warrants serious attention”. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has said he is “broadly in favour” of a ban, but the age limit could be lower than 16.“There’s a huge amount of conflict and uncertainty in the world,” says Livingstone. “And social media seems the fixable problem.” But is banning access the answer?How might social media bans work?Thenew Australian lawsays that social media networks have to take “reasonable steps” to prevent those under 16 from having an account when the law comes into force in December this year.What this means in practice is not fully fleshed out, but an explanatory memorandum suggested that a minimum level should put in place “age assurance” tech, which might include facial recognition and age estimation. Such technology is often offered as the solution to identifying someone’s age, but it remains an estimate – and can be wrong. The average gap between what one of these systems believes someone’s age to be and their actual age can vary between one and three years. That may be a small margin of error for a 45-year-old, but if you are an 18-year-old student and the computer says you are 15 so can’t join social media with your university friends, that is frustrating.Would a ban actually work?A recent More In Common poll found thatthree-quarters of the publicwould support a ban on social media for under-16s, up from the current minimum age of 13 when children can legally access platforms. Many will be parents at their wit’s end as they struggle to keep their children safe online. “Social media has no place for children under 16,” says Vicky Borman, a mother of three children, one of whom is under the age of 16. “It exposes them to a myriad of unacceptable content, including pornography, nudity, bullying and harassment, that they simply aren’t equipped to handle.”Typical of many parents, Borman is in favour of a ban. “It’s time for us to reclaim childhood for our kids, ensuring they have the opportunity to create lasting memories away from screens,” she says.Yet even those pushing most publicly for something to be done do not believe an outright ban on children accessing social media is the answer. Andy Burrows is the CEO of the Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the family of Molly Russell, the 14-year-oldwho took her own lifeafter being bombarded with negativity on social media. “The reality is that if we pull up the drawbridge on social media platforms, those bad actors won’t disappear,” he says. “They will simply migrate to gaming and messaging services, and the risk would be that the volume of harm on those platforms then becomes unmanageable.”Sonia Livingstone also has doubts. “A ban makes a great headline and seems straightforward, but it isn’t,” she says. “A ban is meant to be a ban on technology companies making problematic products available to children, and it very quickly becomes a ban on children accessing technology.”View image in fullscreenThere are protections for children and teenagers in place on social media – often managed by the companies that run the platforms.Photograph: Deborah Lee Rossiter/AlamyWhat protections exist at the moment, and how effective are they judged to be?There are currently protections for child users of social media – many put in place and managed by the social media platforms – for example, that users should be over 13. “But they’re not very transparent or stable,” says Livingstone. Most companies tag accounts they suspect are run by children younger than 13 and put child-safety features on them, such as limits on who can message them or the type of content they can encounter. But it is not clear they work, says Livingstone, who regularly talks to children as part of her research. They say they still receive message requests from adult users.“There are some protections, but absolutely not enough,” says Livingstone. “And until the [UK’s] Online Safety Act and the [EU’s] Digital Services Act kick in, we’re a long way from getting those algorithmic protections people really want.” (While the laws have been passed, enforcement by regulators, such as Ofcom in the UK, is still months away.) Burrows agrees on the UK front. “The prime minister should be urgently prioritising, strengthening and fixing the Online Safety Act, so it works much more effectively for children,” he says.What is the evidence that under-16 social media use is harmful?If you read US social scientist Jonathan Haidt’s bookThe Anxious Generation– which has been on theNew York Timesbestseller list for 46 weeks – there is a lot of evidence that it is harmful. The book is a compelling manifesto warning about the polluting impact of social media and tech on our teenagers’ minds.We know blanket bans tend not to work, tend to be circumvented by teens – but feel like they’re the right thing to doProf Pete Etchells, Bath Spa UniversityYet, onestatistician arguesthat a good number of the studies Haidt relies on are misrepresented, and some even contradict his reasoning. The author admitstwo minor errorson his website. While a psychology professor hasaccused Haidtof “making up stories by simply looking at trend lines”, adding that his conclusions were “not supported by science”.Haidt saysthat his critics have misinterpreted his claims, including using the wrong standard of proof.Among the criticisms of the book was that Haidt confuses correlation with causation. But his central argument seems to fit with the concerns and experiences for many parents. Few people doubt there is a teenage mental health crisis. And adults can feel the addictive nature of their own smartphones. Debates about causation and correlation can feel abstract when parents face daily dilemmas about how to manage their children’s access to smartphones and social media.What constitutes social media?This is the big question that vexes those who are studying this issue. “We don’t really have any clear definitions of what legislators mean by social media at the moment,” says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology at Bath Spa University and the author ofUnlocked. Do two friends chatting to one another on WhatsApp become social media? What happens when you add a third? And does using the status update function on WhatsApp make it social?A definition has not been settled on, even by Australia. When it passed its legislation in November, it failed to detail which companies would be affected, although the country’s communications minister Michelle Rowland said Snapchat, TikTok, X, Instagram, Reddit and Facebook would probably come under the rules.What is the evidence so far from Australia and other places that have passed bans?Australia is the highest-profile country to take action, but its ban has not yet come into force. In the absence of evidence from a total ban, we have to rely on data from partial or scenario-specific bans, such as limiting access to tech or phones in schools or at certain hours of the day. Arecent studypublished in theLancetof more than 1,200 secondary school pupils found little difference in the mental wellbeing of those attending schools that had restrictive bans and schools that did not. The authors’ explanation was that school bans did not affect total phone use. However, according to the study: “We observed that increased time spent on phones/social media is significantly associated with worsened outcomes for mental health and wellbeing, physical activity and sleep, and attainment and disruptive behaviour.”“Anecdotally, we know that overly restrictive, blanket bans tend not to work, tend to be circumvented by teens, butfeellike they’re the right thing to do,” says Etchells. “The South Korea shutdown law is a good example of this.” In 2011, the country enacted a ban on children under the age of 16 from playing video games between midnight and 6am to try to head off concerns about video game addiction. The law was repealed a decade later after the country realised it did not have the intended effect, with identity theft rising as kids found ways to circumvent it.Are some of the manifestations ofbigtech cosying up to Donald Trump in the US – from downsizing moderation teams to cancelling factchecking initiatives – focusing the calls for bans?During Joe Biden’s presidency, says Livingstone, “there was a sense that trust and safety teams were building up. The regulation was coming, being consulted on and under way”. But recent attacks by the Trump campaign against NCMEC, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, a US nonprofit that is government funded, worry experts. NCMEC stops the spread of images of child abuse, and has hadits funding threatenedover its gender ideology. Overall, some fear it adds up to a bleak picture that might trigger more calls for blunt tools such as bans, rather than more nuanced measures that can make a real difference. “The child online safety experts are really worried about whether regulators are positioned to stand up to big tech,” says Livingstone. “Right now, it’s hard to reassure children, parents and the public that social media will get safer in the coming year.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaThe ObserverOnline abuseChildrenYoung peopleMental healthDigital mediaHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No wonder women are giving up on itMartha GillWhen contraception has stagnated for decades, it is hardly surprising it’s fallen victim to culture wars and a wellness cultSat 22 Feb 2025 14.30 ESTShareSomething is changing when it comes to contraception. Lots of people aren’t using it. Last week we heard that this includesa third of young Irish people. Meanwhile, there has been asignificant rise in abortionsin England and Wales. Prescriptions for the contraceptive pill in England dropped from 432,600 in 2014 to 188,500 in 2021. And this month data from abortion clinics found that demand is being fuelled bywomen coming off the pill and using natural methods instead.When the study compared contraception used by women seeking abortions in 2018 and in 2023, it found that the proportion using smartphones to track their menstrual cycle had increased from 0.4% to 2.5%. The use of hormonal contraception among this group fell from 19% to 11%, while the group not using any form of contraception when they became pregnant increased from 50% to 70%.Why? When it comes to the declining popularity of birth control, two factors are at play. One is a conservative backlash against it, starting in America.Alex Clark, a pro-Trump media personality, has called the birth control pill “poison” and said it will cause “issues with fertility” later in life. She has even suggested it can “falsely make women feel bisexual” – claims that are all untrue. And conservative commentatorCandace Owens has denounced the pilland intrauterine devices as “unnatural”. Elon Musk has tweeted that hormonal birth control“makes you fat, doubles risk of depression & triples risk of suicide”.Videos on TikTok and Instagram, many exaggerating the side-effects of the pill, gain millions of viewsColliding with this is thewellness movement, which has a history of advising people to treat themselves with “natural” rather than medically proven methods. As the media landscape splinters, individual voices gain power to persuade. Videos on TikTok and Instagram, many exaggerating the side-effects of the pill, gain millions of views. Then there are individual bad experiences that may gain disproportionate attention, giving the impression that birth control is more dangerous than it is.Public health leaders are trying to combat these forces – the NHS has warned thatmisinformation about the pillon social media, especially a false claim that it causes infertility, is putting women off. But there’s another, underlying problem when it comes to contraception: it needs to improve.Many are deeply dissatisfied with the contraceptives we have. Bad information aside, condoms fail, IUDs are invasive and can be painful to implant, hormonal methods have side-effects such as headaches, weight gain, acne and depression. Of women who take the contraceptive pill, about a third stop in the first year, many due to health concerns and worries about side-effects.The cultural battle over contraception is largely focused on whether people should abandon existing methods, or whether that is irresponsible advice. But there’s another question we should be asking. It’s common for women to be using the same methods as their mothers – or even their grandmothers. Why aren’t contraceptives getting better?There is certainly appetite for new ideas. New products are often greeted with excitement: when Lo Loestrin, a hormonal pill with lower oestrogen, was introduced in 2011, it quickly became popular. But, oddly, there seems to be little appetite for developing it. Research has centred on small improvements to existing contraceptives. There were just20-25 industry-funded clinical trials between 2017 and 2020, compared with 600 for cardiovascular drugs in 2019 alone. While pharmaceutical companies tend to plough 20% of their sales revenue back into research and development,for contraception it is 2%. Funding is limited, propped up by the public sector.Why isn’t more work being done to improve contraceptives? Part of the problem is that when you give a drug to a healthy population, the safety requirements and litigation risks are higher, which may put investors off. Worldwide, the contraceptive market is still growing, despite dissatisfaction; many women are just accepting the trade-offs. This means there has been no big market signal that things need to change.But the history of contraception reflects the culture at large. While conservative forces are trying to push women off the pill by claiming it is dangerous, it was they who stymied research in the first place. Underlying this, too, is an expectation that women will put up with significant side-effects. As long as contraceptives work, unhappiness is ignored or underplayed.There is hope on the horizon. While women’s contraceptives have stagnated, a new range of imaginative treatments is on the way – for men. One, for example, isa gel that works to block fertilitywhen smeared on the arms and shoulders, without affecting mood or libido.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2011,a male contraceptive trial was haltedwhen it emerged that side-effects included mood swings and depression – commonly experienced by women on the pill.Nevertheless, the arrival of better contraception for men could make things easier for their female partners who don’t like the options available. Innovations for men could also cross over into solutions for women, as the bar for safety and effectiveness is raised.There is the risk, too, that, as male contraceptives suck up airtime and funding, women’s will continue to fall behind:almost half of pregnancies around the world are unintended– a high proportion of them in places where birth control is accessible.

Courage is evaporating. People wonder who to trust and what to believe.Watching the destruction being wrought in the United States, many ponder whether Australia’s institutions and norms would be robust enough to survive a similar onslaught.They probably are. But few would have predicted how quickly the American system and its international commitments and standing could be eroded.Creative Australia says it won’t reinstate artist Khaled Sabsabi for Venice Biennale at tense all-staff meetingRead moreEver since federation, fear has been used as a political tool, always poised and ready to be pulled out at any moment. The official view then, according to historian John Hirst, was that Australia was “not the federation of fear, but the wise solemn rational federation of a free people … only possible through the advance of intelligence and the development of a higher system of morality than the world ever saw before”.Yet at the same time, fear was being invoked towards South Sea Islanders, Chinese and Aboriginal people, and by 1902 their exclusion from the political system became law.Fear has deep roots in a society that has fewer reasons to be fearful than almost any other, even if it is not as fair as we’d like to believe. Australia generally works, it is rich, the people are educated, it has no land borders, its democracy is intact, tolerance has long been considered a virtue.But still we are encouraged to be fearful – of others, of abandonment, of what the future may hold.When trying to make sense of why fear works so powerfully in Australian public life, the old frames of analysis that focus on polling, party politics, economics, demographics, history and even language, help but fall short. There is a need, as Dr Julie Macken writes in her forthcoming book, Australia’s Schism in the Soul,to add the tools of psychoanalysis.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“The psyche of the nation is revealed by its collective action and inaction,” she writes.“Pretending not to know, ignoring the past and encouraging ignorance, can temporarily bury fear. But pretending not to know can make us sick, when it leads to cruelty towards refugees, First Nations people, the poor, what we pretend not to know can actually kill.“Australia is a fragile, divided, anxious nation. We vote for policies that destroy the sacred core of people, of children, simply to assuage and manage our own fear. We are unable to accept the reality of Australia’s colonial violence and we all continue to pay a dangerously high price for this delusion. As for any person caught in a life of lies and delusions, our world has managed through self-fulfilling prophecy to become an unsafe place to be.”In recent years, the pong of fear has been building since a “motley group” of opponents to an Indigenous voice to parliamentgathered in Melbourne in late August 2022 with what they considered to be the unlikely mission: to break the consensus supporting meaningful recognition of the First Peoples. Five months after they released the genies of fear and envy online the consensus broke.‘Keep moving forward’: Yunupingu leads Australia Day honoursRead moreTheir slogan “If you don’t know vote no” was aspolitical scientist Allan Patiencewrote: “one of the most ignorant, ethically despicable, and anti-democratic moments in the history of federal politics in Australia … How can anyone respect people who have chosen indifference over concern, hostility over love, exclusion over inclusion, cruelty over compassion?”As always, those who resort to fear-based politics tested how much they could get away with by first targeting the First Peoples, those Noel Pearson powerfully described as “muchunloved”. Then it moves to other groups who become the focus of fear fuelled rhetoric.What we need is leadership that soothes, comforts and inspires, that helps us deal with grief and shame, rather than denies the complexity of our past. Too often our leaders lash out, or smother important questions in economic jargon and empty talk about the cost of living.As seems to be common throughout the world now but has not until recently been a feature of contemporary Australian politics, fear-based blame has become a headline grabbing tool, the leader of a major party, opposition leader Peter Dutton, who might yet be prime minister, has stoked division between the diverse communities that make up the nation. By blaming and setting up straw men, it encourages those who feel neglected by mainstream Australiato lash out.It’s a Sunday, so excuse the sermon, but we can do much better. It’s time to grow up, face our demons and create an inclusive, robust future.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionIndigenous AustralianscommentShareReuse this content"

Look no further than Gwynedd in WalesRowan MooreAs the UK government puts faith in construction, one council has lowered costs by cracking down on second homes and holiday letsSat 22 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2025 14.03 ESTShareCongratulations to Gwynedd, Wales, where the local council’s policies have lowered house prices. This should be the ultimate aim of all the housing and planning initiatives of this government – whether through “cutting red tape”, “kickstarting” the construction industry with publicly funded incentives, talking about far in the future new towns, or promising unfeasible numbers of new homes.So far, these haven’t worked. But Cyngor Gwynedd, by charging a 150% council tax premium on second homes, and requiring planning permission to use a property for holiday lets, has succeeded.Not everyone sees it this way. “Botched second homes crackdown,” declaimed theDaily Telegraph, “wipes £30k off house prices.” But I imagine that the many residents of Gwynedd who struggle with expensive housing will be delighted.Commercial senseView image in fullscreenThe Pfizer building in New York, which is to be converted into about 1,600 homes.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersIn other promising housing crisis news, the architectsGenslerare designing theconversion of a 33-storey office buildingin Midtown Manhattan, formerly the headquarters of the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, into homes. About 1,600 apartments are promised by Metro Loft Development LLC and David Werner Real Estate Investments, which own the building, 25% of them described as affordable, in this and an adjoining 10-storey tower.Given that there are too few homes and too much office space – in Britain as well as in New York – the making of the one out of the other should be a win for everyone. It limits the need to build on green fields and reduces the carbon impacts of new construction and demolition. It’s not easy, though, to turn big office blocks into multiple homes, so it’s good to see it treated as a serious commercial proposition.The lesser evil?View image in fullscreenPalace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, London, where neighbours are rowing over Jon Hunt’s plans for his basement.Photograph: Bjanka Kadic/AlamyWhat side to take in the 20-yearplanning battlebetween Jon Hunt, founder of the aggressive and obnoxious estate agents Foxtons, and the ambassadors of Russia and Saudi Arabia? The former wants to add a basement to his listed mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens, London, also known as Billionaires’ Row, in order to house his collection of classic cars. The latter, who live nearby, along with ambassadors of less vile regimes like France and Japan, objected under the UN 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which requires states to “protect the premises of a diplomatic mission against intrusion or damage”.Hunt’s original plans for the basement, 82ft deep, with a sort of indoor ferris wheel for displaying the cars and an infinity pool on the roof, have been scaled back, but its volume is still equivalent to many ordinary homes. However, although aBBC investigationonce accused Foxtons of lying, faking signatures and other dubious practices, they haven’t actually invaded countries, bombed civilians or tortured people. Hunt is controversial but, relative to some of his neighbours, you have to say that he and his basement occupy the moral high ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Helicopters in the pre-dawn sky.Carabinieribarracks across Sicily emptied, with all 1,200 officers deployed. TheCacciatori– red-bereted shock cops – brought over from the wilds of Calabria. TheCarabinieri’s own film units serving up a morning montage of flashing blue lights, balaclava-wearing officers with submachine guns, police dogs sniffing, cottage doors breaking, and burly, handcuffed men ushered into Alfa Romeos. And then, of course, in the press, thehumiliating wiretapsof gangsters sharing their secrets. Cosa Nostra is back in the headlines, and back under the cosh.Italian law enforcement is good at this stuff. Not a single one of the 181 men and women targeted for arrest on 11 February managed to go on the lam before the crackdown. Based on the numbers alone, this raid was the biggest anti-mafia operation since the 1980s. But Sicily was a very different place back then. It teetered on the brink of becoming a narco-state, and Cosa Nostra treated the Italian institutions with contempt, murdering any prosecutor, police officer or politician who got in its way.A heroic minority led the fightback. Its figurehead was, of course,judge Giovanni Falcone. His enormous “maxi trial” of mafiosi inPalermo in 1986-87 demonstrated for the first time that the rule of law applied to the bosses too. After the supreme court confirmed the verdicts in 1992, the ferocious super-boss Salvatore “Shorty” Riina had Falcone and his close colleague Paolo Borsellino killed in bomb attacks. It was a national emergency, Riina’s declaration of war on the state. But, in the same instant, it was a spectacular confirmation that Falcone had won a history-making victory.View image in fullscreenMafia boss Salvatore Riina at his trial in Sicily, Italy, 14 November 1996.Photograph: Mike Palazzotto/EPAFor the last year of his life, the martyred hero had been in Rome redesigning the wayItalyfights mafia crime, based on the lessons learned in Palermo. Specialised teams of anti-mafia prosecutors in every city. Highly trained police units. A vast database of “men of honour” and their known associates. A new prison regime designed to prevent bosses communicating with their soldiers. Since then, Falcone’s heirs have ground Cosa Nostra down.In this year’s raid, it was older bosses,released from long stretches inside, who were taking the lead in trying to rebuild the mafia’s structure. The bugging transcripts published in the aftermath make for a sullen collective portrait. The old bosses complain all the time. About the confiscation of their assets. About the collapse of omertà. About the quality of their recruits: “The level’s low these days. As soon as they arrest a guy, he turns penitent.” But these problems are not new: they are integral to life in today’s Cosa Nostra. Exactly the same complaints surfaced during the last big round-up, in December 2008, when the Palermo mafia’s entire leadership was arrested.Indeed, if anything, things have got even worse for Cosa Nostra since then. When it comes to narcotics, the Sicilian mafia is living off crumbs from the table of the’Ndranghetacrime syndicate, the noisy neighbours from Calabria – crumbs served with seasoning of nostalgia:You’ve got to get by on a slab of hash? Is that how far we’ve fallen? The guys from the old days, the ones who’ve tragically been sent to prison for life, would they be talking about a slab of hash? If they talked about hash, it was because a shipload was due in … We’re down in the dirt lads. We think we’re doing business, but it’s others who are really at it.Cosa Nostra looks more and more toothless and friendless. During this new wave of arrests, there was not a single murder on the charge sheets, and not a single politician called to account. (At least so far.) As after 2008, the Palermo underworld now faces a rebuild. But this time it is from an even lower base.Given such a record of law-enforcement success, the curious thing for outside observers is that the pessimism in mafia circles is not matched by optimism in Sicilian society.View image in fullscreenProsecutors attending a press conference in Palermo, Sicily on 11 February 2025.Photograph: Igor Petyx/EPAA good part of the blame lies with one trial that, for 15 long years after 2008, hoovered up what little attention Italy could devote to mafia issues. Called the state-mafia negotiation trial, it centred on a conspiracy theory so abstruse that a baffled foreign media ignored it. Yet it set judges at each other’s throats, and divided the anti-mafia movement into fanatical camps. In essence, the prosecution argued that the murders of Falcone and Borsellino were part of an unspeakable pact that bound Cosa Nostra to politicians and deep-state actors such as secret agents and Freemasons. In the end, so the prosecution claimed, the pact brought Silvio Berlusconi to power in 1994, and left the mafia free to resume its ancient partnership with the powers that be. It took until 2023 for the supreme court to demolish this nonsense. But by then, beliefs were so entrenched that many are still convinced there was a cover-up.All kinds of things fed into this collective delirium. The grief of the victims’ families. The failure of the Sicilian economy to provide an anti-mafia dividend. One of Italy’s worst outbreaks of anti-politics. The precocious arrival of social media populism, in the form of comedian Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement. And demoralising scandals in the anti-mafia movement, including the body responsible for administering confiscated mob properties.So this month’s 181 arrests represent a return to Earth after these flights of conspiratorial fancy. The operation’s mastermind, the chief prosecutor of Palermo, Maurizio De Lucia, is a noted sceptic about the state-mafia negotiation trial who is also professionally cautious about the future. Palermo’s struggling businesses can still benefit from engaging Cosa Nostra’s services: cheap credit and debt recovery, for example. The dilapidated prison system has become porous again: scandalously, imprisoned bosses smuggled in encrypted smartphones and held video summits with their peers on the outside.That is why, for all their complaining, the old bosses can still tempt youngsters in the godforsaken outer quarters of the city with a strongcollective identity. “Inside us we’ve got our ideals, and we’ll never let them die because we’d die for them,” one misty-eyed mafioso explained. Another put it more picturesquely: “Cosa Nostra? You married this wife and you keep her as long as you live.” Armed with such resilience, mafiosi know they only have to be stronger than the weakest parts of the Italian system to hang on, and hope for better times.John Dickie is professor of Italian Studies at University College London and author ofCosa Nostra,Mafia BrotherhoodsandMafia RepublicDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Like all such parties, the hard-right Reform UK poses as patriotic while grovelling to foreign interests, and this could be its undoing.But we cannot bank on it. The UK government must do all it can to prevent the disaster that has befallen several other European nations. If itfails to meet people’s needsand keeps echoingfar-right talking points, we could go the same way as Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Finland, Sweden and Austria.As well as working more effectively to keep Reform out of office, the government should ensure that, if the worst happens and Nigel Farage and his Death Eaters win in 2029, the foundations of an authoritarian state have not already been laid for them. But here tooLabourseems perversely determined to prepare the ground for its traditional opponents.Here are three of the consistent features of authoritarian states: the extreme persecution of dissent, the use of parajudicial measures to shut down opposition movements, and the selective application of the law. All three are already widely deployed in the UK. Though they were introduced in their current form by the Tories, they have been sustained and defended by Keir Starmer’s party.What this means is that if a hard- or far-right government starts doing what they always do – persecuting minorities and opponents, ripping into public services and the enabling state – and if good citizens take to the streets to defend the people and institutions under attack, the government will be able to round them up and throw them in prison, without the need for a single new law or statute. It will also be able to license blatant disregard for the law by its own supporters, without breaking existing patterns of policing. And Labour will be unable to say a word against any of it, because all this has been happening on its own watch.Let’s examine these three elements, and how they are already embedded. Two groups in particular are now subject to the kind of legal sanctions and oppressive policing more familiar in countries like Russia and Belarus: environmental and pro-Palestine protesters. Using a combination of older legislation and remarkable new powers in the 2022Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Actand the2023 Public Order Act, the police have been able to shut down any demonstration that they, the government or the media deem unwelcome.The measures and penalties are extraordinary. People trying to prevent Earth systems collapse have been sentenced to six months in prisonfor walking down a street; or five years for discussing a proteston a Zoom call; or have been prosecuted for correctly reminding juries that they havea right to use their consciences; or for seekingto justify themselves in court. Hanging over all such peaceful dissenters is the possibility of 10 years in prison for the remarkably vague offence of “public nuisance”. That’s more than you’d get for most violent or sexual crimes.These are among the mostdraconian anti-protest measuresin any country with democratic features. They are also the most extreme measures in common use in the UK for the past 150 years. The longest sentence received by any of the suffragettes, who engaged in far spikier actions than today’s climate protesters,was three months.Those protesting on behalf of Gaza are subject to all these oppressive laws, and then some. The police have used measures in the Serious Crime Act 2015, which were never intended for this purpose, to arrest campaigners against the genocide on suspicion of participating in an organised crime group. It’s preposterous and deeply sinister.It’s not just that Starmer’s government hasfailed to repealthese grim instruments and applications: it has actively defended them. After her attempt to redefine even mild protest as “serious disruption” was thrown out by the Lords, the then Tory home secretary, Suella Braverman, did something unprecedented: she reintroduced the measure as a statutory instrument, bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. Liberty mounted a legal challenge, and the high courtruled Braverman’s action unlawful. The Tory government appealed. After the election, Labour was widely expected to drop the appeal. Instead it hascontinued the legal fightto uphold a disgraceful infringement of our rights and freedoms.These laws are accompanied by a wide range of parajudicial measures, such asthe injunctions taken outby public bodies and private corporations, which enable protesters to be punished twice for the same crime. This means they facepotentially enormous extra penalties. Extreme bail conditions have also been imposed, which can restrictprotesters’ movements, political freedoms and social livesfor years on end.Even worse is the complete abandonment of equality before the law. Whether or not you get prosecuted for protesting is now a function of who you are. If you are a climate protester, you can get away with nothing. If you are a farmer, you can get away with anything. Even when, earlier this month, farmers blocked the road with tractors where the prime minister was speaking, drowned his speech with their horns and forced him to flee, the police let them get on with it.Thames Valley police explained: “No arrests were made or necessary. The protest has reached its conclusion and the group are now dispersing from the area.” It is unimaginable that a climate protest of this kind would be allowed to reach this “conclusion”. It would have been immediately broken up, with mass arrests and long sentences.Again, this selectivity is ready-made for the hard right. Farage has been appearing at farmers’ protests, using them toadvance toxic conspiracy fictionsabout immigration, just assimilar movements did sosuccessfully in the Netherlands. For a century, farmers have beencelebrated by the rightand extreme right as the true soul of the nation, endlessly threatened by “cosmopolitans”, “globalists”, immigrants, environmental regulators and other “alien” forces. Farmers have a fundamental right to protest, as we all do. But the blatant double standards in the application of protest law – the real two-tier policing – help to pre-legitimise authoritarianism.It’s not just that the Labour government should repeal the draconian anti-protest laws because this would create a fairer society today. It’s also because, in failing to do so, it primes the country for authoritarianism. Labour has helped normalise a far-right legal framework. What if a hard-right government sought to capitalise on that? It doesn’t take a leap of imagination to see what will happen if the two things come together.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If you’re the South Korean auteur, you make a sci-fi satire where Robert Pattinson dies over and over again. The director discusses the inspirational Loach and Mike Leigh and why it’s hard being a ‘middle-aged film-maker’Sat 22 Feb 2025 06.55 ESTShareWe are in the run-up to the release of Bong Joon Ho’s latest, Mickey 17, and Warner Bros has got the Oscar-winning Korean director stashed away in what appears to be some kind of basement storage room, with grey-painted brickwork and exposed wiring. In fact, this room could pass for one of the “gritty and kind of nasty” cargo-container-packed cabins of his film’s spaceship setting.Not that anyone is complaining. Bong, who speaks good English but prefers to conduct interviews via his longtime interpreter Sharon Choi, appears cheerful throughout our conversation, taking occasional sips from a takeaway coffee cup, while dressed in his usual arthouse auteur uniform of a slate-grey blazer over a black T-shirt. He is, for example, completely sanguine about the fact that this follow-up to2019’s Parasiteis only now reaching our screens, 12 months after its slated release date. Mickey 17wasn’t the only production delayed by 2023’s Screen Actors Guild strikes, he points out, and besides: “My films are quite complicated in terms of distributing and marketing. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how to package and when to release, because it’s a mix of so many different genres.”That is certainly true of Mickey 17, which might best be described as a blackly comic, satirical sci-fi-crime caper. It stars Robert Pattinson as the dopey and desperate Mickey Barnes, who signs up to work a dangerous job on a space-colonising mission, led by a despotic ex-congressman (Mark Ruffalo) and his unhinged wife (Toni Colette). Then, whenever one of Mickey’s assignments results in his death – which is often – he is simply cloned, using “reprinting” technology and sent straight back to work. This is a notion Bong seems to find particularly discomfiting. “Y’know, there’s an HP printer right here in this room, as we’re doing this interview,” he says, eyeing the machine warily. “To think that, like, my head and my arms and legs would just be printed out of this printer, like a piece of paper …”View image in fullscreenTaking the Mickey … Naomi Ackie and Robert Pattinson.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesConsidering Mickey 17 originated as an unpublished novel manuscript, optioned by Warner Bros – “The first time I accepted an offer that came to me,” Bong notes – it’s impressive how seamlessly another writer’s ideas have been absorbed into the director’s own creative sensibility. The mission, to the distant planet of Niflheim, is beset by plenty of Parasite-esque upstairs-downstairs discord: there’s a noirish, serial-killer subplot reminiscent of Bong’s breakthrough feature,Memories of Murder(2003), and Niflheim itself is a frozen dystopian landscape, just like that in 2013’sSnowpiercer, and populated by a species of creepy-cute beasts, not dissimilar from the title character in2017’s Okja.We all know that things are just getting worse and worse. I know it, you know it, everyone knows itNone of those previous films were made with the benefit of the three Academy Awards wins Bong has to his name, however. Parasite was a Hitchcockian class-war thriller of such elegant construction that even the notoriously parochial Hollywood establishment couldn’t ignore the achievement. After collecting the Palme d’Or at Cannes, it made history as the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for best picture, positioning Bong at the forefront of Korea’s current wave of international cultural influence, alongside the Netflix TV hitSquid Gameand K-pop stars BTS and Blackpink. When I ask how this has changed his experience of film-making, he fixes eye contact and declares – in English, for added effect – “It changes nothing.” OK, he later clarifies, the Oscars probably did help raise Mickey 17’s budget and ease along the casting process, particularly with regards to securing participation of Pattinson. “He was truly the nucleus of this story,” Bong says, “I can’t even imagine this film without Rob. I’m also quite proud of myself for thinking of him for this role.” He feels similarly about the casting of another Briton, Blink Twice’s Naomi Ackie, as Nasha, the one bright spot in Mickey’s otherwise wretched, expendable existence. “Without Nasha’s strength, this film would be so much more difficult to watch … And Naomi was the perfect actor for that. There’s a sense of purity in her eyes.”View image in fullscreenCopy that … Mickey 17.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesBut don’t these bigger budgets (Mickey 17 reportedly cost more than 10 times as much as Parasite) and higher profile, international casts also come with added pressure? Not really, says Bong: “The biggest thing [during production] was, as I’m getting older, I feel a bit weaker, and my stamina is not as strong, so I have to fight against my ageing body and mind.” He chuckles, shrugs and then adds, in English: “The middle-aged film-maker.”Bong will turn 56 in September, so he is, I suggest, but a babe in arms compared with still-active, octogenarian film-makers such as Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. The mention of these names seems to instantly take another 10 years off him: “I’ve always been inspired so much by Mike Leigh,” he says, sitting forwards in his chair. “I love his films – Naked, Secrets & Lies – particularly with his working-class characters and how lived-in they seemed. And I met Ken Loach in France a couple years ago, and he had so much energy.” He laughs again. “I wish I could take after them, but, y’know, I’m already just thinking about nap time.”The British social realists might not seem an obvious point of comparison for Bong Joon Ho, but his films do share a committed interest in inequality and the ordinary working stiff. In Mickey 17, the title character starts out with “this sort of dopey side to him that doesn’t reflect his reality”; then, as the story progresses, he experiences a dawning class consciousness: “He gets the chance to reflect on what it means to be repeatedly ‘reprinted’. And in that sense, you can say that Mickey 17 is a coming-of-age film.”View image in fullscreenClone wars … Mickey 17.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesBong Joon Ho himself came of age in a “relatively stable, middle-class family” in the Jamsil-dong neighbourhood of Seoul, where his father was a graphic designer and art professor, and his mother a homemaker. He was still a schoolboy in 1979 when Major General Chun Doo-hwan took power, and had just begun a sociology degree at Seoul’s Yonsei University by the time he was deposed. South Korea experienced an echo of this era last December, when President Yoon Suk Yeolattempted to declare martial lawduring a television address. Bong was among the 3,000 members of the Korean film industry who signed a letter in protest. Today, he summarises the effect of political turmoil on his work by explaining that the class divide grows wider under an oppressive military dictatorship. “And so, because I spent my most sensitive years in that environment, naturally I just internalised those issues. It’s not like, when I write a script, I open up my laptop and I have, like, the activist’s headband on …” Here, he mimes tying the traditional Korean protest-wear round his forehead. “Even with Parasite, my question would be: what makes them act that way? And, of course, you eventually touch upon class, but first and foremost, my interest is always with the individual and their environment.”In Mickey 17, that environment is dingy and chaotic – a far cry from the usual gleaming chrome of sci-fi’s futuristic visions. “I think new technology always brings a lot of excitement,” says Bong. “But I tend to feel a lot of fear about things.” This feeling is often manifest in the architecture of his film worlds, and the many staircases of Parasite have their Mickey 17 equivalent in the Cycler, an abyss-like incinerator chute down which ex-Mickeys are chucked, prior to reprinting. “I’m always fascinated by narrow, long corridors, and spaces that have vertical elements,” he says, referring to further examples in Snowpiercer and his 2006 monster film, The Host. “I think there’s a specific cinematic energy that those spaces give out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But Bong says his language choice is more practical than that: “Snowpierceris about the last survivors of humanity on a running train. And it would be really strange for the last survivors to only be South Korean and North Korean.” As for the strand of offbeat humour? That’s just how he is: “I think I’m really good at throwing people off; like it’s funny, but uncomfortable at the same time. I’ve heard responses like that to Parasite. They want to burst out laughing, but they feel a bit afraid of seeming rude. I think that’s just my sense of humour, even in my day-to-day life.”Does that explainTim Keyin a giant pigeon suit? The British standup, Alan Partridge sidekick and increasingly prolific film actor turns up in Mickey 17 as “this weird cheerleader-mascot-third-rate entertainer” known as Pigeon Man. “I’m so happy you asked about Tim!” Bong says, clapping his hands together in delight. “You’re the first person to ask about him!” Bong had never heard of Key until he was suggested by their UK casting director, but soon recognised a kindred spirit. “I found him so funny, smart and creative. I really wanted him to improvise a lot for the film. Early on, he gave us the book of poetry that he wrote, and I just thought it was one of the most amazing things I’d ever read.”So while Robert Pattinson may be Mickey 17’s “nucleus”, it’s in Key that the film’s spirit resides. For all its bleak prognostications about climate collapse and humanity’s future, there is a Pigeon Man-like absurdist optimism that persists. “We all know that things are just getting worse and worse. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. We keep seeing incredibly advanced technology come out, AI and everything, but so much fear and anxiety surrounds that too.” The film’s primary goal was to express this, he says. “But at the same time, I wanted to show that amid such anxiety, fear and pessimism, people like Mickey – just, y’know, everyday people – somehow get through.”Be it the love of a good woman like Nasha, a new book of bizarre poems, or the prospect of going to see Bong Joon Ho’s latest film at the cinema, we find reasons to dive back into the incinerator and reprint once more. “That’s a piece of optimism amid the suffering that I wanted to ultimately deliver,” Bong says. And, believe it or not, he’s still smiling.Mickey 17 is in cinemas on 7 March.Explore more on these topicsBong Joon-hointerviewsShareReuse this content"

Now the story of how it came to court is told in a harrowing, if slightly melodramatic, new Netflix seriesRachel AroestiSat 22 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareJack Thorne writes the kind of meaningful, worthwhile dramas that you definitely – no,honestly– do plan to watch … but just maybe not tonight. Best Interests from 2023, about a distraught mother battling the NHS doctors who decide to allow her severely ill teenage daughter to die, was warm, miraculously funny, and as gripping as a thriller. It was also so traumatising that it could make the viewer feel as if they were in actual physical pain. Before that, there was The Accident, whose matter-of-fact title only hinted at the harrowing subject matter: the series covered the aftermath of a construction site explosion in Wales that killed eight children.Toxic Town (Thursday 27 February, Netflix) – Thorne’s new four-part series – could be considered a companion piece to The Accident: it also deals with a deadly construction site and negligent moneymen. The difference is that this one genuinely happened. You may have never heard of the 2009 Corby toxic waste case, but it was a legal landmark – the first time a link between toxic waste and birth defects was properly established anywhere in the world.View image in fullscreenCleaning up … Joe Dempsie in Episode 1 of Toxic Town.Photograph: NetflixBut before we get into the shattering premise, a brief history of Corby’s industrial heritage is required. Until the late 1970s, the town was a steelmaking centre; after the steelworks shut, residents were promised redevelopment, and the site was gradually cleared. When Toxic Town begins in 1995, the so-called cleanup process is in full swing, with construction workers being incentivised to remove dusty red “muck” as fast as possible in uncovered trucks that spill the noxious substance practically everywhere.By the time we discover our two main characters are pregnant, it’s clear that the atmosphere is filled with poisonous particles. First we meet the raucous, obnoxious, Corby-raised Susan (Jodie Whittaker), who speaks with a thick Glaswegian accent (another small, quite baffling local detail is that large numbers of Scots moved to the East Midlands town to work in the steel industry, and their descendants retained the accents and culture). Whittaker brilliantly channels the kind of abrasive personality that loves making others uncomfortable, such as our second protagonist, sweet young Tracey (a characteristically wide-eyed Aimee Lou Wood), who is unkindly informed by Susan that she’s been farting loudly all night on the antenatal ward. But really it’s all a front: for all her tinderbox scrappiness, we quickly realise Susan has a heart of gold.That heart is about to get a battering. Susan is shocked to discover her newborn son has a limb difference and is destined for a childhood full of pain and surgery. Meanwhile, Tracey’s daughter is born with severe health issues after an almost fatal labour. The former’s numb bewilderment and the latter’s elemental distress are played flawlessly by both actors.View image in fullscreenSpeaking out … Toby Eden, Jodie Whittaker, and Matthew James Hinchliffe in Toxic Town.Photograph: Ben Blackall/Netflix/PA WireThat this all happens in the opening episode makes for a very early emotional climax. The ensuing legal battle is tense, yet its technicalities aren’t exactly enthralling, while the infighting at the council is tricky to follow and also rather dull. Whittaker reliably lights up the screen, but it sometimes feels like her visceral, nuanced performance is marooned in a cardboard cutout of a social justice drama. Scenes often seem jarringly functional – crucial expository conversations that take place on context-less walks, for example – while others are riddled with schmaltz or cliche: one labour that kicks off with a woman’s waters suddenly breaking on the kitchen floor (unlikely in reality, ubiquitous in film and TV) I could forgive; two just feels lazy.I must admit that spotting all these spell-breaking dramatic stereotypes while scratching my head over the curious lack of accent assimilation in the Corby youth was a helpful distraction from the heartbreaking true story behind the show. If – like me – you’re rarely in the mood to be emotionally shattered by one of Thorne’s punishingly devastating dramas, then this series’ lack of believability and tendency towards tedium actually lets you off the hook. Toxic Town transforms a painfully sad tale of infuriating injustice into something that’s just about bearable to watch.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherJack ThorneJodie WhittakerAimee Lou WoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Songs that refreshed radio, songs that lit up discos and clubs, songs that saw her called “The Queen of Rare Groove”, songs that were covered and sampled and sound as fresh today as when she originally recorded them in Miami in the 1970s and early 80s.Gwen Mosley was born in Pensacola, Florida, and grew up singing in church before marrying a sailor she met the week before when he was on shore leave. Her new husband, once free from the navy, insisted they form the duo George & Gwen McCrae in 1963, with Gwen out front. Betty Wright, then a 14-year-old vocal prodigy, brought the couple to soul singer and label co-owner Steve Alaimo in 1967, who signed them to Alston Records. After the duo’s singles sold only moderately, Gwen signed to Columbia to perform deep southern soul but, when sales flagged again, she returned to Alston and began recording the lighter, more dance-oriented “Miami sound” then fermenting in the city’s TK Studios.View image in fullscreenGwen with her husband, George McCrae.Photograph: GAB Archive/RedfernsGeorge McCrae would launch the Miami sound worldwide with his 1974 UK No 1 Rock Your Baby – written by KC and the Sunshine Band’s Harry Wayne Casey (KC) and Richard Finch for Gwen. Gwen’s account was that she wanted to help George, whose recording career had dwindled as he supported hers, and told KC they could give him a song – and Alaimo picked out Rock Your Baby. “I thought: ‘Not that one, you dummy!’”, she later said. By 1976, her marriage had badly soured. “You know when you’re hurting, when someone’s hurting you, you just can’t do nothing,” she said. “You feel helpless.” She would also refer to George as a mere “sperm donor” for their children.But through her heartache, working closely with Wright, KC, Willie “Little Beaver” Hale, Clarence Reid and Willie Clarke, Gwen cut a sublime run of 45s. Her powerful, throaty voice backed by Little Beaver’s chiming, funky guitar licks and TK’s effervescent house band (which could include Timmy “Why Can’t We Live Together” Thomas), made for dance music with emotional depth. Rockin’ Chair, with its propulsive groove and McCrae’s caressing vocal, crossed over to No 9 in the Billboard pop charts – her biggest hit. The emotive, distinctive 90% of Me Is You and All This Love That I’m Givin’ – later sampled to hit-making effect by the French dance duo Cassius – are also landmark recordings.After TK and its associated label crashed in 1981 – co-owner Henry Stone claimed the disco backlash undermined his labels and led to banks refusing to extend his loans – Gwen signed to Atlantic. Her last US chart placing was Funky Sensation in 1981 – a meagre No 60 on the R&B charts – yet she found a new lease of life when invited to Britain in the mid-1980s, where she was idolised by rare groove fans and became an in-demand live performer. Later albums for small UK and US labels demonstrated McCrae’s striking voice had lost none of its sparkle, but she never again troubled the charts.Beyond her legion of loyal British soul boys and girls, McCrae never won the wider recognition she deserved. TK’s back catalogue was not well-served for decades – Stone’s bankruptcy meant he lost control of it – and McCrae would, alongside other Black artists that recorded for the label, complain they were never properly remunerated. The Miami sound has also rarely received the attention from music historians and collectors that Detroit’s Motown and Memphis’s Stax and Hi labels have. Why? Possibly because TK’s biggest artist, KC and the Sunshine Band, sold millions of records to pop fans. Or the Miami sound got disparaged as “disco” when that genre was widely regarded as déclassé by gatekeepers. Alaimo’s death last November received dismayingly little attention.Things may now be changing, with British labelSoulJazz’s Miami Sound albums Volumes 1 & 2 being well-received and containing McCrae tunes – a snippet of a discography charged with pain and wonder in equal measure. “The only time I’m really happy is when I’m on that stage, in front of my audience,” McCrae said in 1997. “Then I’m the happiest woman in the world.”Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulDiscoPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

The ground floor space in Berlin’s southern district of Neukölln is filled with shelves laden with old sewing machines and coat racks brimming with hats, bags and fabric scraps. Even more sewing machines propped on two tables might suggest that this is a tailor’s workshop, were it not for the tangle of cables and synthesisers connected to them. Toy sewing machines in candy colours have a purple phone receiver attached; colourful cables with knitted covers sneak out of household sewing machines and seam overlockers; pins and needles are connected to microphones.Some of Simpson’s sewing machines really are used for sewing, but most of them are living a second life as musical instruments. Having spent years teaching herself basic engineering, she is converting them to synthesiser-like devices for live performance. “It started with toy sewing machines,” she says. “I always thought they were so pretty – but they were impractical for actual sewing. So I started putting oscillators and sensors inside them to use them for sound-making. Then a few years ago, I started putting electronics into a household sewing machine and it has become a sort of synthesiser.”Together with the Munich-based artists Stephanie Müller and Klaus Erika Dietl, Simpson has founded a loose collective of like-minded sewing machine musicians, Ensemble Dressed in Sound. Their largest undertaking takes place this weekend: Sharper Than a Needle, the world’s premier “textile machine orchestra”, will perform on Sunday at Munich’s Kammerspiele theatre, just an hour after polling stations close for Germany’s snap election.View image in fullscreenHanging by a thread ... Stephanie Müller.Photograph: ChicksOnSpeed RecordsIt promises to be an anarchic happening somewhere between a pop concert, a community sewing party and experimental theatre. The project was born out of Müller’s and Simpson’s shared love for sewing as an artistic and musical practice. “It’s funny, we both started to make music with sewing machines around 2004, but we didn’t know each other yet,” Müller tells me in a video call. Ten years later, during an artistic intervention programme in Munich, she and Simpson were introduced and quickly started performing together as a sewing machine duet. “At first, we only had the basic sewing machines we used at home and parts of a drum set with us on stage,” she says. Soon after founding their partnershop, Müller invited her frequent collaborator Dietl to join. Originally a painter, he also works with haberdashery as a tool for sound making – for instance, amplifying the sound of threading a needle.A concert in the city of Görlitz proved a turning point: “It was soon after we started collaborating,” says Müller. The AfD [far-right party Alternative für Deutschland] was already very established there and we weren’t sure about how the audience would react to us.” They not only loved it – they joined the performers on stage. “They were so interested in what we did and wanted to take a closer look,” says Müller. Some asked if they could have a go themselves; others had clothing in need of small repairs. What was intended to be a performance became a communal happening. “There was no division between stage and audience any more.”View image in fullscreenWound up ... Lisa Simpson.Photograph: ChicksOnSpeed RecordsSince then, this open format became a trademark of their events. “We usually have an extra machine with us in case anyone wants to join spontaneously,” says Müller. They also invite the audience to bring along any clothes in need of attention. But Müller does not see their performances existing in any kind of experimental art silo: to her, it’s pop music devoid of hierarchies. “And sewing is similar, people of all different ages and backgrounds have access to it,” she adds.This performance with the sewing machine orchestra is the largest project they have undertaken so far – around 20 performers will be on stage, working with sewing machines, scissors and needles, spinning wheels, knitting machines and anything in between. Performers such as wheelchair dancer Sema Schäffer and dancer and percussionist Ángela Muñoz Martínez will be wearing costumes that change and transform throughout the performance. “They will come to the sewing machine,” Simpson explains, “and some parts of their costumes will be sewn on stage, so it will be like we are dancing together.”The project also weaves in politics: Simpson and Müller explain that, to them, their performances are an expression of feminist empowerment, putting an often devalued form of labour into a different context. (They have repeatedly experienced seeing their expertise questioned by male sound engineers at venues). Plus, highlighting and recontextualising the skill of sewing is also intended as a thoughtful critique of the contemporary fashion landscape. “I have always loved fashion,” says Müller. “I totally get why people love to consume clothes! But I am also interested in the exploitative side of fashion and its mechanisms of exclusion through sizes and standardisation.”Joy and criticism, sewing and sound making, pop performance and clothing repairs – Müller, Simpson and their collaborators are making an ecstaticGesamtkunstwerk, one stitch at a time.Ensemble Dressed in Sound is atKammerspiele theatre, Munich, on 23 February.Explore more on these topicsMusicSewingExperimental musicGermanyCraftEuropeAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)featuresShareReuse this content"

One, titled the Great German Art Exhibition, featured art viewed by the regime as appropriate and aspirational for the ideal Aryan society – orderly and triumphant, with mostly blond people in heroic poses amid pastoral German landscapes. The other showcased what Adolf Hitler and his followers deemed “degenerate art” (“Entartete Kunst”). The works, chaotically displayed and saddled with commentary disparaging“the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil”, were abstract, profane, modernist and produced by the proclaimed enemies of the Reich – Jewish people, communists or those suspected of being either.The Degenerate Art exhibition, which later toured the country, opened a day after Hitler declared “merciless war” on cultural disintegration. The label applied to virtually all German modernist art, as well as anything deemed “an insult to German feeling”. The term and the dueling art exhibitions were part and parcel of Hitler’s propaganda efforts toconsolidate powerand bolster the regime via cultural production. The Nazis used culture as a crucial lever of control, to demean scapegoated groups, glorify the party and “make the genius of the race visible to that race”, argued the French scholar Eric Michaud in The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany. Political control and suppression of dissent were one thing; art,saidHitler’s propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, was “no mere peacetime amusement, but a sharp spiritual weapon for war”.Artists demand National Endowment for the Arts roll back Trump restrictionsRead moreEarlier this month,Donald Trumptook theunprecedented stepof naming himself as chair of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, one of the nation’s premier cultural centers, after purging the board of Biden appointees and installing a slate of unqualified donors and loyalists. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA”, the US president wrote on Truth Social. (The center hosted a nominal amount of acts with drag elements.) Days later, Trump was formallyvoted inby the board – “unanimously”, he noted on Truth Social in a Putin-esque flourish. “There’s no more woke in this country,”he told reporters.The movedrew outcryfrom performers, artists and more, but still went through. The Kennedy Center’s trustees arepresidential appointees, so technically it is vulnerable to such flexes of control, as are other federally supported institutions such as the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian Institution and DC’s consortium of national museums. Some of Trump’s cultural decrees trend ridiculous, such as an executive order calling for a “national garden of American heroes”, or the continued presence of Kid Rock. Others are more insidious – after long threatening to defund the National Endowment for the Arts during his first term, Trump hasimposedrestrictions on its terms, barring federal grants for projects concerning Maga’s favorite targets – diversity and “gender ideology”.View image in fullscreenJoseph Stalin.Photograph: Culture Club/Getty ImagesWhile the takeover of the Kennedy Center may seem less dire and court less furor than, say, hisdismantling of the civil service, Trump’s efforts to exert control over art typify the strategy of a dictator. Comparisons of the Trump presidency to Nazi Germany may be overdone and easily dismissed – even with Republican efforts to ban books in schools deemed “inappropriate”, among many other parallels, Maga and the Third Reich are not the same – but the new administration’s cultural decrees are very much a part ofthe authoritarian playbookto suppress dissent, scapegoat select groups and seize power.Pick your oppressive regime throughout time and you will find efforts to control the arts. Some of the most renowned artefacts from ancient Rome, from Virgil’s Aeneid to Trajan’s Column, were commissioned by emperors to vivify their divine right to power, celebrate military conquests and cement preferred narratives. The Stalinist regime in the 1930s Soviet Unionabolishedall independent artistic institutions, required cultural production to exist in absolute allegiance to the party, and systemically executed all of the country’s Ukrainian folk poets. Mao Zedong’s cultural revolution identified “old culture” as one of the four threats to be eradicated as part of his reshaping of Chinese society, which killed more than a million people. After Augusto Pinochet took over Chile in 1973, the regimearrested, tortured and exiledmuralists. In her 2012bookBrazilian Art Under Dictatorship, the art historian Claudia Calirman recalls how the museum director Niomar Moniz Sodré Bittencourt hid artworks and advised artists on how to leave the country after officials from the country’s military regime entered her museum and demanded the removal of “dangerous” images – a claim not far removed from theTrump administration’s fearmongering around “gender ideology” and “threats” to children.Stars pull out of shows and positions at Kennedy Center after Trump takeoverRead moreThese tactics continue in the present, carried out in some cases by Trump’s expressed allies. The same Brazilian dictatorship that overtook and blocked art exhibitions between 1968 and 1975 is today championed by the Trump allyJair Bolsonaro, who worked during his time as president to rewrite the regime’s reputation. On his first day in office in 2019, Bolsonaro dissolved Brazil’s ministry of culture. He alsohalvedfunding for the Rouanet Law, a measure that publicly supports artists, and appointed rightwing cultural figures with little relevant experience to prominent cultural positions. In Poland, the rightwing Law and Justice party has tried to rewrite history at the second world war museum in Gdańsk and dismissed its director, Paweł Machcewicz; in recent years, Italy’s rightwing minister of culture, Alberto Bonisoli, threatened to not renew the contracts of non-Italian museum directors. Much ado was made in the western press when Cuba jailed theperformance artist Danilo Maldonadofor criticizing the Castro regime in 2017, or when China’s ruling party placed the renowned artist Ai Weiweiunder house arrest.View image in fullscreenViktor Orbán and Donald Trump.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APBut perhaps no one models what Trump aspires to be, and hopes to do, more than Hungary’sViktor Orbán, who since his election in 2010 has rewritten the constitution, changed electoral law to favor his Fidesz party, positioned allies as heads of most media outlets and overhauled the justice system. And as part of his consolidation of power intofull dictatorship, he has takencontrol of the country’s cultural institutions, managing their output and enshrining censorship. Starting when Fidesz first gained municipal power in 2006, the party has purged the boards of local theaters and installed Fidesz loyalists. In 2010, Orbán took over public institutions via appointment of governing bodies that could grant or withhold funds according to the organization’s willingness to heed demands. In 2013, hedismissedthe artistic director of the National Theatre in Budapest, Róbert Alföldi, on account of his resistance to political interference and his sexuality, viewed as offensive by the homophobic regime.Trump chairing a major arts institution would be laughable if it weren’t so deeply troubling | Charlotte HigginsRead moreBy 2019, Orbán could feasibly declare an era “of spiritual order, a kind of prevailing mood, perhaps even taste … determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is the task we are now faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era.” His government subsequently banned funding for gender studies at universities and passed a “culture law” tying funding of theaters to their ability to “actively protect the interests of the nation’s survival, wellbeing and growth”, a censorship measure thatsignificantly chilledthe country’s art scene.Such a measure is not dissimilar, in intent and execution, from Trump’s takeover of the Kennedy Center, nor his new mandates on the National Endowment for the Arts, which has already beensubject to decades’ worth of US culture wars. Those wars are heating up – if history and very recent precedent are anything to go by, then Trump and his party’s efforts to chip away at US cultural autonomy, at individual and institutional creative expression, will be one of his most corrosive and anti-democratic legacies.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationAdolf HitlerArtGermanyViktor OrbánHungaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The only words on the front read “Master Operating Station”, “Subsidiary Operating Station” and “Free Standing Display”. Is any publication less appetising than an out-of-date technical manual?Turn inside, however, and the book reveals a secret. It isn’t a computer manual at all, but a Polish language edition of Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell’s famous anti-totalitarian novel, which was banned for decades by communist censors in the eastern bloc.This copy lives now in the library of Warsaw University, but for much of the cold war it belonged to the Polish writer and dissident Teresa Bogucka. It was Teresa’s father, the art critic Janusz Bogucki, who first brought it toPoland. In 1957, during a window of liberalisation that opened after Stalin’s death, Janusz picked up the Orwell translation from a Polish bookshop in Paris, smuggled it back through the border and gave it to his daughter. Teresa was only 10 or 11 years old then, but she was a precocious reader, and recognised the ways in which communist Poland mirrored Orwell’s fictional dystopian state: “It absolutely traumatised me,” she remembered.Years later, in 1976, when Bogucka joined the emerging Polish opposition movement, she decided to create a library of books that had bypassed the state censor, and donated her own small collection, including this Nineteen Eighty-Four. The SB security service, Poland’s KGB, kept continual watch on her, eavesdropping on her conversations, arresting her and searching her apartment, so she asked neighbours to store the forbidden books. Much of the time, though, they would be circulating among readers, since this would be a “Flying Library”, which rarely touched the  ground.Bogucka’s system of covert lending ran through a network of coordinators, each of whom was responsible for their own tight group of readers. She sorted the books into categories – politics, economics, history, literature – and divided them into packages of 10, before allocating each coordinator a particular day to pick up their parcel, which they carried away in a rucksack. The coordinator would drop the books back the following month at a different address, before picking up a new set.A copy of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago was carried on a flight to Warsaw hidden in a baby’s nappyThe demand for Bogucka’s books was such that soon she needed more, and these could only come from the west. Activist friends passed word to London, where émigré publishers arranged shipments of 30 or 40 volumes at a time, smuggling them through the iron curtain aboard the sleeper trains that shuttled back and forth between Paris and Moscow, stopping in Poland along the way. By 1978, Teresa Bogucka’s Flying Library had a stock of 500 prohibited titles.How many people read her copy of Orwell’s book in those crucial cold war years? Hundreds, probably thousands. And this was just one of millions of titles that arrived illegally in Poland at that time. As well as via trains, books arrived by every possible conveyance: aboard yachts; in secret compartments built into vans and trucks; by balloon; in the post. Mini-editions were slipped into the sheet music of touring musicians, or packed into food tins or Tampax boxes. In one instance, a copy of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago was carried on a flight to Warsaw hidden in a baby’s nappy.What some in the east suspected, but very few knew for sure, was that the uncensored literature flooding the country wasn’t reaching Poles by chance. It was sent as part of a decades-long US intelligence operation, known in Washington as the “CIA book program”, designed, in the words of the programme’s leader, George Minden, to assault the eastern bloc with an “offensive of free, honest thinking”. Minden believed that “truth is contagious”, and if they could only deliver it to the oppressed peoples of the Soviet zone, it was certain to have an effect.From today’s vantage point, when disinformation threatens western liberal democracy as never before, and censorship and book bans are once again turning schools and libraries into ideological battlegrounds, the CIA literary programmes appear almost quaint. Although they had political goals, they must rank among the most highbrow of psychological warfare operations. Along with copies of the Manchester Guardian Weekly and the New York Review of Books, the CIA sent works by blacklisted authors such as Boris Pasternak, Czesław Miłosz and Joseph Brodsky, anti-totalitarian writings by Hannah Arendt and Albert Camus, literary fiction from Philip Roth and Kurt Vonnegut, writing advice from Virginia Woolf, the plays of Václav Havel and Bertolt Brecht, and the spy thrillers of John le Carré.Later, as well as smuggling books, the CIA would fund and ship presses and printing equipment into Poland, so that the banned titles could be reproduced in huge quantities by underground printers in situ. Few individuals were more central to these latter operations than the dissident publisher Mirosław Chojecki, known to the CIA by the cryptonym QRGUIDE.On a Tuesday evening in March 1980, the police came to arrest Chojecki for the 43rd time. Chojecki was 30 years old that night – a tall man, with a mane of red-brown hair. He lived with his family in a third-floor apartment in Żoliborz, a suburb of northern Warsaw, and was cooking dinner for his young son and talking to his father-in-law when they heard the door. There were three men outside, a local cop in the jackboots and grey tunic of the citizen’s militia, and two plainclothes SB agents. They flashed their badges and told him to get his coat. There was no explanation. He had just enough time to calm his crying son, grab a toothbrush and a pack of cigarettes, then they clapped handcuffs on his wrists and took him down to the police Fiat waiting on the road below.They brought him to Mokotów jail, a house of terror to rival the KGB’s Lubyanka headquarters in Moscow, and put him in block III, a wing reserved for political prisoners. He had been here before, once for “vilifying the Polish People’s Republic” and again for “organising a criminal group with the aim of distributing illegal publications” – at least then he had known the reason for his detention. As the days dripped by, he and his cellmates talked politics and played chess with a set made from heavy black prison bread. He wasn’t allowed a lawyer.At Easter, when he had been locked up for 10 days without being summoned to court or allowed to contact his family, he decided to take the path chosen by political prisoners everywhere: he would go on a hunger strike. Eight days later, when he had lost 8kg (17lb), the prison doctor announced that they would force-feed him. They inserted a hose into his mouth, pushing it in deep so that it scratched his oesophagus and made him gag, and poured in a sweet, fatty mush. Tears ran down his face, of helplessness, rage, revulsion. When the food was gone, the doctor whipped out the tube and left without a word.Chojecki had not yet recovered when the guards returned and forced him to climb three landings to an interrogation room, where an intelligence officer was waiting. It was Lieutenant Chernyshevsky, an old sparring partner.Unlike the Nazis, who burned books as a public ritual, the Soviet destruction of literature was designed to be invisibleHow was he feeling, Chernyshevsky asked?“Bad.”“Do you know that there is a printing house on Reymonta Street?”Chojecki didn’t answer.“Do you have Jan Nowak’s book Courier from Warsaw? If so, where, when and how did you come into possession of it and what is your relationship with the author?”There were more questions in this vein, all about the underground press. Chojecki gave the same response to each: as long as he didn’t know what the evidence was against him, they had nothing to discuss.Realising the interrogation was pointless, Chernyshevsky brought it to an end. He offered the prisoner a cigarette, then the guards took Chojecki back to his cell.Of course he knew all about Nowak’s outlawed text. His publishing house had just printed it. It was, he said later, one of the best books they had ever produced.Unlike the Nazis, who burned books as a public ritual, in the Soviet system the destruction of literature was designed to be invisible. The lists of banned titles sent round to libraries and bookstores every year were secret. Works were pulped covertly. Allusions to censorship were not allowed. A list of prohibited publications from 1951 details 2,482 items, including 238 works of “outdated” sociopolitical literature and 562 books for children. Mostly these were proscribed for ideological reasons, but some rulings made little sense even within the bizarre logic of the party: a book about growing carrots was destroyed for implying that vegetables could sprout in individuals’ gardens, as well as in those run by collectives.Chojecki was introduced to the idea of uncensored literature by Krystyna Starczewska, a teacher at his high school. “She got me interested,” he remembered. “She got me reading.” It wasn’t hard for Chojecki to find banned books, as his parents – war heroes who fought against the Nazis – were already plugged into dissident intellectual circles. He was never allowed much time with these publications as they had to be passed on to other readers. But the fragments he read, often overnight, were enough to sow the seeds of dissent.View image in fullscreenThe Main Office for the Control of the Press, Publications and Public Performances in Warsaw.Photograph: Zbyszko Siemaszko/National Digital ArchiveIn 1976, when the government announced drastic increases in the state-controlled prices of food, workers went on strike, and the party responded as it always did, with violence. One victim recalled waking up from a beating with a broken nose and no teeth; another remembered seeing men beat a pregnant woman. The 1976 events turned a group of bookish young graduates into hardened opposition activists, and it didn’t take them long to realise they needed a public voice.In spring 1977, Chojecki decided to focus on underground publishing. He wasn’t the only pioneer of illicit printing techniques, but the operation he led, the IndependentPublishingHouse NOWa, grew to be the biggest and most successful in the underground. By Christmas they had published short runs of half a dozen books by blacklisted writers in Poland. Crucially, they also began to reprint editions of titles that were arriving from the west. The same books that were actively pushed by the CIA.By the third week of his hunger strike, Chojecki’s body was shutting down. On 27 April 1980, the warden came to see him. This was a first: he had never heard of the head of the prison visiting an inmate in their cell before.“How’s the starvation?” the warden asked.“Very well.”“Do you intend to starve for a long time?”“Until I leave prison.”“That’s five years.”“Less.”“Four and a half years?”“A few days, Citizen Warden.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Two weeks later, on Saturday 10 May, the order came through that Chojecki was to be released. He had been arrested in the snow; now the season had turned. As he squinted out from the shadow cast by the prison wall at the sunshine blazing down, he could pick out green shoots on the branches of the trees.He had no appetite, but he knew he needed to eat. He struggled round the corner to a cafe, where he bought a small coffee and two doughnuts, and sat at a window table. He ate very slowly, savouring the sweet pastry with absolute delight. People passed by on the other side of the glass.“They think they are free,” he thought.The regime might have released him, but it was still determined to prosecute Chojecki. As he prepared for his moment in the dock, it was more important than ever for the dissidents to show that underground publishing operations would not be stopped. Five days before the court date, two young NOWa printers set out on a job that would turn into a cat-and-mouse game with the secret police.The night before leaving for work, Jan Walc went through his pockets. In this line of business, you had to assume you would be caught, searched and interrogated, and he couldn’t be found with anything that would incriminate him or his friends. Next he packed a few essentials and took a long bath, knowing it would be his last for some time.He knew where to meet his partner, Zenek Pałka. The only extra piece of information he needed was the time, and Pałka had given him that over the phone. Without saying his name, he had announced that they should get together at 11am on Monday 9 June. Walc recognised the voice. He also knew what the wiretap sergeant listening in didn’t: namely, that he had to subtract two from everything, so the rendezvous was set for 9am on Saturday 7 June. That morning, he said goodbye to his wife and young son and walked out into a humid Warsaw day.View image in fullscreenDissident publisher Mirosław Chojecki.Photograph: Chojecki familyLeaving the building, Walc discreetly scanned the street. As a rule the secret police liked to watch your apartment or place of work and follow you from there, so if you didn’t pick up a tail right away, the prospects of avoiding one were good. All the same, he kept checking until he reached the cafe. Soon Pałka, a giant of a man with frizzy red hair, was settling into the seat next to him.“Is the place far away?” Walc asked. Pałka took a paper serviette and wrote down an address before burning through the words with his cigarette. Then he passed on a few more details. Water came from a well, but they would need a week’s worth of food, since they couldn’t risk leaving the job to go shopping. The printing machine was a mimeograph made by AB Dick of Chicago. It had already been delivered to the house, along with a tonne and a half of paper, six full carloads. The job was to print several thousand copies of the civil society newsletter Information Bulletin, plus some pages for NOWa’s literary journal Pulse. They would need to buy 10 bottles of turpentine to run and clean the press.By the time they’d packed all the food, they had no room for the solvent, so they stopped by at a friend’s place to borrow an extra bag. They didn’t realise he was under surveillance, and when they left his building they spotted a boxy grey Fiat saloon with three men inside which shadowed them as they walked along the road.Reaching a tram stop, they saw the Fiat pull into a side road and park illegally, a sure sign it was the secret police, and when the tram arrived and the printers boarded, two plainclothes agents jumped out of the car and ran across the street, climbing up behind them. All four men now sat in the same streetcar as it rattled towards Zawisza Square. The Fiat kept pace alongside.How to get rid of them? As they reached a stop, the printers saw the Fiat was boxed in at the traffic lights, and they took their chance, leaving the tram at the last minute. When the lights changed and the unmarked car had to pull away, Walc and Pałka were hurrying in a different direction, towards the railway station. A part of their tail was lost, but the other two agents had been alert and were keeping pace behind them as they ran down the station platform.The agents were close as they boarded a train for Warsaw Central. Walc made a show of placing his bags on the luggage rack, but as the doors closed Pałka jammed his leg between them and slipped out. Walc now had the two remaining agents to himself. His job was to drag them around long enough for Pałka to prepare the next move. The men were behind him as he left the train at Warsaw Central and ducked into the warren of passages beneath the station. He knew police radios wouldn’t work down here. He ordered a Coke at a bar, bought some cigarettes, browsed the shops. When 20 minutes had passed, he emerged and headed for the taxi rank. He could see one of the men talking into his lapel as he climbed into a cab.Warsaw’s Poniatowski Bbridge is as much a viaduct as a river crossing, the roadway linked to the streets below by a series of stone staircases. Speeding east, Walc gave the driver his instructions. Midway along the viaduct, the taxi came to a sudden halt, and the printer dived out and ran down the steps to the street below.The chasing agents pulled up behind and raced down in pursuit, but as they reached the lower level Walc was already climbing into another cab, where Pałka was waiting. The policemen watched as their quarry pulled away. Knowing they would now be radioing in the cab’s licence plate, a few hundred yards up the road the printers swapped into another taxi. They transferred their bags, left a generous tip and gave the new driver an address on the far side of the city.Around 3pm, they caught the train to Rembertów The place looked ideal. It was set back from the street, at the far end of a large, overgrown garden. The printing machine and the paper were hidden in an outhouse, 500 reams stacked almost to the roof. The paper was damp, which was far from ideal, but they would make it work somehow.By evening their small room was filled with the fumes of cigarettes and turpentine, and the sound of the duplicating machine beating out its regular, soporific rhythm, bad-dum bad-dum bad-dum bad-dum. Underground printing was filthy, exhausting work. The duplicators were old and the paper was poor. Bibula, the Polish word for uncensored publications, means “blotting paper”, which reflected the stock they had to work with, which had to be hand-fed into the machine, three pages a second, hour upon hour. This meant they worked round the clock, in shifts, for days, until the job was done.Pałka had brought along a transistor. They tuned it to Radio Free Europe, which maintained a regular commentary on Chojecki’s upcoming trial. American printers and British lawyers were protesting at what they called a show trial. Amnesty International was sending a legal representative. “A great day is coming,” Walc thought, “and we are stuck in a printing shop!” If they hurried the job, they might still be able to get to court.Early on Thursday morning they had 20 reams left to print. By 8pm, Pałka was finishing the last stencil and Walc was burning misprints in the garden. Before leaving they had to strip down the machine, wash all the parts and lubricate them.Chojecki told the court his flat had been searched 17 times in four years, on a litany of pretextsAt last, carrying 50 copies of the Bulletin, they found a taxi and gave the driver the address of the apartment where they had been told to collect their pay. They arrived around 11pm. It was crowded with people, including half the Bulletin’s editors. Walc asked about the trial. He was astonished to hear it was already over. The sentence had been read an hour ago. One of the editors had just come back from the court, where they saw Chojecki deliver an excoriating indictment of the communist system. He told the court that his flat had been searched 17 times in the past four years, on a litany of pretexts: they were looking for a murderer, they had said, or a poisoner or a thief, but all they ever took away for evidence were books, typewriters and manuscripts.“Why are such accusations levelled against people who fight against the pillaging of our culture?Officially, half of our recent history is erased from textbooks, studies, encyclopedias,” said Chojecki. It was the same in literature, where the state gave itself a “monopoly of thought” and a “monopoly of the word”. The lists of banned authors contained some of world’s best writers, he said. That was why he and his colleagues had set up NOWa, to fill the silences and correct the falsification.Reaching a rousing finale, Chojecki announced that the trial was not about the accused at all, but about “free speech and thought, about Polish culture, about the dignity of society”.Of course, none of this would change the verdict. The court duly convicted Chojecki and his co-defendants of theft of state property. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for three years. But to everyone gathered in the editors’ apartment, this was a tremendous victory and Chojecki was a hero.“Everybody around us rejoices,” Walc wrote in his account of that week’s events, which would be published in the following month’s Bulletin.Someone pressed a cold beer into his hand. It was midnight.Chojecki’s parents had fought for Polish independence with guns and bullets. He continued the struggle through literature and publishing. At times, his father, Jerzy was sceptical of his son’s tactics. “Do you think, Mirek, that you’ll be able to bring down the communist system with your little books?” he would ask. “Do you think your little words will make a difference?”In fact, the impact of the CIA-sponsored literary tide was huge. By the mid-1980s the so-called “second circulation” of illicit literature in Poland grew so large that the system of communist censorship began to break down. Poland was the most crucial of eastern bloc nations: when communism collapsed in 1989, this was the first domino to fall. As the leading Polish dissident Adam Michnik put it: “It was books that were victorious in the fight. A book is like a reservoir of freedom, of independent thought, a reservoir of human dignity. A book was like fresh air. We should build a monument to books … they allowed us to survive and not go mad.”Teresa Bogucka didn’t know for sure who was paying for the literature she received from the west, but she was aware that the Polish regime claimed that American intelligence supported émigré publishers, and the idea didn’t concern her at all.“I thought, wow, a secret service supporting books,” she said. “That’s fantastic.”This is an edited extract from The CIA Book Club: The Best Kept Secret of the Cold War by Charlie English, published by William Collins on 13 March.To support the Guardian and the Observer order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

All the while, his “pop poetry” – a blend of Self Esteem’s towering choruses and Georgia’s dancefloor bombast – was drawing an audience, first on the gig circuit and later on social media.

One bears the beginnings of an unknown organ piece on which he had started work.The library will announce the acquisition on Sunday to mark the 91st anniversary of Elgar’s death.Having made his name with The Enigma Variations and The Dream of Gerontius, Elgar completed the virtuosic Introduction and Allegro in 1905 during what is considered to have been his finest decade.Elgar: The Dream of Gerontius album review – thoughtful and acutely sensitive to tiniest nuancesRead moreHe conducted its first performance by the then newly formed London Symphony Orchestra, which had commissioned it. With this work, it has been said, Elgar extended the expressive language of string instruments.In 1930, four years before his death, he tore out sketches from one of his sketchbooks and gave them to Frank Webb, his former violin student, with whose descendants the pages had remained until now.View image in fullscreenThe missing pages will help researchers understand the composition process for Introduction and Allegro for Strings.Photograph: The British Library BoardWebb’s son, Alan, later recalled: “On occasion, he [Elgar] would visit my father … Once, he pulled some manuscript sheets out of his pocket and said: ‘Here, would you like these?’ ‘These’ were sketches for the Introduction and Allegro.”The library’s acquisition means the pages will be reunited with the rest of the sketchbook for the first time since then.Sandra Tuppen, the library’s head of music collections, said this collection was “significant for the light that it shines” on Elgar’s creativity.“We’ve already got in the library very preliminary sketches for the piece and the autograph manuscript of the final version,” she said. “This new acquisition is important because it fills that gap. It shows him putting together the pieces, fleshing out ideas. We didn’t have anything comparable before.”Tuppen said all the music in the sketches was used in the final version, but not always in the same order. “For researchers, this will be an opportunity to forensically analyse how he composed the piece.”She added: “This is the first time it’s come to light. It’s completely unknown to scholars, as far as I’m aware. It’s not mentioned in any reference books. So it will be an opportunity now for scholars to study it and to use it when making new editions.”The piece was scored for string quartet and string orchestra. Tuppen said: “In the manuscript, you can see him … writing in the names of the instruments that he wants for different sections. So he’s already working out the orchestration in the sketches.”One of the melodies, known as the Welsh Tune, was inspired by distant choir singing that Elgar heard while on holiday in Wales in 1901.Tuppen said: “The Welsh Tune comes several times in the manuscript. He’s working out the harmony. Then, at the very end, he’s got the full orchestrated version as it appears in the final work. So you really see him working through it in the manuscript.”The library boasts the world’s largest collection of Elgar’s original manuscripts and letters. It received a large amount of material direct from his daughter, Carice. She had given the sketchbook to a close friend, who in turn donated it to the library in 1984.The British Library has now paid £50,000 for the torn-out pages in a sale organised by Christie’s private sales on behalf of Webb’s descendants.If such a collection had come on to the open market, it probably would have fetched much more due to its rarity, Tuppen said. “Christie’s approached us direct to ask if we would be interested in having a look at it because they thought it might well relate to material in our collection. I identified which sketchbook the material came from.”She speculates that Elgar tore out those particular pages because Webb was a violinist. “They weren’t just random pages, because the manuscript from which he tore them contains lots of other works, including some vocal pieces. So it looks as if he particularly picked the sheets to give to his friend.“This is now preserved for the nation and anyone will be able to come and have a look at it.”After some conservation work, it will be displayed in the library’s treasures gallery.Explore more on these topicsEdward ElgarClassical musicBritish LibrarynewsShareReuse this content"

How many more lives must be lost before this tragic cycle is broken?”Yang’s question, asked in the Korea JoongAng Daily newspaper, is just one of many that has emerged since the actor Kim Sae-ron was found dead in her home in Seoul on Sunday in a case police are treating as suicide. She was 24.In May 2022, Kim, whose career took off as a child actor with her role in the 2010 hit crime thriller The Man from Nowhere, was charged with drink-driving, after she crashed her vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer in Seoul.Kim posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and paid a 200m won ($139,000) fine. She reportedly compensated dozens of shops that had been temporarily left without power after the accident.The gesture may have placated business owners, but it failed to stem an avalanche of criticism, both online and in the media.Now her death has raised concern about the pressures placed on the talented young artists who have transformed South Korea into acultural superpower: the endless rehearsing, and restrictions on everything from dating and socialising to calorie intake and online activity.View image in fullscreenA TV screen shows a file image of late South Korean actor Kim Sae-ron during a news program about her death.Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/APCelebrity gossip channels on YouTube posted negative videos about her private life, with some pointing to social media posts showing her socialising with friends as proof that she wasn’t showing enough remorse.

Most of her scenes in the 2023 Netflix series Bloodhounds were edited out, and she was forced to withdraw from the TV drama Trolley.Kim attempted to rebuild her life by working at a coffee shop – drawing accusations that she was exaggerating her financial problems.Kim joins a long list of South Korean celebrities who have killed themselves while under intense public scrutiny, reigniting a debate about the extent to which celebrities can enjoy privacy away from the media spotlight and the impact it has on their mental health.Other victims include theParasiteactorLee Sun-kyun, who died by suicide in 2023, and the film star Choi Jin-sil, who died in 2008, followed, five years later, by her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min. The K-pop artistsSulliand Goo Hara died in 2019; the 2017 death ofKim Jong-hyun, the lead singer of the hugely popular and influential boyband SHINee, shocked the entertainment world.‘Pressure to appear impeccable at all times’South Korean celebrities, and particularly women, find it hard to secure work after encounters with the law. Many are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems in case it triggers even more negative coverage.“South Korean society has become like a giantSquid Game,” said Peter Jongho Na, assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University, referring to the dystopian Netflix drama. “People who make mistakes or fall behind are ruthlessly eliminated without giving them a chance to recover, as if nothing had happened. Celebrities are under immense pressure to appear impeccable at all times”.Sangchin Chun, a professor of sociology at Sogang University, singles out a unique dynamic in Korean fan culture. “Sports stars and celebrities are essentially people you can freely attack without facing any pushback,” he said. “There’s a stark contrast – powerful corporations or politicians can retaliate legally or economically, but celebrities are vulnerable targets. When they make small mistakes, people attack them mercilessly.”Kim’s death has prompted soul-searching among some sections of the media, with several newspapers publishing editorials railing against online abuse directed towards her and other entertainment figures.The Democratic Media and Citizens’ Coalition, a local media watchdog that monitors ethical reporting practices, placed most of the blame on the traditional media for their “sensational and provocative” reporting.“Most media outlets have been at the forefront of promoting criticism against the deceased while she was still alive and encouraging gossipy YouTube content and malicious comments,” the organisation said in a statement, noting that many outlets continued exploiting Kim for clicks even after her death.This media environment creates tremendous psychological strain with few avenues for support. “When [Parasite’s] Lee Sun-kyun was under investigation for his drug use, premises like ‘innocent until proven guilty’ were not observed,” said Na.“The media need to understand that these people are vulnerable to shame, just like any ordinary person. Or maybe even more vulnerable given the high suicide rate amongst Korean celebrities.”Vows to rein in online abuse of celebrities following the deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara have so far come to nothing. Proposals that would have expanded real-name requirements for social media users and strengthened websites’ ability to weed out hate speech and false information failed to make it into law.In response, some South Korean agencies, including Hybe, which manages the K-pop phenomenonBTS, have started taking legal action to protect their entertainers from cyberbullying. Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, wants news organisations and websites to shut down comments sections on entertainment stories.“South Korea has been ignoring thismental health crisisfor decades,” Na said, citing widespread stigma towards mental health disorders and their treatment.Kim last year attempted to rescue her career. She landed a part in Guitar Man, about a genius musician who joins an underground band. It will be her final, posthumous film.Agencies contributed reporting.International helplines can be found atbefrienders.org. In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Shame about the ropey vocal affectations …Rebecca NicholsonSat 22 Feb 2025 17.10 ESTShareThe Peaky Blinders comparisons have been flying around ever since filming on Dope Girls began, so it sounds as if the BBC was hoping that it might have a successor on its hands. Certainly, there are some superficial similarities between the two. Dope Girls is set in 1918 and deals with the aftermath of the first world war, as the surviving men return. But here, it’s the women who are in the spotlight, as the female workforce of the past four years suddenly find their newfound social status has been relegated once again. In mood and tone, however, it is less a return to Small Heath, and more of a predecessor to Cabaret.Kate Galloway (Julianne Nicholson) is a businessman’s wife and wartime butcher, who falls on hard times after a family tragedy. Destitute and homeless, she heads to London, where Armistice Day is looming and the party of the century is about to kick off. With the help of a bright dancer named Billie (Umi Myers), who is as talented as she is troubled, Kate finds her way into the clubland underworld of Soho, where she spies the potential to apply her previous workplace-based knowledge, and sets the ball rolling on building a new empire of nightlife.Joining Kate and Billie is Kate’s daughter Evie (Eilidh Fisher), who begins the series at a fancy boarding school where she is bullied for being from “the slums” – ie she is not landed gentry.Little Women’s Eliza Scanlen is Violet, a young woman from the north of England taking part in “the Female Experiment”, in which 10 women are recruited as the country’s first ever female police officers. Geraldine James, who has been the cherry on the top of a strong female ensemble cake ever since Band of Gold in the 1990s, plays Isabella Salucci, the matriarch of an organised crime family who soon finds herself entangled with Kate’s new venture, and not necessarily in a female-solidarity sort of way.View image in fullscreenJulianne Nicholson as Kate Galloway in Dope Girls.Photograph: Kevin Baker/BBC/Bad WolfCreated and written by the playwright Polly Stenham, with Alex Warren, it is a theatrical affair from the off. It opens with a flash-forward to Kate, soaked in blood and wearing angel wings, frolicking in a fountain in Trafalgar Square; there are plenty of moments when it all goes a bit like a Florence + the Machine video. The first episode establishes how she got there in the first place, but as it must cover a lot of ground, the early mood is skittish and unsettled. It also includes the copious use of Heartstopper-style text graphics, to annotate and explain some of the scenes. One particularly egregious example read “Paaaaaaarty!” over the start of, well, a party. I didn’t love it, but perhaps it is an attempt to win over a younger audience.The show finds more confidence when everyone has been moved into position and the fireworks are finally allowed to begin. As Kate looks to make the most of what life has thrown at her, Violet must prove herself as a police officer by going undercover with Soho’s dancers, criminals and thieves. Both harbour huge secrets that will inevitably be exposed. It’s impossible to root for one over the other, even though they are technically opposing forces, because both are outsiders, and desperate in their own ways.‘It’s now part of my life’: Stephen Graham on shredding to be a buff boxer in A Thousand BlowsRead moreThe timing does feel a little unfortunate. The problem with suggesting it as an heir to Peaky Blinders is that Steven Knight, that series’ creator, has just released another period crime drama, A Thousand Blows, which is also (partly) about female gangs in London.It is set about 40 years earlier, but it, too, deals with outsiders creating their own criminal economy, and women who seek or possess power beyond the levels expected of them. Its energy, however, is bigger and bolder; it spends more time on the story and less time searching for a beautiful angle. A wag might argue that what Dope Girls shares most with Peaky Blinders is a tendency for all accents involved to go wandering around the globe, before settling somewhere, anywhere, in the UK. But that would be impolite.Dope Girls takes place in a busy period, historically, and crams in clandestine same-sex affairs, the 1918 flu pandemic outbreak, spiritualism and empire, among many other ideas. All of this creates a hectic, sometimes fussy scramble.But Dope Girls is in no way a bad series. Its ambition is entertaining, and it is hard to get bored, especially when the crime really gets going. If it is skewed towards a younger audience, then it certainly doesn’t skimp on the brutality or the gore: limbs are severed, tongues are removed and eaten, and you wouldn’t want to guess where a hairpin ends up. It is fun, gory and lively, then, if a little too in love with its own reflection.Dope Girls aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

But even ifLonglegs’intensely creepy atmosphere was too much, don’t be tempted to dodgeThe Monkey. This little guy has a whole new set of tricks to amuse and astound.Theo James(The White Lotus) stars in the dual role of Hal and Bill Shelburn, twin brothers whose traumatic family inheritance comes – and keeps coming – in the form of a wind-up, drum-banging monkey that once belonged to their absentee father. The malevolent toy is a familiar horror trope, specifically derived in this instance from a 1980 short story by Stephen King, then lovingly embellished with eccentric comic details. There’s a too-long fringe, an absurdly oversized water bottle and a 50s rock’n’roll soundtrack, though none of these at all ease the terrific tension that – literally and audibly – ratchets up every time the Monkey’s key is turned. You know someone’s gruesome demise is imminent, but you’ll never guess who or how.Such intricate genre mechanisms are fundamental toThe Monkey’s construction, but the film also has a heart that beats with authentic human emotion. (“Like life,” as the toy box has it.) The director has his own tricky, tragic family history: his father,Psychoactor Anthony Perkins, died of Aids-related pneumonia in 1992; his mother,Berry Berenson, was a passenger on a hijacked 9/11 flight. Perhaps this provoked him to grapple with a matter both profound and highly practical: how are we supposed to keep living when death is indiscriminate, inevitable and all around? Well, here is one intriguing suggestion.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for The Monkey.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsThe ObserverStephen KingFilm adaptationsShort storiesreviewsShareReuse this content"

One song in particular, at least:Feet Don’t Fail Me Nowseems to be absolutely everywhere. I hear it in cafes and bars, trendy boutiques and grimy off-licences and, when I forget to turn it off, the autoplay function on my streaming app of choice. The song only came out in 2021, as a single from Crookes’s acclaimed debut album,Skin, and even if it doesn’t yet feel canonical, it has at least thoroughly saturated certain pockets of the city.Which makes it all the more remarkable that, when Crookes plays it at Islington Assembly Hall this evening – an “intimate”, or intimate forher, show at only 890 people – one of theBrits Week for War Childcharity shows, it doesn’t even garner the biggest singalong of the evening. That honour might go to the understated funk earwormTrouble, about a tumultuous, toxically appealing relationship; or Don’t Let Me Down (Demo), an early song performed by Crookes solo with an electric guitar, preserving all the warm minimalism of the original track. The enthralled crowd roars in appreciation during these moments, which belie the fact that Crookes is still a relatively early-career artist: she’s only released one album, with, she assures fans this evening, another set for release later this year.I sometimes found myself wishing for more bullish defiance, but there is no denying that she can write a killer hookBorn to a Bangladeshi mother and Irish father, Crookes makes music that feels reflective of a melting-pot upbringing: while it’s mainly soul revivalism that colours her music, you’ll also find elements of dub, synth-pop, hip-hop and 2010s pop balladry acrossSkin. She has been praised for a willingness to inject her songs with political themes –Skinfeatures songs about gentrification, racism and misogyny – and despite the vintage tone, Crookes’s music presents an inversion of classic soul tropes. If classic Motown often had a mournful, bleeding-heart spirit, Crookes’s music more often captures a sense of independence and empowerment, befitting a generation in search of anti-anxiety anthems.These preoccupations are at the heart of tonight’s show, the bulk of which comprises as yet unreleased material. These songs, which largely fit the mould of the tracks onSkinwith a little added pop oomph (sturdier and simpler beats, big choruses), are frequently about top-of-mind topics for young people: anxiety, beauty ideals, toxic exes, reliable besties. I sometimes found myself wishing for more bullish defiance or abject sadness, coming from a voice so brassy and rich, but there is no denying that Crookes can write a killer hook. Never more so, perhaps, than on the as-yet-untitled song whose hook goes “You’re a killer”, a bouncy, surely viral-ready track that Crookes introduces as one of her favourites of the new batch. Slick and energetic, it’s a highlight of the evening.View image in fullscreenCrookes performs in aid of the charity War Child.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/the ObserverAnother new song, Crookes explains, is about “unrealistic beauty standards, and how they’re kicking all our arses”. The track centres on a fictional character called Carmen, who represents an impossible ideal; with its halting piano intro, it brings to mind Frank Ocean’s Super Rich Kids and the opening bars of Bennie and the Jets. Later, she plays a song about anxiety and the queasy feeling of adrenaline, inspired in part by the scene inPulp Fictionwhen Uma Thurman’s character is given an injection to the heart. (“This song is a fuck off to mental health issues,” she quips.) Although Crookes warns the crowd early in the night that she has “bubble guts” because she hasn’t performed for so long, her voice sounds pitch-perfect, resonant and full in a room that – likely not built for pop concerts – doesn’t always sound particularly great. She’s backed by a crack four-piece band whose deft, warm style is far more appealing than that of the unsubtle hired hands usually drafted in to perform with rising stars like her.Watch the video for Mathematics by Joy Crookes.Not everything lands. Pass the Salt, a recently released new song featuring Vince Staples, feels harsh and metallic in an otherwise finely tuned set. On the track, Crookes engages a cadence approaching hip-hop over a crisp, booming beat; performed with live drums, the song never really coalesces, and coming second in the set it feels like a shaky start. It’s a bum note she thankfully recovers from.Mathematics, a recent Kano-featuring single performed later in the set, allows Crookes to show off her almighty belt, a remarkable, room-filling thing.The most poignant moment comes when, bathed in blue light, she addresses the reasons behind tonight’s show. “I really wish we weren’t raising money for children that are in conflict and wars,” she tells the audience. As she dedicates a new piano ballad, Forever, to just such children, it feels like a perfect combination of pop and politics.Explore more on these topicsSoulArtist of the weekR&BPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Together over the past four years, with the exceptional dancers ofNederlands Dans Theater, they have forgedFigures in Extinction– a work of serious thought, urgent entreaty and utterly sumptuous dance around the questions of human-made climate change and its effect on the planet.The evening-long show is made of three separate works, and it was the third that received its premiere last week atAviva Studios, home of Factory International. Pite led the creation of the first, McBurney the second, and the third is credited as an equal partnership. But as a whole, the piece has extraordinary sweep and coherence. Each begins with all the dancers on stage and a question being asked. Images run from one to the other – the skeleton of a cheetah and the pinioned movements of a frog seen in the first section return in the last. The effect is one of cumulative richness forged from separate ingredients.View image in fullscreenFigures in Extinction [1.0] the list: ‘an encyclopedia of haunting pictures’.Photograph: Rahi RezvaniFigures in Extinction [1.0] the listis a mournful litany of lost nature. Pite creates an encyclopedia of haunting pictures, suggestive of the creatures that are extinct but not mimicking them. In conjuring lost animals through human bodies, the work generates exactly the state of empathy its soundtrack pleads for.The second part,[2.0] but then you come to the humans, starts with a phalanx of suited dancers in suits on chairs, transfixed by their phones as urgent events unfold around them. As it develops, the movement embodies the dense arguments unfolding on the voiceover, about the left and right brain and the ways in which we have created a society that – quoting Einstein – “honours the servant” by promoting the rational mind over the intuitive, “a sacred gift”.View image in fullscreen‘Dense arguments’: Figures in Extinction [2.0].Photograph: Rahi RezvaniFinally,[3.0] requiemexplores ideas of death and time, the relationship between the living and the dead, and the faint hope that springs from the continuity of both. With music that ranges from Mozart and Fauré to Schnittke and Ice Spice, and scenes around a hospital bed where relatives lip-sync their grief over the dying while shadowy dancers seem to represent the dead, this section is the most diffuse of the three.‘The unknowable is not nothing’: Crystal Pite and Simon McBurney on the mysteries of Figures in ExtinctionRead moreYet it is astonishingly moving in its willingness to grapple with the philosophical notions of extinction, on both a personal and a planetary level. Pite creates choreography that seems to stretch the dancers to their limits, their bodies so expressive, so impassioned, as they form into tableaux and patterns, that at one moment look like Géricault’sThe Raft of the Medusaand at the next like a medical documentary. Group movement breaks into solos and aching duets and finally resolves into stillness. It’s textured, varied, utterly beautiful.In each section, Tom Visser’s astonishing lighting, which constantly switches and highlights mood, Owen Belton and Benjamin Grant’s compositions and sound designs, which blend classical melody with the sound of the street, and Jay Gower Taylor’s fluid, evocative design all add to the weight and power of the trilogy. It’s a towering achievement – a challenge to do more, think more and feel more.Figures in Extinctionis at Aviva Studios, Manchester until 22 FebruaryWatch the trailer for Figures in Extinction.Explore more on these topicsDanceThe ObserverCrystal PiteSimon McBurneyComplicitereviewsShareReuse this content"

Is it the job of a painting to illustrate its own times, in the way that Picasso’s Guernica appears to show the chaotic aftermath of the fascists’ bombing of the Basque Country? Or does it do something more solidly material, standing as evidence of the times in which it was produced – the cost of paint, the politics of patronage, the whirls and waves of the original wooden frame as with, say, a Rembrandt? Is painting there to provoke, console, explain or even conceal the political and economic conditions of its own making?The art critic TJ Clark may not have the answers – he is all about the dialectic of claim and counter-claim – but he does have an awful lot of fun sketching out some possible positions. His writing, most familiar from his work in the London Review of Books, is famously tentative (no one second-guesses and self-corrects quite so much as Clark), yet, simultaneously, slightly gleeful in its own cheek.In this collection of 22 essays, harvested from 25 years of writing in the LRB and elsewhere, Clark starts with a bravura reading of Visions of the Hereafter, Ascent into Heaven, in which he imagines himself as one of Hieronymus Bosch’s odd little people squinting at the sky trying to work out what happens next. The figure he chooses to ventriloquise has a tonsure – so, a holy man of some sort – but is as nakedly greeny-white and vulnerable as a stick of asparagus. Tonsure-man is so keen to enter heaven that he is stretching on tippy-toes, yet Clark grants him the earthly faculties required to make art-historical assessments of the scene around him: the cherubim on a nearby fountain, a naked woman with tumbling hair who may be a reference to Eve in the Garden. Tonsure-man even remains sufficiently prissy to notice a couple who are getting handsy in the bushes, apparently unaware that their immortal souls are about to be weighed in the balance.Bosch is the earliest artist dealt with in this dazzling book, and something of an outlier. Clark’s research interests have always clustered in the 19th and 20th centuries, and it is from this period that the best essays emerge. His ostensible subjects here include Henri Matisse’s painting of his wife in a hat, Walter Benjamin’s Parisian arcades, and LS Lowry’s matchstick men. The real matter in hand, though, remains art’s response to the conditions of high and late capitalism and its many discontents.Specifically, Clark sets out to unsettle received ideas about how artistic modernism, with its privileging of pure form over narrative content, swept away the stuffy representational conventions of the 19th century. In a clever reading of Matisse’s Woman With a Hat, which is usually viewed as a bravura expression of non-literal art, Clark suggests that, actually, the woman’s green skin, purple chin and orange neck might be a truthful account of what happens to colours, including black, when viewed in a particular light. From here he makes a detour into biography – a no-no as far as critics of a formalist persuasion are concerned – to explain that this woman is in fact Mme Matisse AKA Amélie Parayre, an accomplished hatmaker whose craft skills kept the household financially afloat during Matisse’s lean years. Mme Matisse’s crazy colouring, so derided at the time by critics including André Gide, may actually be Matisse’s attempt to express his wife’s triumph over the brute realities of economic production, whether of hats or paintings. Far from being unmoored from the material world, Woman With a Hat presses more deeply into it.At least, I think that is what Clark is “saying” in his essay. If he allows himself constant doubts and corrections, it is only fair that his readers should have an equal right to express uncertainty, and an occasional feeling of having only just made it through. “Phew!” he says at one point, having quoted a passage of Proust which he maintains will better help us understand what Matisse is up to. “Is that the right word?” he asks rhetorically when dealing with Gerhard Richter’s “cocking a snook” at his East German parents. In other places, Clark simply runs out of puff and tails off with three dots of ellipsis as if he can’t quite imagine what comes next. These, then, are essays best read in a spirit of delighted, if occasionally sceptical, play.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She worked as editor-at-large atDazed, and has contributed to publications including theGuardian,Vice, Novara andVogue, where she writes the Dear Shon advice column. She hosts theCall Me Motherpodcast, for which she interviews LGBTQ+ trailblazers. Faye’s bestselling first book,The Transgender Issue, was published in 2021; her second book,Love in Exile, about the politics of romantic love and relationships, is out now on Allen Lane. She lives in London.1.MusicPeggy by CeechynaaView image in fullscreenCeechynaa performing a Reading festival, 2023.Photograph: Simone Joyner/Getty ImagesThis song came out last year, and my jaw dropped at the obscenity of it. Ceechynaa is a young UK drill rapper, and the narrator of this rap is a dominant, aggressive sex worker who humiliates men – Peggy is a word play on pegging – in a way that I feel would make a lot of men genuinely quite terrified. A lot of the music I’ve been listening to has been about female vulnerability, so it was refreshing to hear something that is the antithesis of that, and absolutely not for the male gaze.View image in fullscreen2.BookRecognising the Stranger: On Palestine and NarrativebyIsabella HammadHammad originally delivered this essay as the Edward Said memorial lecture, days before 7 October. It looks at the idea of recognition scenes in fiction – what Aristotle called anagnorisis – when a character recognises something they already knew at some level, but they fully recognise the truth and it confronts them with the limitations of their own knowledge. She takes this idea and expands it to people coming to recognise the personhood of Palestinians. I listened to the audiobook recently and was astonished at the ferocity of Hammad’s intellect.3.PlaceProcida, ItalyView image in fullscreenThe colourful houses of the village of Corricella on Procida island off Naples.Photograph: AlamyThis is an island off the coast of Naples where I wrote a lot of my book. I twice went there to work on my own – when I’m doing a first draft I tend to struggle in London because there are so many distractions. Procida is captivating for the imagination. I was watchingThe Talented Mr Ripley– since it’s the older, better version ofSaltburn– and I recognised that it was all filmed there. I took a lot of walks, and you become intimately aware of this small island and its landmarks.4.RestaurantBrutto, LondonView image in fullscreen‘Simple Italian dishes’: Brutto in London.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWhen I’m at a party and someone tells me to put on a song, I immediately become fearful that my music taste is terrible and everyone’s gonna laugh at me – I feel like that about restaurant recommendations because I have so many friends who are foodies. But what I love about Brutto is that it’s all Florentine, simple, Italian dishes. It’s charming, it’s unpretentious, and it’s in Clerkenwell, so it’s perfectly located. My friend Monica Heisey, the novelist, suggested it once for dinner in September, and I’ve become totally obsessed with it. Now it’s my go-to spot.5.FilmPedro AlmodóvarView image in fullscreenGael García Bernal as Zahara in Bad Education.Photograph: Sony Pictures/AllstarI’m a huge Almodóvar fan – I enjoyed his new filmThe Room Next Door, but I’ve been thinking recently about 2004’sBad Education. I first saw it when I was a teenager, and there’s a section where Gael García Bernal plays a transgender woman called Zahara. Now it’s quite problematic, because he’s a cis man, but he looked so beautiful, and I wasn’t used to seeing representations of trans women in that way. I love that Almodóvar integrated trans characters in quite a humanised way, especially for the time. Anglophone cinema still has a way to go to catch up with Spanish-language cinema on this.6.FashionDilara FindikogluView image in fullscreenJulia Fox in her Dilara Fire dress.Photograph: Gotham/GC IMAGESI don’t impulsively spend as a rule, but the last time I felt a little bit heartbroken over a man, I went to a Dilara sample sale in east London. They had this Fire dress –Julia Fox wore one– which is heavily corseted, and I ended up walking out with one that, to be honest, I’ve only really worn on one occasion. It was pure: “I want to make myself feel better using a bit of consumerism.” I love that Dilara’s designs espouse a kind of gothic femininity: high cinching but also hard and strong, like a warrior.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarRestaurantsPodcastsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the end of the first world war, and women refuse to give up the autonomy they’ve gained – so they establish themselves in the drug business growing in London’s illicit clubs. Kate (Julianne Nicholson) is a single mother who, by the end of this first episode, finds herself with blood on her hands.Hollie RichardsonSarah Beeny’s New Life in the Country6.15pm, Channel 4It’s the last visit to the Beenys’ Somerset pile and, naturally, “build a vineyard” is the final thing on their to-do list.

The recipient is his erstwhile best friend Pádraic (Colin Farrell). An easygoing man, Pádraic is generally acknowledged as a bit dull but a despairing Colm’s attempts to shun him turn surprisingly bloody. The civil war simmering away on the mainland is barely registered by the insular islanders, whose thwarted ambitions and dark secrets are given the weight of Greek tragedy by McDonagh. A superb cast also features Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon.Simon WardellThelma, 10.10am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereShifting smartly from delightful to distressing and back again, Josh Margolin’s debut feature centres on a spirited performance by June Squibb. She plays independent-minded 93-year-old grandmother Thelma, who is scammed out of $10,000 but then decides to hunt down the con artists herself. Co-opting the mobility scooter of her less gung-ho pal Ben (Richard Roundtree, in his final role), she pootles off across Los Angeles, raging against the dying of the light, in a comic paean to ageing on your own terms.SWGodland, 10.40pm, BBC FourHlynur Pálmason’s elemental period drama is a fascinating study in opposites. Coloniser v colonised, civilisation v nature, faith v human fallibility – these problems assail late 19th-century Danish priest and amateur photographer Lucas (Elliott Crosset Hove) as he treks across the big, bleak, beautiful landscape of Iceland one rainy summer to the site of his new church. His guide – and potential nemesis – is Ingvar Sigurdsson’s Ragnar, who resents the incomer but is drawn to his religion, though Lucas seems to care more for his camera than his flock.SWLive sportChampions Trophy Cricket: Australia v England, 8.30am, Sky Sports Main EventJos Buttler leads an under-pressure England in their first Group B match.

The landscape is interspersed with these remarkable communal fortifications, once used to store grain, dates, almonds, honey and important documents. Built from stone and clay, often in almost geometric designs, they were typically set on hilltops or cliffs to provide protection from attack. The Amtoudi granaries, Aguellouy and Id Aissa are prime examples of these historic compounds.Over millennia the mountain waters have cut deep into the rock here, leaving a string of emerald poolsOn a rocky hillside overlooking the village (and river pools) of Amtoudi, the two granaries are connected by a mountain path and were restored in 2007 by eco-architect Salima Naji and a team of skilled local craftspeople. Contact their guardians before you set off so that they can open up for you: Muhammad for Id Aissa (+212 635 49 6084) and Fernando for Aguellouy (+212 061 146 004). Farther north, near Aït Baha, Agadir Ikounka is another architectural wonder, and a rare example of a low-level agadir, the stones jutting out from its walls acting as steps for villagers to access their stores.Around Tafraoute, between these two sites, you’ll find excellent trekking, climbing, cycling and canyoning in the surrounding mountains. Tanalt is a pilgrimage spot for dedicated canyoners. Over millennia the mountain waters have cut deep into the rock here, leaving a string of emerald pools, though unless you’re an experienced canyoner with your own ropes, helmet and wetsuit, don’t attempt it.View image in fullscreenAguellouy is one of the Anti-Atlas’s ancient forts.Photograph: John WellerInstead, head to the mountains south of Tafraoute for a refreshing dip in the waters of Aït Mansour. Tucked behind palm trees, down a short dusty path, the River Mansour stretches gently out along the valley, dappled sunlight illuminating the water and making an afternoon swim hard to resist.Nearby,Chez Amaliya(singles/doubles from €36/€55 B&B) offers comfortable rooms overlooking a pool, and great views of La Tête du Lion rock formation from the rooftop. In the Ameln valley, it’s also within striking distance of Jbel Tagtout. Don’t be fooled if anyone tells you the mountain is an easy climb. There’s no well-worn path and you’ll need to take plenty of water, food and sunscreen, but the view from the summit of the valley below, clenched tightly in the fingers of the surrounding peaks, is worth the effort.For a view without quite such a slog, stroll up one of the hills overlooking the nearby Cappello di Napoleone (Napoleon’s Hat) in Aguerd-Oudad. This towering rock formation was carved out by the forces of nature over millions of years and is now fringed by a picturesque barnacle-like cluster of pink-hued houses. At sunset it’s hard to decipher where the village ends and the peach-tinged rock face begins, making it a popular spot for photographers.The Mediterranean coastView image in fullscreenThisith beach, north of Nador.Photograph: Picasa/John WellerUnlike Morocco’s Atlantic coast, with its well-developed tourist enclaves of Essaouira and Agadir, the country’s Mediterranean coastline, between Al Hoceïma and the Nador headland, is a less well known destination. There may be a few big hotels around Saidia and Nador (and within Melilla, the autonomous Spanish city that carves out a slice of Iberia in this corner of Africa) but the N16 coast road is only 10 years old, and locals dub this area “Morocco’s forgotten coast”.With isolated coves, fortress-topped cliffs and mesmerising viewpoints over the cobalt Mediterranean, it’s not likely to stay that way for long.Of all the beaches we visited in this area – Ajetti, Agharabo Yarzn and Ghanso among them – our favourite was Plage Ihttaryen. Hidden from view behind two enormous red cliffs east of Port Sidi Hsaïn, and accessible only by a steep rocky path, it’s an idyllic spot, with crystalline waves lapping against the pebble shore and curious rock formations rising from the waves.View image in fullscreenEleventh-century Tazouda Castle is prominent on Mount Gourougou, north of Nador.Photograph: John WellerThe headland that juts out into the Mediterranean Sea north of Nador also begs to be explored. There are several fabulous beaches here, including picture-perfect Cara Blanca, where golden sandstone cliffs glimmer almost white when the sun catches them. Below the bluffs, wave-sculpted ledges form a natural coastal promenade from where thrill-seekers launch themselves into almost luminescent cyan water.At the tip of the headland, a trio of beaches vie for your attention. This is a long stretch of sun-drenched golden sand including Thisith beach. Plage Mina Rosita is a sheltered cove ideal for swimming and snorkelling. And over the next headland is a wild, unnamed beach ideal for a secluded swim; we nicknamed it Chimney Beach, after the large brick flue jutting out above the waves offshore.Watch out for the Barbary macaque monkeys – don’t be tempted to feed themStanding tall above all of these, and the city of Nador, is Mount Gourougou. Reaching a height of almost 1,000 metres and cloaked by Aleppo pines, it’s a cool, shady spot dotted with ancient mosques and fortresses (though watch out for the Barbary macaque monkeys – don’t be tempted to feed them).Feeding yourself, however, requires no such caution. Take your pick from the plethora of small shacks and restaurants that have been set up near beaches and viewpoints along the coast, all of them serving fresh, charcoal-grilled fish. At Restaurant Asmak Rif, overlooking Ghanso Beach, you can order your fish by weight, dining on fresh prawns, calamari, grilled dorado and sardines in all their sticky-fingered glory (no phone or website).Small-scale, independent accommodation is still fairly scarce along this section of coast. The Motel Delta Kert (doubles £36 B&B,+212 661 376 378), near Nador, is a practical option for exploring the area, with great views over L’Embouchure de Oued Kert, a natural lake formed by the mouth of the Oued Kert. For a bit more charm, tryGîte Karima(doubles £55 B&B), outside Madagh, a small rural hotel with a choice of colourful bedrooms and apartments. Surrounded by palm trees, it also has a pool and a restaurant serving homemade tagines, harira and pastilla.Around AgadirView image in fullscreenSandboarding in the Timlalin Dunes north of Taghazout.Photograph: John WellerFounded in the 16th century by the Portuguese, Agadir quickly became a prosperous trading post, growing rich on the proceeds of sugar and spices. In 1960, an earthquake destroyed most of the city and paved the way for its reincarnation as a tourist resort. This is the place if you’re seeking sun, sand and surf; the coastline around Agadir is the heartland of Morocco’s surf scene and you don’t have to look far to discover quieter surfing beaches.Tamri and Moknari are local surfing hotspots while Tamraght and Taghazout draw surfers from around the world. Beaches such as Panorama, Mysteries and Anchor Point provide breaks and sets that will have surfers of all levels itching to get out into the swell.If wave surfing isn’t your cup of mint tea, however, try sandboarding in the Timlalin Dunes north of Taghazout. These rolling waves of sand look to have been lifted from the Sahara and dropped on the coast. Ride them at sunset, rather than in the heat of the day, and you will be rewarded with cooler temperatures and the shimmering glow of the golden-hour. As you race down the sand on your board, remember to keep your weight on your back foot and don’t get off until you’ve come to a stop. No matter how slowly your board feels to be moving, if you jump off too soon you’ll end up eating sand in front of a milling crowd.View image in fullscreenTamri beach, a surfing hotspot in Agadir.Photograph: John WellerInland from Agadir there are mountains, ruins and less-trodden paths to explore. As its name suggests, Paradise Valley is an idyll for soft adventure-seekers. Carving through a mountain gorge, the Tamraght river is fringed with gentle hikes, cafes and swimming spots. One of the latter, the Family Pool, has deeper and shallower sections – ideal for families with young children (to get there follow the P1001 inland from Tamraght for 17 miles (27km) to a large car park and follow the path down to the river). For thrill-seekers looking for a bit more than a dip, a natural pool further upriver provides eight- and 10-metre jump spots. Watch daredevils jump, dive and backflip into the emerald water while you work up the courage to join them.Behind Taghazout beach,Teddy Pirate(dorm beds €30) is a B&B, co-working space and surf camp. Offering dorms, private rooms and a sauna, it’s decorated in a harmonic mix of Italian and Moroccan styles, with a large terrace for morning yoga, sunset views over the waves, and home-cooked pancakes and freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast.For those with their own camper van or a tent,Camping Aourir(tents from £8 a night for two) is a rustic campsite up in the hills, about 20 minutes’ drive from Agadir. There are great views towards the mountains and Paradise Valley (guided walks and other activities can be arranged), and with a swimming pool and a restaurant serving homemade harira soup and Beldi-style lamb couscous on site, it’s a soothing place to spend a few days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Its mix of chalets and suites give a taste of Moroccan living, and many guests book in for the food alone – grilled meats, fat local olives and just-baked flatbreads.The SaharaView image in fullscreenThe golden dunes of Erg Chebbi, close to the border with Algeria. Dayet Srij, a lake that runs dry in summer, lies beyond.Photograph: John WellerUntil the 14th century, Sijilmassa was the northern terminus of the western trans-Sahara trade route, along which caravans of merchants would bring gold from sub-Saharan Africa to trade. Today, this once-mighty city is a humble archaeological site just off the N13, the national highway that links this south-eastern corner of Morocco to the north. It’s not so much Amazigh caravans stopping off there today as cars heading south, shuttling tourists from Meknes and Fez to the village of Merzouga.A little way south of Sijilmassa, Merzouga is perched at the edge of the Sahara’s shifting sands and has become one of the main desert hubs for travellers. The drive there entails a dramatic journey over high mountains and remote river valleys, a panorama outshone only by the view at the end of the road: the soaring dunes of Erg Chebbi stand in saffron-coloured splendour on the horizon, their cartoonish contours mirroring the rocky peaks that mark Morocco’s border with Algeria. Climb to the top of the 150-metre-high dunes after the winter rains and you can gaze down on to Dayet Srij, sometimes dubbed Merzouga Lake, a watering hole frequented by a colony of flamingos and occasional camel herders.Gnawa music, characterised by chanting, jumping and clacking, forms a rich, rhythmical soundtrack to any journey to MoroccoThe big draw of this region, however, is the chance to sleep out among the dunes. AtBeldi Camp(€120 a night for two half-board plus Jeep and camel ride), a small cluster of tents on the fringes of the Erg Chebbi dunes, the accommodation comes with private showers and toilets, but it’s the chance to stargaze or watch the sunrise over a sea of cinnamon sand that’s the real luxury.For desert culture of a different kind, the nearby village of Khamlia is home to a collective of Gnawa musicians, the descendants of enslaved nomads who migrated to Khamlia from Sudan, Mali and Niger. Gnawa music, characterised by chanting, jumping and clacking, forms a rich, rhythmical soundtrack to any journey to Morocco but Khamlia’s Dar Gnawa cultural centreis one of the best places to hear it. Just across the road is the inspiring Galerie Chez Les Artistes. A gallery and cafe run by Khamlia native Lahcen Mahmoudi and his wife Johanna, Chez Les Artistes showcases art made from upcycled and found materials, and serves a mean coffee.View image in fullscreenLone ranger … a Saharan camel.Photograph: John WellerThe ability of the Sahara’s sweeping sandscapes to inspire the imagination is brought into even sharper perspective, however, by Hannsjörg Voth’s three striking sculptural installations, rising from the horizon north of Merzouga. Himmelstreppe, Spirale d’Or and La Cité d’Orion merge art, nature, astronomy and architecture to dazzling effect, though you’ll need a 4x4 and driver to reach them (email Hassan: contact@desertrip.com).After pondering the universe, bring yourself back down to earth with a visit to the Gara Medouar, on the outskirts of nearby Rissani. Used as a backdrop in films such as James Bond’s Spectre and 1999’s The Mummy, this horseshoe-shaped limestone outcrop was fortified in the 11th century to protect the trans‑Saharan trade routes. A crater‑like bulk emerging ethereally from the desert, the rock is pierced by a single track. Follow this up to a summit for a final long-distance panorama of the Sahara.The Rif mountainsView image in fullscreenOued El Kannar pools.Photograph: John WellerThe Rif mountains, in northern Morocco, are a beacon for nature lovers and adventure seekers. Forested slopes cascade down to bright verdigris river pools, towering waterfalls and reed-lined lakes, while national parks such as Talassemtane and Bouhachem have some dramatic treks within their stony grasp.Start at the God’s Bridge, a span of red rock in Talassemtane national park. Towering 25 metres above the Oued Farda river, this natural arch was formed over millennia as the river flowed underground, slowly carving an opening in the rock from below. It’s a six-hour round-trip hike to the top fromthe Akchour waterfalls, but the area is ribboned with narrow trails, rocky paths and quaint wooden bridges, many of them leading past idyllic swimming spots. The waterfalls are a highlight, with family-friendly swimming holes plus jumping spots for the intrepid; the most famous is the Grand Cascade, a 100-metre chute that plunges into a clear, turquoise basin.There are also several wild swimming spots along the nearby Oued Laou, including the secluded green waters of Baofa, reached via a steep rocky path, and the more accessible pools of Oued Laou Familial, a gentle river beach that’s popular with families. Further south-east, the Oued El Kannar provides a deluge of deep-blue pools in which to swim and dive.As you journey through the Rif mountains, stop for a revitalising glass of sweet mint tea at Café Karim (on the N2 road), soaking up panoramic views over Embalse de la Palmera lake. Alternatively, take a road trip into the mountains from Tétouan and gaze back at the city’s Lego-like formations of white houses from Al-Khanoos viewpoint as clouds cascade off the surrounding mountain peaks in the evening sun.View image in fullscreenGod’s Bridge in Talassemtane national park.Photograph: John WellerOn the outskirts of the city lies Tamuda, an Amazigh city founded in the third century BC. Looking back at the modern city from here, you can view it framed, improbably, by Tamuda’s ancient arches. Thirty minutes’ drive south are the natural pools of Ain Zarka, popular with local families on summer days; get there early to avoid the crowds.The obvious place to stay in the Rif mountains is the blue-hued mountain village of Chefchaouen.In the heart of its medina,Riad Bin Souaki(doubles from £34) is decorated in traditional style, with mosaic tiling and carved wooden doors.Eat a hearty Moroccan breakfast on the rooftop terrace before going in search of wilder adventures. Or your next meal – the Fromagerie Chefchaouen (on the N2 below the village) sells delicious local cheeses made from the milk of goats grazed on pastures rich in native aromatic and medicinal plants.For a more back-to-nature experience, the Gîte d’Étape Oued Kannar (doubles from £66 a night including breakfast and dinner, +212 660 970567)is near the Oued El Kannar pools, and overlooks a sweep of mountains and velvety green valleys. A basic hotel with three rooms of four, five and six beds – and hot showers – its highlights include stargazing from the roof terrace and great food cooked by owner Nuredin – including lentil stew with fresh soft cheese.Wild Guide:Moroccois published by Wild Things Publishing on 1 March (£18.99).

There’s a famous dish from there called bagna cauda. It’s a meeting of the garlic from the area of Piedmont, the mountains, with the anchovies coming from the sea in Liguria. It’s a very simple dish, a bit like a broth, perfect in winter, and you eat it with raw vegetables of the season. But there’s so much garlic in it that, when you eat it, you need a couple of days away from other people.There is a connectionbetween how you eat and how you make music:the way you blend the elements that you eat, the colours, it’s similar to composing a piece of music. If I take my solo piano repertoire, I would associate it with a very simple food, with few elements and few colours, not overelaborate. If I think of a piece of mine with more instruments, more orchestral, I would associate it with a dish, maybe a soup, that is made of different elements that were cooked for hours, and you can taste the different layers and ingredients in your mouth.I’m a maniac about hot peppers,the red ones. I am very happy that in March I’m going to India, where I can expand my collection.If I had to choose, I would go to a local pub in the UK with a fireplace and a lady that has prepared a stewMy father was a publisher.Every Wednesday they had a meeting in the publishing house and he would bring home some writers – sometimes important writers like Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Primo Levi. When I was about 16 years old, I was alone for a few months with my father, and he would call me at 5pm on Wednesdays and say, “Tonight, we are six!” And after a few months of experimenting, I was able to prepare a dinner for six, eight people. I learned a lot in those years. And it was nice to have those intellectuals coming there and saying, “We love this.”In general, I like more simple food,the local food and traditional food, more than the 10 stars.I’ve been to incredible restaurants, but if I had to choose, I would go, for example, to a local pub in the UK, where you have the fireplace and there’s a lady that has prepared a stew that is beautiful. I like more that style.My family produces wine in Piedmont.My grandfather bought some land at the end of the 19th century. Everybody in the area was making wine, but he was the first one to bottle a specific wine called dolcetto that, before him, you could only buy in big amounts. It started as a little winery, but now is quite big, and it’s very well respected. Every year it’s a different taste, and that is very beautiful. It’s a very special connection that you have with the land, with the wine that comes from there; waiting for the harvest and hoping that it doesn’t rain.I have quite a collection of teas now.I keep buying new, different flavours to try. My favourite, which I have almost every morning, is an assam from Fortnum & Mason that’s from a little garden called Dikom. Then I also like very much the greens, and Oolong from China, specifically tieguanyin, that’s very good for working, for concentration, for your brain.I enjoy very muchbuying different pans. Sometimes when I finish work and I don’t know what to do, I go to a certain shop and buy a new pan, and I’m very happy. I imagine all the food that I can cook in it.My favourite thingsFoodI have to say bagna cauda. When you are in the countryside, it’s beautiful to have it. It’s very tasty and very specific, and I love it.DrinkI will go for tea. Even though I like wine, at this time of my life, tea gives me the same wide range of tastes that I can have with wine, but without alcohol.Place to eatThe last time I was in London, there was a fantastic vegan restaurant called Farmacy in Notting Hill. It had an estate in the countryside where they produced all the vegetables that you could eat there. It’s closed now, unfortunately, but I think they would like to reopen.Dish to makeLast year I bought a Moroccan tagine and I very much enjoy making a tagine with vegetables or sometimes with fish and all the proper spices, like turmeric. Then, of course, my selection of hot chillies.Ludovico Einaudi’s new album The Summer Portraits (Decca) is out now. He tours the UK and Ireland from 30 June.

A lot of the ingredients may well be in your cupboard already, so possibly just a trip to the butcher will be required a few days before you want to make it and ask them to order some pig cheeks for you. This indulgent plateful is a real favourite in our house, and will both please the family and impress guests.Honey- and Marmite-glazed pig cheeks (pictured top)It’s best to make this the day before, then reheat gently.Prep20 minChill2 hr+Cook3 hr 30 minServes41 tbsp vegetable oil8 pigcheeks(about 100g each), or 800g collar of pork cut into 8 pieces1 white or brown onion, peeled and roughly chopped1 large carrot, trimmed, peeled and split in half lengthways1 medium leek, white part only, outer leaf peeled off and discarded, the rest split in half lengthways1 stick celery, trimmed and split in half lengthways1 garlic clove, peeled and left whole2 cloves1 star anise5 black peppercorns1 bay leaf2 sprigs fresh thymeAbout 1½ litreschicken stock, plus 100ml extra to finish50ml honey50ml MarmiteHeat the oil in large, heavy-based frying pan, then sear the pig cheeks all over, until nicely browned.Put the seared meat in a large casserole dish for which you have a lid, then add the onion, carrot, leek, celery, garlic, cloves, star anise, peppercorns, bay leaf and thyme. Pour over enough stock just to cover the contents of the pot – you may not need all of it – then bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook for three hours, until the meat is very tender; if you prefer, slow-roast the meat in a 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3 oven for two to two and a half hours.Lift the pig cheeks out of the pot, then put them in a dish, cover and chill in the fridge overnight, or for long enough that they are completely chilled, so give them at least two hours (you want the glaze to stick to them when you come to finishing off the dish, and if the cheeks are still warm when you do so, they will fall apart). Pass the rest of the mix through a sieve into a clean pan, then reduce it slowly, until the flavour is deep but before it becomes too salty – so taste and taste some more. Strain again, this time through a fine sieve, leave to cool, then cover and chill alongside the cheeks.When you’re ready to eat, put the honey, Marmite and the extra 100ml stock in a wide saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to make sure they’re all well combined. Turn down the heat, add the pig cheeks and gently baste in the Marmite mix until well glazed and warmed through.Serve at once with the celeriac and potato dauphinoise below and the reheated reduced sauce.Celeriac and potato dauphinoiseView image in fullscreenJosh Eggleton’s celeriac and potato dauphinoise.Again, this also benefits from being made ahead of time and reheated on the day.Prep15 minInfuse10 min+Chill/pressUp to 12 hrCook1 hrServes4300g maris piper potatoes, peeled and finely sliced (on a mandoline, ideally)300g celeriac, peeled and finely sliced (again, on a mandoline, ideally)400ml double cream300ml whole milk2 pinches ground nutmeg1 garlic clove, peeled and mincedSalt and pepperPut the sliced potatoes and celeriac in a bowl of cold water. Put the cream, milk, nutmeg, garlic and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a large saucepan and bring slowly to a boil. Take off the heat and leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Drain the potatoes and celeriac, then layer them in overlapping slices in a small oven dish lined with baking paper.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Pour enough of the cream mixture over the potatoes and celeriac to cover, then bake for 45 minutes, until slightly golden on top and cooked through (test for doneness with the tip of a small sharp knife). Take out of the oven and leave to cool.Once the gratin has cooled, cover with clingfilm or similar, then weigh it down with a heavy object, such as another oven dish, that will fit neatly on top, then put in the fridge to press for up to 12 hours.When you’re ready to serve, gently reheat the dauphinoise in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 15 or so minutes. Divide into four portions and serve immediately.Josh Eggleton is chef/owner ofthe Pony groupin Chew Magna, SomersetExplore more on these topicsWinter food and drinkPorkFoodMain courseSide dishesMeatVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Which is to say, I have history with this dish. It feels familiar, comforting and overwhelmingly wholesome, yet I don’t often eat it these days, not least because I’ve never found one commercially that makes any welfare claims for the chicken concerned (and I’m generally too cheap to make it myself).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So I was quite excited about this particular taste test – and perhaps inevitably disappointed that even the most expensive samples gave so little information about the provenance of their meat. That said, with a handful of exceptions, the standard was pretty high flavour-wise, and Aldi, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all at least note that they use British chicken, which is a start.For me, chicken and vegetable soup suggests a chunky broth, rather than a creamy puree, but both types are represented here and have their merits in the comfort department – though, personally, having been reminded how much I like the stuff, I’m now more inclined to make my own. Should you be less fussy, you’ll find some decent alternatives below.The best supermarket chicken soupBest all-rounderWaitrose hearty chicken & vegetable brothView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 600g at Waitrose★★★★★Attractive looking and bursting with both vegetables (I liked the sweetness of the peas more than the overcooked spinach) and meat. It has a distinctly chickeny flavour, but I’d like to know where it came from. This one feels like it’s doing me good.Best bargainCo-op chicken & vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£2.45 for 600g at Co-op★★★★☆Generous British chicken content (though I’d prefer pieces of leg to dry strands of breast). In common with many of the soups tested, the base tastes more of vegetables – of which, to be fair, there is a great range: potato, carrot, cabbage, onion, peas, leek, swede, celery and parsnip. Commendably clean ingredients list.Best splurgeCully & Sully chicken & vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£2.40 for 400g at Ocado£2.40 for 400g at Tesco★★★★★This feels more like a soup that you might serve in little cups at a dinner party than something you’d microwave for lunch. Oddly, it has the lowest chicken content of all those I try (again, origin unspecified), and I’d have preferred them to leave the pieces out of the silky, creamy base. But this has a full flavour, and is sweet with root vegetables, savoury with alliums and rich with cream and butter. Delicious.And the rest …M&S chunky chicken and root vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 600g at Ocado★★★★☆The base is comfortingly creamy, but it always feels odd to me to find bits in a thick puree. Nice pieces of chicken thigh, though, and a sweet, soothing root-vegetable flavour.Yorkshire Provender roast chicken with traditional vegetables soupView image in fullscreen£2.58 for 560g at Asda£3.45 for 560g at Sainsbury’s★★★★☆This has a winningly chunky, almost-homemade feel, with generous hunks of vegetable and chicken, and a pronounced, pleasing taste of green leek. The chicken is more of a texture than a flavour, and weirdly, though Yorkshire Provender proudly declares it sources its parsley from Yorkshire (from May to October), there’s no mention of the meat’s provenance.

It’s tasty enough, but with no particularly distinctive flavour. Inoffensive, but unmemorable.New Covent Garden Soup Co classic chickenView image in fullscreen£2.20 for 560g at Sainsbury’s£2.20 for 560g at Tesco★★★☆☆I’d describe this more as a potato soup with pieces of chicken, which is no bad thing – I love a starchy spud soup. This one’s a bit salty, though, and if you’re going to include bits in there, it would be nice to have some other, sweeter vegetables along with the chicken. But I can imagine this might hit the spot if I was feeling under the weather.Tesco chicken & vegetable soupView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 600g at Tesco★☆☆☆☆A bit flat – more like underseasoned vegetable stock than chicken, which is a shame, given that the meat came all the way from Thailand to end up in this faintly disappointing soup. I like the chewy pearl barley, though.Sainsbury’s chicken & vegetable brothView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 600g at Sainsbury’s★☆☆☆☆The star is for using British chicken at this price point, although the strands are so small that they’re difficult to pick out, both in the bowl and from my teeth afterwards. What with that, the small pieces of vegetable and the murky rags of kale (leafy greens don’t really lend themselves to being reheated), it’s not very exciting to look at or eat; more like vegetable cooking water than stock.Morrisons chicken & vegetable brothView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 600g at Morrisons£2 for 600g at Amazon★☆☆☆☆Although this describes itself as a broth, it’s more stew-like, with the peculiarly gloopy consistency of a bad Chinese chicken soup. “Even the carrots don’t taste of anything, which is quite a skill,” observes one friend disconsolately. On the plus side, I like the pearl barley, the list of veg and the fact that they’ve used juicy (British!) chicken thigh.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe FilterSoupChickenVegetablesMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The most delicate of vegetables, such as peas, are picked at peak ripeness, plunged briefly in vinegar, then stored in oil to preserve them until desired. I’ll admit that my recipe wantonly uses frozen petit pois, which are then in part pickled and in part whizzed up to make a stock in which to cook the orzo; nevertheless, eating it brings its own warm and welcome Italian sunshine to my English kitchen in cold, dark February.Peazotto with pickled peasThis dish uses a decent amount of extra-virgin olive oil to add richness and flavour to the orzo (as well as to preserve the peas), but it is expensive, so you could use less, if you wish. You’ll need a blender to make the pea stock.Prep15 minCook45 minServes4380g frozen petit pois10 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve8 tbsp lemon juiceFine sea salt andcoarse ground black pepper1 medium white onion, peeled and diced4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or minced2 tsp dried mint400g orzo20g nutritional yeastPut 300g of the peas in a heatproof bowl and the other 80g in a second bowl, then pour boiling water over both, leave for three minutes, and drain separately.Pour six tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil over the 80g bowl of blanched peas, add six tablespoons of lemon juice and a teaspoon of salt, stir to combine and put to one side. Tip the larger bowl of blanched peas into a blender or food processor, add 100ml water and blitz smooth.Heat all the remaining oil in a large saute pan for which you have a lid, add the onion and a teaspoon and a half of salt, and cook, stirring, on a low to medium heat for about 10 minutes, until browning, soft and sweet.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Stir in the garlic, cook for a couple of minutes, then stir in the dried mint and the pasta. Add 700ml cold water, cover the pan and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, and cook, still covered and stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes, until the orzo is tender.Stir in the pea puree, nutritional yeast, the remaining two tablespoons of lemon juice and a half-teaspoon of ground black pepper; if the mix seems quite stiff, stir in warm or hand-hot water to loosen (I added 150ml). Cook, stirring, for two minutes more, then take off the heat.Distribute the peazotto between four plates or shallow bowls. Make an indentation in the centre of each serving, fill each of these with a quarter of the pickled peas and a couple of spoonfuls of their lemony olive oil, and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe new veganVegetablesFoodPastaMain coursePickling, fermenting and preservingrecipesShareReuse this content"

This stew of creamy white beans cooked slowly with pork and cured meat is traditionally made withfabes de la Granja(orjudionbeans),morcilla (Spanish black pudding), chorizo andlacón(cured pork shoulder, and similar to pancetta); it’s also the perfect dish for using up leftover roast pork.Fabada Asturiana, or smoky pork and bean stewMeat bones are packed with incredible flavour and nutrition, so I always save them, along with cooking juices and fat, in the freezer to create dishes such as this glorious Spanish stew – leftover ribs, chop bones, ham hocks or roast pork shoulder, together with any fat, will all work beautifully here.In 2016, I went to afiesta de matanzain northern Spain with my friend, the cook Oliver Rowe – the term translates literally to “the slaughter festival”, and it’s an annual village event where a pig is slaughtered and butchered fromnose to tail. While it’s admittedly a bit gory and hard to watch, it is nevertheless a respectful, community-focused ritual that helps people connect to the origin of their food, and just witnessing proceedings made me reflect deeply on how I want to live and eat.Fresh, honest ingredients, grown locally and sustainably, taste as they should – vibrant, flavourful and alive. By contrast, mass-produced foods, which are designed primarily for shelf life rather than enjoyment, are often stripped of many nutrients and much of their flavour. By adopting root-to-fruit principles, I’ve found myself eating better, wasting less and rediscovering the joy of truly good food – dishes like fabada, in which every ingredient is respected and celebrated.Serves4500g dried white beans– for example, fabes de la granja, cannellini or butter beansLeftover roast pork (bones, fat and meat), or the remains of cooked pork chops, or leftover cooked knuckle or ham hock bone, or any saved roast pork bones100g pancetta, or bacon (optional)100g morcilla, or black pudding (optional)2cooking chorizos, or 100g dried chorizo, sliced (optional)1 onion, peeled and halved4 large garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp smoked or sweet paprika4 tbsp olive oilA few saffron strands(optional)Soak the beans in cold water overnight. The next day, drain, then put in a pot and add fresh cold water to cover them by about 4cm. Nestle any saved leftover pork meat, fat and bones in among the beans, then do the same with other optional pork, such as a piece each of pancetta (or bacon lardons) and morcilla (or black pudding), and the whole cooking chorizos (or sliced dried chorizo).Add the onion, garlic, paprika and olive oil, then bring slowly up to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, skim off any foam, then leave to cook gently for an hour to an hour and a half, until the beans are tender; if need be, add a splash of cold water as necessary to keep the liquid just above the beans.Once the beans are soft, grind the saffron, if using, in a mortar (or just add the stamens to the pot whole), then cook on a very low heat for another 30 minutes. Season to taste, then cover and leave to rest for up to an hour. Lift out the meats, including any fat, cut into bite-size pieces, stir back into the beans and serve warm topped with a drizzle of good olive oil and crusty bread alongside.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkWaste notStewFoodFood wastePorkMeatSausagesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
