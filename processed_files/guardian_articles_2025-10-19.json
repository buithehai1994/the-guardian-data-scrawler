Here is where your numbers should be, and how to change them for the betterPhil DaoustSun 19 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 13.39 EDTShareThe older you get, and the more obsessed with your health, the more it feels as if life comes down to numbers:how many more years you can expect; your lean body mass; your percentage of visceral fat;how dense your bones are; how many kilos you can squat; how long you candeadhang; how oftenyou stilldo it; your levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol; your resting heart rate; your overnight blood oxygen level; how quickly you can run; how many steps you do in a day; how many hours you sleep; how fast you are shrinking; how often you get up to pee.I sayyou, of course, but what I mean isme. I fixate on all those things and more. Do you want to know my vascular age as calculated by my smart scales? I will tell you. The point is that some of these numbers matter more than others. And one that definitely belongs in the you-should-give-a-toss column is blood pressure (BP).If this gets too high for too long, the strain will weaken and narrow your arteries and other blood vessels, damage your internal organs and encourage blockages, bulging, bleeding and bursts. Next stop,heart attack or heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, vision problems or dementia. And unless you measure your blood pressure, you may not know it’s a problem. That’s why it’s often described as a silent killer.Low pressure is no joke either. But because it will make you dizzy and possibly even faint, you’re more likely to realise something’s up.View image in fullscreenSitting comfortably? … Relax for five minutes with your arm at heart level before measuring.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianNow 62, I’ve had high blood pressure, AKA hypertension, since at least my early 50s – probably much longer given that alcohol, stress and excess weight are risk factors and I spent half of my life as aworried, bloated drunk. So I take medicine every day – one little capsule oframipril, originally 5mg and now 2.5mg. This is an unremarkable sort of dose: the most that’s usually prescribed is 10mg.That’s right: numbers again. And there’s more where those came from. Such as: hypertension is responsible formore than 10 million deaths a year. Globally, according to the World Health Organization, there are almost 1.4 billion adults with it, and more than 600 million are not getting treatment, either because they don’t know they need it or they don’t want it. This killer is not just silent but ignored.In the developed world at least, no one can say this is because it’s difficult to get a test. In the UK, every GP’s surgery and pharmacy will have at least one sphygmomanometer. No one calls it that, of course – it’s just a “blood pressure monitor” – and you’ll know one when you see one: a cuff that wraps around your upper arm, connected by a tube to a machine that inflates it and takes your reading, usually throwing in your pulse at the same time. If you want your own, you can pick one up for less than £20.Testing takes about 10 minutes if it’s done properly (which it often isn’t – but more about that later). You will get your results immediately.What do those results mean, though? So long as everything’s broadly OK, you may not get much of an explanation. This is probably because doctors and practice nurses have tried to explain it in the past and seen patients’ eyes glaze over. This stuff is important but also dull. Still, here are the basics.Graph of blood pressure zones.Blood pressure is always expressed as two numbers: systolic pressure, or the force exerted within your arteries as the heart is contracting to pump blood round your body, and diastolic, or the pressure recorded while it is relaxing and filling. Systolic is higher than diastolic (obvious, when you think about it) and always listed first; the two numbers are separated by a slash in writing (115/75, say), or by “over” in speech (“115 over 75”).None of this will be news if you’re a fan of TV medical dramas, but what you may not know is that blood pressure wasfirst measured more than 300 years ago– on horses. Reverend Stephen Hales, an English clergyman, stuck glass tubes into the animals’ arteries, with enlightening but also fatal results. It wasn’t until 1856 that a French surgeon, Jean Faivre, first measured blood pressure in a human – during an amputation, when he connected the patient’s exposed arteries to a mercury manometer, or pressure gauge. Even today, blood pressure is expressed in millimetres of mercury or mmHg.There is some fuzziness about what constitutes ideal blood pressure, with the range varying slightly from country to country. In the UK, the NHS defines “normal” or “healthy” BP as between 90/60 at the low end and 120/80 at the high. “Slightly raised” BP (sometimes known as “high normal” or “elevated”) ranges from 121/81 to 134/84 and “high” BP starts at 135/85. This is the point at which your GP is likely to offer you medication or give you a serious talk about your lifestyle.(Doctors mostly focus on systolic pressure, but in the long term, high diastolic pressure can also damage your heart and blood vessels. So in order to be “normal”, for example, your systolic pressure must be 120 or lessandyour diastolic pressure must be 80 or less. If either of these are greater, you’ve strayed into the elevated zone. The same principle operates at higher levels.)If it hits 180/120 you are, if you’ll excuse the medical jargon, in deep shit. This ishypertensive crisisterritory, AKA severe hypertension. At the very least, you should get straight on the phone to your GP. If you’re also experiencing symptoms such as chest pain, breathlessness or confusion, call 999 or head to A&E.Let’s back up a bit, though. Remember I said that high BP starts at 135/85? That’s if you’re measuring it at home. In a medical setting, it begins at 140/90 to allow for the so-called “white coat effect” – the tendency of readings to be higher because they are in a stressful context or (though this is less often acknowledged) rushed.Ideally, you should have been sitting peacefully for five minutes before your blood pressure is taken, with your feet on the ground, your back supported and your forearm resting on something like a table, so it’s about heart-high. Once the cuff is placed around your upper arm, it should be inflated three times, and a reading taken each time. The first reading should be discarded, then the other two averaged to give a final result.Is it really worth it? Let’s put it this way. My blood pressure mostly hovers just over or under the 120/80 level. As I was having my photo taken for this article, with a sphygmomanometer lying around, I thought I’d take a quick reading. No time to relax, poor posture, a reasonable amount of stress … bish bosh. My systolic pressure was well over 150.View image in fullscreenUps and downs … Phil Daoust wore a Hilo bracelet for a month.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianAnd it’s not the most hardcore approach to measurement. I went foran extremely thorough “body scan”at Neko Health, a Swedish-British company that specialises in preventive healthcare. As well as having my moles checked, my cholesterol measured, my grip tested etc, I was fitted with not one but four pressure cuffs – one on each arm and leg. Dr Sam Rodgers, Neko’s lead GP for the UK, explains that this is partly meant for repeat users, so Neko can track how the blood supply to each limb changes over time. But he started out as an NHS GP, and still works as one. “Ideally,” he says, “you would be looking at the blood pressure in both arms to see if there’s any significant difference, then taking the reading from the arm with the higher reading so you don’t miss any cases of high blood pressure.”So what figures should you be aiming for? Just because doctors are only likely to intervene once you pass 135/85 or 140/90, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to get below 120/80. Pre-hypertension, as the zone between “normal” and “high” is sometimes called, is not entirely without risk, and obviously this increases as your pressure rises. Rodgers compares the concept to“pre-diabetes”, where doctors increasingly recognise the value of early intervention. Some countries, such as the US, take a more aggressive approach than the UK.Don’t forget that blood pressure fluctuates, adds Dr Sabine Donnai, a consulting GP and the founder of the London longevity clinicViavi. Not only does it typically dip at night, but it can spike as a result of stress, exercise and other factors. The lower your base level, Donnai says, the less dangerous those spikes are likely to be: “Ideally we want systolic pressure to be anything between 100 and 120.”“Your blood pressure is not high all the time,” is how she puts it. “You go to your GP or the pharmacy and your blood pressure is absolutely fine. Then, just after some caffeine or alcohol or stress – or excitement even – suddenly your blood pressure shoots up. That’s when you could get a stroke or a heart attack.”To get some idea of my own ups and downs, I spent most of September wearing aHilobracelet, which uses optical sensors to measure your BP several times an hour, day and night. It’s slim and weighs next to nothing, and other than the odd flash of light, there is no way to tell it’s doing anything until you check your figures in a smartphone app. After 635 readings, I had an average blood pressure of 125/72 (slightly elevated), with a highest spike of 155/87 (well inside the high zone).For comparison, Donnai’s colleague Jonathan Wreave fitted me with an ambulatory blood pressure monitor. This is the sort of battery-powered device that a specialist might ask you to wear for 24 hours, with a cuff that inflates on an unpredictable schedule (usually when it will cause the most embarrassment), a tube that runs annoyingly down your back or irritatingly across your front, and a wodge of electronics that dangles from your belt. I got some very odd looks when it started whirring and beeping on the 17.27 from St Pancras to Tulse Hill. My average here was lower than with the Hilo – a positively healthy 116/71 – but with a similar peak of 154/84.If you smoke or drink, you should give up or at least cut down. But I don’t do eitherWhat with the spikes and everything, I’d like to lower my BP a little. Maybe I could even reach a point where I don’t need medication? When I suggest the possibility to Rodgers, however, he smiles and says he’s a little jealous of me. As well as reducing the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes, he says, “Ace inhibitors” such as ramipril can protect the kidneys. This goes beyond simply countering the damage done by hypertension.Either way, lifestyle changes can definitely reduce BP. For a start, if you smoke or drink, you should give up or at least cut down. I don’t do either – so no room for improvement there. If you’re overweight or have obesity, losing weight may also reduce hypertension. But here again, my wriggle room feels limited. At 1.77 metres (5ft 10in) and 80kg, I already weigh 30kg less than I once did.Obviously, it’s important to get plenty of exercise, aerobic and resistance-based. But as regular readers will know, I’ve been there, done that, droned on endlessly about it.Everyone was politely ignoring the dangers of salt – and that includes doctorsAnd in any case, all this advice is terribly generic. It’s the stuff you should already be doing if you want a long, healthy, happy life.Salt is less widely discussed. “Everyone was sort of politely ignoring it until recently,” says Rodgers. “And that includes doctors. We weren’t great at asking patients about it. And most of us oversalt our food, or have a lot of salty packaged or restaurant food. If you’ve got a high intake of food and you reduce it, you can achieve a 5mmHg to 10mmHg drop in salt.”The usual advice is for adults to have no more than 6g of salt a day, or about a level teaspoon. This includes the salt that’s already in processed food and the salt added during and after cooking.View image in fullscreenBack to the wall … Isofitter’s exercise to lower blood pressure.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianI thought I might make some headway here. Then I tracked my diet for a week, including every single pack of crisps and Mini Cheddar. Most days I’m already under 6g.Stress seems more promising. Alongside the ambulatory blood pressure monitor, Wreaves fitted me with a sensor to measure myheart rate variability, often used as a guide to fitness and resilience. The idea was to get some insights into my nervous system, especially the balance between the sympathetic side, which governs the body’s fight-or-flight response, and the parasympathetic, or rest-and-digest.You don’t have enough calm in your life. Your system doesn’t recognise when it needs to switch offAfter 72 hours of monitoring, Donnai was not impressed. ‘You’re stuck in a sympathetic drive throughout the day,” she tells me. In other words, my body is focusing on fight or flight. “You might think that’s normal because you’re at work and you’re busy. But even in the evening and the night, when you’re supposed to be relaxing, there’s very little recovery. It seems to me that you don’t have enough calm in there. Your system doesn’t recognise when it needs to switch off. There is a lot of stress that is uncompensated for.”How to fix that? Donnai recommends meditation, yoga and breathwork. I already do all of this, but I obviously need to try harder – without, you know, stressing about it.And maybe there’s more mileage to be squeezed out of exercise. I recently stumbled across a research project calledIsofitter, looking at the potential benefits of isometric exercise, where you simply hold a fixed body position for a short time. This waspreviously foundto be more effective at lowering blood pressure than aerobic exercise, resistance training and high-intensity interval training. Jim Wiles of Canterbury Christ Church University, who’s helping to lead Isofitter, worked on a similar project in 2018. In “pre-hypertensives or high normals”, he says, this lowered systolic pressure by 12mmHg and diastolic by 6mmHg. That sounds massive, I tell him, and he doesn’t contradict me.The classic isometric exercise is the plank, but Isofitter is using the wall squat, where you just stand with your back to a wall and sink down until your hips and knees are bent. “Many people find the exercise easy to do,” the website insists, “even those that are not very fit.”The six-month study is looking for more than 500 recruits. I’ve signed up.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingFit for everFitnessNutritionAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are mostly bought by investors who then rent them to local professionals: three years ago, a report on early sales of flats in one developmentsaid that 40% of early buyerswere from Australia, China or Singapore.Ten minutes’ walk away, you can witness a very different spectacle. Every Monday night, a charity called Liverpool In Armshands out foodin the city centre, to queues of people. Some are homeless; others have a house or flat to live in, but can’t afford to eat. While I wasreporting on the city’s housing crisisfor the Guardian’s video series Anywhere But Westminster, I watched its volunteers in action for the best part of an hour: they told me the need they try to meet has doubled since last year.I spoke to a 50-something man who had failed to keep up with a £20 weekly surcharge and the rent on his flat, and then had his benefits withdrawn by the Department for Work and Pensions’ sanctioning regime: he suddenly had nowhere to live, and was clearly in a state of complete disorientation. The same was true of Jimmy, who was sleeping rough, and described being endlessly tortured by one of the city council’s cruellest policies: its insistence on summarily disposing of people’s tents, with everything they contain.15:25The city that reveals Britain's biggest problem: there's nowhere to live – videoI asked him about the prospect of somewhere permanent to stay, and his eyes filled up. “I’ve got more chance of sleeping in that bed there,” he said, and he pointed at a sumptuous double bed, festooned with cushions and pillows, in the illuminated window of Primark.The next morning, I went to an advice servicerun by the Merseyside Refugee Support Network, full of the frantic bustle of very fragile lives. In a warren of rooms next to a city-centre church, there was a steady stream of people faced with one of the asylum system’s cruellest features: the fact that, with a handful of exceptions, if you are granted residency in the UK, you will now be served notice of the need to leave accommodation funded by the Home Office in a matter of weeks. The result, as I saw, is a rapid pipeline to living on the streets.They arrived in an upstairs room, carrying letters from the Home Office contractor Serco. A man from Eritrea, who carried the sense of someone who was utterly terrified, showed me the instructions issued to him and his wife: “The Home Office has told us you have been granted permission to stay in the United Kingdom. You are still required to leave the property no later than 12 noon, which is [on] the date given in the attached notice to quit.”He was being helped by a volunteer who had come to the UK to escape war in Sudan. “They’re going homeless – they have not any choice,” he told me, before he described what often happens next: the handing-over of tents and sleeping bags, and another increase in the numbers of people who huddle in Liverpool’s doorways.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most recent datashows 12,764 householdson the city’s social housing waiting list. But one figure is particularly shocking: reflecting the fact that most local authorities now lack either the means or will to build anything more than paltry amounts of new social housing, thecity’s “additional social rent dwellings” in 2023-24totalled – and read this slowly – five.In the last year alone, private rents across the cityhave gone upby an average of 9.6%. While I was in Liverpool, I met a single mum called Helen, who works for the local ambulance service. Up to now, she has rented the house she shares with her 15-year-old son – which has damp walls, ceilings covered in mould and an upstairs window that won’t shut – for £600 a month. But her landlord recently hit her with a no-fault eviction notice – because, she suspects, he is set on charging a new tenant the £1,400 monthly rent he now gets for similar properties, which are presumably in a much better state.The numbers of people waiting for social housing, she told me, means that unless she and her son endure a spell of homelessness, they are highly unlikely to get that kind of help. So she is trying to somehow find a way through all this impossibility, with precious little idea of what comes next. As we talked, she mentioned a seemingly indelible part of the online conversations she sees about people in her predicament. “I see the messages on Facebook [that] blame the asylum seekers: ‘If it wasn’t for these people coming over on the boats, you’d get your house.’ That upsets me tremendously. Cos it’s not right.”None of these are specifically Liverpudlian problems: they form one particularly vivid element of a national story split between an ever-growing crisis, and housing policy that is still nowhere near to convincingly dealing with it. On the upside, the renters rights bill – which offers people such as Helen a range of new protections – isabout to receiveroyal assent. Ministers say their £39bn social and affordable housing plan willdeliver at least 180,000 homesfor social rent by 2036. But spending on that policyhas been backloadedto the end of the current parliament – and besides, the target amounts to only 18,000 a year. On the ground, therefore, everything still feels terribly fragile and uncertain.In London, housing policy is about to undergo the utterly absurd change that wasrecently decriedby my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty, whereby developers will be free to build even less “affordable” housing in return for even greater public subsidy. Liverpool city council, meanwhile, has just started a public consultation on its target of 30,000 new homes over the next 15 years, but any hardened specifics on social housing are hard to come by (its latest draft Local Plan says the council will require large developments to set aside 10% of homes for social rent, but clearly, this won’t get near current levels of need). This is the focus of a brilliantly energised new campaign called Help –House Everyone in Liverpool Properly. It keeps its collective eye on the city’s gleaming new developments, and also wants to steer the local conversation about housing away from blaming outsiders, and blurring the politics of housing into asylum and immigration: the city’s crisis, they say, should bring people together rather than pulling them apart.Which brings us to a particularly disquieting shift. Liverpool has long been credited with the so-called“scouse exceptionalism”that supposedly makes its peopleless proneto belligerent expressions of national identity and Little Englandism. But in many neighbourhoods, there are now streets festooned with union flags and St George’s flags. In the midst of what I heard about its housing shortage, they began to look like a desperate, distorted show of a fear laced with defiance, and proof of an unshakable political fact: that if you make people feel scared about something as basic as the roof over their heads, they will sooner or later start to behave in very unsettling ways.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Also, to see the suffering end for the people inGazawho, for most of them, were experiencing this through no fault of their own, other than being born into a situation that was horrific.”View image in fullscreenKushner speaks as Israelis gather at ‘hostages square’ in Tel Aviv to celebrate the ceasefire agreement in Gaza on 11 October.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt was a strong diplomatic sentiment for a man whose boss had threatened tounleash “hell” in Gaza. But the soft-spoken heir to his father’s real estate empire has quietly become a key conduit for Trump’s outreach to the Middle East, leveraging his Rolodex of leaders in the region and positioning himself to win a lucrative windfall if the goal of redeveloping Gaza ever comes to fruition.It has been a notable return to the political fold after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, effectively swore off politics after the January 6 riots at the US Capitol that followed Trump’s loss in the 2020 elections.Now, Kushner, who manages billions of dollars in investments including from Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund in his investment company Affinity Partners, sits at the nexus of power in Washington DC.“Of course there’s an enormous conflict of interest here,” said Matt Duss, the executive vice-president at the Center for International Policy, who described the influence-peddling in the administration as open corruption.But, he added: “Part of what’s bizarre is that the Trump organisation is so deeply leveraged in the Middle East that the corruption could sustain the ceasefire. Because they all stand to make so much money there is an interest and an incentive to kind of stop the war.”The administration has denied that there is a conflict of interest in Kushner’s diplomatic work while continuing to run an investment fund managing billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatari state funds.“I think it’s frankly despicable that you’re trying to suggest that it’s inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told a reporter during a briefing earlier this month. “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the president of the United States, to secure world peace, and that is a very noble thing.”Kushner, who was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in New Jersey, had no previous experience in diplomacy before he was proposed by his father, the New York real estate developer Charles Kushner, to join Trump’s first administration. He was mocked after an early interview in Trump’s first term when he said he had “been studying this now for three years. I’ve read 25 books on it, I’ve spoken to every leader in the region, I’ve spoken to everyone who’s been involved in this”.Now, JD Vance and other backers of the administration have taken to reposting the remarks with a sense of vindication.When Trump returned to the White House in January, Kushner and Ivanka stayed in their $24m Miami megamansion and did not take any formal role in the transition, keeping more distance between themselves and the administration than during Trump’s first term.For many, Kushner’s central role in the negotiations was unknown until he and Tony Blair participated in a White House meeting in August to discuss planning for the postwar governance and redevelopment of Gaza.View image in fullscreenTony Blair and Jared Kushner at a US-led workshop in Manama, Bahrain, on 26 June 2019.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I put Jared on it because he’s a very smart person and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players,” said Trump last week shortly after the deal was announced. In an interview with the New York Times, Kushner explained it simply: he and Steve Witkoff, the president’s Middle East envoy, were “deal guys”, veterans of the New York real-estate scene who understood what made people tick.“A lot of the people who do this are history professors, because they have a lot of experience, or diplomats. It’s just different being deal guys – just a different sport,” Kushner said.According to US officials, Kushner and Witkoff had been given virtually unlimited authority by Trump to get both sides to agree to a ceasefire: from a closed-door meeting between Trump and Arab leaders during the UN general assembly to stress test a 20-point Gaza proposal, to persuading Netanyahu to deliver an apology message to Qatar’s prime minister after an Israeli airstrike in Doha last month, to an unprecedented meeting between White House officials and Hamas that led to the best chance to end the war in Gaza since it began in October 2023.“One of his strengths was that he was unofficial” but still had direct access to Trump, said a former US diplomat of Kushner. “He could work in the background, and through his business interests, to bridge all of these sides and build enough credibility to help get the deal across the line.”‘Waterfront property’: what are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read moreSince Trump’s first term, said diplomats and associates, Kushner had pushed a vision that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a stumbling block preventing a vast rapprochement between Israel and Arab states, especially the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, that could transform the region economically.After Netanyahu’s strike on Qatar earlier this month, Kushner and Witkoff were said to have sensed an opening, as Arab leaders grew worried that the attack could set a precedent for further strikes in the region.In an interaction first reported by the Wall Street Journal and then confirmed by US officials, Kushner and Witkoff dictated the apology to the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani that Netanyahu delivered by telephone shortly before he and Trump appeared together at a White House summit in late September.“It was the sort of thing that mature people do,” said a US official briefed on Witkoff and Kushner’s efforts to negotiate a ceasefire. “That got us some leverage.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Jared Kushner at Ben Gurion international airport on 13 October amid the prisoner-hostage swap and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersObservers say Kushner’s imprint on Middle East policy has been visible since the beginning of Trump’s second administration. One signature proposal – that Gaza be redeveloped as a vast beachfront property – wasfirst voiced by Kushner at an event at Harvard in 2024. Critics accused Trump of promoting ethnic cleansing after he said that Palestinians could be forcibly evicted from Gaza before the redevelopment – an idea that Kushner had also floated first.Aaron David Miller, a former diplomat and Middle East negotiator, and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, recalled meeting Kushner during Trump’s first term and described his unsentimental approach to diplomacy in the region.“[Kushner] said: ‘Don’t talk to me about history,’” recalled Miller. “I’m not interested in history. We’re doing things differently here.”Kushner’s family had maintained close links with Netanyahu for decades, mainly through his father, Charles Kushner, who had been a major donor to pro-Israeli causes. The relationship was so close that Netanyahu once stayed at the Kushner family’s house in New Jersey, according to the New York Times.Despite that, Kushner had told Miller that one key to Trump’s diplomacy in his first term was that he would “make it impossible for any Israeli prime minister say no to him”.“Little did I know … that foundational principle would essentially create a situation unlike any other American president I ever worked for,” Miller said.Describing the talks, a US official said that Trump’s vocal support of Israel had made it possible for Kushner and Witkoff to work closely with Arab leaders and even meet directly with Hamas without estranging Netanyahu’s government.View image in fullscreenThe US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, left; Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu (centre); and Kushner attend a government meeting in Jerusalem on 9 October.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockTrump, as well as Kushner and Witkoff, had “stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%”, said a US official. “Israel has a lot of trust in President Trump that he’s not going to ask it to do anything that would compromise its security.”"

From shows such as Gilmore Girls and Sex and the City, cosy Meg Ryan movie masterpieces, including Sleepless in Seattle and You’ve Got Mail, and social media, you’re given the illusion that the season mainly consists of sauntering along leaf-strewn streets, pumpkin spice latte in hand, while wearing snug layers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The reality is more startling: getting up in the dark, leaving the office in the dark, arguments about whether it’s too soon to turn on the heating, and growing bored with eating soup.Now, while we can’t help with the drop in serotonin levels, we can help with those grey mornings when even the dog doesn’t want to go out. Getting dressed in the dark means you’ll need pieces that you don’t need to think about. A striped shirt. A cashmere jumper. Tailored trousers. And piles of leaves that look pretty in the sunshine but turn to mush in the rain require harder-working footwear – so how about a biker boot? These are the wardrobe heroes you’ll end up easily mixing and matching day after day.Then there are the wardrobe extras that make your look feel a touch more special: tinted glasses, jazzy socks, cheerful-making jewellery … because, let’s face it, winter’s coming and you have to get your mood-boosting kicks where you can.Women’s wardrobe updates for autumn and winterView image in fullscreenStylist Sonia Lyson has the autumn look down.Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty ImagesKnitwear nod to the 90sBurberry on a budget.

It’s time to let them go. Instead, you need a purposely visible sock. It can be tall or slouchy, but it needs to be seen. Zoë Kravitz and Hailey Bieber like to wear their black loafers with white ribbed socks, while at the recent shows, the street-style set tested out everything from block colour pairs to patterned. We also spied one show-goer in a cashmere bed sock. There are no rules!Socks and the cityAs the temperature drops, swap wafer-thin merino versions for thermal.

Here are some culinary experiments to avoidGuardian readersSun 19 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 12.37 EDTShareI’m very fond of steamed vegetables with lemon and black pepper. When I was pregnant, my loving partner took it upon himself to cook for me. We didn’t have any lemons. We did have kiwis. He proudly presented me with a dish of broccoli and kiwi. And, in his wisdom, he decided to boil the sliced kiwi with the broccoli, for rather longer than was necessary. His hope (he explained later) was that the broccoli would become “infused” with the kiwi flavour. Strangely, the opposite happened. The meal was rather bland, overcooked broccoli accompanied by broccoli-flavoured semi-transparent kiwi mush. My partner maintains he is a “visionary” aligned with Heston Blumenthal. I continue to disagree.Liz, BathI had bought my first home as a young soldier. I was a physical training instructor so invited the rest of the gym team to my house for a veggie lasagne. It was the first meal I’d cooked from a recipe and I thought twoclovesof garlic meant twobulbs. Cue the amazing smells, mostly garlic, for some reason. I served it with much panache to the guys. Then watched their faces as they and their taste buds slowly died inside. Still oblivious, I tucked into mine only to experience my soul leave my body and look down on a lot of people drinking as much fluid as possible.Paul, 65,wildlife photographer, Powys, CymruView image in fullscreenTwo bulbs take a lot of chopping …Photograph: Andrii Lysenko/Getty ImagesI was about 35 and had had an entire bottle of white wine when it was time to start dinner. I was at the stage when the wine goes into the pot of mussels, along with the garlic and shallots, when I realised I had drunk the only bottle of white wine in the house. So, like any drunken cooking novice, I substituted red wine and continued. I quickly realised after adding the cream why the recipe called for white wine. What I had in front of me was a skillet full of Pepto-Bismol and mussels.AnonymousAs a young lad, I baked a chocolate cake during a wet afternoon. I couldn’t find the cocoa until I happened across an unlabelled tub with brown powder in it. My sense of smell isn’t great. Anyway, my old man thoroughly enjoyed the slice of gravy cake he had and went back for seconds.Craig Dawson, Burscough, LancashireView image in fullscreenNo cocoa? Don’t use gravy granules instead.Photograph: Food and Drink Photos/AlamyWe used to get an organic vegetable box delivered. We got one that contained rhubarb. I dislike rhubarb but my wife is a fan, so I made her a lovely rhubarb crumble and served it with much fanfare. The rhubarb turned out to be chard. It was left uneaten after the first bite.Andy Fletcher, IT, LondonMy son was bringing his future wife to a family dinner and I thought my suggestion of spaghetti bolognese was safe enough. As usual, I left it to the last minute and realised there was no mince in the fridge, or tomato puree, or canned tomatoes. However, there was a bunch of homegrown brussels sprouts. I ended up serving brussels sprouts on a bed of pasta shells with ketchup. My lads tucked in, but my future daughter-in-law asked for a cheese sandwich.Margaret Sully,retired, LondonView image in fullscreenPasta and brussels sprouts, anyone?Photograph: Alp Aksoy/AlamyThis was a meal my husband made early on in our relationship. I think he was trying to impress me with his culinary prowess. He cooked pork loin. He wanted to make a sauce to accompany it. We had pineapple, a potential contender in place of apple. He added garlic – not highly unusual, and it probably would have worked had he not decided to thicken the sauce with banana. He didn’t taste the sauce and drenched the beautifully cooked pork in this monstrosity. It was the vilest thing we have ever eaten. It did not put me off and we got engaged shortly after, but I do most of the cooking now.Amy, 39,occupationaltherapist, NorthamptonView image in fullscreenWhy use apples when you could use bananas?Photograph: nito/AlamyIn my early 20s, I invited two friends over for lunch and decided to make mac and cheese. I made a roux with the last of the flour I had but added far too much liquid and ended up with a thin gruel. Panicking, I thought I needed to thicken this mess. Glancing around the kitchen I saw porridge oats. Porridge starts thin and thickens so surely it would do the job in a roux? Well, yes and no. The resulting mush was barely edible. My guests ate in silence until one piped up: “Porridge and pasta?” We abandoned the meal and went to the pub.Andrew Kemp, 70, retired, NottinghamI made a spaghetti bolognese following a Tom Kerridge recipe I’d found online to the letter. I remember thinking it was eccentric, but the best recipes are. There was a typo in the ingredients list. I ended up adding 10 times too much demerara sugar. My wife compared it to eating meaty candy floss. I didn’t think it was too bad, but she still shudders when she sees brown sugar. Or spaghetti bolognese. Or Tom Kerridge.Neil, 42,creativedirector, Bromley, south-east LondonView image in fullscreenLooks better than it tastes …Photograph: Kritchanut Onmang/AlamyI left home at 17 and just lived off ready meals. I thought I could impress a vegetarian girl who was coming over by cooking tofu, which I’d never tasted before. I bought a block of silken tofu (I didn’t know there was any other type) and put it in the frying pan, with nothing else apart from a splash of oil. It fell apart and tasted of nothing. I knew no better than to plate it up with plain white rice, boiled broccoli, and a miserly sprinkle of soy sauce. The doorbell went. She was here. But I couldn’t serve it to her because it looked hideous and tasted of nothing. I didn’t have much money, so I looked at what was in the (pretty bare) cupboard. I eventually served her spaghetti drowned in tinned cream of tomato soup and a dash of black pepper. I didn’t get a second date.Ian, 39,seniorsocialgovernmentofficer, LeedsView image in fullscreenNo Lea & Perrins? Anchovies aren’t the next best thing.Photograph: SC Food/AlamyMy partner spent hours slow-cooking a vegetarian cottage pie using Quorn mince. Despite her best efforts (red wine, dark chocolate etc), the “mince” was a bit bland, so she searched for some umami to give the pie some depth. We didn’t have any Lea & Perrins so she turned to, in her mind, the next best thing – a tin of anchovies. The fishy/meaty filling was highly disconcerting and was aptly christened Seagull Pie.Barty, 29, carpenter, BristolI was making Mexican mole, a delicious mixture of many ingredients including dark chocolate. After mixing and mashing almonds, garlic, chillies and other things into a pungent delight, I realised I had no dark chocolate, so I went to buy some. I couldn’t find any so I bought milk chocolate. What could possibly go wrong? Well, everything. It was awful! But I couldn’t throw it all away now. So I added it to a cake mix. It had chocolate and almonds in it, didn’t it? The cake came out of the oven, and my friend and I tried it together … and it was terrible. My friend was nearly sick and it ended up in the kitchen bin. Don’t ever use milk chocolate in mole, and never use bad mole in a cake!Adrian Keith Burton, SpainView image in fullscreenRemember to stick to white wine in a risotto …Photograph: Ted Levine/Getty ImagesI was cooking for 11 people and decided to do a big gruyere risotto. I’d done this dish plenty of times to very good reviews. However, I started cooking this after having had a few beers at the pub with the friends I was cooking for. I quickly realised that I had no stock cubes. I proceeded to pour in a whole bottle of wine that I was drinking. After adding in some grated gruyere, I needed more liquid. In went a second bottle of wine. And then a third. After three bottles of white wine and heaps of gruyere, this was starting to smell very funky. Now fresh out of white wine and the risotto getting drier by the second, I poured a bottle of rosé in. When I tasted this monstrosity, I walked out of my house and cried. My friends tried to eat it, but it was a fruitless endeavour. We dubbed it the “ethanol risotto”.Cathal McGuinness,26, civil service,Dublin, IrelandPeople featured in the article responded to a Communitycallout.

Nothing about the group would seem unusual to passing dog walkers and runners – until they huddle together and one starts a countdown.On three, a collective scream cuts through the park. The outburst lasts only a few seconds before giving way to laughter. They were only meant to do it once, but end up screaming again – louder, the second time.This isLondon Scream Club, one of several gatherings across the UK where people meet to scream into the open air as a form of release. A TikTok video of a public group scream in Minneapolis, US,went viral, inspiring offshoots in Chicago and now cities including London and Birmingham. Participants follow a few simple rules: “Hydrate, respect your body’s limits and if you feel dizzy, pause,” explains 23-year-old Shania Barnes.View image in fullscreen‘It’s nice to be able to release your energy together,’ said Shania Barnes (centre, with white scarf).Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFor many, it’s not just about the noise but connection, community and finding new ways to cope with stress.“It’s important to connect with others,” says Barnes, a culinary management student who also runs a micro-bakery. “In a city like London, people are constantly stressed. It’s nice to be able to release your energy together. It’s not only a scream club, but also a social club.”Barnes says she started the group to “release pent-up energy” from the “stresses of work, life and being a girl”.“This time last year, I would’ve never done something like this,” she says. “Being lonely, struggling to make friends – I felt it all, once upon a time. I might still feel that way, but I wanted to make new friends.”What began as a viral trend has quickly evolved into a new kind of “third space” that some in the group say they have been searching for: a setting that doesn’t revolve around alcohol or spending money. “We need more social clubs,” Barnes says. “There aren’t many places for young people to go to meet others without spending money or feeling pressured to drink. People really need that.”View image in fullscreen‘Nobody’s judging you,’ said Maliha Hussain, 21.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFor others, the scream club is an experiment in vulnerability. Ikhlas, 20, a politics student, says she came along after seeing the trend onTikTok. “I realised I’ve never screamed at a loud volume in my whole life, so I wanted to see how that would feel – is it tension-relieving?” she says. “A few years ago, I would’ve never imagined I’d come by myself to a park and scream with strangers.”She found the experience unexpectedly freeing. “It helps with social anxiety,” she says. “It’s fun, but you also go home feeling refreshed because you’ve met and spoken to new people. That in itself is a kind of therapy.”Maliha Hussain, 21, a master’s student, also discovered the club through social media. “I’ve been stressed a lot recently – my eye keeps twitching,” she laughs. “I can’t really scream at home, my parents would be confused. But here, everyone’s in the same boat. Nobody’s judging you.”Hussain believes the trend reflects the difficulty many young people face in accessing mental health support. “It’s really hard to see a therapist in the UK. NHS waiting lists are long, and private therapy is expensive,” she says. “Coming here and having some sort of stress relief, even if you’re not talking about your problems, works for people.”Shania’s mother, Raswella Warburton, 55, came along to support her daughter but also ended up joining the group scream. “People of an older age might think screaming is quite silly, or only for young or unwell people,” she says. “But I actually felt a kind of unburdening.”View image in fullscreenOttilie Nye, 25, left, and Sarah Craig, 26, right, ‘come together to let it all out’.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFor best friends Ottilie Nye and Sarah Craig, 25 and 26, the experience was as cathartic as it was fun. “I never scream,” Sarah says. “I was nervous at first because I didn’t know how people would react, but it was actually quite liberating. It felt fun to scream with strangers, everyone’s going through their own things, but we come together to let it all out.”Ottilie, a drama workshop leader and sex educator, says scream clubs have resonated with young people for “so many reasons”: “The state of the world, all of the horrific things that are happening – sometimes it can feel hopeless and we’re conditioned to think we’re not allowed to feel that.”Explore more on these topicsLondonYoung peopleLonelinessSocial mediaTikTokEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Palestinian officials said dozens died in the retaliatory airstrikes.A senior Egyptian official said “round-the-clock” contacts were under way to de-escalate the situation as regional powers scramble to shore up the ceasefire, though hopes rose that a complete collapse could be avoided when both Hamas and the Israeli military issued statements saying they were committed to the agreement.Senior US officials, possibly including the vice president, JD Vance,were expected to arrive in Israelin the coming days for what observers said was a clear effort to hold Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, to the deal signed in Sharm-el-Sheikh earlier this month.Even before Sunday’s violence, tensions had been running high in recent days with a dispute between Hamas and Israel over the return of the remains of 28 deceased hostages held by the militant Islamist group. Israel has said Hamas is delaying the return of some hostages’ remains in violation of the ceasefire deal.Palestinian officials inGazaaccused Israel on Saturday of violating the ceasefire 48 times and killing dozens of Palestinians since the deal brokered by Trump was signed 10 days ago.There was no official confirmation from Israel of the move to suspend all aid, which was widely reported in Israeli media as well as by international news agencies citing security officials. Earlier on Sunday, Israel announced that the crucial Rafah crossing with Egypt would remain shut “until further notice”. Moves to delay the opening of Rafah last week prompted widespread international condemnation.The deal signed last week between Israel and Hamas raised hopes of an improvement in the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza. A surge of aid was one of the key elements of the 20-point deal brokered by Donald Trump.The new Israeli restrictions will mean renewed suffering for many in Gaza, where famine was declared in parts in August. Fuel and medical supplies are also desperately scarce, particularly in the north, where destruction is most severe.The Israeli military said its strikes into Gaza came after Hamas attacked Israeli troops “operating to dismantle terrorist infrastructure” in the southern city of Rafah. Maj Yaniv Kula, 26, and Staff Sgt Itay Yavetz, 21, “fell during combat in the southern Gaza Strip” the military said, the first Israeli fatalities since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.Israeli planes then began targeting what it said were tunnel shafts and military infrastructure in the area and also launched strikes in the northern town of Beit Lahia.In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said he had directed the military to take “strong action” against any ceasefire violations but did not threaten an immediate return to war – as demanded by his far-right allies in the ruling coalition.On Sunday evening an Israeli security official told Channel 12, an Israeli TV network, that Israel “did not want to bring down the ceasefire” and implied that Israel was aware that some Hamas militants were operating without orders from commanders.Later, a military spokesperson said that Israeli forces, “following a series of significant strikes in response to Hamas’s violations”, had “begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”.Among targets hit by Israel on Sunday was a makeshift coffeehouse on the coastal side of al-Zawaida town in central Gaza, where six Palestinians were killed, while two people were killed near the Al-Ahli soccer club in the Nuseirat refugee camp by a second strike, Palestinian officials in Gaza said. Awda hospital, which received the casualties, said the attack in Nuseirat also wounded eight.A third strike hit a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis in the south, killing at least one person, according to Nasser hospital.Gaza’s civil defence agency said the strikes killed at least 33 people on Sunday. There was no independent confirmation of the claim.Izzat al-Risheq, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group remained committed to the ceasefire despite the reported clashes in Rafah with Israel forces. “It is the occupation that continues to violate the ceasefire and provide excuses for its crimes,” he said.Hamas said its communication with its remaining units in Rafah had been cut off for months and “we are not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas”. A delegation from the organisation arrived in Cairo on Sunday to being talks over the second phase of ceasefire negotiations.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians fill containers with fresh water from a public tap in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where two people were killed on Sunday.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ceasefire deal also stipulated that all Israeli hostages, living and dead, would be returned and nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners freed. Last Monday Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but as of Saturday evening had returned the remains of only 12 of the 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza.‘The loss of education is the loss of the future itself’: Gaza’s children and teachers on two years without schoolRead moreHamas says the war’s devastation and Israeli military control of areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned.On Saturday night, Hamas returned two caskets, which were identified by forensic doctors as containing the remains of Ronen Engel, a 54-year-old photographer who was killed on 7 October in a kibbutz in southern Israel and whose remains were taken to Gaza, and Sonthaya Oakkharasr, a Thai national who was killed in the Be’eri kibbutz.Engel was a photojournalist and volunteer ambulance driver for Magen David Adom. His death was confirmed in December 2023. His wife, Karina, and two daughters, Mika and Yuval, were also kidnapped but werereturned during a deal in November 2023.Ronen Engel was a photojournalist and volunteer ambulance driver.Photograph: Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/ReutersOn Saturday night, the US state department said there were “credible reports” that Hamas would violate the ceasefire, saying a “planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement”. If such an attack took place, it said, “measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire”.The US statement was understood to be referring to Hamas’s crackdown on clans that are opposed to its rule, many of which are backed and armed by Israel. Videos circulated last week of Hamas carrying out public executions of clan members.View image in fullscreenA truck carrying humanitarian aid at the crossing into the Gaza Strip at the Rafah border on the Egyptian side on Saturday.Photograph: ReutersAs part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned 15 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, bringing the total it has returned to 135. However, they have been returned with no names, only numbers.Meanwhile,Gaza’s ruinswere being scoured for the dead. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian death toll above 68,000, according to the health ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross. About 1,200 died in the Hamas raid into Israeli in October 2023 that triggered the war, and 251 were abducted.With Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Forces at the scene arrested nine suspects and detained 16 others for questioning.”A Maccabi statement read: “Following the police’s decision, it was determined that the Tel Aviv derby will not take place tonight.”It came after Maccabi supporterswere informedlast week that they would not be allowed to attend November’s Europa League game against Aston Villa in Birmingham.Birmingham’s safety advisory group – made up of local stakeholders, West Midlands police and event organisers – said the decision had been made due to a high risk of violence based on “current intelligence and previous incidents”.The decision caused political uproar, with the prime minister, Keir Starmer,condemning the moveon Thursday and several figures urging for the ban to be lifted.“This is the wrong decision. We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets,” he said. “The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”Ayoub Khan, the independent MP for Perry Barr in Birmingham, reiterated his opposition toMaccabi Tel Avivfans being allowed to travel in a post on X: “Shame on all those disgraceful politicians and news anchors that conflated this matter!“It was never about religion but everything to do about hooligans!

It said this rise was below the 10-year average for the average October bounce of 1.1%.Rightmove said some of the recent slowdown in activity could be attributed to a strong September in 2024, which was boosted by the first Bank of England rate cut in four years, setting a high benchmark for a year-on-year comparison.However, property experts said buyers, sellers and high street lenders were “hitting pause” before the budget. “[There are] some continuing jitters about what the upcoming budget might contain,” Rightmove said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similar legislation was enacted in 1917 to remove the titles of peers and princes who fought against the British in the first world war.One senior Labour backbencher and select committee chair described Andrew as a “disgrace” and said he “brings shame on himself and those associated with him”.“I would delight in voting for a parliamentary motion to strip him of all his titles,” they said.Asked by the BBC if he would support such legislation, Miliband said “the royal family will have to make its own decisions about what other steps can be taken” but that they had suggested “they didn’t want to take up parliamentary time with this”.Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, called for “a proper thorough investigation into what happened”.“It’s very clear the sense of entitlement thatPrince Andrewhas comes with being a prince and being part of the monarchy. The bigger story here is the monarchy itself. This is why I think the king has closed up shop. It poses some very difficult questions about how power operates in this country,” he said.George Foulkes, a Labour peer, wrote to the clerks of the Commons and Lords on Sunday night asking them toreview rules restricting parliamentarians from asking questions about the royal family.Foulkes said that early this year, the Lords table office rejected questions he tried to ask on Andrew and his 10-year role as a UK special representative for trade and investment, which the prince finally gave up in 2011 after a string of controversies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Sunday Foulkes called for the rules to be reviewed “in light of recent events”.Meanwhile, more than 1,000 letters were sent to MPs over the weekend urging them to push for a “full-blown parliamentary or independent inquiry into the royal Epstein scandal”.Supporters of the campaign group Republic wrote to their MPs accusing them of being complicit in their silence and urging them to call for an immediate investigation. Republic have called for an inquiry to look at actions taken by the Met police and for Andrew to face prosecution.“It is not credible to believe that the Met would not have informed senior royals of Andrew’s attempts to use them to smear Giuffre. There are also questions as to why the Met continues to refuse to investigate, interview or charge Andrew,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“Public anger is what’s going to push this forward and there is a palpable anger among the public who can see that Andrew being stripped of the use of his titles is no punishment at all.”The Guardian publishedan extract from Giuffre’s posthumous memoir last weekin which she detailed her first encounter with the “entitled” prince and said he “believed having sex with me was his birthright”.The Mail on Sunday published messages Andrew allegedly sent to Ed Perkins, then the queen’s deputy press secretary, in 2011 saying he had asked one of his close protection officers to obtain information about Giuffre.According to the messages, Andrew told Perkins he had given the officer Giuffre’s date of birth and nine-digit social security number and claimed she had a criminal record in the US. The email was sent hours before the publication of an infamous picture of Andrew with 17-year-old Giuffre.Her family has said she had no criminal record. There is no suggestion the police officer complied with the request.Another leaked email obtained by the Mail on Sunday suggests that Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, took Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, then 20 and 19, to visit Epstein in New York after he was released from prison.After a newspaper interview given by Ferguson in 2011 in which she said her association with him was a “terrible error of judgment”, Epstein wrote to Paul Tweed, his UK-based lawyer, in April 2011, and said she was “the first to celebrate my release”. A source close to Ferguson said that neither she nor her daughters had any recollection of such a visit.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchyMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

They are weak. They are foolish. They are incapable of displaying true courage themselves, so they look to harm those who are. They are obsessed with personal gain at the expense of group success. They cannot cope with disappointment and personal inadequacies so they seek to bring down others to their level.”She added: “I want you to know … I passed my suspicions of who is responsible for this treachery to head office and a thorough investigation is already under way. The guilty parties will be expelled from the Reform party without delay. They will have no political future.”It came as James Orr, an academic who is influential within Donald Trump’s administration, was appointed a senior adviser to Nigel Farage.Reform UK welcomed Orr, an anti-abortion theologian at Cambridge whom JD Vance once described as his “British sherpa”, to his role on Sunday night.Zia Yusuf, the party’s head of policy, described him as “a brilliant academic, theologian, thinker” who had been “a bastion of common sense and patriotism at Cambridge University”.Kemkaran was facing pressure on Sunday over her comments in the footage, which was of a meeting which took place in late August. The leader of Medway council issued a statement saying he would be writing to her to seek clarification after she told Reform councillors at the leaked meeting that other leaders of Kent councils who she had met did not like her because she was a woman.“To suggest I don’t like her because she is a woman is utterly ludicrous,” said Vince Maple, the Labour Medway council leader. He said her comments flew in the face of the “collaborative approach” Kent councils had to date when it came to working together over local government reform (LGR) plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we don’t balance the books you can forget Reform winning the next election. It’s that crucial.“If we can avoid putting up council tax by the full 5%, that is going to be the best thing that we can do to show that Reform can actually run something as big as Kent council, because let’s not forget we are the shop window in KCC. People are looking at us, they are judging us every single day, every single minute of every single day. Nigel knows that. He is super-aware that we are the flagship council.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKKentLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

It features golden eagles and is covered in 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds. The French culture ministry said eight items of jewellery were stolen, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gave to his wife, Marie Louise.1:06‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in rapid heist, says French minister – videoOther jewels stolen included a sapphire necklace and sapphire earrings worn by Napoleon’s stepdaughter Hortense, who became the queen of Holland, and which was also worn by the 19th-century queen Marie Amélie.The French interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, visited the scene and toldFranceInter radio that “priceless” jewels “of unmeasurable heritage value” were stolen after what was clearly a well-organised raid.The thieves struck at 9.30am local time on Sunday and Nuñez said it took them seven minutes to make off with the jewels. He said: “They stole jewels which have a real heritage value, an inestimable heritage value.”View image in fullscreenPolice officers examine a basket lift beside the Louvre on Sunday.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APThe thieves approached the building from the outside, at an area where building work was taking place. A truck and a basket lift were used to access the museum. They used an angle grinder and power tools to break windows and enter. Nuñez said it was the work of “an experienced team who had clearly scouted the location”.He said three or four suspects had fled – their route was known and police were investigating whether it was a gang known to them for other crimes. Investigators were studying footage from security cameras.Nuñez would not confirm what jewels were taken but said the thieves targeted two glass cases. The gilded Apollon gallery of the Louvre, the ornate decoration of which was commissioned by the Sun King, Louis XIV, has a collection of historic crowns, diadems and sovereign jewellery. It is one of the museum’s most spectacular rooms. Pieces usually on display there include three historic diamonds, the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia.TheParisprosecutor, Laure Beccuau, said the thieves did not target or steal the world-famous Regent diamond kept in the same gallery.A graphic showing which part of the Louvre that the theft took placeNuñez said the museum was evacuated to preserve evidence and to allow investigators and forensics teams to carry out their work. He later wrote on social media: “Targeting the Louvre is targeting our history and our heritage.”The Paris prosecutor has opened an inquiry into the theft and work is under way to estimate the value of the stolen pieces.Police are hunting for four thieves. The culture ministry said alarms went off when the display cases were opened and museum security guards intervened and called police. The thieves fled, leaving their equipment behind them.Le Parisien newspaper reported that the thieves had been dressed in building attire, wearing yellow hi-vis jackets.The French culture minister, Rachida Dati, was first to announce the incident. “A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre museum,” she wrote on social media. She used the French wordbraquage,which can mean robbery or hold-up. She added: “No injuries reported. I’m on site with museum staff and police.”Dati confirmed that one stolen piece of jewellery was recovered outside the museum where the thieves had fled.View image in fullscreenRoyal jewellery on display in the Apollon gallery in 2020.Photograph: Stéphane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty ImagesAt least one person had entered the museum, a member of her team told Agence France-Presse, without adding anything about any possible theft.The Louvre said it was closing for the day “for exceptional reasons”, without providing further details on what had been stolen.Politicians were quick to react. Ariel Weil, the Socialist mayor of Paris’s central area, said he was “shocked” and that it seemed like a storyline from a film. He told Le Parisien: “It’s hard to imagine that it was seemingly so easy to burgle the Louvre.”Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, said: “The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture. This robbery, that has allowed thieves to take the jewels of the French crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on X: “The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our History. We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.”One of the largest arts centres on the planet, the Louvre attracts more than 8 million visitors a year. Its works range from classical sculpture to the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci’s 16th-century masterpiece and the world’s most famous portrait.View image in fullscreenInvestigators near a possible point of entry for the thieves at the museum.Photograph: Poitout Florian/ABACA/ShutterstockIn January, Macron announced a bigrenovation of the museumafter its director said that visiting the overcrowded building had become a“physical ordeal”.In a note to the cultural ministry leaked to the media in January, the Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, had said the space below the museum’s glass pyramid entrance was not properly insulated from the cold or heat, tended to amplify noise, and wasuncomfortable for the public and the staff.Des Cars also raised the alarm over water leaks, failing infrastructure and temperature swings that endanger the conservation of works of art. Visitors faced overcrowding and substandard facilities, she said.The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous was in 1911, when theMona Lisa vanished from its frame.An Italian painter and decorator, Vincenzo Peruggia, had hidden all night in a museum cupboard before taking the picture from its frame and leaving the building, apparently unseen. It was 24 hours before anyone noticed the painting was missing.The poet Guillaume Apollinaire and the painter Pablo Picasso were both questioned by police. The painting was recovered three years later in Florence and returned to Paris.The most recent theft in the Louvre dates to 1998, when a painting by the 19th-century French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was removed from the wall. It has never been found, but its disappearance led to a review of security at the museum.Several museums across France have beentargeted by thievesin recent months. Last month, criminals used an angle grinder to break into Paris’s Natural History Museum, stealing gold samples with a street value of €600,000 but priceless to scientists and researchers.Last November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay Museum in Paris targeting a popular exhibition, Pocket Luxury, which featured small precious objects from the 18th century. Seven valuable tobacco boxes were stolen, some of which had been on loan from the Louvre and the UK’s royal collection.When Macron pledged this year that the Louvre would be “redesigned, restored and enlarged”, he said he hoped the annual number of visitors would rise to 12 million.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The preference would be a service to be delivered in person or online in weekly sessions over two to four weeks, they told researchers.Those surveyed said the acceptability and success of such a programme would be dependent on it being accessible, accurate and based on the latest scientific evidence. It would also help with “myth busting”.The UCL team has begun developing a training programme that could help women prepare for menopause and support those experiencing symptoms. These can includephysical symptoms such as hot flushes, palpitations and difficulty sleeping, and mental symptoms including brain fog and mood changes.The lead author of the study, Prof Joyce Harper, from UCL’s Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women’s Health, said: “We have a menopause gold rush because companies, investors and people see menopause as a lucrative market.“Whilepublic awareness of menopausehas greatly improved recently, there has been a rapid expansion in private companies and individuals providing menopause education, especially on social media, which has led to misinformation which can make existing menopause-related health inequities worse.Feel it in your bones: taking the pain out of osteoporosisRead more“There remains a dearth of evidence-based, theoretically informed and rigorously evaluated public health programmes targeting individuals around the time of menopause and immediately afterwards. Hence our proposal for a new national programme of menopause education and support, which we hope will be funded by the government.”The senior study author Dr Shema Tariq, of UCL’s Institute for Global Health, said: “Although menopause is a natural hormonal and social shift, without evidence-based information and support it can be a challenging time for people.Menopauseoften comes at a ‘crunch point’ in our lives – we may be juggling multiple caring roles as well as the demands of work, and potential impacts on our self-esteem and relationships.“We believe that everyone should be entitled to accurate information and support networks, free of charge, so they are better able to navigate this stage of life.”Explore more on these topicsMenopauseWomen's healthHealthWomennewsShareReuse this content"

But the revelation that official security services are keeping watch over them, the same kind of agencies known to surveil proscribed terrorist organizations like the Islamic State, shows how active clubs are an evolving and quickly growing threat.“Intelligence agencies want to be aware of extremist networks that exist in their countries,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, about active clubs, “their potential for current or future violence, and what links they may have to other movements and individuals, both domestically and internationally.”Already, there’s been evidence of that international coordination coming to light.Revealed: how a Russian fight club expanded into the US with the help of American neo-NazisRead moreIn August, a Canadian active club, Nationalist-13, released a video of a national meetup inside Canada on the Telegram app. Typical of the low production propaganda common to active clubs, members are seen pumping weights and sparring in a flurry of cuts, featuring blurred faces and a synth beat. Then seven emblems of participating chapters appear: two are American active club chapters, from Illinois and Wisconsin, with a third being Patriot Front – an ultranationalistAmerican hate group.“Canada needs all [white] men of good character,” said the Canadian active club group in its post.The open, cross-border pollination of an American extremist movement – born from the ashes of acriminal neo-Nazi gangcentral to the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville – has not gone unnoticed.In a classified January report released via freedom of information request to Canada’s spy agency, CSIS – itself a sharing member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, counting the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the US – made note of the threat of active clubs’ increasing transnational collaboration and the potential for them to empower ties.“Some Canadians have sought to travel to the US in order to attend events (extremist affiliated or co-opted), likely seeking to forge stronger lies with like-minded individuals,” said the report.“Some Active Club members, for example, travel between both countries to network and train in martial arts as they strive to strengthen international partnerships.”The report conceded it “remains unclear” how many individuals in the movement traveled back and forth, but warned that “such travel by those who engage in extremist activities can allow them to reinforce links, share information and strengthen capabilities, all of which could ultimately lead to violence”.Using Telegram as leverage to their international links, Nationalist-13 and other active club chapters outside the US have also been promoting the legal defense of Thomas Sewell, an Australian neo-Nazi who once tried to personally recruit theChristchurch mass shooterinto one of his past groups. Sewell was recently found guilty ofintimidating a police officer, and his Australian neo-Nazi groupmaintains linksto the network of international active clubs.Another Canadian intelligence report, from 2023, makes note of already monitoring the online postings of these same active clubs’ networks: “Neo-Nazi active clubs have endorsed calls on Telegram for violence targeting Jews and the US government.”Peter Smith, a Canada-based extremism researcher, said it doesn’t surprise him that Nationalist-13 and its growing partnerships are catching the attention of authorities.“It’s understandable that the intelligence community would be interested not only in extremists operating in their own back yard, but also in those orchestrating cross-border meetups with organizations and networks that openly espouse a neo-Nazi ideology,” Smith said.“These groups operate independently but see themselves as part of an international movement to ‘retake’ their countries and remove those who are not white.”Smith described how the sharing of tradecraft, “ideology, tactics and aesthetics” between active clubs that combine their social media followings and presence builds “a stronger transnational neo-Nazi movement than has [not] been seen in decades”.Recently, neo-Nazi organizations’ forging of global links typically coincided with their escalating threats to public safety.For example, the Base, an internationally proscribed neo-Nazi terrorist group, started with cells all over the US and eventually spread them across the western world into Canada, the UK, Europe and Oceania. After a years-long FBI counter-terrorism investigation, several members were arrested, including a Canadian cell leader who was illegally ferried into the US and is now currently serving anine-year sentencein a US prison.“The neo-Nazi skinhead group theHammerskinshas had members in both the US and Canada, and more recently, the accelerationist groups theAtomwaffen Divisionand the Base have had members in both countries,” said Fisher-Birch, referring to two other groups that had transnational criminal networks.“Active club propaganda boasts that they are building a movement throughout the US, Canada,Europeand Australia, so the more connections between the clubs, visits, joint events, etc, the more they can promote the message that they are building an international white supremacist movement.”Active clubs were first modeled to become globally embraced and designed in the mould of better organized, more publicly acceptable versions of European soccer hooligans and fascist counterculture – both valuing combat sports, nationalism and the violent machismo of the Third Reich. Their founder, Rob Rundo, is an infamous neo-Nazi and was a leader of the Rise Above Movement, a white supremaciststreet-fighting gangthat was a player in the violence at the Charlottesville rally, withmembers charged for their participation.Chapters of active clubs are now everywhere from Australia to Europe and South America, with a Global Project Against Hate and Extremismreportputting them in 27 countries, along with Hitler Youth-inspiredyouth wings.The news that American extremists are traveling north to help strengthen chapters inside of Canada also comes at a time when the Trump administration has accused the US’s northern ally of exporting terrorists stateside. That fact has not been lost on Canadian media: using the same tranche of intelligence briefings,Global News in Canadareported how more terrorists are traveling north than are headed south.Explore more on these topicsThe far rightFar right (US)Far right (Australia news)Far right (Politics)EuropeCanadaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Clad in skin-tight black glittering bodysuits and masks – the full Leigh Bowery – it is a look: gorgeous with an undercurrent of unnerving. There’s a confidence on all fronts in the work of Marcos Morau, which befits a multi-award-winning choreographer who graces major stages with his own company La Veronal, but also has an ongoing relationship with the small NationalDanceCompany Wales. In Waltz (2023) the ideas aren’t overcrowded. Morau’s dancer-creatures emerge like an alien chorus line, bodies entwined in geometric formations like a sci-fi Busby Berkeley. The highly ordered machine breaks down into separate parts, dancers in stop-start motion, their beguiling and peculiar appearance not dissimilar to the dislocated postures of Sharon Eyal or Wayne McGregor. Perhaps the novelty is exhausted before the time runs out, but there’s pleasing clarity, and it looks damn cool.View image in fullscreenGorgeous with an undercurrent of unnerving … Waltz by Marcos Morau.Photograph: Kirsten McternanThis triple bill actually begins with the short Infinity Duet by Faye Tan: two dancers and a swinging sculpture like a trapeze (by Cecile Johnson Soliz). Airy guitar music brings the warmth and ease of a hazy summer day, its breeze – and the pendulum-like sway of the sculpture – setting the dancers in motion. I was waiting for them to start swinging, but it wasn’t that kind of show.We like to celebrate dance being such an international art form, but at the same time, it’s great to see NDCWales doing something as thoroughly Welsh as Osian Meilir’s Mabon, based on the ancient stories and legendary creatures of the Mabinogion. An eerie tone is set by the score of harpist Cerys Hafana, who electronically manipulates traditional music into something futuristic with driving dance rhythms and ethereal voice. Becky Davies’ creature costumes are fantastic, as if she’s gone on a wild rampage through the haberdashery: fur, feathers, fringing and pearls; masks of abstracted animal faces whose markings look like giant eyes to scare off predators. They gradually shed their robes so you can actually see them dancing, and jig and whoop in ritual circles. Meilir’s roots in Welsh folk dance are clear; less clear is the sense of these characters’ quest (to find the mythical Mabon ap Modron) but this is a delightfully unique piece.AtAberystwyth Arts Centre, 6 November; thenDance East, Ipswich, 21-22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

When they sold up, many of their customers invited them over for dinner, because they created such a great atmosphereFor startersLucasRose-Marie is much older than me and she’s done a lot more in her life – some really fascinating things. She’s been all around the world. She was a wonderful person to talk to, composed and sure of herself.Rose-MarieI thought, “He looks young.” He was very pleasant, very smiley. Naive, I would call him. He must have used the F-word about 15 times. It wasn’t offensive or aggressive, it was just “that fucking thing” and “those fucking people”. I don’t think he even realised he was doing it.LucasWe both picked banquet C, which started with duck pancakes.Rose-MarieThe second course was a chilli prawn thing, then a chicken sweet and sour – all delicious. I had two glasses of wine. He had two beers.View image in fullscreenThe big beefLucasThe big point that we didn’t agree on was immigration. I would consider myself a European, a proud multiculturalist and very pro-immigration. Even down to the genetics of it all; the island nation that we are can’t survive without immigrants. Even the 19th- and 20th-century history of ideas – we owe a lot to the people who have come here. She was very staunchly anti-immigration, I’d go so far as to say conspiratorial.Rose-MarieI laid back on my chair with my arms folded, listening to what he had to say, and I felt like he was reading from a book on Trotsky and waving his arms about. Immigration is totally out of control. People are paying higher and higher taxes – it’s all going on immigrants who have no intention of working. It needs somebody strong to sort it out. And once the country is on a better footing, then it’ll be up to people to vote for something a bit more moderate.View image in fullscreenSharing plateLucasWe are both very much for nuclear power. I was quite surprised about that. She believes in climate change, but I said, corporations get away with their climate-destroying policies by persuading you it’s your fault for not recycling enough. She didn’t agree with that.Rose-MarieWithout capitalism, where would we be? Sure, there are a lot of companies that take the Michael. But he was on a roll – he was saying that he was a total socialist, bordering on communism. Then he went on about energy and windmills and all the rest of it. I said, “We have a sea in Scotland that we can have lots of oil, lots of gas out of, until we sort our energy problems out.”View image in fullscreenFor aftersLucasI don’t like Trump; I compared him to a ghoulish creature of the village. There were economics points that she agreed with him over. And I was, like, look at the number of times he’s bankrupted himself …Rose-MarieHe started ranting about Trump and the trouble he’s getting us into, comparing it to the Cuban missile crisis. I had to say, “Son, hold on a minute, the Cuban missile crisis? Do you know who the president at the time was?” And he said, “No, not really.” Trump’s a Marmite character, there’s things I hate about him and things I think he’s done well, and that’s it.View image in fullscreenTakeawayLucasWe were quite present.

Can you even describe the six-piece as a psychedelic rock band any more?Their music to date has encompassed metal, folk, jazz and dance music; they have experimented with dense concept records and microtonal tunings, and this year they’ve been touring both an orchestral show and a rave show, alongside residencies in European prisons and amphitheatres.And in July, King Gizzard made their latest hairpin turn:removing all their music from Spotify, in protest of CEO Daniel Ek’s €600m (A$1.06bn) investment in the AI military tech firm Helsing.“We have done a lot of different things over the years, but sometimes you just forget that you have free will – you can do whatever you want in these spaces,” says frontman and de facto bandleader Stu Mackenzie over the phone in September. “I don’t particularly want to try to start a movement or something like that – I’m happy if other people join. But for us, it was a decision about our music and a decision about what we think is right and what we think is not right. [We decided] we’re just gonna walk and deal with consequences later.”He pauses, before adding: “Of which there have not been many … nobody seems to really care too much.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe move was inspired byLeah Senior, another Melbourne musician who is a close friend and collaborator of the group. “We had seen a couple of others leaving as well, but it was when Leah left, she and I had this one conversation about it – I told her I was really proud of her and I thought it was an awesome thing,” says Mackenzie. “It’s kind of a beautiful thing – you look at people leaving and think ‘That’s really admirable’. I admire the courage to do the thing that is different and also right.”View image in fullscreenMackenzie (right) says only a ‘small’ portion of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s income came from Spotify to begin with.Photograph: Maclay HeriotMackenzie says that the band’s only concern about leaving Spotify was one of accessibility: the world’s largest music streaming platform allows fans to listen for free (with its ad-supported tier) or relatively cheaply (with its premium tier). There are ethical concerns around this model –Mood Machine, a recent exposé of Spotify’s business practices by the reporter Liz Pelly, reveals how heavily this model favours the most popular artists in the world and greatly reduces recorded music income for independent and DIY artists – but proponents of the service, and even some critics, argue it democratises listening.‘Death to Spotify’: the DIY movement to get artists and fans to quit the music appRead moreKing Gizzard have a solution for that too: at the same time as removing their music from Spotify, they’ve made their entire catalogue – 27 studio albums,64 live albums, three EPs and five bootleg compilations – available as a “name your price” download on Bandcamp.Making the band’s catalogue free, says Mackenzie, “didn’t really feel like a big move” because Bandcamp was already a significant platform for them: the vast majority of their live albums were made available on the platform first; and their 2017 albumPolygondwanalandwas released into the public domain, with the band encouraging fans to press their own vinyl copies.“It just felt like what we would usually do – I just thought, well, Bandcamp is actually quite a cool place, and it would be nice if we can lure some people over there [so they can] discover some other amazing music on that platform,” he says. “It’s been a really big part of King Gizzard’s story from the very beginning, and I’m happy for people who listen to our music to spend some more time there.”Mackenzie says he doesn’t know how much of the band’s income came fromSpotifyaside from that “it is small”. While some musicians do make significant money from streaming, many working musicians have found more reliable revenue sources in touring, merchandise and vinyl. The band’s music also remains available on competing streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Tidal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mackenzie says that idea makes him “vomit in my mouth a little bit.”“I know that we are a quote-unquote ‘brand’, I know that. But I fucking hate – that’s not why I’m here. We are serving nobody by carrying on like that,” he says. “I just want to make music with my friends, and I am cognisant enough to know that we need to make some money along the way to keep the gas in the tank – but for the most part, I just want to make music.“A lot of the decisions that we’ve made along the way that people kind of thought ‘Oh, that’s a bit different’, it’s mostly from that perspective. You put music at the top of the triangle, and then other things fall on from that, and the decisions have been very easy to make along the way.”Those decisions have led King Gizzard to some enviable, thrilling places: on Friday they are playing a free rave set – in which they foreground synth and dance music – at Melbourne’s 10,000-capacity Federation Square, before embarking on a series of shows with a 29-piece orchestra, first debuted in the US earlier this year. The rave sets and the orchestral sets, as vastly different from each other as they are, represent King Gizzard exactly as they are right now – which, Mackenzie says, is just the point.“It feels like an open portal into our brains,” he says. “It just is you, right? It’s an auditory manifestation of yourself. It’s what you do when you’re a musician.”King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are performing a free rave in Federation Square on Friday 24 October 7-10.30pm with DJ Merve.

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Archive image: courtesy of Huey MorganBorn in 1968 in New York, Huey Morgan is a musician and broadcaster. He was 18 when he joined the US marines, and after being honourably discharged, formed Fun Lovin’ Criminals. The band’s first album, Come Find Yourself – featuring the hit singleScooby Snacks– went platinum in the UK. Huey hosts a weekly BBC 6 Music show, and his memoir,The Fun Lovin’ Criminal, is out now.I was 14 and feeling myself. I’m dressed in nylon parachute pants, a Members Only jacket, my bandana and a Van Halen necklace. On the amplifier you can see a bad graphic design of the letters “SD”, which I thought was the greatest logo of all time. It stands for Sudden Death, the name of my band.When I was a teenager, music was a way for me to make connections. My father left my mother and me when I was about seven. It left a dark cloud over me, and writing and playing songs became a catalyst; a way to get out of myself, to derail those feelings of not being good enough.With ADHD, you can treat it as a flaw or embrace it as a gift. I realised early on that mine came with an ability to hyperfocus. I could play guitar for seven hours straight, and once I got a four-track, I’d stay in my room for so long that Mum had to remind me to eat.Aside from music, I was a pain in the ass. I was trying to overcompensate for low confidenceMy mother was a cool lady. Once, when we were walking through Union Square, Andy Warhol came out of a building. I whispered, “Mum, that’s Andy Warhol.” He saw us and called out, “Hey, how are you doing?” as if they were old friends. And they were. Long before his fame, when he was broke and illustrating women’s shoes, my mother was writing at Seventeen magazine. He would stop by at lunchtime and she’d share half her sandwich with him.Aside from music, I was a pain in the ass. I was trying to overcompensate for low confidence. Puberty was hitting and I started to think I was a tough guy; getting up to no good and hanging around the wrong people. In the end I was given an ultimatum: go to jail or join the marines. What was the tipping point? I was in a room with some dudes and we got caught with a bunch of stuff. While I wasn’t one of the primary guys, I was there. When I was given an opportunity to change the trajectory of my life, I jumped at it.The men I met in the marines were crazy.I was with people from all walks of life – every ethnicity, class, personality – and with that came an education in musical genres. I learned a lot just through osmosis. Most of them were from the south and introduced me to fingerpicking and a lot of old soul music.Music was always my safe space. But like a lot of veterans whose job it is to fight and kill, you get left with residual side effects. Finding the right method to treat PTSD took years. I had a girlfriend who was training to be a psychologist. Without my knowing it, she had started writing her doctoral dissertation on my mental health challenges after separating from the marines. I was having trouble sleeping, I was drinking too much and topping it off with a few Valium if I could get some. She introduced me to Joyce, who became my therapist.I was apprehensive at first. I was with a different psychiatrist for a while, who put me on SSRIs to keep me from having extreme lows. But it numbed me out. I stopped taking them because I realised I was trying to dance around the heart of the matter when what I really needed was talk therapy. Joyce taught me about silence and introspection and meditation. Therapeutic tools of stillness feel like the last thing you want to reach for when you’re in fight or flight. Instead, military personnel tend to run towards the fire, which is what happened to me for a long time, and is why a lot of veterans take their own lives.I was still getting my head togetherand working behind the bar in a superclub when the Fun Lovin’ Criminals formed. I loved being around these wild subcultures, and found a great bunch of people within it. Fast [Brian Leiser] and Steve [Borgovini] were making EDM, and were courageous enough to join me on my sojourn into whatever the hell the Fun Lovin’ Criminals turned out to be. Our first gig was at this big weirdo-techno night at the Limelight, packed with club kids. It could have gone sideways, but it didn’t. We used the heavy bass of dance music and repetitive sampling to lock into a groove. By the end ofThe King of New York, they were shouting every word right back at us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I still say that to myself every dayBecause of the experiences I had as a kid, and because I was a little older when Fun Lovin’ Criminals started, I wasn’t going to get gassed by some music business guy in a suit. Those sort of dudes aren’t intimidating if you’re from where I come from. I had a good sense of my own taste and confidence in what I was doing. I really didn’t mind saying no. If something was corny and stupid, the band wouldn’t do it. One radio station wouldn’t play any of our music for five years because we refused to do some summer show where they wanted us to lip-sync. The kind of attitude I had is not what the industry wants. Just look at Harry Styles: “Wear that dress, do that song – if you don’t want to we’ll just move on to the next guy.” I once wrote a song called We Are All Very Worried About You, which was partly about my mental health. The record company was very unsure, but I was like, “I don’t care.” I wasn’t about to get yanked around and spat back out again.Broadcaster Anthea Turner looks back: ‘I spent my Blue Peter era scared to death I was going to get found out’Read moreThe gunner in the marines once told me that “courage is just doing it scared”. I still say that to myself every day, and when the band got successful, I used it as my ethos. I quickly realised that trauma and fame did not mix well together. I am very self-conscious, and had to make myself comfortable in situations that I was not necessarily comfortable in, like going to award shows or schmoozing with freaking Madonna and Donatella Versace. I’d have a couple of extra drinks to cool myself down and try to mask the anxiety with a substance. Often I would turn into my own worst enemy. How I look back at the Never Mind the Buzzcocks thing [when Morgansmashed a mug on a table in 2013] is that it was a PTSD episode. The white wine definitely didn’t help. Unfortunately it happened on TV instead of in a pub in Lewisham, and I’ve since quit drinking alcohol.I used to be a tropical storm, and now I’m a pressure front. My beautiful wife is a big part of that change. Marrying her was one of the smartest things I ever did, and now I have a wonderful son. My mum was a lovely cat, but she worked a lot when I was a kid, and all I ever wanted was a family. Now I have one, and it’s fantastic.I’ve dealt with a lot of what was heaped on me when I was young, and that’s the message I’d give the boy in this photo: there’s hard work ahead, but if you hold on, stop yourself from ending things, life’s going to be all right.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyPop and rockHip-hopJazzReggaeRadiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’d parked in a nearby supermarket car park and I’d left my dog in the back seat with the window rolled down, thinking we wouldn’t be gone long. As my friends continued drinking, I walked alone to fetch my dog, not wanting to leave him alone any longer.I was having some trouble getting the car door to open when I suddenly felt hands around my neck. A voice behind me said “Give me your purse”. In the grip around my neck, I could feel something sharp, cool and metal against my skin.Time slowed down. I remember thinking, is this my friends playing a prank on me? I now work as a psychologist and what happened next is what they call, in trauma studies, “the ocean moment”. My body just reacted without my mind making a decision about what to do. I threw my arms back up over my head and yelled “Get out!” even though, at 153 centimetres tall, I had no chance of actually hitting my assailant. My cry sounded like a thin whisper to me, but someone heard it.The kindness of strangers: a woman paid for my groceries when I couldn’tRead moreIn an instant, out of the dark, a gang of youths appeared from behind the supermarket. They looked pretty scary – safety-pin earrings and the whole thing. In other circumstances, I wouldn’t have wanted to come across them in a car park.One of them chased the guy off and the others just surrounded me, asking if I was OK and what they could do to help. They stayed with me as I got the dog out of the car and walked with me to the police station so I could report what had happened. Then they just disappeared, back into the darkness.I learned a few things that night – that you can’t judge a book by its cover, that people can and will help strangers, and to always ask someone to accompany me to car parks late at night.This happened over 40 years ago, but the memory of those youths’ humanity is still an illuminating treasure that dims the disappointment I felt in the man who sought to violently steal from a woman half his size. I would like them to know that what they did was something extraordinary. It had a lasting effect on my faith in humanity.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

What if we covered ecocide and pollution in the same way?Julia ShawSun 19 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareWhenever you read, watch, or listen to the news, you’re likely to be exposed to stories of violence and murder. As a criminal psychologist, I’m often asked to comment on these cases to pick apart the motives of the perpetrators. People want these kinds of insights because murders feel frightening and horrifying, but also oddly compelling. There’s a level of focus and fascination, and the way these crimes are covered profoundly influences our perception of what the most urgent problems facing society are.One day it struck me that the world would be a very different place if environmental crimes were treated in the same way as murders. So, why aren’t they? And should they be?At the moment such crimes can, mistakenly, feel distant and abstract. If someone came into your flat and set fire to your furniture, stole your valuables, killed your pet, added poison to your water … what would you do? You’d be terrified. You’d go to the police. You might want revenge. You’d certainly want justice. It would be entirely obvious to you that a crime had been committed.In reality, environmental crime is just like this, but even worse because it happens at scale. The problem is that it doesn’t alwaysfeelthat way. But criminals releasing noxious gases into the air, cutting down protected forests, fishing illegally or polluting rivers do injure us in concrete ways. And that’s before you consider the broader impacts on biodiversity and climate change.It’s easy to default to the well-worn stereotype of evil corporations watching the world burnPart of the difficulty in appreciating this is that we tend to conflate all kinds of environmental harm in a way we just don’t when it comes to more familiar crimes. People intuitively understand the difference between hate speech and murder, even though both are acts of aggression. No one thinks of them as interchangeable. But thatishow we tend to think of environmental crime: people who don’t separate their recycling or fly a lot are conceptually tossed into the same category as those who perpetrate heinous acts of degradation. We need to stop putting mundane ignorance or selfishness in the same bucket as serious green crimes, and focus on the ecological equivalent of serial killers.It’s helpful to define what environmental crime is. Put simply, it happens when someone breaks the law – negligently, recklessly or deliberately – and causes environmental damage by doing so. Sometimes, specific green laws are broken by releasing high levels of toxic material into the air, water or soil, destroying protected plants or killing endangered animals. There are also more tangential crimes, such as committing fraud to get around fishing permits, laundering money to hide the proceeds of illegal mining, or engaging in corruption to facilitate wildlife trafficking.It’s easy to default to the well-worn stereotype of evil corporations watching the world burn while raking in the proceeds of exploitation and extraction. And while corporate misconduct is part of the problem, it’s often organised crime syndicates doing the dirty work. These more closely resemble the dangerous world of drug traffickers than men in suits making decisions based on greed.For example, in the context of wildlife trafficking, crime bosses with money and connections in China might hire middle-men in Mozambique who head into towns to recruit desperate local people willing to poach elephants or pangolins. Guards and customs agents are bribed to turn a blind eye to ivory and pangolin scales being smuggled across borders. Paperwork is forged and financial experts set up shell companies and launder money, pretending that the syndicate trades in “plastic pellets”. The same kind of structure applies if we’re talking about illegally mined minerals, toxic waste or timber harvested from protected areas.These mafia-style operations are perhaps easier to conceive of as serious wrongdoing than the image of environmental crime we might have had in our heads. And while money is often the driving force, it isn’t theonlymotivator, just as “power” isn’t the only reason people commit murder. If we ask the perpetrators why they did it, their answers can be as revealing as the explanations given for other kinds of crimes. In general, there are six psychological drivers: ease, impunity, greed, rationalisation, conformity and desperation.And if you’re tempted to turn around and say that environmental crimes don’t happen because of individuals, but because of “the system”, I hear you. Social structures, ideologies and politics have a profound impact on human behaviour. Using this term – thesystem– can feel like a profound contribution to a difficult discussion, underpinned by the desire not to over simplify. But exactly who, or what, isthe system?A serial killer also lives in a society, and we can blame society for any hardships they may have faced. But if on a true-crime show I were to simply cite “the system” as a motive for murder, people would want me to be more precise. We understand that choices are involved, and motives are personal, not just systemic. Otherwise, wouldn’t we all be criminals? The same goes for those whose unlawful activity damages the environment – they are neither just victims of the system, nor purely motivated by greed.I’ve tried to illustrate how a strange double standard seems to apply to how we write and talk about environmental crime – and therefore how we think about it more generally. Imagine a world where it occupied as much space in our news feeds and podcasts as gangs and murders do. We’d hear about the damage done, and also about the efforts to catch and punish the perpetrators. This would have a number of benefits: it would act as a deterrent for potential criminals; it would counteract the kind of eco-anxiety we feel when we think “no one is doing anything”; and it would also help set new social norms, making it clear that crimes which damage the ecosystems that sustain us are as serious as personal crimes. Putting them in the same psychological category as murder would mean we could better appreciate what’s really at stake.Dr Julia Shaw is a criminal psychologist atUniversity College Londonand author ofGreen Crime: Inside the Minds of the People Destroying the Planet and How to Stop Them.Further readingHow to Save the Amazonby Dom Phillips (Bonnier, £22)The Petroleum Papersby Geoff Dembicki (Greystone, £10.99)Cobalt Redby Siddharth Kara (St Martin’s Press, £24.99)Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe big ideaPollutionGreen politicsCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

TheWashington Post recently covered its reinvention, meeting Jacob Hoff, who’s gay, and Samantha Greenstone, who’s straight, a blissfully married couple with a baby on the way (they “birds’d and bees’d” Greenstone explained for the pruriently curious). The Post also spoke to friends April Lexi Lee and Sheree Wong, both “on the asexual spectrum”, who say they “bestied so hard we got married … platonically”.Of course, if you’re talking openly about a lavender marriage, it isn’t one. The point of them was to confer a fig leaf of heteronormative respectability at a time when that was professionally and socially essential; these people aren’t in it for appearances. Hoff and Greenstone don’t like the term: “It cheapens what we really have, which is a love match,”Greenstone says. But “lavender marriage” has been co-opted online as a shorthand for different forms of loving, committed relationships that do not centre conventional romance and sexual desire, both asjokey aspirationandlived experience. They need another name: some people call themselvesplatonic life partners(PLPs); I’ve seen “rainbow marriage” on TikTok.If you’re my age, in a heterosexual marriage in a North Yorkshire suburb rather than a Portland, Oregon polycule, there’s a spectrum of options for how you may view these unions, ranging from “harrumphing great-uncle” to enthusiastically onboard, with a real danger of sounding like a groovy vicar, effortfully down with the kids, when discussing it. I’ll run that risk: groovy vicar here, reporting for duty, to address a few harrumphing points. The HGU (and I assume he’s not a homophobe, just a bit baffled) might say something like, “Aren’t these just friendships?Why treat them as something different? Why get married?”Hoff and Greenstone absolutely don’t see their relationship that way, but for those that do, whynotget married? I don’t consider my union as having some exalted status, just because it was forged in conventional romantic connection or sexual attraction – it’s still mostly two people watching TV and bickering about bins. We’re past treating marriage –a property-based transaction historically and a patriarchal institution still– as a sacrament capable of being sullied by extension to other types of love, surely? “Just” friendship is as sacred and worthy of formalising; it has been sometimes, and in some places. In her recent bookBad Friend, Tiffany Watt Smith describes the history of friendship pacts and ritualised contracts, from 13th-century Iberianconiurationesand early-modern Frenchaffrèrements, to the choosing of abelayDo– an intimate friend elevated to kinship status – by Aku women in Cameroon at puberty.One Bladder After Another: why bros are finally having to queue for the loo | Emma BeddingtonRead moreThere are very good reasons to marry a person you love in any way, not least simple economics. The “single penalty” is real: rent, bills, not qualifying for tax breaks all add up; in the US, health insurance is a huge additional consideration. Exploring the nu-lavender phenomenon,ViceandBusiness Insiderframed it as a gen-Z response to economic struggles (coupled with an understandable weariness with dating). And marriage, rather than ad-hoc cohabitation as platonic companions, is good for us in other fundamental ways: married people enjoylonger life expectancy and better health outcomes(especially, I’m compelled to mutter,men). The intimacy – physical or not – emotional support and sense of security a good marriage can offer is protective; asLee says, “I realised how much easier it is for me to move through this world with a partner.”An HGU might also object that relationships like these have always existed, privately, quite contentedly. Why broadcast them on social media? Both couples in the Post piece are proudly vocal about the particularities of their marriages online (content creation is Hoff’s main income source), responding to the hostile or simply curious, and actually, I find that especially admirable. Because unlike the lavender marriages of the 1930s, these ones are, by their chosen visibility, making a powerful case that love of all shapes is worthy of official recognition and celebration. They’re cracking open what marriage can be and yes, this is an awfully groovy vicar statement, but in our age ofsubmissive tradwives,book bansand narrowly defined, exclusionary “Christian” valuesreframing empathy as sinful, I find that enormously exciting.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Bookmakers may withhold odds on the outcome. In the US-China race for 21st-century primacy, Xi is sprinting ahead, assisted by spur-heeled Trump’s many missteps.It’s amazing that debate still rages, in the UK and US, about the character and aims of China’s expansionist regime. Its aggressive, worldwide economic empire-building, suppression of basic rights inHong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet, regional sabre-rattling and ubiquitouscyber-espionage, allow only one conclusion.Even as British MPs argued over whether Beijing is anenemy or an investment opportunity, Xi was providing an unequivocal answer. China’s drastically expanded global export controls onrare-earth mineralsand magnets, over which it exercises a near monopoly, are the deliberately damaging act of a hostile power.These materials are essential for manufacturingmost electronic devices, including phones and cars. The security implications are alarming. Rare-earth products are used in cruise missiles, combat jets, nuclear submarines, drones and other modern weapons systems. China’s new rules will prohibit their use for any military purpose. Governments are scrambling to find alternative supplies. This embargo,if enforced next month, potentially compromises western arms supplies to Ukraine and defences against Russia, Beijing’s ally.China also intends to control use of these materials byoverseas-based manufacturersand supply chains. The US has asserted similar extraterritorial jurisdiction since 1959. Now Beijing is playing Washington at its own imperious game – and weaponising trade for political purposes. Trump blew a fuse when the measures were announced,threatening 100% tariffsand cancellation of his planned meeting with Xi. Amid market panic, he backed off. But tit-for-tat trade penalties continue, stoking fears of global economic downturn.As usual, Trump has no plan, no idea what he’s doing. Not so Xi. He is demonstrating that if Trump insists on a full-blown trade war,he will go toe-to-toewith the White House windbag. The rare-earths diktat could be a negotiating tactic, or a side-product of Chinese Communist party (CCP) politicking. But that’s probably wishful thinking. Analysts detect a fundamental shift. After initially biding his time, Xi is goingon the offensive.What has caused the shift? It’s the realisation in Beijing that Trump’s reckless America First policies are alienating old and new friends alike, creating a vacuum it can fill. US global influence and leverage is plummeting, reflected in disrupted alliances in Europe and Asia, weakness in confronting authoritarian regimes in Russia and Israel, the virtualelimination of US foreign aidand soft-power outreach, and contempt for the UN and the international rules-based order.China is staring at an open goal. Hardheaded Xi plays airhead Trump: it’s an embarrassing mismatch. Yet the slower-witted in Washington still don’t get it. “The president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China,” JD Vance crowedlast week. It would be rewarding to play the vice-president at poker.Does Vance realise, for example, that – to quotethe Center for Strategic and International Studies– “China [with unlimited access to rare minerals] is rapidly scaling up its munitions manufacturing capacity and acquiring advanced weapons platforms at a rate estimated to be five to six times faster than that of the US”? Does Vance realise the US islosing the tariff fightit started? “Since Trump launched the trade war this year, Chinese exporters have had considerable success finding new markets. Last month, China’s year-over-year exports to the US fell by 27%, but exports as a whole were still up by 8.3%,” noted James Palmer in Foreign Policy.In contrast, US farmers have lost their crucial China soya bean market to Brazilian producers, perhaps permanently. With the holiday season approaching, American consumers facerising prices. Most toys and up to 90% of Christmas goods sold in the US aremade in China.As the US retreats, Xi advances, determined to make China the polestar of a revamped, multipolar world. RecentChina-hosted summitsattended by the autocratic leaders of Russia, India, North Korea and Iran highlighted this refashioning of the global order in China’s image, under Chinese tutelage. Beijing is extending its influence via the Brics group of developing nations, by bolstering the much-denigrated UN system and by establishing new institutional frameworks to woo the global south. As Trump raised tariffs on much of the world, China moved to make African importstariff-free. As Trump slashes foreign aid, Beijing pursues its “global development initiative”. As Trump threatens to attack neighbourssuch as Venezuela, Xi promotes his “global security initiative”. Everywhere, the US islosing geopolitical and moral ground– or is in serious danger of doing so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They claim his priorities, and China’s “core interests”, are unchanged: internal stability, national sovereignty, unchallenged CCP control, economic and social development. Yet, paramount at home after more than a decade in power, Xi’s ever bolder, confident actions belie such comforting theories. On present trends, the Sino-American struggle for primacy will inexorably intensify. Thanks to Trump, more fall guy than tough guy, it’s a struggle the US looks set to lose.For the UK, this prospect is worrisome, to put it mildly. Scorned by Beijing, patronised by Washington, decoupled from Europe and reduced to the role of lonely bystander incapable of articulating a coherentChinapolicy, Britain can only hope it avoids becoming collateral damage.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

New adaptations of Austen and Brontë could explore everything from slavery to death in childbirthSun 19 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 15.54 EDTShareNews that Andrew Davies – the man behind thenation’s most beloved Pride and Prejudiceadaptation – is planning to have Jane Austen’s Emma die in childbirthdrew gasps from audiencesat Cliveden literary festival last weekend. Davies is planning to explore the dark undercurrents of Austen’s work in adaptations of Emma, Mansfield Park and unfinished novel The Watsons, and while his ideas may shock those fans wedded to Austen as a romcom author, I couldn’t be happier.I have always loved a period drama, especially literary adaptations. A few years ago, though, Austen fatigue set in for me. Maybe it’s the fact I’ve seen at least three Emmas and three Pride and Prejudices, and read each of her novels at least thrice. There are so many other stories in the world, many waiting to be discovered and adapted. Unless there was some new spin or interpretation being offered, I simply stopped being interested.As such I enjoyed Sanditon – what joy to have Austen’s West Indian heiress brought to life. But Emma with Anya Taylor-Joy bored me, and the less said aboutNetflix’s Persuasion(“now we’re worse than exes; we’re friends”), the better.If comments from readers of the Times are anything to go by, audiences will get in a froth about how “woke” Davies’s adaptations are when they make it to our screens, especially in their approach to slavery. Austen makes passing reference to slavery in Emma and Mansfield Park; in the latter it is clear that this is where the Bertram family have made their money. So why not show scenes making this explicit? Why not show Sir Thomas and Tom brutally quashing a slave revolt on their plantation in Antigua? Contemporary readers will probably have inferred this as the purpose of their trip in the novel. The moment when Fanny, the protagonist, brings up the topic of slavery and is met with dead silence by her cousins may feel subtle to us – to her 19th-century readers, it would have been the opposite.As for death in childbirth, I can’t be the only Austen lover who has always wondered about what happens to her heroines after the “happy ending”. Austen herself knew women who had died this way, as so many did. There’s a reason why the wedding makes a good place to stop, as anyone in the 19th century would have understood. It’s not that Austen sanitises and sugarcoats, it’s that modern readers – and many screenwriters – do. Think about how radical it felt when Joe Wright opted for more mud and a handful of farmyard animals in his more realist adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. That, amusingly, shocked viewers at the time, and yet what he created in his depiction is a Longbourn that feels vivid and true. Making tangible certain aspects of Austen’s works – or even filling in some of what is unspoken – isn’t necessarily an attempt to shock, but about providing a setting that feels real. Everything doesn’t have to feel so mannered. Period dramas such asHouse of Guinness, with its depictions of childbirth and its portrayal of the horrific legacy of the great hunger inflicted on Ireland by the English, have really raised the stakes.I’ve always embraced the darkness in literature. Being technically what the internet calls a “Brontë girlie”, I grew up being repelled and fascinated bythe red roomin Jane Eyre, and by Bertha Mason’s madness, before falling head over heels for Wuthering Heights at 14. But when it comes to dark themes, is there such a thing as going too far?The Brontë girlies have been in revolt overEmerald Fennell’s forthcoming Wuthering Heightsadaptation, which not only has a white Heathcliff and looks to have put the actors in costumes from the “wrong” period, but according to test audiences opens with a scene in which a nun gropes a recently executed man’s penis. You do find yourself wondering if it’s necessary, when the source material manages to be fairly depraved already. Heathcliff hangs a puppy and digs up Cathy’s body, for instance. Wuthering Heights is famously difficult to adapt, but I rather liked Andrea Arnold’s2011 social realist film.Amusingly, there was a debate at the Cheltenham literature festival a few years ago with the immortal title “Heathcliff versus Darcy: who is the bigger shit?”. I think the jury is still out. Heathcliff may have murdered a dog, but until we know how Darcy makes his money it’s all to play for. One of the panellists, Dolly Alderton, described Darcy as a “conceited, bullish and rude snob who, as my fellow millennials would say, needs to check his privilege”. (Willher Netflix adaptationreflect this? Now that would be new.)I’m wary of purists – as all creative people should be. If anything, I’m often in favour of going further, of having screenwriters and directors of period drama make concrete the dark undercurrents of so much 19th-century literature. That Andrew Davies is talking about exploring, for example, the “psychopathic” Frank Churchill’s hold over Jane Fairfax in Emma is only to be welcomed. As for Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights, it sounds utterly appalling and I will be there at the doors of the cinema the moment it opens.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It also risks becoming a crisis of democracy, if politicians of every stripe are subject to the same crushing financial constraints.Campaigners and developing nations are demanding radical reform. With South Africa chairing the G20 this year, many had hoped to see progress. But while the group of leading nations acknowledged the scale of the problem in aministerial declarationin Washington last week, it offered no concrete solutions.People with knowledge of the talks that led to the statement said a more ambitious proposal, to task the IMF with examining ways of giving more help to countries in crisis, was rejected by China.“There’s nothing in the declaration that will make a difference to the lives of people in poor countries,” said DFI’s director, Matthew Martin.Patricia Miranda, global advocacy director of the Latin American social justice campaign group Latindadd, says the countries she works with are often judged by the IMF to have a sustainable debt burden, while to the public the burden feels anything but sustainable.“When we have meetings with our members in Latin America they say, ‘How can you say that the debt in my country is sustainable? What does sustainable mean, if our lives are at risk, we don’t have access to public services, we don’t have clean water, we have food insecurity?’”Reform of the IMF’s debt sustainability analysis – currently under review – is one demand made by campaigners who want to see the current multilateral system for debt relief, theG20Common Framework, overhauled.Once low-income countries qualify for the system, DFI argues that they should have debt repayments capped at 10% of revenues. This would help to “free up maximum spending room for countries to make progress on fighting inequality, climate and nature crises”.Another widely backed demand is a change to the legal framework for private sector debt, much of which is issued under English law.Championed by UK development charities, new legislation would prevent commercial creditors from receiving better terms than other parties in debt restructuring agreements; and stop them from suing debtor governments in the middle of a restructuring process, as is threatened in the Ethiopian case.Senior figures in the Labour party in the UK initially showed some enthusiasm for this idea; but they appear to have backed away from it since a decision earlier this year tocut the government’s aid budget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Campaigners suspect lobbying by the financial sector.One organisation arguing publicly against a similar legal change in the US is the Institute of International Finance (IIF). In Washington last week the group hosted a drinks party at the British ambassador’s residence, where Rachel Reeves gave a short speech, and the IIF’s president, Tim Adams, gave a longer one.Despite reservations about legal reform, the UK has expressed some interest in acting as a convener on the issue of sovereign debt, with the chancellor setting up a London Coalition, to facilitate engagement with private-sector lenders.But since February’s aid cut, from 0.5% to 0.3% of national income, the key focus for the UK’s development minister, Jenny Chapman, has been deciding where the axe will fall for overseas projects.The results are expected to be announced in the coming months, with the UK withdrawing from some countries altogether. The cuts come as other countries, including the US, France and Germany, are also cutting aid.Scant progress on global debt relief is expected next year, when the US takes on the G20 presidency. But the UK could take up the role in 2027, and campaigners are already mobilising to urgeLabourto use it to fight for a better system.Tim Jones, policy director at Debt Justice, said: “Debt relief is taking far too long and leaving countries at high risk of debt crisis. The UK must use its likely presidency of the G20 in 2027 to champion major changes, including deeper and quicker debt relief and a suspension of payments during negotiations.”It is a knotty issue to confront, requiring deft politics. But in an era of diminished budgets, perhaps it could take Labour closer to its manifesto promise, of “regaining Britain’s global leadership on development”.Miranda, of Latindadd, says: “What we keep hearing is: ‘It’s so tough, it’s so complex, this is the best we can achieve.’ But the way I say it is the other way around: the context is so tough that we need an inflexion point – now.”Explore more on these topicsDebt reliefViewpoint columnEthiopiaG20Environmental sustainabilityEconomicsEconomic policyForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

I know I am making the right choiceSun 19 Oct 2025 19.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 19.30 EDTShareAmerica, it’s been 60 years but I’m breaking up with you. I still love you but I’m not in love with you and I’m calling it quits. I’m going willingly although I’m sad because there isa lot that’s wonderful about you.From your magnificent national parks, soaring redwoods and unique wildlife to the magic of fireflies amid the corn fields on summer nights and the vibrant colours of autumn leaves, your natural beauty is stunning. Your capacity to inspire creativity and innovation is boundless, as reflected in the inspirational people I have met who live within your borders. So many of my fondest memories of our time together revolve around the flavours that will always remind me of you – cinnamon, pumpkin pie, grape jelly. But, America, I just don’t understand you any more.US falls out of world’s 10 most powerful passports list for first time in 20 yearsRead moreIf I were to write a break-up letter to the US, that’s how it would start. I have been what is called an “accidental American” since birth thanks to my father and 10 generations before him, beginning in 1636 and featuring revolutionary and civil war soldiers, shared DNA with a former president and generations of pioneers who crossed the country, from Massachusetts and New Jersey to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kansas.I am so proud of my family’s history and their contribution to America’s story. My dad grew up during the Great Depression; his father served as a Marine in France in the first world war; his widowed great-grandmother managed a farm with nine children to feed; his great-uncle helped rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake; and his grandfather ran as a state senator.Yet despite this quintessentially US family history, I find myself no longer feeling a connection with the country. This is especially so considering the perplexing and alarming political climate that leaves me questioning what being American means. It has beendubbed “citizen insecurity”– and I think I have it. Now I wish to distance myself.I have only lived in the US for two years andI have not visitedfor eight. I have been an Australian citizen for almost four decades and have no intention of living, working or studying in the US again. And I am certain I will never require extraction by a Seal team – so there is no requirement for me to remain a US citizen.View image in fullscreen‘I have my certificate of renunciation and my hole-punched passport to keep as a souvenir’Additionally, the obligation I have as a US citizen to file a tax return every year, despite not living or working there or qualifying for any benefits, is onerous and stressful. The US is one of only two countries – along with Eritrea – that taxes based on citizenship and not residence. And tax compliance is mandatory – it’s written in the back of our passports.Sure, there is atax treatybetween Australia and the US, designed to prevent double taxation, but it costs between A$1,200 and A$3,500 each year just to get an average, simple return prepared, and it’s an extremely demanding and byzantine process to undergo every January, when the US tax year begins.I have been told that, at some point, the US government will enforce compliance and impose substantial penalties on those who are delinquent. And it’s not just mega-wealthy people likeBoris Johnson who are targeted; every US citizen living abroad must comply.While I am not renouncing because of taxes, the cost and stress of filing each year is distressing and basic economics tells me it is a poor investment. But ignoring my US taxes would mean that a visit to the US comes with the added anxiety ofpotentially being turned back at immigrationfor non-compliance. Or I could leave it for my estate to sort out upon my death. Neither option is satisfactory.Having a US passport is a privilege that thousands ofimmigrants are desperately trying to obtain. But it’s a privilege that I do not feel comfortable with, so I am doing something about it, although it is costing me US$2,350 to do so.The menacingphoto portrait of Donald Trump, glowering upon those gathered at the US consulate in Sydney – where I take the oath of renunciation – is the final push. I know I am making the right choice for me and when the consular officer asks me if I am being coerced into renouncing, I truthfully answer no.Two weeks later I have my certificate of renunciation and my hole-punched passport to keep as a souvenir. My name will apparently belisted on a federal register. I just hope that I am granted a visa next time I choose to visit.The author is a writer living in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionDonald TrumpAustralian citizenshipcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a living, breathing practice that helps make sense of an incomprehensible worldShadi Khan SaifI grew up in Kabul and Karachi. In both, I learned the value of the quiet rituals observed while no one is watchingSun 19 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 18.39 EDTShareWhen I was leaving London for Melbourne, my eldest sister-in-law told her kids not to forget the “tradition” – to throw a bowl of water behind me as I stepped out the door. Just a small splash on the ground, a gesture older than borders. “La har azaab po aman se,” she whispered in Pashto under her breath – may all hardship stay away from you. The little ones giggled and waved their goodbyes as they spilled the water, somewhere between shy and amused.My mother used to do this too, back in Afghanistan. Every time I left for a journey, especially international ones, she’d quietly follow me to the gate with a bowl of water, whispering prayers I couldn’t always hear. But this moment, between two western cities, with children growing up in a world so far from where that habit began, felt different. It was softer. Bittersweet. Like watching an old song being hummed in a new language.Positive thinking can make success feel like the only acceptable option. But humility allows for grace | Jackie BaileyRead moreI grew up between Kabul and Karachi; two cities that always felt like they were on the edge of something. One broken by war, the other always just holding itself together amid all sorts of hardships of a city outgrowing itself but starved of resources and infrastructure. In both, I learned that people survive not just through faith but through the small things they do when no one’s watching; the quiet rituals and little beliefs that live in everyday life. They’re not loud, not official. But they’re full of love and hope.I saw it all around me. In the way my grandmother would suggest a black cloth by the door after someone recovered from illness or we bought something “precious” – to keep the evil eye away. In the way my aunt would burn esfand herb above her children in a pot when they came home from a wedding or party looking too beautiful and getting too much attention. In the way my other sister-in-law would put a tiny black dot behind her baby’s ear when he smiled too much – just to hide some of that beauty from the world. “People are not very nice and too much goodness invites jealousy and negativity,” she’d say. “It’s better to be a little hidden.”Drawing on my own encounters, I’ve come to see how these seemingly small gestures – the fragrant smoke of esfand to lift heaviness, the rhythmic pull of qawwali, the quiet assurance of a taweez tied around a wrist – hold more than superstition. They carry virtues: grounding, comfort and a deep sense of protection. None of these things were in any book of religion. No one ever sat down and taught them. They were just picked up, like pebbles from the ground, passed from women to girls, from grandmothers to mothers to daughters – and sometimes to sons who were paying attention.Even the most religious people I know – people who prayed five times a day, who fasted every Ramadan, who could quote the Qur’an by heart – still do these little things. They didn’t see them as separate or wrong. Just part of faith and tradition woven together into everyday life, to feel safe and at peace.When I moved to Melbourne, I carried some of those things with me. Not in boxes but in habits. I still whisper Ayatul Kursi before a flight, even if I’m late and running through the airport. I still avoid sweeping the house at night, not because I’m scared but because I remember my mother saying, “You’ll sweep away your blessings”.My generation agonises over how to act and what to say. We have to learn to go with the flow | Bertin HuynhRead moreSometimes I think these little rituals stayed with me more than the big teachings. Not because they were more important but because they were more personal. More human. They helped us make sense of a world that often didn’t make sense. Especially back home where things could change overnight, where life was unpredictable, where people had lost so much.And they remind me that spirituality itself isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice, woven into daily life. It takes on local colours while pointing to something universal. I’ve seen echoes of it elsewhere in the chanting circles of Indigenous Australians, where voices rise together in rhythm and prayer; in the protective rituals of other communities, each finding its own way of asking for peace. Across cultures, people reach for these small, invisible shields.I still remember the trees outside a mosque in the bazaar of Kabul. People used to tie little strips of cloth to its branches; one for each prayer they made.Because these rituals are more than just old habits. They are threads that connect us to our past, whispers of love carried across generations and subtle ways of finding peace in a world that so often feels chaotic. Maybe one day, they will fade. Maybe the children who threw water behind me in London won’t pass the tradition on to their own kids. But as long as we live, humans will search for these quiet, innocent acts of hope and protection gestures that don’t always make sense on paper but make all the difference in the heart.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsReligionMaking sense of itIslamMindfulnesscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s an idea – let’s just ignore themPip FinkemeyerSocial media didn’t live up to its promises. So why do we think artificial intelligence will be any better?Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailSun 19 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 18.43 EDTShareThere is a “hype cycle” that maps the euphoria and hysteria generated by new technology and then the consequent plunge into the “trough of disillusionment” when it fails to deliver on its promises.TheGartner Hype Cyclewas coined in 1995, timely for the dotcom boom, and now traces the trajectory of artificial intelligence. We are at the “peak of inflated expectations” before we nosedive into that aforementioned disillusionment. Some would say we are already in freefall, with companies struggling to convert their investments into productivity.Most creatives, workers, humans (actually, anyone except those who have invested the trillions into AI and will lose a lot of money from the inevitable puncturing of the hype) would welcome that freefall, that collective loss of belief.As a writer, but more so as a tech worker, I’ve seen first-hand people’s propensity to believe in things they don’t understand, perhaps specifically because they don’t understand them. I once had a boss who spoke about my work in hushed and reverent tones because I was working on something that simply sounded a lot like AI – it was IA, or information architecture, which has nothing to do with AI except that it uses the same letters.At times I think it’s kind of beautiful, the way enough kind-hearted people will always believe some magical and sublime invention is coming to save us. But this hope and optimism is what big tech is counting on. The hype is boosted by the opposite opinions too, ones that speak to a powerful and all-knowing dystopian force coming to us straight out of science fiction novels. If hype feeds on our positivity (wanting to believe in something) and our negativity (our survival instinct to scan the horizon for predators) then what are we to do?Sad Girl Novel author Pip Finkemeyer on critiquing sad girl novels: ‘It has to have a heart’Read moreI’d like to entertain the idea of a kind of collective ignoring, like students ignoring a disruptive class clown in hopes they quieten down faster. But class clown might be too likable and innocent as a stand-in for a collective of men with the highest concentration of power in the world. Also, class clowns are funny.So, do we really have the power to do that? Just ignore them?Tech is a speculative industry, money is made not on the product working, being any good or, in many cases, even making it to market. The money is made by making usbelieve. Or to get more granular on that idea (as the tech bros love to say), the money is made by making investors believe, not that the product will work, but that individuals and society as a whole can be made to alsobelieve, if they put enough money behind the idea, that a certain type of future is inevitable. When we submit to their ideas, that’s when they get their return on investment.There are so many ways resisting big tech is difficult. But there is one simple way to resist that can’t be taken away from you and it might sound naive: just ignore it and its stories about your life.As a fiction writer, of course I am interested in the practice of making people believe something I just pulled out of thin air. If Ken’s job is “beach”, mine is “make believe”. As a tech worker, I spent the first Trump presidency working on a product to help people in the US learn Mexican Spanish. Now I look back with longing at the period in the 2010s when Washington at least pretended it had control over Silicon Valley, not the other way around.The inversion point for that relationship between tech and politics is what drives the scandal in my novel One Story. During this era, we all (or enough of us) believed in the connection that social media would bring us, and flocked to those platforms. In hindsight, we surely see how much the opposite is actually true, now that we have all the data. Or rather, they do, and they used it to change the course of democracy.But with AI, we all (or enough of us) are believing all over again, a new story from many of the same men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While electric vehicles (EVs) looked like science fiction, that prediction looked prescient. Fast‑forward 20 years and battery technology has improved dramatically; EVs are affordable. Last week it emerged that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) aren’t very green. The sales pitch had been that motorists could use “clean” battery power for city jaunts and dirty petrol for longer trips. This promised sustainable travel without the anxiety of a limited range. But real‑world tests, by the European non-profit Transport and Environment,showthat PHEVs emit just 19% less carbon dioxide than petrol and diesel cars – far short of the 75% claimed in the lab.Hybrid vehicles are, however, very profitable. Carmakers can charge top dollar for what are essentially re-engineered petrol cars with a battery bolted on. They also remain attractive to policymakers keen for industry sops. Byweakeningelectric vehicle targets, the UK government risks a scandal in pushing hybrids that emitfive timesmore CO2than claimed.Europe is a battleground between climate necessity, commercial reality and political clout. Four big European automotive companiesavoidedmore than €5bn in fines because emissions compliance was not judged on real-world data. Switching to electric cars seems an obvious step. Yet former Renault boss Luca de Meosaid earlier this yearthat EVs won’t be the dominant technology in Europe for two decades. It’s not just a lack of buyers or engineering nous holding back EVs. It’s that Europe’s carmakers are keeping profits rolling in by squeezing cash from hybrids and petrol cars.Newer competitors are stealing a march. The UK has justbecomethe largest international market for China’s BYD, the world’s bestselling electric carmaker. And that’s without benefiting from the government’s new EV subsidy scheme, whichexcludesChinese-made vehicles for environmental reasons. In Europe, where Elon Musk’s far-right political views have undermined Tesla brand loyalty, its newcheapermodel will have tocompetewith Chinese EVs that sell for less than £20,000.Yet even BYD may face its own reckoning. Itscompetitiveedge rests on low-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries. If Toyota delivers on its promise to manufacture solid‑state batteries for commercial use by 2027, it could leave rivals behind by delivering safer power packs, faster charging and longer range. The tech promises to make thedreamof driving an electric car on a single charge from London to Milan a reality. Disrupters getting disrupted is just capitalism. Whether it serves society depends on the wiring of the system. Markets reward what’s profitable, not what’s sustainable or equitable. So if Toyota does leapfrog BYD, the question isn’t “Is that fair?” It’s “Who benefits, and at what cost?”Which brings us to the real question: should cars, however low their emissions, remain the dominant form of transport? Relying solely on EVs risks a future of congestion and road fatalities –about30 lives are lost every week in Britain. It also overlooks planetary limits. The global north cannotmonopolisecritical minerals to electrify car fleets while producing nations are left behind. A just transition means not only cleaner cars but fewer of them, as well as real benefits for resource-rich countries. Ultimately, we must shift away from a carbon-intensive economy. Key to that will be reshaping urban life around mass transit, not pretending that the current model can persist, albeit with different engines.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsOpinionRoad transportGreenhouse gas emissionsRenaultTeslaToyotaElon MuskeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But it is not clear that the right lessons have been learnedSun 19 Oct 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 15.54 EDTShareThestartling rise in the costto the NHS in England of medical negligence cases, and asharp increase in birth injuriesto mothers, are the latest warning signs of deeply troubling failures in maternity services. The £60bn estimate of negligence liabilities, from the National Audit Office, represents a quadrupling in less than 20 years. While some medical specialties have seen falling payouts, those in obstetrics rose. The reason why payments in such negligence cases are so high is that when babies are injured,awards must cover lifetime care needs.Grave shortcomings in maternity care are widely recognised, along with unjustdisparitiesin outcomes for women from different socioeconomic and racial groups. Preventable deaths and injuries at units inMorecambe Bay,Shrewsbury and Telford, andEast Kent, have been among the most shocking patient safety scandals of recent years.Investigations following these and other tragedies revealed a range of problems including poor collaboration between clinicians, weak leadership, a lack of openness and inability to learn from mistakes, inadequate staffing, and bad practice including a lack of monitoring. Yet despite long lists of recommendations, and some improvements including in the use of data, it is impossible to be confident that past mistakes could not be repeated. Two years ago the Care Quality Commission rated two-thirds of maternity unitsinadequate or requiring improvement. Last year, the first parliamentary report aboutbirth traumasuffered by womenconcludedthat “poor care is all‑too-frequently tolerated as normal, and women are treated as an inconvenience”.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said that raising standards will be a litmus test for this government. But while his emphasis is welcome, and should prompt trust bosses to pay closer attention to an area that is too often overlooked, it is unclear how improvement will be achieved. A set oftargets agreed in 2015, including halving maternal and neonatal deaths, is on course to be missed. And bereaved families havestrongly criticisedthe remit of the rapid investigation of specific units announced by Mr Streeting in the summer, which is due to deliver its report next year.The rising number of severe vaginal tears, as well as theincrease in maternal mortality, and the level ofreadmissions to hospital of new mothers, all point to issues that go far beyond the relatively small number of cases in which a baby suffers brain damage as a result of medical mistakes.In relation to maternal injuries, part of the recorded increase may be due to better reporting and greater awareness about a subject that barely used to be discussed at all. The changing demographic of mothers, with more older and heavier women giving birth, is said by experts to be one factor increasing risk. The rising proportion of caesarean section deliveries presents challenges not because they are a problem in themselves, but because they make different demands on staff and the system. It is well known that unmanageable workloads causeproblems with staff retention.Given all this complexity, there can be no simple formula for upgrading the maternity care system. The concern is that this latest review could produce yet another set of recommendations that are no more likely to succeed than others before them. But it is, at least, an opportunity to focus minds on the urgent need to improve birth outcomes and experiences.Explore more on these topicsNHSOpinionPregnancyHealthMaternal mortalityParents and parentingWomeneditorialsShareReuse this content"

It’s a slap in the face for people who are crying out for homes they can afford to live in.The plan to shower large property developers with public subsidies is an astonishing misuse of taxpayer money. At a time when public services are on their knees, the government proposes to use scarce public funds to boost the profits of highly successful private companies. We already see this in Liverpool, where the Labour council allows private developers to avoid paying much neededsection 106 moneybecause they argue that their schemes become “unviable”.The proposal to suspend the community infrastructure levy is equally shortsighted and damaging. The levy is a crucial tool for ensuring that development benefits everyone, not just the developers. It pays for essential infrastructure: new schools, GP surgeries and transport links. This change will mean worse roads, fewer school places and more pressure on GP surgeries. It will cripple community budgets for years to come.Most tellingly, the exclusion of local authorities and social housing providers from these discussions reveals Labour’s true centralising colours. To sideline us so completely shows a government that trusts big business more than it trusts local communities.This is a policy born of the same old Westminster thinking: top-down, developer-led and fundamentally unfair. It is a profound betrayal, and local communities will not forget it.Cllr Carl CashmanLeader, Liverpool Liberal Democrats;vice-chair,Local Government Associationinclusivegrowthcommittee,Cllr Mike RossLeader, Hull Citycouncil,Cllr Jim MillardDeputyleader, Richmond upon ThamescouncilThe proposal by the housing secretary,Steve Reed, to reduce affordable housing requirements to 20% would be a gift to developers and a disaster for those who actually need homes.

It doesn’t speed up construction; it simply reduces the share of new homes that are affordable, deepening the housing crisis.Lowering the quota also distorts viability assessments: developers will increasingly argue that even 20% is unprofitable on many sites, especially small or difficult ones, and ask for further reductions or exemptions. This pattern is already visible across planning systems: the stronger the baseline requirement, the more developers accept it; the weaker it is, the easier it becomes to wriggle out of it.International experience proves that firmness works. InNew York, inclusionary zoning mandates 25% to 30% affordable housing in rezoned areas, and development remains strong.Parisenforces a 25% social-housing quota under the solidarity and urban renewal law, with fines for non-compliance, whileViennashows what decades of consistent high expectations can deliver: over 40% of residents are in social or limited-profit homes.Meanwhile, Britain’s biggest builders are thriving.Persimmonposted £405m in operating profit last year, with a 14% margin, and Berkeley Group reported £529m pre-tax profit. Executives take home multimillion-pound bonuses. These are not industries on the brink; they can afford to contribute their fair share to the social good.Sarah WillsonTown planner, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He is right that there is no choice to be made between nature and housing and that both are essential. He is right that the repeated demonisation of wildlife by some in government is both inaccurate and against the deepest instincts of the British public. He is right that the planning and infrastructure bill has been spun into this narrative and that parts of it represent a huge risk for nature. But he is wrong that environment NGOs have been “mute” in response.Collectively and individually, we have repeatedly called out the bill publicly in the media and elsewhere, including the damagingpart 3 proposalsand the shambolic last-minute government amendments. We have compiled hundreds of briefings, evidence and research papers highlighting the dangers within the bill and opportunities to improve it, and urged action. We have worked with our indefatigable supporters, who have sent over 100,000 emails, letters and postcards to their MPs and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.This work led to a large package of amendments that, while by no means perfect, improved part 3 of the bill, with the Office for Environmental Protection describing them as going “a long way towards addressing the issues we raised in our advice”.We have never stopped campaigning on the bill’s flaws and we will continue to challenge where this bill could harm nature in its final stages and in implementation.With rumours of a second planning bill also on the horizon, we will continue to do everything in our power to galvanise our supporters and to stop the environmentally, economically and politically disastrous assault on the wild spaces we all cherish.Craig BennettChief executive, TheWildlifeTrustsHilary McGradyDirector-general, National TrustDr James RobinsonChief operating officer, RSPBRichard BenwellCEO, Wildlife and Countryside LinkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Cody Gakpo struck the woodwork three times and missed a gilt-edged opportunity to head home a second equaliser in the 87th minute. But having lost toCrystal Palace,Galatasaray,Chelseaand nowUnited, the Dutch coach conceded he has a job on his hands to end Liverpool’s damaging run.“As a manager you constantly face challenges,” said Slot. “When you start and you need to win games, when you go to a bigger club, when you are the successor of Jürgen Klopp and people are saying: ‘This is the biggest challenge you have ever faced.’ Now we have lost four times in a row and that is also a challenge. The life of a football manager is also an ongoing challenge.View image in fullscreenArne Slot gives tactical instructions to his players during Manchester United’s win at Anfield.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“But do we lose confidence? I can not see that yet because every game we’ve lost we were able to create in the second half an unbelievable amount of chances. If we can keep producing what we are doing and maybe do a few things a little bit better, then there is every reason to expect that we will win football games again. Of course there is also the part that, apart from the two goals we conceded, we conceded maybe two or three more chances. This is constantly the struggle we have when we are 1-0 down, then you need to take a bit more of a risk.”Slot felt the referee, Michael Oliver, should have stopped play before Bryan Mbeumo’s 62-second opener because of a head injury sustained by Alexis Mac Allister. The Liverpool midfielder required four stitches in a cut. But the head coach said: “The main thing I should do now is not complain at these kind of things. We should have done much better after Macca was on the floor but the health care of the players is important and if a player needs four stitches you would hope everyone understands he needed treatment. But we could have done better and that is not the reason we lost. The reason is we missed far too many chances to win a game of football.”Amorim said United’s spirit and composure was key to victory at Anfield, particularly after Gakpo levelled for Liverpool late on, but insisted the finest result of his turbulent reign would not change any targets for the season.The United head coach said: “I want you guys [the media] to continue with the narrative that you have so I will not increase the goal. What we need to do is try to win three games in a row now and forget about top four or top six. We already said we want to go to Europe. This doesn’t change nothing.

Little wonder there were smiles, Verstappen knows he is back in the fight.‘For sure, the chance is there’: Max Verstappen hopeful he can retain titleRead moreVerstappen beat title rival Lando Norris into second and with Norris’s McLaren teammate, andchampionship leader, Oscar Piastri managing only fifth from sixth on the grid, the meeting in Austin has set up an enormously tense run-in as the season enters its final five meetings. Norris has now closed to within just 14 points of his teammate.For Verstappen the victory has put him emphatically back in the title fight. He now trails Piastri by 40 points and Norris by 26. His hopes for a fifth drivers’ title remain a long shot, he needs to keep winning and forMcLarento fumble, but on this form and with the car looking increasingly impressive he will revel in bringing the pressure to bear and has far more experience than Norris and Piastri in closing out at the sharp end of a championship.Once Verstappen had held his lead from the start he was indomitable out front. He was without doubt aided in that any potential challenge from Norris was stymied when the McLaren driver lost second place to Charles Leclerc through turn one. The Monegasque made a blistering opening on the quicker soft tyres, a gamble from Ferrari that paid off at Norris’s expense.After which Norris duelled with Leclerc all race until with a spirited effort at the death he claimed back second for good, but all the while Verstappen had made hay and was gone. Leclerc took third but Piastri, never really on the pace all weekend in Austin, could make no charge forward as his championship lead became slender indeed.With the leaders all one-stopping, strategies were largely matched and Verstappen, enjoying clean air out front, needed no second invitation to grind out the kind of relentless win that notably marked his previous titles.View image in fullscreenLando Norris tries to find a way past Charles Leclerc in Austin.Photograph: Nick Didlick/APThe turnaround for Verstappen has been little short of extraordinary. Piastri had 104 points over him after the Dutch GP at the end of August, with the main consideration at the time being when and which McLaren driver might secure the championship.Since then, in the space of four grands prix and one sprint, well over half that advantage has been erased and Verstappen has taken three GPs and one sprint win from four meetings. Five races and two sprints are still to come and it is worth observing that since the Dutch GP neither McLaren driver has finished in front of the world champion.The timing has played its part. McLaren ceased development of their car some time ago, shifting resources to the 2026 model, butRed Bullcontinued to address the failings that had stymied them all season. Since the new team principal, Laurent Mekies, took over from Christian Horner in July, that they have been successful in doing so has been increasingly evident.In recent meetings on a variety of circuits and conditions the team appear to have solved the narrow operating window that was hampering performance, an achievement Verstappen has admitted that “nobody expected”.When asked his reaction had someone suggested he would be in this position back at the Dutch GP, he was blunt. “No I would have told them he was an idiot,” he said.He has cited a “different philosophy”, a new working approach that suggests the RB21 was never quite the undriveable beast the first half of the season indicated but rather that its consistent performance had to be teased out. Every indication after this sweeping victory in the US is that they have done so and Verstappen is now wielding it with joyful precision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet at no point this weekend did either of the McLaren drivers look like they had the edge on Verstappen.The sprint crash was costly with both Norris and Piastri taken out, but in qualifying Norris was still three‑tenths off Verstappen’s pole time and in race pace, even McLaren’s previous ace in the hole for so long, being able to work its tyres harder and longer, had been at least matched in the US by the Red Bull.Quick GuideUS Grand Prix results and standingsShow1Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1hr 34mins 161sec2Lando Norris(GB) McLarenat 7.959sec3Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrariat 15.3734Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrariat 28.5365Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLarenat 29.6786George Russell(GB) Mercedesat 33.4567Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bullat 52.7148Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauberat57.2499Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F1at 1:04.72210Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martinat 1:10.00111Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bullsat 1:13.20912Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martinat 1:14.77813Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedesat 1:15.74614Alexander Albon(Tha) Williamsat 1:20.00015Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haasat 1:23.04316Isack Hadjar(Fra) Racing Bullsat 1:32.80717Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpineat 1 lap18Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick Sauberat 1 lap19Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpineat 1 lapDNF: Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams5 laps completedFastest Lap:Antonelli1min 37.577secs on lap 33Drivers' standings:1Oscar Piastri346pts, 2Lando Norris332, 3Max Verstappen306, 4George Russell252, 5Charles Leclerc192, 6Lewis Hamilton142, 7Kimi Antonelli89, 8Alexander Albon73, 9Nico Hülkenberg41, 10Isack Hadjar39, 11Carlos Sainz Jr38, 12Fernando Alonso37, 13Lance Stroll32, 14Liam Lawson30, 15Esteban Ocon28, 16Yuki Tsunoda28, 17Pierre Gasly20, 18Oliver Bearman20, 19Gabriel Bortoleto18, 20Franco Colapinto0, 21Jack Doohan0Constructors' standings:1McLaren678pts (champions), 2Mercedes341, 3Ferrari334, 4Red Bull331, 5Williams111, 6Racing Bulls72, 7Aston Martin69, 8Sauber59, 9Haas48, 10Alpine20Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Stella was insistent this weekend that the team had no intention yet of prioritising either driver to see off a threat from Verstappen – but after the US GP that consideration has surely become all the more pressing and one amplified by the inexorable assuredness Verstappen demonstrated in Austin.Lewis Hamilton was fourth for Ferrari and George Russell finished sixth for Mercedes.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenRed BullMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Broncos coach Sean Payton ran out onto the field to argue the call and was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. That put the ball at the one and Dart took it from there.The Broncos had taken a 30-26 lead on Nix’s 18-yard keeper with 1:51 remaining.The Broncos were actually in danger of getting shut out at home for the first time in their 66-year history when they were blanked for three quarters.The Giants, who grabbed a 26-8 lead on a deflected touchdown catch with 10:22 remaining, left several points on the field on two missed extra points and a failed two-point conversion.Dart threw a trio of touchdown passes, one of them to Cam Skattebo, as the Giants built their big lead.Harvey’s two-yard TD catch came on a deflected pass, and Nix’s two-point pass to Sutton made it 19-8, but on the ensuing drive, on third-and-17 from the Denver 41, the Giants got their own ricocheted touchdown when tight end Theo Johnson hauled in Dart’s pass after it went off wide receiver Wan’Dale Robinson’s hands and raced into the end zone.Trailing 26-8, the Broncos scored twice sandwiched around Justin Strnad’s interception that set up his offense at the New York 19. First, Nix scored on a seven-yard keeper, then threw a two-point pass to Franklin to make it 26-16 with 5:13 remaining. Then he hit Harvey from two yards out to make it 26-23.The Broncos’ comeback came on a day the franchise honored the late Demaryius Thomas by inducting him into the team’s ring of fame.By the halftime ceremony, the Giants had taken a 13-0 lead highlighted by Dart’s 44-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Benninger in the first quarter and his 13-yard strike to Scattebo in the second quarter for the rookie running back’s first career TD grab.New York made it 19-0 on Tyrone Tracy Jr’s 31-yard scamper late in the third quarter, but the two-point conversion failed.Philadelphia Eagles 28-22 Minnesota VikingsJalen Hurts gave his lagging offense a jolt by throwing for 326 yards and three touchdowns, Jalyx Hunt returned an interception for a score, and the Philadelphia Eagles rebounded from back-to-back losses by hanging on to beat the Minnesota Vikings 28-22 on Sunday.Hurts went 19 for 23 in the highlight-reel revival of the passing attack that helped the Eagles (5-2) win the Super Bowl last season, hitting AJ Brown for two touchdowns and DeVonta Smith for a career-high 183 receiving yards that included a 79-yard score.Facing third-and-9 from their 44 with 1:45 left and the Vikings (3-3) still holding two timeouts, Hurts dropped back and dropped a 45-yard rainbow into Brown’s arms to seal it after he beat former teammate Isaiah Rodgers with a slick double move up the sideline. Rodgers, in his first season with the Vikings, also got beat on Smith’s touchdown.Carson Wentz went 26 for 42 for 313 yards on an erratic afternoon, getting picked off twice in his own territory and struggling on the other end while the Vikings had to settle for Will Reichard’s field goals on five of six possessions inside the 20.Wentz said during the week he’s too far removed from his time with Philadelphia to carry a grudge into this game, having made Minnesota his sixth stop in six seasons, but he didn’t give his original team his best performance – particularly in the red zone.Washington Commanders 22-44 Dallas CowboysDak Prescott threw for three touchdowns, including a 74-yarder to CeeDee Lamb, DaRon Bland returned an interception 68 yards for a score after Jayden Daniels left with a hamstring injury and the Cowboys beat the Commanders 44-22 on Sunday.Lamb had 110 yards on five catches after a high ankle sprain kept him out of the previous three games, when George Pickens sparkled without his new sidekick, then had just as much of an impact with them sharing the spotlight again.Pickens’ 44-yard catch keyed a 35-second touchdown drive for a 27-15 lead in the final minute of the first half after Daniels had scored on a one-yard run with 45 seconds to go before the break.Javonte Williams ran for 116 yards a touchdown for Dallas (3-3-1).On the first possession of the second half for Washington (3-4), Daniels, who has already missed two games with a knee injury this season, injured his right hamstring while losing a fumble on Shemar James’ sack. The AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year grabbed behind his leg after getting dragged down by James as the ball came out.Marcus Mariota replaced Daniels, and his first possession ended when he scrambled left and threw deep the other way to Jeremy McNichols. Bland was waiting for the throw and went untouched on the pick-six. Bland set an NFL record two years ago with five interception returns for touchdowns.Green Bay Packers 27-23 Arizona CardinalsJosh Jacobs ran for a go-ahead, one-yard touchdown with 1:50 remaining, Micah Parsons had a career-high three sacks and the Packers rallied from an early 10-point deficit to beat the Cardinals 27-23 on Sunday.Green Bay (4-1-1) fought through a sluggish first half to win their first road game of the season. The Packers had their share of adversity this weekend – the team’s travel was reportedly delayed roughly five hours on Saturday because of mechanical issues with their airplane in Wisconsin.Arizona (2-5) had a chance to win the game on its final offensive drive but Jacoby Brissett’s fourth-down pass was batted away in the end zone with six seconds left. Brissett – filling in for the injured Kyler Murray – threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns.The Cardinals have lost five straight games by a combined 13 points. They’re just the third NFL team to lose by four points or less in five straight, joining the 2017 San Francisco 49ers and 1984 Cleveland Browns.Jacobs was a game-time decision because of an illness and calf injury, but produced his third straight two-touchdown game. He finished with 55 yards rushing and also ran for a seven-yard touchdown in the third quarter.Green Bay’s Jordan Love completed 19 of 29 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown.Indianapolis Colts 38-24 Los Angeles ChargersDaniel Jones threw for 288 yards and two scores, Jonathan Taylor had his third three-touchdown game of the season and the Colts beat the Chargers 38-24 on Sunday for their NFL-leading sixth win.The Colts (6-1) also snapped a five-game skid in Los Angeles after losing to the Rams at SoFi Stadium last month. They hadn’t beaten the Chargers, Rams or now-Las Vegas Raiders in L.A. since 1986. Overall, the Colts hadn’t beat the Chargers since Sept. 25, 2016, in Indianapolis.Off to their best start since 2009, the AFC South-leading Colts led 23-3 at halftime while holding the Chargers to 10 rushing yards on six carries. The Colts scored 2 1/2 minutes into the game on Taylor’s 23-yard TD run and never looked back.Jones was 23 of 34. Taylor had 16 carries for 94 yards.The Chargers (4-3) never led while losing for the third time in four games despite a career-high 423 passing yards and three touchdowns by Justin Herbert. His 37 completions set a franchise record.Carolina Panthers 13-6 New York JetsBryce Young threw a touchdown pass before leaving with an ankle injury, Jaycee Horn had two interceptions of Tyrod Taylor after New York benched Justin Fields and the Panthers beat the winless Jets 13-6 in a snoozefest Sunday for their third straight victory.It marked the first time since Young was drafted with the No. 1 overall pick in 2023 that the Panthers (4-3) have a three-game winning streak with him as their starting quarterback – but he was unable to finish this one.And now the concern is if Young will be out for any extended time.Young went to the locker room late in the third quarter, appearing to walk with a slight limp. The Panthers announced his return was questionable before ruling him out.Andy Dalton took over with 34 seconds left in the quarter when Carolina got the ball back leading 13-3 following an interception by Horn in the end zone. Young was sacked by Jowon Briggs for a 12-yard loss on his last snap before the Panthers punted.Las Vegas Raiders 0-31 Kansas City ChiefsPatrick Mahomes threw for 286 yards and three touchdowns in less than three quarters of work, Rashee Rice caught two of the TD passes in his return from a six-game suspension, and the Chiefs beat the Raiders 31-0 on Sunday.Rice finished with seven catches for 42 yards in his first game since Week 4 last season, when he tore his ACL in a collision with Mahomes. He made it back from the injury in time to participate in the offseason and training camp, then was suspended before the start of the season for his role in a high-speed car crash on a Dallas highway in March 2024.Rice’s return sparked an offense that scored on its first five possessions and finished with 434 yards in all.It didn’t help Las Vegas to play most of the game without star pass rusher Maxx Crosby, who left with a knee injury.The Chiefs (4-3) were nearly as good on defense, though, holding the Raiders to three first downs and 96 yards while beating them for the 10th time in the last 11 matchups. Geno Smith finished 10 of 16 for 67 yards, while Ashton Jeanty, one of the NFL’s top rookies, carried just six times for 21 yards.View image in fullscreenPhiladelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts tries to avoid a tackle from Minnesota linebacker Eric Wilson during the first half of Sunday’s game.Photograph: Abbie Parr/APNew England Patriots 31-13 Tennessee TitansDrake Maye threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns and the New England Patriots beat the Tennessee Titans 31-13 Sunday in coach Mike Vrabel’s first game against the franchise that fired him in January 2024.The Patriots (5-2) won their fourth straight to keep them atop the AFC East and spoil Mike McCoy’s debut as Tennessee’s interim head coach.Fans chanted “Vrabel, Vrabel” as the clock ticked down.With a 135.9 passer rating, Maye became only the third player under the age of 24 with at least 200 yards passing and a passer rating of 100 or higher in six straight games in NFL history. He joined Patrick Mahomes (seven consecutive in 2018) and Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino (six in 1984).Linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson had two of the Patriots’ five sacks and returned a fumble four yards for a touchdown. Harold Landry III had the final sack against the team that released him in March, and Marcus Jones had an interception in the final minutes.New Orleans Saints 14-26 Chicago BearsDennis Allen’s defense dominated his former team, and the Bears beat the Saints 26-14 on Sunday for their fourth straight win.Allen, the Bears’ defensive coordinator, had to like what he saw in his first game against the Saints since they fired him as head coach midway through last season after two and a half years. The Bears forced four turnovers and sacked Spencer Rattler four times.Montez Sweat set the tone with an early strip-sack that led to a field goal. Nahshon Wright set up the game’s first touchdown with a long interception return, and the Bears (4-2) overcame a spotty performance by Caleb Williams to match their best streak since the 2018 NFC North championship team closed the regular season with four straight wins. They also had a much easier time after winning 25-24 at both Las Vegas and Washington.New Orleans (1-6) continued their worst start since opening 1-7 in 1999 under then-coach Mike Ditka, the Hall of Famer and Super Bowl-winning coach with the Bears.Miami Dolphins 6-31 Cleveland BrownsQuinshon Judkins scored three touchdowns and the Browns snapped a three-game losing streak with a 31-6 victory over the Dolphins on Sunday.Judkins, the 36th overall pick in April’s draft, had 84 yards rushing on 25 carries. He is the first Browns running back with three rushing scores in a game since Nick Chubb in 2022.Cormerback Tyson Campbell, acquired from theJacksonville Jaguarson 9 October, returned an interception for a touchdown on the first play of the second half as the Browns (2-5) got over the 17-point hump for the first time in 12 games.Rayshawn Jenkins added an interception and fumble recovery as the Browns had four takeaways in a game for the first time in nearly two seasons.Los Angeles Rams 35-7 Jacksonville JaguarsMatthew Stafford threw three of his five touchdown passes to Davante Adams and the Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 on a rainy Sunday at Wembley Stadium.Stafford, who has thrown 12 touchdowns with no interceptions in his past four games, also connected with rookie receiver Konata Mumpfield and rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson in the London rout.The Rams (5-2) are off to their best start since their Super Bowl-winning season in 2021. Star receiver Puka Nacua missed the game with an ankle injury.The only highlight for the Jaguars (4-3) was rookie two-way star Travis Hunter getting his first NFL touchdown. It made the score 28-7 in the fourth quarter.Adams, who caught two touchdown passes in the first half, then added a third on a one-yard jump ball that sent Jags fans to the exits.Explore more on these topicsNFLLos Angeles RamsJacksonville JaguarsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Over a longer period, their home record is just three wins in 18 games, leaving Frank to face the line of questioning that stalked his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou.“It’s not that simple,” Frank said of Tottenham’s struggles at home. “We performed well against Burnley, Wolves and Villa, but not against Bournemouth. A clear draw became a defeat today. The fans were good, and helped with what they could. They would have loved a 3-0 win and the place rocking, but it wasn’t to be. We looked quite good, but lost 2-1 due to two top quality goals.”View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers celebrates after scoring Aston Villa’s first goal of the season.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersVilla in contrast are flying, with this hard-fought victory appearing to confirm their pre-international break revival could become permanent. After five successive wins in all competitions the misery of a disappointing,PSR-affected summerand slow start to the season seems like a distant memory.As Frank suggested the visitors’ goals were worthy of winning any game, with Rogers beating Guglielmo Vicario with a long-range curler from the edge of the area and Buendía capitalising on some quick-thinking from Matty Cash and Lucas Digne.While Buendía has been pivotal to Villa’s recent revival with goals in previouswins against Fulhamand Feyenoord, it is Rogers’ strike which may have long-term significance.The 23-year-old scored 14 times last season but began this campaign in the doldrums in a summer where he had been linked to Chelsea, so replicating his international form, after scoring forEngland against Wales, for Villa would be a huge boost for Unai Emery.The Spaniard also declared himself equally impressed with another goal-shy England star, Ollie Watkins, who gave Villa an extra attacking edge when he came off the bench for the final half hour.“Morgan is playing and scoring, but he’s helping the team for 90 minutes,” Emery said. “He has that capacity. He was always doing his task. He’s a hard worker. When you work you show your skill. Watkins didn’t score or assist, but he played fantastic for 30 minutes. They are both very important for us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amadou Onana could only clear Mathys Tel’s corner as far as the edge of the Villa penalty, from where Tel played the ball back out to Kudus on the left flank.Kudus’ cross found João Palhinha at the back post for the Portugal midfielder to head back across goal to Bentancur, who scored with a well-controlled half-volley from just inside the penalty area. Kudus thought he had doubled Tottenham’s lead two minutes later, but was offside after running on to Micky Van de Ven’s long through ball.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Bentancur gives Tottenham a first-half lead.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesVilla’s only attempt on goal in the opening half-hour was a shot that flashed past the far post from Matty Cash, whose every touch was booed in a legacy of his reckless challenge on Bentancur two years ago. The Polish international’s tenacity created a rare opening seven minutes before half-time, with his pressure on the ball creating a half chance for Rogers, who took full advantage to score.Rogers struck the ball well, but it beat Vicario in the middle of his goal and he looked faintly embarrassed as he collected it from the back of the net, one of his first touches of a hitherto quiet afternoon.Villa were more competitive in the second half, with Donyell Malen hitting the side-netting just before the hour, but their winner was still unexpected. A cleared corner fell on the halfway line to Cash, who showed great vision to attack the ball and play a thunderous half-volley to the right for Digne, who released Buendía. The Argentine cut in from the flank and beat Vicario to seal the points.Rogers and Buendía showed real quality in crucial moments in a manner which proved beyond Tottenham, who continue to be troubled by familiar failings.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Earlier Heather Knight’s third ODI century in her 300th international set up the exciting finale.India were left needing 27 off 18 but, defying England’s recent reputation of falling to pieces under pressure, Linsey Smith conceded just four runs from the 48th over and then defended 14 off the last to ensure England came out on top.England beat India by four runs to book World Cup semi-final spot – as it happenedRead moreSmith had earlier taken the crucial wicket of Smriti Mandhana, whose 88 from 94 balls looked to be taking India to a straightforward victory until, hobbling with cramp caused by the sweltering humidity, the Indian vice-captain sent a catch into the hands of long-off with 55 runs still needed.Still, with six wickets in hand, the match was India’s to lose, and their clutch all-rounder Deepti Sharma hit just enough boundaries to keep them in touch, bringing up her half-century in the 46th over. But Richa Ghosh holed out to Knight at cover the very next ball, before Deepti herself slog-swept into the hands of Sophia Dunkley at deep midwicket in the next over, leaving too much for Amanjot Kaur and Sneh Rana to do.Tournament hosts India are now fighting it out with New Zealand for the fourth semi-final spot and will need to beat the White Ferns on Thursday – plus avoid defeat in their final match against Bangladesh – to be sure of qualification.View image in fullscreenNat Sciver-Brunt hugs teammate Emma Lamb after England’s win.Photograph: Matt Roberts-ICC/ICC/Getty Images“I can’t quite comprehend what’s just happened,” Smith told Sky Sports. “The fight that we showed at the end there was amazing. For me, it was trying not to overcomplicate it too much. I’ve been practising that death plan all week, trying to bowl a tight line into their heels.”With both teams still pushing for a place in the semi-finals, this was the tournament’s standout crunch match to date, and the capacity Indore crowd were treated to a nailbiter – albeit not the result they had been hoping for.Knight’s century enabled England to post 288 after choosing to bat first. “I was desperate to put in a statement performance on a big-cap occasion and I’m really pleased that I did that,” Knight told Sky Sports.View image in fullscreenSmriti Mandhana’s 94-ball 88 proved to be in vain.Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/MB Media/Getty ImagesIt was a formidable total that would have required India to pull off a record run-chase – but nonetheless there was a feeling that England had undershot on a very good batting track. Knight’s run-out in the 45th over, wrongly chancing the arm of Amanjot Kaur at deep square leg, proved to be the catalyst for a very on-brand collapse: England lost five wickets for 31 runs and what should have been a 300+ total crashed and burned. The head coach, Charlotte Edwards, who had chosen to keep the faith with her established lineup despite unconvincing showings against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, might well have raised an eyebrow in the dugout.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Capsey dismissal was a smart piece of cricket to a poor piece of decision-making: Deepti spotted the batter’s pre-meditated reverse, adjusted her line, and tangled her up so much that the ball ended up in the hands of cover.Earlier, India’s swing-queen Renuka Singh Thakur – brought back into the XI for this match due to England’s recent struggles against new-ball movement – had been unlucky to finish wicketless after a hooping five-over opening spell. Instead, it was Deepti who broke England’s 73-run opening partnership in her first over of the day, bowling Tammy Beaumont round her legs. However, England’s tormentor with the ball could not quite finish the job with the bat.View image in fullscreenEngland celebrate after the wicket of India’s Deepti Sharma.Photograph: Sahiba Chawdhary/Reuters“I’m so, so happy,” a relieved Nat Sciver-Brunt told Sky Sports. “We haven’t really been tested towards the end of our innings with the ball. Everyone showed how calm they were and were really clear in what they wanted to do.”Meanwhile her opposite number, Harmanpreet Kaur, will be as much under pressure as ever, despite her own run-a-ball 70 in Indore. India once again failed to use the DRS system effectively: twice in the England innings they reviewed on-field decisions which replays showed were drifting down leg, taking their tally of unsuccessful reviews up to eight. It might not have cost them the match against England but if the trend continues it could yet cost them a place in the semi-finals.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupIndia women's cricket teamEngland women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Borthwick has immediately responded to calls to involve a player who evidently possesses the qualities to thrive at Test level, despite the headline-grabbing performance over the weekend being the first time he started for Saracens in the Prem. The 6ft 5in wing has represented his country at under-18 and under-20 level.The former England captainOwen Farrell is overlooked by Borthwick, as expected, despite being available again after his return from a spell with Racing 92 and the absence due to injury of the inside-centre Seb Atkinson of Gloucester. Fraser Dingwall, Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade are among Borthwick’s midfield options – with Tommy Freeman of Northampton also aiming to continue hisdesired switch to outside-centre.Slade orchestrated Exeter’s dominant 38-0 win against Exeter on Sunday, scoring 23 points, while Harlequins’ Chandler Cunninham-South is included by Borthwick despite going off injured at Sandy Park.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Corinth crossed the line half a length in front and while Loz Vegas was awarded the race in the stewards’ room, the interference was deemed to be accidental as a result of Corinth “racing green”.The race at Sandown which William Haggis used as an example of a ‘professional foul’ by jockey Oisin Murphy.“There was an example that really, really upset me,” Haggas said. “I’ve been very upset over the past few years with the professional foul that jockeys do, that sort of leaning across a horse and then pulling the stick through and winning by a length.“But if you are in a bicycle race and you have to stop suddenly, then you can’t actually get going again. When horses win by a length, they say ‘it’s won too easily’ [to be sure that the runner-up has been denied the win]. The jockeys know and they do it a lot.“The incident with Corinth at Sandown, I thought he [Murphy] deliberately made sure that Harry Davies didn’t win that race. It got taken off him, but to say that was accidental is complete and utter madness. We have to step on this sort of thing because that, in my opinion, was bordering on dangerous. If [Davies] had fallen and gone to hospital, they would have made a song and dance about it. That is not the way to be riding from our champion jockey.”While he was sharply critical of what he sees as potentially dangerous tactics employed by Murphy and other riders, Haggas also suggested that the blame lies with stewarding panels failing to treat such incidents as deliberate, and accepting jockeys’ explanations – such as that inexperienced horses are running “green” – too readily.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday racing tipsShowBath1.55 Jedhi Knight 2.25 Rejjien 2.55 Tai Hang Pegasus 3.25 Double Naughty 3.55 Asinara 4.25 On Edge 5.00 Baynoona 5.35 GladiadoraPontefract2.03 Salkadan 2.33 Rawalpindi Express 3.03 Shayem 3.33 Stormy Impact 4.03 Divine Comedy 4.33 Spirit Lead Me 5.08 ArnhemPlumpton2.10 Kajikia 2.40 King Of The Story 3.10 Hill Station 3.40 Alien Storm 4.10 Tapley 4.42 Masterdream 5.17 Hurst HillWolverhampton4.55 Beautiful Dawn 5.30 Mwafaq (nap) 6.00 Visually 6.30 Noble Vow 7.00 Trojan Truth (nb) 7.30 Blue Anthem 8.00 Suzuka  8.30 Meet Me In MerakiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“That’s not his [Murphy’s] fault,” Haggas said. “He’s been allowed to get away with it. That is something stewards should be looking at more closely. Personally, I would not have jockeys in stewards’ inquiries because they look after themselves.”Murphy, who is riding at Longchamp on Sunday afternoon, has not responded publicly to Haggas’ comments – but they were reposted on his official X account.

Juventus thought they had equalised in the 36th minute when Jonathan David slotted home from close range, but the Canadian’s effort was ruled out for offside in the buildup.‘Rashford is a role model for me’: Abu Kamara’s journey from Hull to La LigaRead moreEarly in the second half, Kempf required treatment for a cut to his forehead after an accidental clash with his teammate Jacobo Ramón but was able to continue with heavy strapping.

Victory moves Cesc Fàbregas’s side up to sixth in the table, above Juventus on goal difference.Paz has contributed to eight of Como’s nine league goals this season with four goals and four assists in seven matches, the most inSerie A. After the game, Fàbregas revealed he spoke to his former Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger, before the game.“I thank [Arsène] because at 16 he believed in me, just as I believe in Nico Paz, who is a champion,” Fàbregas told Dazn. “I’m very confident about his future because I can recognise when a player has the mindset to become a top player. If he continues like this, he can go wherever he wants.”Juventus, meanwhile, face a tough task to end their winless run in midweek – they go to the Bernabéu in the Champions League on Wednesday. They began the league season brightly but the goals have dried up since their 4-3 win over Inter last month.Tudor brought on the striker Dusan Vlahovic for the midfielder Manuel Locatelli in the 77th minute, two minutes before Paz’s goal. “I don’t know who else plays with two strikers and two wingers, probably only us,” Tudor said.“We believed this setup was the best for the team and I think it was the right choice regardless of the result … but against a side like Como you have to run a lot. We got caught on that counterattack and at 2-0 the game was over, there was nothing left to do.”View image in fullscreenBologna enjoyed an overdue away win at Cagliari to move into the top five.Photograph: ® Gianluca Zuddas/LaPresse/ShutterstockBolognaalso overtook Juve and went fifth with a 2-0 win atCagliari.Emil Holm’s close-range finish and Riccardo Orsolini’s strike from the edge of the area earned a first away win in seven league games for Vincenzo Italiano’s side.Atalantaremain unbeaten but drew for the fifth time in seven league games as they were held to a goalless draw by mid-tableLazio.Genoaclimbed off the bottom after a stalemate at home toParma, who had Abdoulaye Ndiaye sent off late in the first half.Later on Sunday in Italy,Milanclimbed to the top of the table with a 2-1 win at home against strugglingFiorentina.

Sean Dyche and Roberto Mancini are among the candidates who have been sounded out.Nottingham Forest approach Dyche and Mancini after Postecoglou sackedRead moreMarinakis has turned his interest to Silva, whose buyout clause has been reported to be as high as £13m. Forest recognise it would cost to extract Silva from his contract at Craven Cottage, which expires at the end of the season.Forest are mindful of financial restrictions, having sacked two managers this season and furnished the squad at a cost of about £200m this summer, but Marinakis is a longstanding admirer of Silva having appointed him at Olympiakos, where the Portuguese coach won the Greek Super League in 2015-16.Crucially, Silva is thought to be interested in the Forest job, with the club among the favourites to win the Europa League at the outset. The 48-year-old coach has been atFulhamsince 2021 and in England has also managed Everton, Watford and Hull in the Premier League.Silva was linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2023, only to sign a three-year deal keeping him at Craven Cottage until 2026.There was unrest in the summer of this year as Fulham were slow in the transfer market: only the Brazilian forward Kevin arriving as a permanent outfield signing, with two loans in Samuel Chukwueze from Milan and Jonah Kusi-Asare, a teenager from Bayern Munich who is yet to make a first-team appearance.Silva would be joining his fifth Premier League club, should he depart Fulham, where he has established the London club in the top division; this is their fourth in succession after promotion was secured from the Championship in 2021-22.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is possible Starmer will not travel to the G20 but instead send his deputy, David Lammy, asking him to take up the prime minister’s duties as he did at the UN general assembly last month.The UK is also due to chair the G20 in 2027, an event that threatens to show how far the UK has fallen as an aid superpower since the then prime minister Gordon Brown chaired the G20 in 2009.The new polling was conducted by More in Common for the One Campaign, which said that if the UK matched the£1bn contribution to the fundmade by Rishi Sunak three years ago, 1.7 million lives would be saved over the next three years.There are few aid institutions that are seen as so effective as the Global Fund. Since its formation in 2002, the its vaccines-based strategies have saved 70 million lives. It is seeking to raise $18bn (£13.5bn) at its next replenishment summit in November.The foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, is under Treasury pressure to cut the UK’s contribution to the fund after February’s 40% reduction to the Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget. An announcement on the three-year UK commitment is likely to come before the budget.At the WorldHealthSummit in Berlin, Germany announced a €1bn (£870m) commitment to the Global Fund, exceeding expectations and adding to the pressure on Starmer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In contrast to the moderate Erhürman, the hard-right nationalist had been openly backed by Ankara.News of the result was met with scenes of euphoria in the Turkish-occupied north. Analysts described the electoral win as a potential gamechanger on an island that has been ethnically split for more than 50 years between Greeks in the internationally recognised south and Turks in the north.“His win offers hope for peace on Cyprus,” the former MEP Niyazi Kızılyürek said on Sunday. “Supporters say they expect real change in everyday life, starting with confidence-building measures, and everyone expects that he will want to resume negotiations based on UN resolutions very soon.”View image in fullscreenErhürman’s supporters celebrate his resounding win.Photograph: Yiannis Kourtoglou/ReutersThe outcome, he told the Guardian, would be “a test” for Greek Cypriots. “Its easy when the opposite side doesn’t want to talk, which was the case with Tatar. Now they will be forced to respond to a charismatic Turkish Cypriot leader who wants to sit down and negotiate.”UN-brokered negotiations to reunite Cyprus have been on pause sincethey spectacularly broke downin the Swiss mountain town of Crans-Montana eight years ago – the longest hiatus in the peace process ever.Polls had indicated a neck-and-neck race between the election’s two main contenders.The scale of Erhürman’s victory showed that the decidedly secular Turkish Cypriots were tired of isolationist policies that had seen the territory become increasingly aligned with the Islamist leadership of the ruling AKP party in Ankara, as well as wanting a shift towards Europe. The community has long complained of its identity being eroded under the influence of Turkey, the only country to acknowledge the breakaway republic.“Supporters of Erhürman see themselves as an autonomous ethno-political community, not as Turks of Cyprus, and they want to keep it that way,” said Kızılyürek, adding that the children of Turkish settlers born in the north had been especially appalled by what they perceived as the “anti-democratic turn” of Turkey in recent years.“They voted for Erhürman in a big way because they want their future to be in the European Union,” he said.View image in fullscreenErsin Tatar speaks to the media after casting his ballot.Photograph: Birol Bebek/AFP/Getty ImagesCyprus has been divided since 1974 when a coup aimed at union with Greece – engineered by the military junta then in power in Athens – prompted Turkey to invade and seize the island’s northern third.

I’ll keep my head held high, including at the prison gates,” Sarkozy toldLa Tribune de Dimanche. He has been ordered to present himself at the gates ofLa Santéprison in the south of Paris early on Tuesday morning. He said he had asked for “no privileges” in his treatment behind bars.Sarkozy, 70, toldLe Figarothat he had packed family photos and three books, as permitted for the first week. “I’m bringingThe Count of Monte Cristoand two volumes of the biography of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils,” he said.He is expected to be held in solitary confinement for his own security, in an individual cell of about 9 metres squared. He will have no mobile phone, but will have a small television. A security-controlled phoneline will allow him contact with his lawyers and family. He is expected to have the right to two visits a week from family. He told Le Figaro that he’d been advised to take earplugs. “At night you hear lots of noise, shouting, screaming,” he said.‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in raid by ‘experienced’ thievesRead moreSarkozy will be able to leave his cell for one hour a day, to walk in an interior courtyard, with the opening to the sky protected by wire mesh. Three prison guards will accompany him when he leaves his cell.“My life is a novel and this ordeal is now part of it,” Sarkozy told Le Figaro. He said: “They wanted to make me disappear but this will make me be reborn.”La Santé prison has held some of Frances’s most famous prisoners in its 158-year history, including the terrorist Carlos the Jackal and the war criminal Maurice Papon.Sarkozy’s son, Louis, who is preparing to run for mayor in Menton on the French Riviera next spring, urged supporters to stand near Sarkozy’s home in the 16tharrondissement ofParisto cheer him off as he is driven to prison on Tuesday.Sarkozy wasfound guilty last monthof criminal conspiracy over a scheme to seek funding from the regime of Gaddafi for his victorious 2007 French presidential election campaign.View image in fullscreenMuammar Gaddafi and Sarkozy meet in Tripoli, Libya, in 2007.Photograph: Sipa Press/REX/ShutterstockThe lead judge, Nathalie Gavarino, justified the five-year prison sentence by saying the facts of the case were of an “exceptional gravity” and “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.During the trial, the public prosecutor had told the court that Sarkozy entered into a “Faustian pact of corruption with one of the most unspeakable dictators of the last 30 years” to gain election funding from Gaddafi.Sarkozy was acquitted of three separate charges of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding.At his trial, Sarkozy denied wrongdoing and said he was not part of a criminal conspiracy to seek election funding from Libya. He has appealed against his conviction. A new trial is expected in about six months. But the nature of Sarkozy’s prison sentence means he must go to jail as his appeal process plays out.The former president’s lawyers are expected toformally ask for his releaseas soon as he arrives at the prison, and a court will have two months to examine the request. The court could order Sarkozy’s release under judicial supervision or home arrest with an ankle tag. It could also decide against letting him out of prison if, for example, it deems it the only way to prevent evidence tampering or witness intimidation.Althoughthe allegations of a secret campaign funding pact with the Libyan regimeformed the biggest corruption trial Sarkozy had faced, he had already been convicted in two separate cases and stripped of France’s highest distinction, the Legion of Honour.Sarkozy had previously become the first former French head of state forced to wear an electronic tag after being convicted in aseparate case of corruption and influence peddlingover illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge. In that case, he was given a one year jail term but was able to serve it with an electronic tag worn around the ankle. He wore the tag for three months before being granted conditional release.The presiding judge in the criminal conspiracy trial receiveddeath threatsfrom unknown people after the verdict last month, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to publicly call out such attacks as “unacceptable”.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisNicolas SarkozyMuammar GaddafiEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We have since taken action by calling in that application.”Opponents of the proposed complex, which would span across 20,000 sq metres to become the biggest embassy in Europe, are preparing to seek a judicial review of the decision if it is approved. Mark Nygate, the treasurer of the Royal Mint Court Residents Association, said they were raising the funds to challenge it.The matter is quasi-judicial, meaning the minister responsible for it – currently the housing secretary,Steve Reed– must make his decision objectively under the law and with an open mind.In his opinion, Banner stressed that “for now there has been no disclosure or formal evidence as to whether any ‘assurances’ have been given” or what the nature of such assurances were.But he wrote that if the prime minister had made a promise to Beijing, for example, that “would be seen by the fair-minded and informed observer to generate a real possibility or real risk that the secretary of state (at least if he was aware of the promise) had a closed mind on the basis that collective cabinet responsibility required him to uphold the prime minister’s promise”.He said it was of “critical importance” that any relevant written evidence, including any records indicating that assurances were given, must be preserved by the government, which will be obliged to disclose them if there is a judicial review. Reed’s department was contacted for comment.Last week China expressed“grave concern and strong dissatisfaction” after ministers delayed their decision over the embassy until 10 December. It said the government had shown “disregard for contractual spirit, acting in bad faith and without integrity”.Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, saidChinahad acted with “the utmost sincerity and patience” over the matter and the UK should “immediately fulfil its obligations and honour its commitments, otherwise the British side shall bear all consequences”.Downing Street said it did not “recognise any claims of commitments or assurances” over the embassy application on Friday.Luke de Pulford, executive director of the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), said: “Lord Banner has laid down a marker. If the rumours are proven true and unlawful assurances were given to Beijing, the government could face a catastrophic judicial review, where all the details would be laid bare.”On Sunday the government categorically denied any political interference inthe decision to drop charges against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, accused of spying for China.A government spokesperson said “there was absolutely no political interference with the evidence provided in this case” and denied reports thatMatthew Collins, the official who drafted the evidence, privately acknowledged it was influenced by political considerations. “This is categorically untrue,” they said.The Sunday Times reported that Christopher Berry, one of the two men who had been charged with espionage, was carrying £4,000 in cash when he was stopped by police under terrorism laws after flying into Heathrow from China in February 2023. Both Berry and his co-accused, Christopher Cash, deny wrongdoing.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said at the time: “A man in his 30s was subject to a stop at Heathrow airport on 2 February 2023 under Schedule 3 of the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019. He was not arrested and enquiries continued.”Explore more on these topicsChinaPlanning policyForeign policyKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

If it spreads or comes back after standard treatment, patients may be offered immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy. But if this fails, there is often little else doctors can do.Research showed a drug called amivantamab, given as an injection, can shrink tumours in patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer who had tried immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Details were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Berlin.Prof Kevin Harrington, a professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute ofCancerResearch in London, and consultant oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, said: “To see this level of benefit for patients who have endured numerous treatments is incredibly encouraging.“This could represent a real shift in how we treat head and neck cancer – not just in terms of effectiveness, but also in how we deliver care.”He added: “This is the first time we’ve tested this kind of triple-action therapy for head and neck cancer patients whose disease has returned after treatment. Amivantamab is a smart drug that not only blocks two key cancer pathways but also helps the immune system do its job.“Unlike many cancer treatments that require hours in a hospital chair, amivantamab is given as a simple injection under the skin. This makes it faster, more convenient, and potentially easier to deliver in outpatient clinics – or even at home in the future.”The Orig-AMI 4 trial, funded by the pharmaceuticals company Janssen, involved patients from 11 countries, including the UK. Each had recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) – a hard-to-treat form that often returns after standard therapies.One group of 86 patients in the study, who had received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, were given amivantamab. Early results show 76% of this group saw their tumours shrink or stop growing.‘Gamechanging’ HIV prevention jab to be approved for England and WalesRead moreResponses were seen within six weeks on average and treatment was generally well tolerated. Most side-effects were mild to moderate. Average progression-free survival of patients receiving amivantamab on its own was 6.8 months.Amivantamab is a drug that targets cancer in three ways. It blocks both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), a protein that helps tumours grow, and MET, a pathway that cancer cells often use to escape treatment. It also helps activate the immune system to attack the tumour.Carl Walsh has tongue cancer and joined the trial in July after chemotherapy and immunotherapy failed. “I’m now on my seventh cycle of treatment. It’s working well so far and I’m very happy with the progress,” the 59-year-old from Birmingham said.“Before starting the trial, I couldn’t talk properly and eating was difficult but the swelling has gone down a lot, and I’m not in the same amount of pain I used to be in. Sometimes I even forget that I have cancer.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchHealthCancerMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

That is where the bonobos sleep, 12 metres above the ground. But it has rained all night, and the primates are in no hurry to get up. It is 6.30am when the first head emerges. It gives a cry, a sharp bark, and another silhouette unfolds from its cocoon of branches. And then another. Within five minutes, the whole group is awake – yawning, stretching, straightening. Their features are fine, their limbs long and delicate, their build less stocky than that of chimpanzees, their closest cousins.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBonobos live on the left bank of the Congo RiverMountain gorillas are back from the brink. But what happens if they run out of room?Read moreBonobos live on the left bank of the Congo River, while chimpanzees spread along the right bank, extending their range from here in theDemocratic Republic of the Congoto Tanzania in east Africa and Cameroon in the west. The two species diverged about 1-2 million years ago, when a few groups of chimpanzees are thought to have crossed the river, probably during a period of exceptional drought.Those early migrants evolved differently: chimpanzees on the right bank developed male-dominated societies, sustaining traditions of collective hunting and recurring conflict with other groups. Among bonobos,females are the dominant sex, and their societies are less aggressive and more peaceful. When primatologists began studying them in the wild in the 1970s, they noticed how conflict was often defused by brief sexual encounters. The press of the day dubbed them “hippy apes”.View image in fullscreenBonobos are increasingly threatened by human activity such as poaching and deforestationIt was around the village of Wamba, just north of the equator, that scientific research into these primates first began. The Japanese primatologist Takayoshi Kano set up the first observation post there in 1973. A second was opened the following year at Lomako, farther west, and a few others followed. Today, four sites remain active: Kokolopori, LuiKotale in Salonga national park, Lomako-Yokokala and Wamba.Over the past 50 years, studies at these sites have revealed the distinctive traits of bonobos: the dominant role played by females in social organisation; the function of sex as a lubricant for daily interactions; their tolerant nature, heightened emotional sensitivity and willingness to cooperate, which reveals an astonishing capacity for empathy – qualities once thought absent from the animal kingdom.This year, a study carried out in the community reserve of Kokolopori and published in Science in April found that bonobos were capable of combining vocalisations in complex ways, much like the structuring of human language. “This discovery challenges what we thought we knew about animal communication and the supposed uniqueness of human language,” says American conservationist Sally Coxe.View image in fullscreenBonobo societies are less aggressive and more peaceful than their chimpanzee relatives on the other side of the riverIn 2002, Coxe helped protect part of the Kokolopori forest with the BonoboConservationInitiative (BCI) NGO, working with the local organisation Vie Sauvage to safeguard the last remaining bonobos there – and to study them, in partnership with Harvard University.Yet, 20 years on, the protected area and research it facilitates face the same obstacles: almost no roads or electricity, and infrastructure is collapsing. The DRC remains one of the five poorest nations in the world, despite its immense deposits of copper, cobalt, lithium and coltan. According to the World Bank, three out of four Congolese people live on less than $2.15 (£1.60) a day.View image in fullscreenMbangi Aringo is the most senior tracker in Kokolopori forest“Since the 1990s the roads have not been maintained, vehicles can no longer use them,” says Mbangi Aringo, the most senior tracker in Kokolopori forest. “If we want to sell our crops, we have to carry them on foot or by bicycle.” Now in his 50s, he says: “If BCI had not paid me a salary to observe the bonobos, I would have become a farmer and struggled to feed my family, or I would have had to hunt in the forest. I would have had no choice.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAmong Aringo’s tasks in the forest is the collection of bonobo urineAgainst this backdrop, bonobos – one of the DRC’s most emblematic species – are increasingly threatened by human activity, above all poaching and deforestation, which gnaw away at their habitat year after year. “We estimate the population at fewer than 20,000 individuals,” says Takeshi Furuichi, director of research at Wamba and a professor at Kyoto University. “Perhaps even fewer than 15,000. They are now critically endangered.”View image in fullscreenThe government is considering ‘bonobo credits’, paying for local infrastructure if communities agree not to huntIn an attempt to slow the erosion of habitat, the government and conservation organisations have been exploring the possibility of “bonobo credits”. Modelled after carbon credits, the programme would give money for infrastructure to communities that prevent hunting of bonobos and keep their forests standing.We want to bring people and nature closer togetherJef DupainPrimateologist Jef Dupain, director of the Antwerp Zoo Foundation in Kinshasa, has been involved for decades in bonobo conservation and research and is working in partnership with the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation on the pilot scheme. Their aim is to create a mechanism giving local people a direct stake in protecting wildlife. “I wanted local residents to gain real income from conservation,” he says.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: a woman works in the fields of Yetee village in the heart of the forest; a school supported by the Bonobo Conservation Initiative; Fidèle Lokonga Itembe, a member of a local NGO, Vie Sauvage, is head nurse in a local health centre; Junior Baolimo and his wife, Esther, in their sewing workshop in Yetee“Villagers who commit to respecting bonobo habitat have begun receiving monetary compensation, in the form of funding for infrastructure. The aim is to create a harmonious balance, involving civil society as a whole, unlike the older conservation model, which sought to wall off areas of biodiversity when they came under threat. We want to bring people and nature closer together.”At a roundtable discussion on bonobo credits, DRC president Félix Tshisekedi said it was an opportunity to flesh out the country’s proposal for “the creation of a biodiversity credit specific to each species, particularly emblematic species of high value to humanity such as the bonobo”.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBonobo society is dominated by females, and conflict is sometimes defused by brief sexual encountersFor those working on the ground, protecting bonobos’ last remaining habitats is crucial. “There is still much to learn from them,” Coxe says. “Their use of medicinal plants in the forest, and what humans may have learned from them in this regard. But also their communication – verbal and nonverbal – and the ways they respond to threats from humans, such as poaching.”Furuichi agrees. “Before the 1970s, the bonobo was still regarded as an unknown primate,” he says. “The discoveries made over the past five decades have helped us to better understand the evolution of humankind.”View image in fullscreenBonobo numbers may be down to just 15,000Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionWildlifeDemocratic Republic of the CongoConservation and indigenous peopleConservationHuntingAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said: “The bulldozers are very near the fen now … it seems the developers have run out of patience because it has been months, so they are just going to go on and despoil the land, and they are saying ‘take us to court to stop us’.”Richard Daws, the local councillor for Ambrook, near the wetland, said: “Despite stringent protections … we find ourselves in the position that the bulldozers are lurking at the gates of the Wolborough Fen SSSI.Cardiff becomes first UK council to impose higher parking charges on larger vehiclesRead more“Nature conservation should never be dismissed as ‘blocking’, but recognised as something fundamentally key to humanity’s future.”The developers were issued with a temporary stop notice in April by the council after concerns that their works were encroaching on the wetland. The stop notice has expired, but conditions attached to the planning permission say evidence must be provided that shows, with a high level of certainty, that the proposed development would not adversely affect the SSSI.Teignbridge district council (TDC) said it is taking legal advice on whether conditions are being breached and is considering enforcement action if necessary.DevonWildlifeTrust (DWT) said it considered the restarting of works by Vistry to be “a breach of planning control” and said they had no doubt the works would damage the three-and-a-quarter hectares (eight acres) of wetland.“On the basis of technical advice indicating significant risk to Wolborough Fen, DWT has expressed repeated concerns about the impact of planned development in the vicinity of Wolborough Fen,” the trust said in a letter. “(It) is vital that planning conditions attached to the outline permission by the secretary of state to protect Wolborough Fen SSSI are fully adhered to.”The wetland contains woodland, pools, springs and streams and is home to diverse wildlife, including a variety of dragonflies, wildflowers, rare fungi and amphibians including frogs, toads and newts. The area is also known for its significant populations of butterflies and moths. As an SSSI, it should have the greatest level of protection from the impact of any development.Vistry has applied to have the planning condition regarding the wetland lifted. Malcolm Gilmore, regional technical director of Vistry, said in a letter to the council, seen by the Guardian, that the delays over lifting of the conditions were blocking housing growth. Given seasonal weather constraints, he said Vistry “had no alternative but to commence” enabling works adjacent to the fen.Gilmore said he was in touch with government ministers on “current blockages” and was seeking their help to expedite the project.“This site was included in the government’s new homes accelerator programme … recognising its strategic importance and its contribution to the national objective of delivering 1.5m new homes during this parliamentary term,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Vistry do have reserved matters consent in place for where they are working on key infrastructure to improve the local road network.We continue to engage constructively with the council to support their review and remain fully committed to progressing the site responsibly, with sensitivity to the local environment and in line with all planning requirements.”Vistry said there was no confirmation that they were in breach of any planning condition and said it had carefully resumed limited works at Wolborough Barton, remaining outside the area affected by the earlier temporary stop notice.TDC said: “In April 2025, Teignbridge district council issued a temporary stop notice to restrict building work at the Wolborough Barton (NA3) site,” the council said. “Although the notice expired on 24 June, the developer, Vistry Devon South West, agreed not to restart work while legal matters were being considered. Since then, only agreed safety and environmental mitigation measures have taken place on site.“The developer has sought legal advice and has now informed the council of its intention to restart some infrastructure work in areas outside the Wolborough Fen SSSI hydrological catchment … TDC is currently seeking independent legal advice to determine whether restarting these works would breach planning control.”A spokesperson for the Ministry ofHousing, Communities & Local Government said: “We are determined to unblock barriers to development so we can restore the dream of homeownership.

They do not break down easily and therefore build up in the environment, water, wildlife and human bodies. Scientists have linked some Pfas (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)to cancers, hormone disruption, immune system effects and other health risks.AGC Chemicals in Lancashire has been under investigation since the Guardian and Watershed Investigations revealedhigh levels of a banned carcinogenicPfas, called PFOA, being discharged from the site into the River Wyre. People living nearby have been told not to eat food from their gardens or allotments, and PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) has been found in vegetables. AGC said while levels of Pfas had been detected, there had been no conclusion to the ongoing investigation.TheEnvironment Agencyis sampling soils and water around AGC for a range of Pfas – and has detected some, including PFOA – but it has ignored a Pfas produced by AGC called EEA-NH4, which is used in the production of chemicals used on non-stick products such as cookware.In one report on the substance, the agency estimated about800kg ofEEA-NH4 was being emitted into the River Wyre annually. In another it says the chemical is “very persistent” and “mobile” in the environment, as well as being classified as “reprotoxic category 2”. AGC said it had not been determined what, if any, public health risk there might be around the site.New independent sampling has confirmed the presence of EEA-NH4 in soils around the plant.Dr David Megson, a forensic scientist and Pfas expert who carried out the analysis, said there was “a giant chunk of toxic material” in the environment that regulators were ignoring.“Our results showed that in addition to PFOA, the soil surrounding the site consistently contains EEA-NH4 and hydrogen-substituted carboxylic acids (H-PFCAs). Less is known about them … but studies are showing that they have a similar toxicity,” Megson said. “It is essential to consider them, as any human health risk assessment that does not include these chemicals is likely to underpredict the health risks fromPfasin this area.”View image in fullscreenA spokesperson for AGC said effluent from the company’s Hillhouse site was ‘not having a significant effect’ on protected areas of the Wyre estuary.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThe Environment Agency has said it could only look for Pfas for which an established analytical standard had already been created, and there was not one available for EEA-NH4, but Megson says it is absurd to ignore known Pfas emissions from the site.“To me this highlights a key limitation of the current testing regime,” he said. “Any contaminated land investigation should carefully consider the source, receptor and pathway. There are over 7m potential Pfas – just focusing an assessment on a handful of commonly detected Pfas is not appropriate. Instead it should focus on the specific Pfas that are originating from the source – this includes EEA-NH4 and H-PFCAs.”Prof Hans Peter Arp, a Pfas expert at the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology, said: “Considering all we know about Pfas – their persistence, costly clean-up, and emerging hazards – it remains a shock that there is so little oversight of emissions from production factories.“This is not just a UK problem but a global one. We need stronger monitoring of total Pfas, not just known substances like EEA-NH4, but residuals too. Citizens, who often bear the health and remediation costs, need to know how much Pfas is being released so polluters can be held responsible and a transition to zero Pfas emissions can begin.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That assessment had now advanced “to intrusive investigations of both soil and water on-site”, with findings due to be shared with authorities early next year.The spokesperson stressed that the use of EEA-NH4 was authorised under the site’s permit, subject to Reach registration (a EU regulatory procedure), and that the Environment Agency had carried out an independent risk assessment in April 2023.“At present it has not been determined what, if any, public health risk there may be,” they said, adding that independent monitoring over four decades showed the company’s Hillhouse site’s effluent was “not having a significant effect” on protected areas of the Wyre estuary.An Environment Agency spokesperson said they were working with AGC’s Thornton-Cleveleys site “to ensure ongoing compliance with the requirements of their environmental permit”. They confirmed that, at Wyre Council’s request, the agency was “investigating the site and surrounding land for historic contamination unrelated to current operations”.“There is no strong evidence to suggest EAA-NH4 contamination is widely present in land surrounding the site,” the spokesperson added.Explore more on these topicsPfasLancashirePollutionSoilRiversEnglandEnvironment AgencynewsShareReuse this content"

They cited “violent clashes and hate crime offences” at a Maccabi Tel Avivmatch in Amsterdam in 2024.Asked on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News whether Villa Park was a no-go area for Jews, Miliband replied: “No, and it can’t be, and I’m very, very clear about that.“We cannot have a situation where any area is a no-go area for people of a particular religion or from a particular country, and we’ve got to stamp out all forms of prejudice, antisemitism, Islamophobia, wherever we find them.”Asked about a petition calling for a boycott of Israeli teams in the UK, Miliband said: “I profoundly disagree with that approach, with what is being said in that petition.”The former Labour leader said the “vast majority of Muslim people in this country would disassociate themselves” from suggestions thatMaccabi Tel Avivfans could not come to Aston Villa because it was a predominantly Muslim area. But he said “integration is not something you can ever take for granted”.The Home Officehas offered West Midlands police extra supportto ensure the match can go ahead with all fans, with ministers piling pressure on officers to reverse the ban.It emergedover the weekendthat Aston Villa told club stewards they would not have to work during the fixture, saying they understood that some might have “concerns about attending work”.The BBC reported that staff were informed they had permission to skip their duties before a decision was made to ban away fans.In an email on 3 October, stewards were told that “regarding the upcoming fixture against Maccabi Tel Aviv … we appreciate that some of you may have concerns about attending work”.Those who were meant to work on the day were told they would “be able to submit a one-off absence request” and this would “allow you to register your absence for this specific fixture”.Aston Villatold staff “this type of absence will not affect your contractual minimum attendance of 80%”.West Midlands police said they had classified Villa’s home fixture against Maccabi as “high risk” based on intelligence. The force also cited the match between Ajax and Maccabi in Amsterdam, where more than 60 people were arrested over violence that authorities said was fuelled by a “toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger”.Explore more on these topicsMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaWest MidlandsBirminghamPoliceIsraelEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

One review page was also taken down.Fake reviews have become a business, with companies dedicated to selling positive or negative feedback online.In response, regulators such as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority have made it illegal to commission or host fabricated feedback. These measures are aimed at restoring consumer confidence, but critics have questioned whether the marketplace can be policed, because of its sheer scale.Trustpilot uses artificial intelligence software to spot fake reviews. The company removed 7.4% of reviews submitted in 2024, compared with 6.1% the year before.The vast majority of removed reviews were taken down automatically by AI as it identified patterns that flagged concerns.One company that carried a 4.7-star rating was Crypto-Benefits247. After the company was flagged by the Guardian, Trustpilot removed some of its positive ratings and its score fell to 2.8. The Financial Conduct Authority has warned that the firm may be operating illegally. KwikChex found Crypto-Benefits247’s incorporation certificate was a forgery, crudely edited from another company’s legitimate document.There is a one-star score from someone who said they lost more than £65,000 to Crypto-Benefits247 after being lured in with small, successful withdrawals before the company began inventing fees for certificates, upgrades and “activation keys”.Another company, Oakvests Crypto, had a 4.5-star score but used a video of the chief executive of a different business, Oakvest, on its website. Oakvest’s finance director, David Wells, said: “We are grateful to KwikChex for alerting us to this identity theft and wish them success in tracking down the fraudsters.”Since the account was flagged to Trustpilot, Oakvests Crypto’s rating has dropped to 3.2, with a number of reviews taken down.Quantum Recovery Law Group, rated 4.1 stars from 82 reviews, presented itself as a wealth recovery law firm. TheSRA has issued a scam alert against it. Trustpilot removed the account after being presented with the findings of KwikChex’s report.The exact names of companies are used in this article, as such entities often imitate or reference real businesses.Emmins said: “The successful use of fake reviews undermines every legitimate business that works to earn a genuine reputation. Meanwhile, scammers use Trustpilot to polish their lies.”KwikChex has called on Trustpilot to drop its slogan “find a company you can trust” and to stop using “verified” banners on reviews, warning that the platform’s system is too easily exploited. In response to this specifically, Trustpilot said: “As we have not seen the mentioned report we cannot comment on its findings at this time.”None of the companies identified by KwikChex responded to the Guardian’s attempt to reach them for a comment.A spokesperson for Trustpilot said it takes the integrity of reviews extremely seriously, adding that its systems were always learning and it did not “always get it right”. They said that was why the community was encouraged to flag suspicious reviews.“We have previously taken action against the companies mentioned, removing fabricated reviews and issuing both warnings and legal cease and desist letters for guideline breaches,” the spokesperson said.“Since further concerns have been raised we have launched a deeper investigation and removed further fabricated reviews from each profile. Each profile now displays a consumer alert, warning consumers about these companies. Our investigation is ongoing.”Trustpilot said it was continuing “strengthening” its systems to stay ahead of “evolving tactics”.Explore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

He also created lyrical landscapes of the countryside around his Essex home.By his own calculation he took more than 2m photographs, averaging 100 a day, but he made that count several years ago. He continued posting archive and new images daily on social media up to a few weeks before his death, and had been planning to give a talk on his life and work at an event organised by the British Press Photographers’ Association, of which he was a founder member.View image in fullscreenBrian Harris in East Berlin, November 1989, as the East Germans break down the wall at Potsdamer Platz.Photograph: Brian Harris/TopfotoTales from a rollercoaster career included an expenses-shredding business class flight in 1991 to reach the funeral in India of the assassinated leader Rajiv Gandhi, where he collapsed from heatstroke and pneumonia and was cooled down with ice that had been used to preserve the body.His 1983 images of the then Labour party leader Neil Kinnock with his wife, Glenys, toppling into the tide on Brighton beach –a stroll taken at Harris’s suggestion– were carried across eight columns of the Times front page, and are regularly reproduced as a hideous example of photo-opportunity hubris. His 2016 memoir, ... And Then the Prime Minister Hit Me, took the title from an exasperated John Major striking him with a rolled-up briefing paper, after Harris challenged his unemployment statistics.View image in fullscreenBerlin, 12 November 1989, looking from the east towards the west.Photograph: Brian Harris/The Independent/AlamyHe had become the Times’ youngest ever staff photographer when he joined the paper in 1976, at the age of 26, and worked around the world for nearly a decade, including coverage of the end of the civil war in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He eventually resigned over what he saw as censorship of his strongest images of famine in Africa.In 1986 Harris became chief photographer as the team was assembled to create the Independent. He played a key role in forming the style of editorial photography that the paper became known for, helping raise the bar for news photography and broadsheet design, in dramatic images filling front and back pages, and photo spreads inside. Among many awards, he was named the What the Papers Say photographer of the year in 1990 for his work in eastern Europe documenting the collapse of communism.He worked as a freelance after being made redundant by the Independent’s new owners in 1999, and major projects thereafter included a year spent photographing cemeteries across the world in 2006 for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which resulted in an exhibition launched at Canada House in London – where he gave a personal tour to Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh – and a moving book, Remembered (with text by Julie Summers).View image in fullscreenWenceslas Square, Prague, where more than 500,000 protesters assembled during the Velvet Revolution in November 1989.Photograph: Brian Harris/AlamyHarris was born in east London, to Dorothy (nee Nicholls) and Leonard Harris, an electrician who later helped his son build a darkroom in the garage. In the mid 1950s the family moved farther east – and up in the world, as they saw it – to the Rise Park estate in Romford, Essex. Brian attended Chase Cross secondary modern, acquiring useful skills in woodwork and metalwork, before leaving at 16.At the Fleet Street agency Fox Photos, he rose rapidly from messenger boy to photographer, and launched his professional career at the east London local papers the Stratford Express and the Newham Recorder before moving on to Fleet Street.Fellow photographers, often scooped by him, recalled his work as astonishing. Nick Turpin, who worked with him in the early days of the Independent, described him as “a great and fearless photographer”, an inspiration to a generation of young colleagues. Tim Dawson, a freelance organiser at the National Union of Journalists (Harris was a staunch union man), said he “reimagined the possibilities of news photography during newspapers’ last golden age”.View image in fullscreenFarming in north Essex, 2016.Photograph: Brian Harris/AlamyIn 2001 Harris made contact through the Friends Reunited website with Nikki Bertroya, whom he had first met as a three-year-old in Rise Park infant school, and they became inseparable partners through his remaining years. After receiving his terminal diagnosis, in August they went on a road trip in Europe, posting sunny images of good meals and good wine, and revisiting significant sites including Dresden and Ypres.His last task, completed a few weeks before his death, was to transfer his vast archive of 55 years’ work to a permanent home atTopFotoin Kent. Among his favourite archive images he commented on a very young Harris drinking large glasses of wine with the actor Helen Mirren, in the cellars of Château Margaux: “What a blessed life I’ve had – no regrets and no ‘Must Do’s’”.He was married twice, to Valery Morgan in 1978 and Susan Pettifer in 1994; both marriages ended in divorce.He is survived by Nikki, his son Jacob, from his second marriage, Nikki’s daughter, Holly, and by his sister, Jan.Brian Harris, photographer, born 15 September 1952; died 4 October 2025Explore more on these topicsPhotographyNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesobituariesShareReuse this content"

It was the second raid on a UN building in Sana’a in 24 hours.A UN spokesperson said officials were in contact with theHouthisand other parties “to resolve this serious situation as swiftly as possible, end the detention of all personnel, and restore full control over its facilities in Sana’a”.A second UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels confiscated all communications equipment from the facility, including phones, servers and computers.The employees belong to agencies including the World Food Programme (WFP), Unicef and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Yemen needs two-state solution as no prospect of ousting Houthis, says southern leaderRead moreThe Houthis have been conducting operations against international organisations working in rebel-held areas including Sana’a, the coastal city of Hodeidah and the rebel stronghold in Saada province.Scores of people, including more than 50 UN staffers, have been detained so far by the Iran-backed group. A WFP worker died in detention earlier this year in Saada.The rebels have alleged without evidence that detained UN staffers and those working with other international groups and foreign embassies were spies. The UN denied the accusations.The UN suspended its operations in Saada after the detention of eight staff in January. It also relocated its top humanitarian coordinator from Sana’a to the coastal city of Aden, which serves as the seat of the internationally recognised government.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricaIrannewsShareReuse this content"

TV stations with feeds from protests warned viewers they could not be responsible for the language used in the signage. A later crowd estimate by the Chicago Tribune put the number at 100,000.Some of them said “Hands Off Chicago”, a rallying cry that began when the president first announced his intent to send the national guard into the city. Others read “Resist Fascism”, but many others used language unsuitable for broadcast.The crowd erupted in chants of “Fuck Donald Trump” when Illinois representative Jonathan Jackson took the stage.Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, told the crowd theTrump administrationhad “decided that they want a rematch of the civil war”, which the white supremacist Confederacy lost to the Union in the 19th century.“We are here to stand firm and stand committed that we will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit,” Johnson said. “We do not want troops in our city.”On Saturday, Ginny Eschbach joined her 42nd protest since Trump’s inauguration in January.The 72-year-old came to the No Kings rally in Los Angeles dressed as SpongeBob SquarePants, her second choice after not being able to find an inflatable frog costume.“I wanted to be whimsical, because I think that lets them know, when we’re here, we’re serious, however, we are not dangerous and we are not violent,” she said, referring to Republicans’ efforts to paint the rallies as dangerous and un-American. “We are just not happy.”For Eschbach, who drove in from Thousand Oaks, a city north-west of Los Angeles, and carried an American flag, the Trump administration’s crackdown on free speech has been particularly alarming.“I personally am not happy with the erosion of our first amendment rights,” she said. “This is my gravest concern, as they attack universities, the media, law firms and now our very own freedom of speech and threaten our ability to peacefully assemble.”More than 200,000 Washington DC-area residents rallied near the US Capitol. In many cities, protesters wore inflatable animal costumes – a Dada-esque theme created during immigration enforcement protests in Portland, Oregon, to counter the administration’s narrative of a city under the grip of lawlessness and chaos.While the main protest march in downtown Portland, Oregon, was peaceful and local police officers helped block off streets and bridges for the marchers, a smaller protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city’s south waterfront neighborhood was met with force by federal officers.Suzette Smith of the Portland Mercuryreported on Blueskythat federal agents hurled gas canisters at protesters who gathered at the facility before a schedule 5pm protest.In Santa Fe, New Mexico, costumed characters included unicorns, chickens and frogs. “It’s about the absurdity of it all,” resident Amy Adler told theSanta Fe New Mexicanwhile wearing a lobster suit she described as an ode to Portland.On FoxLive, national security analyst Lt Col Hal Kempfer debated whether the costumes were for defensive purposes “I don’t discount that they are just showing off the costumes but any costume like that could provide a certain amount of defensive protection from pepper balls and stuff. But you have to weigh against that you can’t move very fast and you can’t see as well.”In Georgia, at least 10,000 people had filled the field of the Atlanta Civic Center in preparation for a march to the state capital by mid-morning.“I heard an American president stand up the other day and say to generals in our military that we’ve got to stand up against the enemy within,” said the US senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you are an American citizen, you should be deeply concerned,” Warnock said. He warned about the presence of federal law enforcement “showing up in communities all across our country.“What the hell is happening? And all of us have to be concerned.”Trumphas cracked down on US cities, attempting to send in federal troops and adding more immigration agents. He is seeking to criminalize dissent, going after left-leaning organizations that he claims are supporting terrorism or political violence.Cities have largely fought back, suing to prevent national guard infusions, and residents have taken to the streets to speak out against the militarization of their communities.Trump’s allies have sought to cast the No Kings protests as anti-American and led by antifa, the decentralized anti-fascist movement, while also claiming that the protests are prolonging the government shutdown. Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, has said he would send the state’s national guard to Austin, the state’s capital, in advance of the protests.Map showing where the protests are taking placeSome politicians, including Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Chris Murphy, and independent senator Bernie Sanders, attended the protests. The No Kings coalition has repeatedly underscored its commitment to nonviolent resistance, and tens of thousands of participants have trained on safety and de-escalation tactics.“What’s most important as a message for people to carry is that the president wants us to be scared, but we will not be bullied into fear and silence,” said Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of Public Citizen, one of the protest organizers. “And it’s incredibly important for people to remain peaceful, to stand proud and to say what they care about, and not to be cowed by that fear.”More than 200 organizations havesigned onas partners for the 18 October protests. Organizers have identified several anchor cities: Washington DC, San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta, New York City, Houston, Honolulu, Boston, Kansas City in Missouri, Bozeman in Montana, Chicago and New Orleans.The simple framing of the protests is that the US has no kings, a dig at Trump’s increasing authoritarianism. Trump told Fox News on Friday: “They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king.” Leading Republicans, including House speaker Mike Johnson, have described the protests as a “hate America rally”.In Washington DC, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders responded to Johnson’s characterization, saying: “Boy, does he have it wrong. Millions of Americans are coming out today not because they hate America, but because we love America. We’re here because we’re going to do everything we can to honor the sacrifices of millions of men and women who over the last 250 years fought and sometimes died to defend our democracy and our freedoms.”Among the themes the organizers have pointed to: Trump is using taxpayer money for power grabs, sending in federal forces to take over US cities; the president has said he wants a third term and “is already acting like a monarch”; the Trump administration has taken its agenda too far, defying the courts and slashing services while deporting people without due process.Leftist groups have called for the enunciation of a clear political program and concrete demands. In a 15 October statement,No Kings, No Nazi Führers! Mobilize the Working Class Against Trump’s Dictatorship!, the Socialist Equality Party said the central slogan, “No Kings”, articulates vast popular hostility to autocracy but warned that “anger and outrage are not enough to stop dictatorship”.The progressive group Public Citizensaidthe protests aimed to counter “the most unlawful administration in American history”, adding that “millions of Americans will come together in peaceful pro-democracy protests to show that we will never bow to a king”.The June No Kings protests drew millions to the streets, with the Harvard Crowd Counting Consortium estimating that between 2 million and 4.8 million people attended protests across the more than 2,000 locations in what was “probably the second-largest single day demonstration since Trump first took office in January 2017”, second to the Women’s March in 2017.Explore more on these topicsProtests (US)Donald TrumpTrump administrationProtestUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Recent pop-ups include experiences linked to Minecraft, Jurassic World and Squid Game.As big money has rolled into the sector, so too has a desire from companies to rely on solid gold intellectual property to bring in the crowds – with mixed results.“We’ve looked into a lot of immersive experiences,” says Hollywood financier Chip Seelig, who has backed Come Alive!, the London-based theatre experience inspired by the hit 2017 film The Greatest Showman. “While even [prime] intellectual property doesn’t guarantee a success, we find it very hard to attract audiences without recognisable global IP. So we think it is a critical item to success.”Seelig’s TSG Entertainment co-financed and produced the Hollywood blockbuster. Even before its release he had spied the opportunity to bring it to life in a real-world experience, and struck a rights deal with 20th Century Fox, now owned by Disney.Disney is also launching its own more traditional theatre-style version of The Greatest Showman in a world premiere at the Bristol Hippodrome in the spring.While shows such as Come Alive! have proved a success – it recently extended its run at the former home of the BBC Earth Experience for another year – costs involved in real-world productions mean that commercial success is far from certain.The plight of traditional theatre provides a cautionary tale for the booming immersive entertainment sector.A recent analysis by the New York Times found that none of the 18 commercial musicals that opened on Broadway last season have yet made a profit, and at least three with $20m (£15m) budgets closed less than four months after opening.And since the end of the pandemic, only three of 46 new musicals – those not based on existing, familiar IP – have become profitable to date.Another significant issue facing the relatively nascent experiential industry is that a gold rush mentality has resulted in an increasing number of operators launching events that fail to live up to expectations.Last year, an unofficial event called The Detroit Bridgerton Themed Ball, which charged ticket holders between $150 and $1,000,went viral for all the wrong reasonswhen attendees were shown sitting on the floor, eating KitKats and watching a solitary pole dancer as the evening’s entertainment.Similarly, Glasgow’s shoddy Willy Wonka experience, billed as a “celebration of chocolate in all its delightful forms”,made global newswhen police were called after families who had spent hundreds of pounds on the event that left children in tears became furious, and it was abruptly cancelled.The most recent production tocome in for criticismis Elvis Evolution, which opened in London’s ExCel centre in the summer with tickets priced from £75 to £300. It was initially advertised as a concert experience that would use “AI and feature holographic projections of the star”.An initial promise of a “lifesized digital Elvis who will perform iconic moments in musical history on a UK stage for the first time” ended up with AI being used to “upscale archive footage”.Layered Reality, which created the show, said it clarified there would be no hologram by the time tickets went on sale and had been “overwhelmed” by praise from attendees.One attender said the experience was “absolutely atrocious” and one VIP ticket holder said it was a “shambles from start to finish”.While some fans enjoyed it – one said she“loved every minute”– reviews have been mixed. The Telegraph gave it one star and even Time Out, which was more positive with a three-star rating, alluded to a“noticeable amount of booing”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are a lot of smart people realising experiential is where the present is meeting the future.”He adds: “Netflix, Apple, Amazon and others have done a phenomenal job of raising the bar of quality and quantity of content coming into your living room.

For many of the UK’s most iconic products, this is an alarming trend.”The signatories, which included the Scottish Grocers’ Federation, the Night Time Industries Association and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said they represented thousands of bars, restaurants and hotels, as well the farmers who grow the barley used in whisky production.They argue the higher duty on spirits, including British-made products such as vodka and gin, has a disproportionate impact on bars and clubs.They calculate that spirits sales generate 38% of the hospitality sector’s profits, despite being only 15% of their sales by units of alcohol. Data from International Wine and Spirit Research found whisky sales in the UK fell by 4.3m bottles in 2024 compared with 2023.Their appeal to the chancellor is designed to bolster a campaign by the ScotchWhiskyAssociation (SWA), the sector’s trade body, for a freeze on the duty until 2029 – a proposal that would reduce the Treasury’s options in future.The SWA said there was evidence the Treasury’s approach to spirits duty was misguided. In its submission to the Treasury in advance of the 26 November budget, it said the 14% duty increase over the last two years had backfired.In 2023, the Treasury had forecast revenues from spirits duty would increase by 18% – however, they have increased by only 1.5% since then. Other official forecasts of 38% growth in duty receipts “bears no relation to the real world and risks undermining further confidence in HM Treasury modelling”, it said.The industry bodies argue that inflation, increasing wholesale prices and staff costs, and falling consumer confidence add to an increasingly difficult economic picture. The UK’s spirits duties are 97% higher, the SWA said, than the EU average.Liz Cameron, the director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: “A duty freeze is not a handout. It is an investment in British business, British exports, and British jobs – and a chance to back one of the UK’s most successful and globally recognised industries.”Andrew Connon, the president of NFU Scotland, said: “Quality cereals grown here in Scotland are the foundation of a hugely valuable supply chain – one that runs from grain to glass and delivers skilled jobs, investment and economic growth.”The Treasury said the chancellor had been clear she needed to balance public spending with supporting growth, but would not comment on her tax plans.“Our distilleries are vital to Britain’s economy, so we’re making it easier for them to thrive: no export duty, lower licensing fees, reduced tariffs, and a cap on corporation tax,” a spokesperson said. The Treasury did not comment, however, on the pressures facing hospitality and farmers.Explore more on these topicsWhiskyBudget 2025Tax and spendingRachel ReevesEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

We would have to close it down. I’m talking job losses. We’re talking probably 7,500.”Betfred’s chief executive, Joanne Whittaker,told the Sunday Times: “The most frightening element is we’re going to lose the whole retail business. I’m not scaremongering … I’m not being alarmist.”The gambling industry has been ramping up itslobbying effortsamid intense speculation that Reeves could raise taxes on sports betting firms to 30%, from current levels of 15%, and on online slots from 20% to 50%.The former prime minister Gordon Brown has pushed for the changes. The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, which has close links to Labour, estimates that such an increase could raise £3.2bn.Brown argued that the extra revenue could be used to alleviate child poverty across the UK, and noted that – excluding the lottery – the £11.5bn betting and gaming industry only paid£2.5bn in taxlast year. “As much as £3bn extra can be raised from taxing it properly,” he said.Last week Betfred’s rival, William Hill,said it could close up to 200 betting shops, with up to 1,500 jobs potentially affected. Stella David, the chief executive of Entain, the FTSE 100 owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, has also said higher gambling taxes could lead to shop closures and investment being diverted to other countries.Responding to a closure threat from Betfred’s bosses, a Treasury spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Datareleased this weekshowed Tesco’s sales growth outgunning its traditional rivals.The retailer’s resurgence represents a remarkable turnaround for a business whose relentless growth across Britain through the 1990s and early 2000s was abruptly curtailed as management became too focused on overseas expansion and profits over service.A devastatingaccounting scandalin 2014 appeared to close the chapter on a corporate success story that had regulators and politicians concerned about its all-encompassing dominance. Now, Tesco seemingly has its mojo back and is quietly reasserting its stranglehold on the UK market – this time in a far less visible manner.‘Every little helps’The term “Tescopoly” was first coined in the noughties, when concerns about the retailer – and it supermarket peers – putting local high street shops out of business were at their height.Regulators allowed Tesco, then led by Sir Terry Leahy, tobuy up the 860-store convenience chain T&S Storesin 2002, and it later marched into selling electrical goods, homewares and clothing in its out of town Homeplus stores from 2005. Tesco had already set up a banking venture with Royal Bank of Scotland in 1997 and its mobile phone service with O2 in 2003.Huge superstores were built on the edge of towns around the country and there were concerns about it hoarding land to block rivals from setting up shop nearby and using its dominant scale to bully suppliers.“Nowhere is it written on the sliding supermarket doors that by crossing the threshold your vibrant, distinctive local economy will begin to wither,” wrote Andrew Simms, the author of 2007’s Tescopoly: How One Shop Came Out on Top and Why it Matters.View image in fullscreenThere have been concerns down the years over the impact of Tesco’s big stores on high street rivals.Photograph: Kumar Sriskandan/AlamyBy the time Tesco tried to take on Amazon and Apple with theHudl tablet computerin 2013, it seemed there was no area of life where the supermarket did not reach. Cafes and restaurant chains, such asHarris + HooleandGiraffe, had been acquired to help fill the giant stores, which had become unloved.Today, Hudl, Homeplus and even Giraffe may be just a memory of a hubristic time when Tesco had operations across the world from the US to South Korea, while regulators have since acted to prevent the holding of land to block rivals. However, with its globetrotting ventures much reduced, those close to the business say remaining the grocery kingpin in the UK and selling a wider variety of products to shoppers has become even more important.Kings of convenienceAt its peak in 2007, Tesco’s market share neared 32%, driven by huge scale andpunchy marketing. Today that figure stands at 28.3%, up from as low as 26.5% in 2020. Although the figure remains some way off its high, Tesco’s new UK boss Ashwin Prasadreportedly told suppliersthe retailer wants to top 30% again. Its nearest competitor, Sainsbury’s, trails well behind, on 15.3%.Market share graphicSmall stores and online retail are likely to be the engine room of that growth. Since its launch in 1994, Tesco Express has rapidly filled the gaps in emptying high streets to bring in local shoppers. Rather than adding to its 809 hypermarkets in the UK, the retailer is expanding via dozens of convenience stores a year, with Tesco Express adding 43 sites this year taking the total to 1,675, according to Lumina Intelligence.The Worldpanel Tesco grocery market share figure does not include the 730 One Stop shops it operates and 354 more it supplies through a franchise deal or the thousands of independent retailers that buy goods via Tesco’s Booker wholesaler, including under its Premier, Londis and Budgens brands.Concerns have been raised about Tesco’spower over small local shops, with Premier accounting for the largest number of convenience shops in the UK, and numbers rising to 4,800 this year, from 4,760 in 2024. Londis edged up to 2,490 from 2,465, and Budgens by six to 452.Unlike in the noughties, when buying groceries online was extremely niche, today 14% of Tesco’s sales are ordered from home, with sales growing by 11% in the first half of the year on a year earlier.In that market, Tesco is even more dominant than in stores, controlling 37% of the UK’s online grocery sales.Last June, Tesco launched its new marketplace, which now sells 600,000 items, from dog beds to toys, laptops and tents.The growth of online shopping has also offered Tesco new avenues to lure consumers: once simple money-off vouchers were its preferred discount method; now more subtle, targeted digital ads are also deployed.The power of ClubcardAside from using its scale to secure better deals from suppliers and operate efficiently, Tesco is also using heavy investment in technology to offer personalised deals through its Clubcard loyalty scheme, now in the hands of 24 million UK households, to make it tougher for rivals to prise away its shoppers.In recent years Tesco has made Clubcard an essential byoffering markedly lower prices for cardholderswhile also gamifying the card – offering discounts if shoppers can meet a “challenge” such as racking up a certain number of purchases within a week.View image in fullscreenTesco uses heavy investment in technology to offer personalised deals through its Clubcard loyalty scheme.Photograph: True Images/AlamyTesco also plans to extend its reach in the non-food market via its online marketplace and potentially through acquisitions of brands such as Paperchase or joint ventures, such as with the toy retailer The Entertainer. The idea is to make the most of its Clubcard database to sell those households a much wider range of goods.“Tesco has a huge opportunity on non-food,” says Richard Hyman, a retail analyst at Aria Intelligent Solutions. One industry insider adds that Clubcard means Tesco “knows a lot about people’s lives and gives opportunities to sell things that go well beyond groceries”.Tesco profitsTesco’s revival has not gone unnoticed by its critics. The vast profits made during the cost of living crisis and the£9.2m paid to Murphy last yearhave made it the target of union ire.The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “Every day people are on their knees and being kicked while they are down. This is profiteering pure and simple. Tesco made £3.1bn profit last year and its sheer size means that the game is rigged from the start. It is obscene. Where is the off button?“Tesco’s dominance means it can squeeze suppliers while boosting its own profits. This then feeds into more food inflation and worsens the cost of living crisis for workers and communities.”One supplier source says Murphy is “much more demanding” than under previous regimes, but in a way that is “collaborative and not brutal”.A changing retail landscapeTesco – one of the UK’s biggest employers – has also benefited from a historically rare moment when two of its major competitors are in the doldrums and a third has seen growth stagnate. The UK’s number three grocer,Asda, has been losing sales amid struggles with heavy debts from a private equity takeover.Another major rival,Morrisons, is also weighed down with debts and imminently expected to be overtaken in market share by Lidl as sales remain behind inflation, while Aldi’s growth has softened somewhat.A Tesco spokesperson said: “Our performance is driven by the fact that more customers are choosing to do more of their shopping with us, as a result of the sustained investments we’re making in value, quality and service – supported by the extension of our savings programme, which is on track to deliver circa £500m of savings this year.“Despite continued inflationary headwinds, including from tax and regulation, we’ve worked hard to keep prices down for customers and as a result we have further improved our price position against the market.”Threats still remain to Tesco’s growth. The chain faces the looming presence of Aldi andLidl, which continue to open dozens of stores a year in the UK, backed by vast European operations capable of pressing Tesco on price.View image in fullscreenAldi and Lidl are expanding in the UK.Photograph: PAChanging market dynamics could also have a role in keeping Tesco in check. Asda’s and Morrisons’ struggles have led to speculation that one of them will be broken up in the next few years, with Sainsbury’s a potential buyer of a large chunk of stores in northern regions where it is under-represented and the well-funded Co-op perhaps keen to take on more convenience stores.While Sainsbury’s attempt to buy Asda in 2019fell foul of the competition regulator, the potential sale of a troubled major player could lead to a reassessment of a merger particularly since the appointment of the former Asda and Amazon executive Doug Gurr to head the Competition and Markets Authority. He has a remit topromote the government’s growth agenda, which may well clear a path to new deals.I think we will see a redrawing of the competitive landscape in the next three or four yearsRichard Hyman of Aria Intelligent Solutions“I think we will see a redrawing of the competitive landscape in the next three or four years,” Hyman says. Another senior industry source puts it more bluntly: “I cannot see both Asda and Morrisons persisting as independent businesses on a 10-year view.”Meanwhile, the dominance of Amazon – as well as the growth of Shein and Temu – offers tough competition on non-food.Patrick O’Brien at GlobalData says that Tesco’s profit margins – of 4.5% – remain relatively slim on its £63.6bn of worldwide sales. “Currently, you’d be hard pressed to argue for much concern, such is the competitiveness of the UK market, especially in grocery.”Tesco group sales graphicLeigh Sparks, the professor of retail studies at the University of Stirling, says Tesco’s market share has “moved up sharply” in the last two years. “I don’t think we should be as worried as we were 20 years ago,” he says. “It is a watching brief. If [its market share] continues to accelerate as in the last couple of years then it could be a concern.”Explore more on these topicsTescoSupermarketsFood & drink industryRetail industryJ SainsburyAldiLidlfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s telling her own stories, starting with a cast of ‘young kings’Sun 19 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareDays before we meet,Letitia Wrightfound herself cheek-by-jowl with a far-right march in London. This is the year when St George’s flags have been displayed in suburban windows and tied to lamp-posts, and when thousands of people – some more intimidating than others, especially to people of colour – have marched on the centre of the capital and beyond. A friend of Wright’s was visiting the city, and they had moseyed down to the South Bank, unaware of what awaited them. “It was jam-packed,” she says, recalling their struggle to get out of the fray. “I  was in the middle of it, and then I was out of it. They were doingtheirthing – and I was doing mine.”The actor has played refugees twice: once in the BBC Three dramaGlasgow Girls, where she portrayed a Somali teenager, Amal, and then in the 2022 film Aisha, where she took on the role of a woman from Nigeria navigating Ireland’s often Kafkaesque immigration system. With this insight – and as a black woman – how does it feel to see far-right rhetoric being spread in the way that it is now? “Sometimes people need to see the humanity behind these things that they assume the worst of, which isn’t true,” she says. “And I’m an immigrant, my parents are immigrants … It’s an interesting conversation. And it’s interesting to see [it unfold] in a country that has done so muchtoother countries historically …” She was close to the London Eye when she caught sight of the march, but also a rainbow in the sky. “I try and find the peace,” she says, sounding – understandably – a little exhausted by it all.View image in fullscreenWith Josh O’Connor in the film Aisha.Photograph: Sky UK/Bernard Walsh/ Cornerstone 2021Dwarfed by an oversized hoodie and a mop of black braided locks, the 31-year-old has doe eyes, perfect makeup-free skin and – in contrast to many of the glamorous shots that pop up if you search for her on Google Images – a sort of androgynous cool. For someone who is currently, in her words, “working a night shift” (more on that later), she’s holding up. A few weeks after we meet in east London, Wright will be visiting schools in this same area to speak to students about her directorial debut, Highway to the Moon, a striking short film inspired in part by the blight of knife crime. But today – drowning in her sweatshirt – she looks as if she could be of school age herself.It’s close to 10am on a Monday morning when we meet; Wright is eating a pot of fruit and offers me one, too. She’s casual, driven (she frequently describes herself as “relentless”), occasionally straight-talking, and often playful (“I cracka lotof stupid jokes,” she tells me). She’s also a bona fide movie star, a stalwart of the Marvel Cinematic Universe who has appeared in four of its superhero epics, including Black Panther in 2018, with another on the way (Avengers Doomsday, due for release at the end of 2026). As tech-savvy princess Shuri, she led Wakanda Forever (2022), the highest-grossing female-led superhero movie in US box office history. For those who had been following her rise, it would probably have come as little surprise: at 21, she starred in Urban Hymn, directed by Michael Caton-Jones, who gave Leonardo DiCaprio his breakout feature film role in 1993’s This Boy’s Life. On the release of Urban Hymn, hesaid of Wrightthat he had “not felt like this about someone since Leonardo … my instinct is [that] she can be as big as she wants”. Elsewhere, Wright has – among other things – snagged an Emmy nomination for her role in Black Mirror’s macabre episode Black Museum, and appeared in Steve McQueen’s landmark anthology series Small Axe, as Altheia Jones-LeCointe, the Trinidadian scientist turned British Black Panther.View image in fullscreenIn an episode of Steve McQueen’s landmark series Small Axe, 2020.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/McQueen LimitedWright grew up in Tottenham in north London, having moved from small, rainforest-covered Guyana in South America with her parents when she was seven years old. In a world of industry nepo babies, her background is refreshingly normal: teacher mum, a dad who worked in agriculture, and two younger siblings, now 18 and 19. While she is the inspirational big sis, it wasn’t always that way. As a teen, she says, acting was her biggest goal, but she was light on connections and knowhow. Certainly, no one else in her family had attempted anything vaguely similar. “It’s like …” she pauses, looking for the right words. “What the hell?! No one else is passionate? No one’s relentlessly chasing after their dreams?”Wright had an unconventional route into the industry, sending DIY headshots to agents as a teen until one finally acquiesced and invited her for an audition. “The assistant’s name was something like Emily,” she laughs. “So I was annoying poor Emily, like: here’s me again! Here’s my headshot, here’s my CV!” As well as bagging an agent, she spent some of her teenage years training at the Identity School of Acting, where her classmates included the future Star Wars lead John Boyega. Wright was an extra on his 2011 breakthrough film Attack the Block, about an alien invasion on a London estate. “He’s super talented, and seeing his dreams come true because of the hard work that he put in allowed us also to believe thatourdreams could come true,” she says. Boyega is “a big brother” to her.Wright is now pursuing another dream, as the writer, director and producer of Highway to the Moon. It’s a project she has described as “a love letter to black boys”, and one that reimagines the pastel-hued Arizonan desert as a liminal space. There, teens whose lives have abruptly ended meet one another in a commune and try to make sense of their new reality (the lead character, Micah, arrives still dressed in his school uniform).My friend losing her brother and seeing her grieving him was really hard. I just thought about all the family that he left behindIt was inspired in part by the death of the model Harry Uzoka, whose murder by fellow model George Koh made headlines in 2018. “I felt really confused. How did a well-known model, a young trailblazer in his industry, get stabbed to death by his friend? It didn’t add up. Usually we are told that these young men are part of a gang, or some other stereotypical explanation for their actions. I immediately began to wonder: why are our black boys hurting each other like this?”It was also inspired by the death of Wright’s friend’s younger brother, Kwasi Anim-Boadu – known as Junior – in a knife attack in London’s Finsbury Park the same year, and the pain she observed the family go through. “It made an impact,” she explains. “My friend losing her brother and seeing her grieving him was really hard. I just thought about all the family that he left behind, where his spirit was, and the spirit realm. It’s different when you’re seeing these things on the news – when you’re like, that’s over there. But when it’s closer to you, you start looking at it differently.” She wanted, she says, to make a project “that looked at what it means to have unity and love – they have that in ‘the inbetween’. And also what it means to regret not having that here.” It’s important, she says, for young boys to see themselves in a different light. “I want people to see black boys in a way that is not connected to a stereotype, but to take in their emotions, complexities, hopes, dreams, disappointments and fears.” She is also making the film for “other black boys to see themselves as worthy, beautiful and to know that their lives have a meaning. To embrace self-love that will transfer into love for their brother.” She refers to her cast as “her young kings”.Much care has clearly gone into Highway to the Moon’s futuristic, arresting visuals. Wright had to get special permission to film on the land of the Navajo nations, while her inspirations included the Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan, whose exhibition There Is Light Somewhere brought together black history with space and astrology. Meanwhile, incubating new talent clearly also means a lot to her. She first came across Kenyah Sandy, who plays Micah, in Small Axe (he appeared in the fifth episode, she was in the first), while some other members of the promising young cast came from a New York summer camp where Wright spent a week as a guest teacher. She went on to pay for acting classes for the boys for three months out of her own pocket. “It’s opening up an opportunity for them,” she says, buzzing with excitement. The film sees Micah question his new surroundings, while connecting with other young men who extend positivity to one another and to themselves, uttering lines such as, “I’m destined for greatness” and, “I am my brother’s keeper”. Wright says she was inspired by the affirmations that the boys had said to one another as they huddled around the campfire. Her script is poetic, but impactful; among its lines: “You created wounds, similar to the deep, dark pits on the surface of the moon, intomybody.”The most important thing is that kids see it and have these conversations. How does it affect you? How does it inspire you? What did you like about it? What didn’t you like about it?The school tour is an important part of the puzzle for Wright. “It’s for them, it’s for young kids, so I’ve always planned that – the most important thing is that kids see it and have these conversations. How does it affect you? How does it inspire you? What did you like about it? What didn’t you like about it? Just bringing it directly to them and praying that it sparks the heart of someone.”While she hasn’t turned her back on acting, Wright clearly has big aspirations for her career as a producer and director. She has her own production outfit, 3.16, founded in 2020 and named for the Bible verse John 3.16 about Christian salvation. “I wanted to create a nurturing environment for storytellers, and for myself,” she says. “I wanted to just create.” The idea, she says, is to start “very small, very simple, two short films a year”, before building up to feature films. Ultimately, she says she would love to work with other production companies; she’s an admirer of arthouse darlings turned Hollywood heavyweights A24 and Barry Jenkins’ Pastel (Aftersun, Moonlight): “I take a lot of inspiration from them,” she says. “And the boldness of their storytelling.”Wright has always been an intense actor. I mention her early but memorable role in Russell T Davies’s 2015 series Banana, and its post-watershed companion show Cucumber, about gay life in Manchester, and interwoven stories of love, loss and lust. As a lead in Banana and a recurring character in Cucumber, she played Vivienne “Scotty” Scott, a shy, sheltered young lesbian who develops a sudden, stupendous crush on an older woman she sees in the supermarket, played by Gentleman Jack’s Rosie Cavaliero. “Oh man, I love that character,” Wright says, wistfully. “It’s still one of my favourites today – very quirky, very weird.” Wright was a Bafta Breakthrough Brit in the year that Banana came out; by 2019, she would bag its Rising Star award, and by 2024 she would be on the judging panel.In 2015, though – and specifically the period after she had filmed Urban Hymn – Wright was close to packing it all in. She had just signed with an agent in LA and was about to start work on a film with Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning when she found herself suffering from what she would later describe in that Bafta Rising Star speech as “a deep state of depression”. She returned home to London, where she dedicated several months to Bible study. In previous interviews, she has described this period as crucial to the development of her Christian faith, something that she is still committed to today. Did she ever worry about not being able to get back into the industry? “Those questions did come up,” she says, looking thoughtful. “Those questions of: if you do take a break, will you be able to come back to acting? Will you be able to pick things back up? And I think the desire for clarity and the desire for my mental health to be improved outweighed that.”Back in Hollywood, she auditioned for a new Marvel project,Black Panther, which became the first blockbuster black superhero movie. Ryan Coogler’s film brought home more than $1bn at the box office. When it won three Oscars, Adele and Beyoncé were among the stars partying with Wright at the cast afterparty. “I didn’t realise how big a deal it was until the premiere. I knew we were making something amazing, but when it came out, how it impacted the world … I was really proud of myself, and it made me remember my sacrifices as that 17-, 18-year-old girl.”It was also the project where she met and became close to the late Chadwick Boseman, whose seemingly sudden death (he had not made his colon cancer diagnosis public) in August 2020 can still feel hard to comprehend. In Wakanda Forever, as the characters mourn King T’Challa, it’s clear they are also mourning Boseman, and the tears that Wright cried were surely for both the actor and his character. His death, she says, is “something we continually try to process and to understand”. She pauses. “It’s a hard thing to talk about. Wakanda Forever was an opportunity to honour my brother that way and continue the thing we started. But it’s one of those questions I’m just going to have to ask God – why did that happen? I know that my brother’s resting and that I’ll see him one day; that gives me a bit of comfort.”View image in fullscreenWright with Lupita Nyong’o and Chadwick Boseman in Black Panther, 2018.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyI missed a lot of opportunities when [Boseman] was here doing promotion, and he would say, ‘Let’s have dinner.’ I was like, ‘I’m going to see you on set.’ I thought I’d have for ever, and I didn’tHas her grief changed over time? “It is one of those things … it comes in waves,” she says. “It really depends. Sometimes you can be completely fine and joyous and celebratory, and thinking about everything that he achieved, and sometimes you’re just upset.” Keeping in touch with Boseman’s wife, Taylor Simone Ledward Boseman, is a comfort, and they speak often. It has also taught her a lot, Wright says, about “cherishing people, really cherishing moments. I missed a lot of opportunities when [Boseman] was here doing promotion, and he would say, ‘Let’s have dinner.’ I was like, ‘I’m going to see you on set.’ I thought I’d have for ever, and I didn’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At the end of 2020, she shared a video on X (then Twitter) by a pastor who espoused anti-vaccine and transphobic views. Wright has since staunchly denied endorsing those beliefs; in a2022 interviewwith this paper, she said: “Those are things that I am not and I apologised and I’ve moved on.” With the benefit of hindsight, I ask whether she feels she was treated unfairly by the media. She was far from the only celebrity to be linked to content that was critical of the Covid vaccine, but was among those who got the most flak. In 2023,Rolling Stone publisheda piece with the headline: “Why was Letitia Wright dragged more than Ant-Man star Evangeline Lilly?” I expect Wright to be a little testy, but she is happy to talk about it. “I feel, upon reflection, that as a society we hold each other accountable … It’s about learning from it, which is what I’ve been able to do. Learn from it, and improve as a person.” It must have been pretty awful in the moment? “I learned from it. I grew from it,” Wright repeats. “I had an opportunity, and I took it.”In 2024, Wright gained her first executive producer feature credit on Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot, a film about a church in East Texas where 22 families adopted 77 children from local foster care. While the Wall Street Journal described it as “a big-hearted film made with a homespun sincerity”, its release was clouded by links between the film’s distributors – the Christian production company Angel Studios – and the right-wing US news site the Daily Wire, something Wright was not made aware of at the time.Wright saidon social mediathat she did “not condone using this beautiful film for divisive political purposes”. Was it frustrating having to clarify things, and to distance herself?“Do you work as a freelancer?” she asks me.Yes, I say.“So if there’s a particular company that you are working with and they’ve done something that’s not part of the agreement, what would you do?”Explain that it wasn’t part of the agreement and that I didn’t know about it – so more or less what you did. But was it frustrating to have to do that?“No, not frustrating at all. It was just a simple procedure … My job was just to bring awareness to something that’s important. If there’s a section or part of a team that doesn’t align, you have to say something. And I did that as gracefully as possible.”We move on to other subjects. As an actor, producer and now director, Wright has been firmly in the bosom of the industry for some time. And now, in her early 30s, she is thinking about what’s next. “I still want to achieve a lot more,” she says. “But it doesn’t feel so pressing.” As for settling down and having a family: “When it happens, no one will know.” She’s notoriously private – “extremelyprivate”, she clarifies with a laugh. So much so that she won’t even tell me where she lives, other than that it is in east London, but that she’s currently staying south of the river.Not Your Superwoman review – Letitia Wright and Golda Rosheuvel are magnetic in mother-daughter dramaRead moreFor the moment, though, she remains booked and busy. Later that day, she will head over to west London’s Bush theatre for another performance ofNot Your Superwoman, the play that is keeping her busy for eight performances a week. It’s a two-hander that also stars Bridgerton’s Golda Rosheuvel, who plays her mother. Its writer, Emma Dennis-Edwards, has described the play as an exploration of “the family dynamics of Caribbean women, the way resilience, humour and strength exist alongside silence, pressure and unspoken struggles”. The goal, Wright says, was to make “something that was a reflection of what we’ve experienced in our life, and that a lot of women can relate to – especially a lot of black women. We have people from all walks of life in the audience. It’s really, really beautiful.”View image in fullscreenOn stage last month with Golda Rosheuvel in Not Your Superwoman.Photograph: Rich LakosIt’s far from her first rodeo on stage: she has appeared in two plays by her Black Panther co-star Danai Gurira. Next year, she will make her NationalTheatredebut in Tracey Scott Wilson’s The Story, about “an ambitious black reporter who defies her editor to pursue an incendiary lead”. What does she get from theatre that she perhaps doesn’t from film and TV? “Theatre is the mecca of everything, in terms of how everything has started for us in terms of acting,” she says. “I love all the art forms, but the discipline that comes with theatre is different, and there’s the opportunity to try something new every night.” Occasionally, of course, things go wrong, but by now she’s a master at styling it out. “I have a Guyanese flag I take out of my bag in one scene, and the bag just wouldn’t open one night,” she says, wincing. “Golda was like: all right, let’s get this open. The audience was looking at us, and she just turned around and went: ‘We really need what’s in the bag!’ They were cracking up laughing, and when we finally got it open, the audience just roared.”The show went on; Wright won’t let anything stop her. I get the sense she hasn’t stopped frantically pushing herself her whole life. “It’s that thing of, ‘just try’,” she says. “You never know what’s on the other side of trying. And many people don’t. I really want to maximise my potential. I do not want to die super full – I want to die empty.”Highway to the Moon is available to watch on arts platformwepresent.wetransfer.comfrom 20 October.Main portrait: Stylist: Rudy Simba Betty.

But as soon as the light went on, the house caught fire – and it’s been burning ever since.”David Harewoodis talking about Othello, ahead of a new production from the Tony award-winning director Tom Morris that opens in London’s West End on 23 October. The production, which also features Toby Jones as Iago and Caitlin Fitzgerald as Desdemona, sees Harewood return to the role almost 30 years after his landmark performance at the National Theatre.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When he took onOthelloin 1997, it was the second time he’d done so in his then-short career. The first was at the Swan theatre in Worcester six years earlier – an opportunity for him to familiarise himself with a text he’d certainly revisit in the future, his agent at the time told him. Now he was at the Cottesloe (renamed the Dorfman in 2014) as the first Black man to play Othello on a National Theatre stage.The venue was significant not only because of his race – it was still rare for Black actors to be cast in the part, directors instead often choosing to put white actors in blackface – but also because it was the same space in which Laurence Olivier set the gold standard for the character decades earlier. Olivier’s 1964 performance, which later aired on the BBC, shows the actor thickly painted and shiny with blackface makeup, capped with a kinky dark wig. In interviews he described going down to the docks to study Black people so that he could perfect their movements and mannerisms. The performance became a blueprint: to this day, it is still heavily referenced as aspirational. Even Harewood, who made aBBC documentary in 2023about the strange and racist practice of blackface, describes Olivier’s Othello as “flawless”.Shakespeare’s tragedy follows Othello, a Moorish general in Venice. Through manufactured evidence, Othello’s ensign, Iago, convinces him that his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful. Consumed by jealousy, Othello murders Desdemona, only to discover her innocence too late – a revelation that drives him to take his own life.View image in fullscreenBard act to follow … Mandela Siobhan and Ken Nwosu in Othello.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe modern stage performance history of Othello in the UK begins with Rudolph Walker at the Malvern FestivalTheatrein 1966. Of course there were performances by Black actors before him – Ira Aldridge, Paul Robeson, Errol John – but it was after Walker that attitudes towards casting Black people in the role began to significantly shift. Walker was received well enough in Malvern that he would be cast in the role again multiple times, including at the Young Vic theatre, but not so much as to immediately end the blackface tradition. When, for the Othello that was recorded as part of its Shakespeare Collection in the 1980s, the BBC had the opportunity to cast him or indeed any other Black actor (the American James Earl Jones was blocked by Equity, which threatened to thwart the production with a strike unless a British star was cast), it was a blacked-up Anthony Hopkins who was chosen to play the lead role.It is true that Shakespeare rarely wrote parts specifically for Black actors. Othello is one of just three prominent characters in his repertoire explicitly written to be played by an actor of darker skin tone, and the only lead role. This fact, plus what could be described as a lack of imagination in the theatre industry when it comes to the Bard’s plays, creates a sense not only that every Black male actor is hoping for their turn to play Othello, but also that their aspirations are somewhat restricted to that hope, because they are less likely to be cast as Romeo, for example.Lucian Msamati – who played Iago at the RSC in 2015, believes there is racism in the idea that actors be restricted in their roles by the colour of their skin. His upbringing across Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe meant that everybody from the president to the pauper looked like him, and so playing outside his race was never a big deal. “I’m an actor, I was never a Black actor until I came here,” he says. The topic of whether he should be allowed to play Iago, written as a white character, was hotly debated among the backlash when his casting was announced.View image in fullscreenAs you light it … Hugh Quarshie as Othello and Lucian Msamati as Iago.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRecalling a conversation he’d had during the run with a fellow cast member, a white man who expressed a desire to play Othello, Msamati said he responded: ”You have a way in with originality, with integrity, that is true to the story – whyever not?” While there are definitely some who’d argue that white people should not play Othello at all, there seems to be more of a consensus that it isn’t simply white actors playing the part that’s the issue, but rather white actors using racist stereotypes to imitate Black identity in their portrayals.Harewood not only disagrees with the idea that all Black male actors are essentially Othellos-in-Waiting but rejects the notion that their aspirations should be so limited by race. Before he was ever cast in the title role he was much more interested in Iago, Othello’s villainous standard-bearer, which by line count is the bigger undertaking of the two – some might argue it’s also a more interesting character. “I think you’ll probably find as many Black [male] actors who want to play Hamlet. I want to play King Lear, I want to play Macbeth – this is the third time I have played Othello, but I’d be just as excited to play Richard III.”Ken Nwosu – who has just finished playing Aaron in Titus Andronicus at Hampstead theatre – also wouldn’t say he’s always dreamed of playing Othello specifically. He was always sure, however, that Shakespeare would feature prominently in his acting career. He recalls being asked at his drama school audition where he saw himself in 10 years’ time, and immediately answering: “The RSC”. Nwosu was first cast to play the Moor as understudy to Hugh Quarshie just three years after graduating from Drama Centre London. Looking back, he says he felt a bit too young for it at the time but the experience was formative, and definitely cemented his ambition. Last year, almost a decade later, he reprised the role inOla Ince’s productionat the Shakespeare’s Globe’s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.While many Black actors who’ve performed Othello have done so at the beginning of their career, using it as a platform to showcase their acting ability or develop their craft to prepare them for more high-profile projects,Chiwetel Ejiofortook a different route. His Olivier award-winning Donmar Warehouse performance came after starring in Hollywood movies such as Children of Men, American Gangster and Love Actually. Like Harewood, he played the role as a youngster, fresh out of drama school, and then returned to it some years later. At that point there was still a relative scarcity of Black performers on stage in any capacity, and certainly not in leading roles. Simultaneously, it was at the tail end of all those conversations about whether Black people should be in Shakespeare at all. “I felt like there was a lot more to that conversation – not just with the part but about what the meaning of Othello was in the culture at the time,” Ejiofor says.View image in fullscreenScroll with it … Ewan McGregor and Chiwetel Ejiofor at the Donmar Warehouse in London.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyHe believes Shakespeare was able to tap into something much more ahead of his time in terms of his positioning of Black characters. “The critique of racism is so strong in Othello,” he says. “The critique of Iago is so strong, as is the critique of Brabantio, Desdemona’s father. All of these characters that Shakespeare is writing as petty and racist and jealous – even though that system ultimately does bring down Othello – is still a critique of that system. If we’re trying to get into the psychology of Shakespeare’s attitude to Blackness, it’s very rich and progressive in many ways.”TheBritish Black and Asian Shakespeare Performance Databasereveals a stark illustration of the way in which Black actors are limited by the colour of their skin. It’s a digital archive created and maintained by Dr Jami Rogers at the University of Warwick to celebrate the contributions of Black, Asian and minority ethnic performers to the history of Shakespearean performance since 1930. According to the database, 72 different Black actors have played Othello in 93 different productions in that time. By contrast, six different Black actors have played King Lear across seven productions, and the same numbers apply to Hamlet. There’s no accurate number for how many productions of Hamlet or King Lear have cast a white actor in the lead role but a conservative guess could easily put it in the hundreds, if not thousands of productions over the course of the last century. There’s a gross double standard at play here – white actors are given access to roles written for darker-skinned actors, while Black actors are effectively limited from playing all roles, including the ones that are, essentially, written for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I think I just screamed at her for two-and-a-half-hours.” With the wisdom of the years passed, he’s able to look at Shakespeare’s words with an appreciation for the full depth of their intention. “It isn’t just rage – it’s loss, it’s hurt, it’s self-loathing, it’s insecurity, it’s vulnerability. Anybody who’s been in a loving relationship or a marriage knows that when you do have arguments, they’re not a full-tilt 10 – they’re twos and threes and then nothing and then twos and fives and then nothing. It’s a kaleidoscope of emotion.” Coming back to the part has also given him a greater appreciation for the skill required in the undertaking: “It’s a real opportunity to test yourself technically as an actor. I wasn’t old enough and I wasn’t experienced enough to just enjoy the language and the verse.”It is perhaps because Harewood is a different person today that he is seeing things in the play he didn’t see before. He’s an older man, carrying the complexities of a lifetime, which have taught him that “when you embrace your vulnerability, it gives you a hell of a lot of strength”. He’s been amazed at just how emotional rehearsals have been right from the start because the script touches upon so many feelings. In 1997, he says, he was overly preoccupied with offering an authentic portrayal of Blackness above all else: “I wanted to bring that believability – I wasn’t free enough to have fun and play the role.”This time, he is less concerned with that authenticity as he once was. He has examined his vulnerabilities and insecurities and is weaving those into the character. He is uniquely able to identify with Othello in the time leading up to Desdemona’s murder because of his well-documented struggles with his own mental health. “I think the character does go into a form of psychosis – and I’m drawing on my own experience because during my psychosis I did a whole lot of things I didn’t want to do because the voices in my head told me to do them.”Being the first carried with it a huge pressure. He was aware of how his performance might influence the careers of those coming after him: “One wants to not just open the door but kick it down for the people behind me.” But the role itself is also profoundly challenging – not just because of the racism but also the misogyny, which rears its ugly head mostly in the second half where Othello slaps Desdemona in public. “We all deify Shakespeare. We all think he is a genius because of the things he talks about and yet a lot of his women are quite weak and subservient. It is hideously misogynistic and we are trying to play against that. When we started looking at those elements in the play this time, I felt awful. I felt like a monster. And then you’re playing into the stereotype of the Black monster – I found that really difficult.” He’s grateful to have a drama therapist in the rehearsal room to remind him he is an actor, playing a part.While there’s no doubt that the play was written for a blackface performance, Harewood is keen to eradicate the ways in which the outdated tradition transforms Othello’s race into a dramatic device that drives the action and advances the plot. “Blackface is full of trope and I think some of those tropes inform the play.”Dr Jason Allen-Paisant also examines the insidious nature of blackface in his award-winning poetry collection Self Portrait as Othello. Just as in the forthcoming production, his work seeks to de-couple Othello’s actions from the fact of his race and skin colour. “One of the reasons I am interested in this Shakespeare is that it is, paradoxically, both an erasure and a record,” he says. “At the same time as recording the existence of Black people in 16th-century Italy, it simultaneously erases the same by reducing Black identity to a pack of stereotypes.” The narrative of his book is significantly driven by the objective of creating a backstory for Othello. “These myths have an enduring power. I wanted to imagine for him the density of a real character, with a real story,” he says.Countless productions have given in to racist interpretations of Shakespeare’s original script, presenting Othello as a man who murders his wife because violence is inherent to Black identity. One of the things Harewood is most concerned with in that respect is to restore dignity to Othello’s character. “He loves, hard. There’s no honour in what he does, but there’s heart in it. I want the audience to leave the theatre thinking it’s a sad tragedy because a great man was corrupted.”Othello is at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, 23 October to 17 January.Explore more on these topicsTheatreDavid HarewoodWilliam ShakespeareOthelloChiwetel EjioforfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is an appropriate image, given that so many early readers – from BookTokkers to fellow authors – have reported weeping uncontrollably during the book’s final third.For King, the reaction was unexpected. “I certainly felt a lot of emotion while I was writing. Not sobbing, more a deeper grief,” she says. But she describes the writing of her sixth novel, which begins with a 1980s college love story then revisits the same characters in middle age, as a joyful experience. “It was really great to just go back to the 1980s and college. It was a relief.”King’s latest novel shares a “connective thread” with Writers & Lovers, her bestselling 2020 tale of a 31-year-old woman waitressing while striving to establish herself as an author, which counts Curtis Sittenfeld, Elizabeth Strout and Madeline Miller among its fans. Like that book, and 2014’s Euphoria, inspired by the life of 1930s anthropologist Margaret Mead, Heart the Lover features a love triangle (actually, in Euphoria the triangle is more of a square). This dynamic feels true to life, King says, at least in her experience: “You go through droughts with relationships and then it just pours.”Yet King did not intend to write a love story this time. She was working on a “political murder mystery” titled Mercury Island during the pandemic. “I had about 90 pages, and I had run out of steam. I had a dead body on the first page, and I didn’t care how he died,” she laughs. Then her friend Ann Patchett sent her the manuscript of Tom Lake. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, she’s having so much fun. And I am having so much fun reading this.’”So she flipped to the back of her notebook and started writing Heart the Lover’s first scene.King’s writing is warm and big-hearted – even when characters behave badly they are presented with sympathy – and she comes across the same way, speaking from the house she shares with her husband in Portland, Maine. She is curious, chatty, has a cascade of long, curly blond hair and exudes a sense of hearty outdoorsiness – she hikes and, as she tells me with a wince, “Dare I say, I have gotten really into pickleball.”For all her buoyancy, she is devastated by the political situation in the US; her voice cracks when she talks about her fears for voting rights, and about the tech companies who strike her as “intent on pushing us away from each other – actively, deliberately – with seemingly no conscience or sense of responsibility. It just breaks my heart.”We Americans have always had an exceptionalist point of view, as though that authoritarianism would never come hereGiven the darkness of this moment, she admits that in the run-up to publication she sometimes wished she had written that political murder mystery, and not a love story, after all. At times she worried that the book’s title – taken from a card game the characters play – was too “schmaltzy”. One of her two grownup daughters even told her: “‘You use that title, you will ruin your career.’ That really haunted me!”In the end, though, she decided to “go all in”. “Falling in love produces all of these great feelings and chemicals and hormones,” she says. “The extraordinary thing is that you can read a novel and feel those same things.” She is well aware that love stories are sometimes discussed “in a belittling way. I really want to push back against that, because I don’t know what else we have if we don’t have love?”King knew she wanted to be a writer from her first high school creative writing class. But the road, she says, was “very, very, slow”. She studied English as an undergraduate, and a master of fine arts in creative writing at Syracuse University, then, similarly to her Writers & Lovers protagonist, Casey, paid the rent waiting tables. Her first novel was published when she was 36.She says she developed writerly, watchful instincts during her “chaotic” Massachusetts childhood, which encompassed periods at home alone with her unhappily married parents while her two older siblings were at boarding school, and then the acquisition of 14 step-siblings after her parents divorced when she was 11, remarrying three times between them. Her father “was a really serious alcoholic. I don’t know how he got all these wives to marry him!” she says. Each family setup was so different. “There were four different cultures. I became very adept at watching for signs of how that culture operated, how I would survive best and how to protect myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She and Blume are now friends, having met during an online event during the pandemic. That “has been an incredible honour. She gave me everything. I feel like I would not have this career if I hadn’t read her books.”These days, she is a diverse reader. “I always keep a copy of Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse on my desk, as well as The Evening of the Holiday by Shirley Hazzard,” she says. She is a longterm devotee of Tessa Hadley, Strout and Colm Tóibín, and citesMy Friendsby Hisham Matar, about three Libyan exiles living in London, as a recent favourite. At the moment it is “useful to read dissident literature about countries in authoritarian crises. I’ve read a lot of those books all my life – now it’s with a totally different perspective. We Americans have always had an exceptionalist point of view, as though that would never come here. And so I think those stories are so important – but we also need to balance our reading so we don’t get terrified into numbness and inertia.”That, in the end, is why she decided to embrace her accidentally written love story.Fiction“allows us to see things from so many perspectives. That is such an important part of living communally,” she says. When we connect with others through fiction, it reminds us “that the huge majority of people on this Earth are genuinely good and have love in their hearts”.Heart the Lover by Lily King is published by Canongate (£18.99).

His second, 1929, out this week, takes readers “Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How it Shattered a Nation”.It’s been 16 years between books, but Sorkin hasn’t been idle. A columnist for the New York Times, he founded its DealBook newsletter and summit; he’s a Squawk Box co-anchor for CNBC; and after Too Big to Fail was filmed by HBO, he co-created Billions, a huge hit for Showtime starring Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti.After Too Big to Fail, Sorkin said, he was “often asked about 1929. I actually didn’t know much. I had readJK Galbraith[The Great Crash, 1929, published in 1955] and a couple other books. And most people I knew, we would all sort of talk about 1929 as this terrible calamity, but nobody … knew what actually happened – who the people were, what they said to each other, what the motivations were, what the incentives were, what the lessons actually were.”This month’s best paperbacks: Jonathan Coe, Tessa Hadley and moreRead moreThe short version of what happened in 1929 is that a stock market built on fast credit and wild speculation suffered a series of falls culminating in the Black Thursday crash on 24 October, in Galbraith’s words a day “measured by disorder, fright, and confusion”.Combined with factors including protectionist tariffs and rising unemployment, the crash was a key signpost to a devastating global depression.“About a decade ago,” seeking a way into the story, Sorkin went on vacation and “like a real nerd, downloaded some books to a Kindle … and I remember reading them, thinking: ‘Wow, this is so much more interesting than I knew,’ but also feeling most of the books about this period were written in the 1930s, some in the 40s, 50s. I think there’s one that was maybe the 70s. And a lot of them were written by economists … told through charts and data and economic systems. And I wanted the human drama.View image in fullscreenThe cover of 1929.Photograph: Viking/Penguin“One of the lessons of writing Too Big to Fail was, we talk about business and the economy oftentimes in big numbers and structures and systems, but it really is ultimately about people and the decisions they make. So I thought: ‘Maybe there’s an opening to write a book like that.”A visit to Harvard allowed a look at the papers of Thomas Lamont, a partner at JP Morgan, including transcripts of White House talks with President Herbert Hoover. Allowing for myriad commitments and the challenges of pandemic-era research, Sorkin’s book was a go.As influences for a book based on first-hand sources found in countless archives, Sorkin cites business classics: Den of Thieves by James B Stewart, about insider trading; Liar’s Poker by Michael Lewis, about bonds traders; and Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, about the fall of RJR Nabisco.“Widening the aperture”, a phrase Sorkin uses to describe a project that encompasses earlier panics (1907, 1921) and the long aftermath of 1929, he also looked to Walter Lord’s A Night to Remember, from 1955, as “really the definitive in-the-room account of the sinking of the Titanic” and “actually a little bit like a mental model … [for] a way I wanted the reader to be able to feel.”The crash of 1929 was indeed like a shipwreck. Livelihoods were lost when the market capsized, though Sorkin confirms that one image in the popular imagination, of ruined brokers leaping from Wall Street windows, is not what actually happened. For a while, it seemed the economy might recover. It took other factors, prominently including the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, to bring about depression.As Sorkin’s book comes out, Donald Trump’s tariffs and their effects are in the news. Sorkin said he wrote with an eye on current events but preferred not to oversell such parallels, instead seeking chiefly to present relatable characters.“I’m always trying to understand where the drive comes from, where the motivation comes from, for whatever the decision is that people are making,” Sorkin said, citing experience gained “in the context of Billions and the making of the movie Too Big to Fail” as well as “what I try to do with my journalism every day.“Oftentimes it was to try to understand: ‘Well, what is it that’s driving Charlie Mitchell?’ … or: ‘What was it about Carter Glass in his childhood that led him to be this sort of very unique character?’ Similarly with Lamont and John Raskob and so many others.”View image in fullscreenThe front page of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper.Photograph: Icon Communications/Getty ImagesMitchell, CEO of National City Bank, a casualty of the crash, was hauled before Congress and into court on tax charges. Glass was a senator from Virginia who drovereformto protect ordinary Americans from Wall Street excess. Raskob, an executive at DuPont and General Motors, chaired the Democratic National Committee.One way Sorkin seeks to make such characters relatable is to depict their use of technology to master fast-moving markets – analog telephones in serried ranks on desks above Wall Street now home to computers. He’s also happy to compare key players to equivalents today.Considering Glass, a Virginia conservative, Sorkin looks to a current senator from Massachusetts, decidedly more progressive, the force behind theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed after 2008 to protect ordinary investors.“If Elizabeth Warren was a racist, that’s who [Glass] would be,” Sorkin laughed. “But what, to me, was so interesting about [Glass] was also that … he was cited after the 2008 financial crisis as one of the great bastions of the regulatory world. I think liberals really loved him. They thought that he was really trying to hold Wall Street to account.“And I went into this project thinking about that narrative, and … as the story progresses, it is so much more complicated than that. I’m not sure Elizabeth Warren would be citing Carter Glass today if she really understood the full dynamic of howthe Glass-Steagall Billwas created.“I thought of Glass-Steagall [also named for Henry B Steagall, a congressman from Alabama] as this famous bill that broke up the banks and was really meant to end the casino [gambling on the markets], and then you realize … the real movers weren’t even politicians, to some degree they were bankers who were trying to screw each other. And maybe it just represents how this world is actually no different than it is today, in many ways, in terms of how the sausage gets made.”Among those bankers, Sorkin found Mitchell “sort of a villain, but not really” and compelling because “I love characters that are not black and white. And he was so interesting to me because he was as famous as Jamie Dimon [CEO of JPMorgan Chase] would be today. But there were aspects of [Mitchell] that might have been more like a Michael Milken,” the insider trader jailed in 1990 thenpardonedby Trump in 2020.“Charlie Mitchell created credit and leverage in the system to loan money to ordinary investors, which in large part is what led to the crash. Michael Milken revolutionized the debt markets and the credit markets in the 80s by loaning high-yield bonds, or what people call junk bonds, to less good credits. And they both were arrested. The outcome was slightly different, but they were both hated.”Knowing today’s titans well – it was his question that memorably prompted Elon Musk totell critics “go fuck yourself”– Sorkin is well placed to make comparisons. Regarding another key character in 1929, the Tesla, SpaceX and X owner duly enters the chat.View image in fullscreenAndrew Ross Sorkin.Photograph: Mike Cohen“To me, John Raskob is like Elon Musk. Think about a businessman who was involved in everything. Cars, obviously, General Motors, and [Raskob] gets involved in politics … starting to try to damage the reputation of Hoover by doing all of these back-channel projects. And then he’s building the equivalent of a spaceship, the Empire State Building. And he also happens to have 13 children.”Among the supporting cast, there’s Hoover, the technocratic president who rebranded the post-crash “panic” as a “depression”, inadvertently sealing his reputation as a failure, left to watch Franklin D Roosevelt save the day. Sorkin also depicts Winston Churchill, a decade away from his finest hour as British prime minister, in debt to his shirtmaker, playing the Manhattan markets anyway, wandering Fifth Avenue, there to be hit by a car.Financial calamity brings political fallout. In the second half of 1929, Sorkin’s story moves to Washington and attempts to hold Wall Street accountable. As in 2008, most main players avoided serious penalties.Clearly, Sorkin is going to get more questions about what 1929 might teach us about 2025 and aUS economyshowing signs of trauma, Trump-induced or not.He said: “There are a lot of parallels that I imagine people could draw out. I mean, look at the idea today and the idea back then of democratizing finance.”In 1929, “democratizing finance” meant opening the markets to ordinary Americans through unchecked credit.“Today,” Sorkin said, “what do they talk about democratizing finance? They just passed a bill that Trump signed that’s going to allow private equity and venture capital and private credit into your 401(k) plan. That’s all about democratizing finance. Crypto is now a thing that’s about democratizing finance. Obviously, the tariffs are almost a super-direct parallel.”Another Trump obsession, bending the central bank to his will, is also foreshadowed in Sorkin’s book.“There’s the whole debate the Fed is having in the spring of 1929 about whether to raise or lower interest rates,” Sorkin said. “To some degree, [there are] even debates about the independence of the Fed … So I think there’s lots of things that do seem familiar.”1929 isoutnowExplore more on these topicsBooksBusiness and finance booksEconomicsEconomic policyUS economyStock marketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a shame then that her latest work, We Caliban, inspired by The Tempest, doesn’t manage to convey her rich ideas around this key character. We begin with a letter from Elizabeth I to Walter Raleigh from 1584, giving him licence to set out and conquer foreign lands, then maps of Caribbean islands, their original names crossed out and replaced with Anguilla, Grenada, Barbuda. Jeyasingh’s postcolonial take on the text seems clear, Prospero the invader forcing native Caliban into servitude. But having established this on stage, the idea dissipates into something much more impressionistic, the conceptual thrust is lost. We’re led into a story and then left stranded, like a Milanese duke and his daughter on a remote island.View image in fullscreenTender connection … Shobana Jeyasingh Dance: We CalibanPhotograph: Foteini ChristofilopoulouJeyasingh’s dancing is always well wrought. Her background is in the Indian classical form bharatanatyam, melded with western contemporary dance, and she has a classicist’s feel for proportion and precision, an acute (no pun intended) sense of angle and line. Character is less of a concern – the dancers aren’t “acting”, as such – and the effect is flat. Prospero, with his book and his staff, controls in fairly benign fashion. Caliban gets more interesting. Dancer Raúl Reinoso Acanda (formerly of Cuba’s Acosta Danza) has two key duets: first with Miranda, where there is resistance, or resentment, perhaps, but also a connection between them that leads to tenderness. Then after the colonists have left, a second enigmatic duet (with an unnamed woman, one of the island’s original inhabitants). This one is cool and careful, the two are fascinated, yet wary and distant – their fingers only just touching in a long stretched pose. They look at the audience rather than each other, but they seem to have a kind of mutual understanding. What’s going on here? The fallout, perhaps of trying to rebuild yourself when you’ve been stripped of what was essentially you? Caliban now trying to work out how to be himself, how to live, how to trust?The music, by Thierry Pécou, is an unpredictable patchwork of melodies, textures, sounds and silences, which never lets you get comfortable; fitting for a work that’s frustratingly hard to get a handle on.AtWarwick Arts Centre, 21 Oct; further tour dates to be announced in spring 2026.Explore more on these topicsDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes they are forcibly toppled, such as in the case of 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, whose bronze statue wasrolled into Bristolian waters in 2020. But several years before that, there was protest over Yale University’s Calhoun College, named in honour of 19th-century alumnus, John C Calhoun, a white supremacist and zealous advocate of slavery (the college was renamed after Grace Murray Hopperin 2017).The demand for its renaming is the subject of this debut play by writer-actor Jamie Bogyo, who is a Yale alumnus himself. A fictive statue of Calhoun sets the culture wars into full swing; a petition, organised by Omar (Ivan Oyik), is circulating the dorms. Connor (Bogyo) is its main opponent. He rails against virtue signalling and snowflakes, but insists he is not racist (“I voted for Obama”). He also tries to co-opt his Black room-mate, Isaiah (Ernest Kingsley Jr), for his cause. Meanwhile, Connor’s girlfriend, Annabelle (Céline Buckens), who comically manifests all the signs of white guilt, has ambitions to become president of Yale’s Women’s Leadership, but is pipped by freshman Stacy (Bola Akeju).View image in fullscreenStatue toppling … Bola Akeju and Céline Buckens.Photograph: Helen MurrayIt is a lively setup which tries to wrestle with intersecting themes of race, gender and privilege, with dynamic direction from Roy Alexander Weise and lovely a cappella interludes. But the tone seems that of a broad campus comedy, complete with sophomoric sex, joshing and a silly masturbation scene. The Obama era language might be emphatic but feels dated.Omar is made to seem goofy so that he resembles a sitcom character rather than an anti-racist firebrand with a blind-spot around gender. Stacy is overplayed as the ambitious Black student from the wrong side of the tracks and Connor is converted to the liberal cause after a single argument with Isaiah, while Isaiah’s own turn to a more politicised Black identity also feels too abrupt.Connor as a whole seems too nice, too apologetic, to be the hard-right nemesis he is supposed to be, so there is not enough tension between characters. You get the impression that they would all be part of the No Kings campaign if they were students today.There are a few strong scenes, such as an argument between Omar and Isaiah but not all of its grenades detonate. The a cappella remains a pleasure; Connor and Isaiah make good their rifts through music and both Bogyo and Kingsley Jr sing exquisitely, but the question of whether a Simon & Garfunkel song can save this friendship at the end does not carry quite the emotions it should.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreChichester Festival theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Our bandmate. Our heartbeat,” the band wrote.“Sam Rivers wasn’t just our bass player – he was pure magic. The pulse beneath every song, the calm in the chaos, the soul in the sound.Limp Bizkit review – nu-metal elders can still rock the party like it’s 1999Read more“From the first note we ever played together, Sam brought a light and a rhythm that could never be replaced. His talent was effortless, his presence unforgettable, his heart enormous.”Fred Durst, the band’s frontman and lead vocalist, posted a video Sunday morning that recounted how they met at a club in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, and went on to music stardom and performances around the globe. Durst said he has shed “gallons and gallons of tears since yesterday”.“He really did have an impact on the world and his music and his gift is the one that’s going to keep on giving,” Durst said. “I just love him so much.”The cause of Rivers’ death was not revealed.Rivers, 48, had spoken of heavy drinking that had caused liver disease. He left the band in 2015 and received a liver transplant before reuniting withLimp Bizkitthree years later.Durst said he and Rivers shared a love of grunge music, naming the bands Mother Love Bone, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.“He had this kind of ability to pull this beautiful sadness out of the bass that I’d never heard,” Durst said, calling Rivers “so talented I can’t explain.”Limp Bizkit formed in Jacksonville in 1994 and rose to fame in the late 1990s with their eclectic and heavy sound that blended metal, hip-hop and punk influences.They achieved mainstream success with their albums Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), which topped the charts in the US.Their off-the-wall sense of humor is reflected in the titles of their mega-selling 2000 album, “Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,” and a single released last month, “Making Love to Morgan Wallen.”Rivers was one of the founding members of the band, along with vocalist Fred Durst, drummer John Otto, guitarist Wes Borland and turntablist DJ Lethal.“Rest easy, brother. Your music never ends,” they said in the Instagram post.DJ Lethal added in a comment below the band’s post: “We are in shock. Rest in power my brother! You will live on through your music and the lives you helped save with your music , charity work and friendships. We are heartbroken 💔 enjoy every millisecond of life. It’s not guaranteed.”Limp Bizkit has scheduled a tour of Central and South America to begin in Mexico City in late November.Explore more on these topicsLimp BizkitMetalPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

His mother and Iare divorced, and I moved out when he was three. We share custody; he is with me three days/nights a week– including part of the weekend. He is doingwell at school and has varied interests. He is a very happy child and the most precious thing to me.I havebeen in a steady relationship with a remarkable woman for three years. She and my son get along beautifully;he looks forward to seeing her and she loves him very much.I’ve beenconsidering remarrying.All the ingredients of a happy life are in place, but I am worriedit might have an adverse effect on my son.I do not want to introduce anyconfusion into his life.While he has spent loads of timewith my girlfriend andI,it seems he has yet to graspthat we are in a relationship. A few monthsago, he heard me referto heron the phoneas “my girlfriend” and said, “I thought shewas your friend. I didn’t know shewas your girlfriend.”We didn’t discuss it further and I took care to never refer to her as “my girlfriend” again.I don’t know how to speak to him about itwithout making himinsecure or confused. But I also feel it might be better to takethis step nowthan later, when he is a preteen/teen– as he’ll probably feel very differently then. I don’t know if I ambeing overcautious, butI don’t want to do anything that interferes with his childhood and happiness.The first thing you may have to get on board with is that your son’s reaction may not be exactly what you want, or it may change. But it’s up to you as the father to stabilise this, and you will because you’re thoughtful.I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Lucy Fuller, who said, “The words ‘girlfriend’/ ‘partner’/‘wife’ may have a different definition to a seven-year-old than they do to you.”She also wanted to reassure you that “it can often be forgotten that adults are entitled to romantic relationships.”Be clear that your new partner is an addition to the family and will carve out their own role, and is not a replacement for your son’s motherAs long as you are age-appropriate, remember to be confident, as children take their lead from us. “If we are hesitant, anxious or secretive,” said Fuller, “children pick up on our unease without being able to understand what they are feeling, which can lead to acting out and have a negative effect on family dynamics.”It’s important to remain thoughtful of your child’s feelings, but Fuller wanted you to be mindful that in some cases, “if the parent is not clear about their expectations as to how the partner is accepted, children can feel they have the power to enact their immature and instinctive need to reject a new partner who they could (and often do) perceive as a threat to their mother or father.“So be clear that your new partner is an addition to the wider family and will carve out their own role, and is not in any way a substitute or replacement for your son’s mother. You need to reassure him that you love your girlfriend, but this does not diminish your love for him. That the love is not shared between you but is multiplied to include everyone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Approach this with gentle confidence – because that will make him confident – and maybe refer back to that conversation where he said your girlfriend was just your friend as a starting point. What does he understand a girlfriend to mean?At this point Fuller suggests you bring up the subject of marriage. She says, “Encourage him to ask questions about your girlfriend – answering in an age-appropriate manner – and your relationship. Respond confidently while reaffirming your love for him and his importance to both of you. Emphasise how much your girlfriend likes him, but bear in mind that his interest will be more about how he fits into the new dynamic.”And remember that children are endlessly fascinated by the practicalities.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Also known variously as “breakfast casserole” and “egg dish”, strata is an American brunch favourite that, according to the great US chefSohla El-Waylly, is best described as “the love child of frittata and bread pudding”, while the dish’s name comes from the fact that it’s assembled in layers. Like all the best leftovers recipes, those layers are eminently flexible, but what all strata have in common are stale bread and eggs. The rest is largely up to you.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ll be honest, rich as it is, strata is not something I’d tackle before lunchtime, so I was relieved to read the lateJames Villas explainthat, “in the South, a strata is traditionally served on an informal dinner buffet or at a casual supper”. Whenever you plan to enjoy it, however, note that, as per America’s favourite cookbook,The Joy of Cooking, if need be the ever amenable strata “can be assembled and refrigerated overnight, then baked the next day, leaving you nothing to do but brew the coffee”. Or mix the bloody marys.The breadThis recipe should comfortably accommodate any savoury bread you wish to use up – rye bread, corn bread, even garlic bread will all give your strata a slightly different character – though I’d avoid anything too delicate, such as brioche.Samuel Goldsmith suggestssliced baguette in the spinach and tomato version in his Tinned Tomatoes Cookbook, there’s a smoked salmon one with bagels onFood52andmultiplecroissant-based takes online.Most writers, however, call for either a “quality white sandwich loaf” or “supermarket-style ‘French’ or ‘Italian’ bread”, for which I use a supermarket ciabatta. I prefer the more robust, chewy texture of the latter, or sourdough; the white tin loaf all but dissolves into the custard, especially when used fresh. For this reason, I’ve suggested crisping the slices up in the oven first. Arlyn Osborne,writes on Serious Eatsthat drying the bread in the oven “extracts moisture while leaving the crumb’s structure intact, making oven-dried bread a better option than stale bread”. She adds thatthe restructuringof starch molecules during the staling process makes for tough, rather than crunchy bread. However, this is first and foremost a recipe that’s about using up leftovers, so if you have thoroughly stale bread already, by all means skip that step – it will still be good.View image in fullscreenArlyn Osborne oven-dries her bread, rather than using stale bread, which ‘extracts moisture while leaving the crumb’s structure intact’.Most strata involve cubes of bread, which is odd, because, as Villas notes rather tartly, “if the primary ingredients are not arranged in alternate layers, the dish is not a genuine strata but an ordinary casserole”. Thick slices will,as Cooks Illustrated observes, help keep the layers intact and make for a neater end result. (Again, if you’re using a loaf that doesn’t lend itself to slicing, just cut or tear it into chunks instead.)The custardThe recipes I try are divided between those who make their strata with an enriched white sauce thickened with flour, such as Villas’ and chef and writer Amy Thielen’s; and those, such as Cooks Illustrated, Osborne and Melissa Clark in the New York Times, who prefer an egg custard (which seems to be the more common modern choice). The benefit of the former is that it’s cheaper, less temperamental and can be made as rich or plain as you like simply by adjusting the number of eggs you beat in at the end. But a dish of bread baked with a starchy sauce could be accused of being rather stodgy, especially first thing in the morning. The custards are more delicate and almost quiche filling-like in the case of those containing heavy cream (the US equivalent of British whipping cream.Because this is, in theory, a breakfast dish, I’ve come down on the egg custard side of the argument, but my testers find some examples offputtingly “fluffy”, bringing back traumatic memories, they claim, of school dinner flans. I put that down to the high milk content – the more water in the emulsion, the more risk of it breaking in the heat of the oven. Mixing the milk with something that’s higher in fat, such as cream, is good insurance, and makes for a firm, silky result rather than a watery, weepy one. I’ve gone for tangy creme fraiche, but any thick cream will do the job.View image in fullscreenAmy Thielen favours an egg custard, and includes layers of sliced, cooked eggs.Thielen brings some Minnesota flairto the “egg dish” in her book The New Midwestern Table by including layers of sliced, cooked eggs rather than whisking raw ones into the sauce. However, although we enjoy the rest of her dish, the baked hard-boiled eggs are deemed a bit dry and rubbery; Clark’s idea of cracking raw eggs on to the top of the strata halfway through baking feels a better choice if you’d like extra protein.The flavourings and ingredientsStrata are a good vehicle for more than old bread – leftover vegetables, meat scraps and ends of cheese can all go in, so it’s worth bookmarking this recipe for Twixmas. The recipes I try use spinach (both fresh and frozen) baby leaves, curly kale, ham, bacon, leek and mushrooms, as well as soft goat’s cheese and several sorts of hard stuff including gruyere, mild cheddar and parmesan. The golden rule is, as so often in baking, to make sure you get rid of as much water as possible before introducing them to the other ingredients, which means pre-cooking the vegetables. (Loth as I am to disagree with the great Villas’ The Glory of Southern Cooking, raw mushrooms do tend to leak a lot of water, frying the bacon and so on.Clark’s recipe whizzes greens (baby kale, mustard greens, chard) and herbs into the custard itself, turning it a vibrant green, which looks great, though my testers and I miss the texture of the layer of leaves. She also introduces parmesan to the custard itself, which, if you want cheese to be more of a seasoning than a star player, is a great idea. If you hanker for the stretchy pull of melted cheese, however, then deploy a milder, softer variety as a layer in its own right; gruyere, emmental, red leicester, double gloucester or a medium cheddar are all ideal candidates, but, again, it’ll work with just about any combination you have handy. Match your seasonings to the ingredients: mustard, Tabasco, fresh thyme … if it wouldn’t be out of place in a quiche, or folded into scrambled eggs, it’s a fairly safe bet in a strata, too.View image in fullscreenMelissa Clark’s strata whizzes greens and herbs into the custard, turning it a vibrant greenI’ve gone for a classic combination of spinach (this is a great place for the frozen variety), leek and cheese, with a grating of nutmeg, but replace those as you see fit; an easy way to judge how much you need of a particular ingredient is simply to scatter it across the base of the baking dish to see if you can get two layers out of it. Garlic and nutmeg feel inevitable with spinach, but if it’s too early in the day for the former as far as you’re concerned, you could always leave it out, or indeed replace it with spring onion, shallot or a mild red onion.If you’re thinking of having this for lunch or dinner, you might also want to consider replacing some of the liquid in the custard with chicken or vegetable stock, or flavouring it with a few spoonfuls of dry white wine reduced by half, as in Cook’s Illustrated’s recipe; both give it a slightly more complex, dare I say sophisticated flavour profile. No one wants that at breakfast time.The resting and cookingThielen is the only one not to give the custard a chance to soak into the bread before baking, proving that if you’re running late, the situation is not irretrievable. That said, the layers will hold together better if they’re left to sit – I don’t find much difference between Cook’s Illustrated’s single hour and Villa’s six, and you can even leave them to mingle overnight, if you wish, preferably with a weight on top to help with more crisply defined strata.As with anything custard-based, keep the oven temperature moderate to avoid it curdling – 160C ((140C fan)/325F/gas 3) rather than the 180C ((160C fan)/350F/gas 4) called for by many recipes – and leave it to rest before serving, because eggs taste far better warm than hot.Strata doesn’t freeze well, but it can be made a day ahead. These quantities can be easily scaled up or down, too.Perfect strataPrep20 minChill1 hr +Cook1 hr 50 minServes4-6About 250g bread– I like sourdough or ciabatta1 tbsp olive oil1 small leek, trimmed and finely sliced250g frozen spinach, defrosted, or about 500g fresh spinach, wilted in a large pan with a splash of water2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedSalt and black pepper6 eggs100gfull-fat creme fraiche, or double cream175ml whole milkNutmegButter or oil, for greasing100g grated cheese(eg, gruyere, emmental, medium cheddar)Unless your bread is already rock hard and crunchy, heat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/gas ½.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Birmingham’s dining scene often leans towards the intense. I recall a hazy afternoon seven years back at theDigbeth Dining Club, a ramshackle food market inside an old factory with few seats, loud music, breakfast cocktails and baos; it was a thoroughly chaotic way to take on board calories. More recently, I loved the city’sAlbatross Death Cult, which served 12 courses of scintillating, seafood-focused finickiness to a pounding, darkwave industrial-goth soundtrack.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And, now, it is the turn of 670 Grams to bombard my senses Brummie-style, in Digbeth’sCustard Factory development. Chef Kray Treadwell began cooking at the city’s well-loved and much-missedPurnell’s, followed by a stint at Michael O’Hare’sThe Man Behind The Curtainin Leeds. By 2021, he had been namedMichelin’s UK young chef of the yearafter creating, with head chef Sacha Townsend (also formerly of several O’Hare projects), this kooky, monochromatic, moody restaurant that plays semi-loud hip-hop.View image in fullscreen670 Grams, Birmingham: ‘Bombard your senses Brummie-style.’The decor is kitsch crypt, and very dark in places, with not a single 50-watt bulb in the house. The bathroom is purposefully styled with all the cosiness of Renton’s“worst toilet in Scotland” in Trainspotting. No actual overflowing toilets, I stress, but every wall festooned in graffiti and a toilet roll holder made out of a Polaroid camera. Pre-drinks in 670 Grams’ lobby, meanwhile, take place around fancy coffee tables and surrounded by moody art. It all feels a bit like being in an exclusive 1980s Soho hotel during a power cut.Restaurants such as this – edgy, ballsy, disruptive – will always be a difficult sell to some audiences. The menu, which is painstakingly executed over six or 12 courses, is a cascade of small, meaningful bowls – an earthy bone broth here, a sliver of Jemison Park trout there – all of which just ooze flavour and, like all the best superheroes, turn up with an origin story. Meat and two veg this is not. Instead, expect the likes of a glossy half-inch of eggless custard-topped carabinero prawn with a smear of sambal and a sharp hit of lime, which is odd and delightful in equal measures. Similarly intriguing is a chunk of Cornish bluefin tuna in a froth of eel milk with a little jersey royal potato. Can you milk an eel? Is it the new new dairy alternative?View image in fullscreen‘Odd and delightful in equal measures’: 670 Grams’ carabinero with prawn head caramel and savoury custard.Courses turn up at a steady pace, brought by both Treadwell himself and his very capable staff. One highlight is two voluptuous, wobbling barbecued Cornish mussels in a Thai-ish turmeric sauce with a sweet hit of caramel apple; they are served with “sourdough” that is more like a crouton. 670 Grams is not a place to arrive famished and hoping for a slap-up. Rather, it is very clearly a journey, an exploration, a culinary art exhibition or a high-concept dining experience, or indeed any of those other terms I’ve ever used to define dinners of this kind (of which I’ve eaten hundreds), where chefs cook at a sublime level, but dish up such minuscule amounts.The bottom line, however, is: would I remember this fancy-schmancy teensy dinner? And the answer is a resounding yes: there is something wildly likable about Peterhead Market cod laced with koji onion and sesame cauliflower, and a brief but meaningful portion of Staffordshire texel lamb cooked in jerk-influenced spices and served with a slice of barbecued hispi cabbage. The lamb comes with a rich sauce made from sheep’s milk and further hints of that jerk rub. Every element of 670 Grams’ menu is doubtless sketched out, cogitated over and measured to within an inch of its life.View image in fullscreen‘Brief but meaningful’: 670 Grams’ Staffordshire texel jerk lamb with barbecued hispi, sheep’s milk bread and jerk sauce.Any hopes that the dessert courses might provide some much-needed refuge from all this intensity are immediately dashed when they bring out carrot cake with a frosting made of lamb fat. That would have been the point when my old Aunt Pat, God rest her soul, would have clutched her pearls, grabbed her handbag and flounced out mumbling loudly about her Women’s Institute recipe. Being a brave sort, I stayed put, and it turns out that lamb fat does, in fact, work rather nicely in a sweet icing. And isn’t lamb and carrots a classic combo, anyway? Even so, I won’t be looking for lamb-flavoured sponge cakes turning up in a Greggs meal deal any time soon.View image in fullscreen‘Marvellous’: 670 Grams’ tribute to Cadbury’s Fruit & Nut bar features Pedro Ximénez-steeped prunes, tulakalum chocolate foam and almonds.The marvellous final course was much safer ground: a tribute to the local Cadbury’s factory and its belovedFruit & Nut bar, albeit one made with tulakalum grand cru chocolate, prunes steeped in pedro ximénez and almonds.

What happens if you want to break up?Alaina DemopoulosSun 19 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTShareOnce Vanessa Dunn started living alone, it became impossible to imagine sharing her space with a boyfriend. “It was so, so girly,” said Dunn, who is a 25-year-old fitness instructor from Maine. “There was pink everywhere. I’d look at my bathroom and think, ‘Living with a man sounds like my worst nightmare.’”Then, six months into a whirlwind romance with a long-distance boyfriend, Dunn’s apartment gained another occupant.Dunn and her boyfriend, a grad student who moved from Scotland, say they started shacking up because they are in love and someday plan to get married. But they would be lying if they said theever-increasing cost of rentdid not also play a role in the decision.View image in fullscreenVanessa Dunn.Photograph: Courtesy of Vanessa Dunn“I just had a mental breakdown about the finances of living alone,” Dunn said. “It doesn’t feel like the world is made for single people. When you have a partner, everything’s split down the middle, and you can put that extra money away and potentially have savings.”Every love story is unique, but Dunn’s speedy meet-cute to move-in timeline echoes a wider trend. In August, astudyreleased by the rental company Apartments.com found that one quarter of surveyed couples moved in together within the first six months of their relationship; 33% of them said they did so to save on rent. A September report from the Kinsey Institute andDatingNews.comsurveyed 2,000 single US adults and again, nearly one in foursaidthey would “fast-track cohabitation” with romantic partners for the sake of finances. This was especially true for gen Z: 38% said they would move in faster due to inflation and the cost of living – perhaps skipping the formative step of living alone altogether.“It was only a matter of time until we found evidence that inflation impacts dating and relationships,” said Dr Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow at Kinsey and one of the study’s lead authors. “It seems clear that some people view moving in together as a way to be more financially comfortable.”When we moved in, yes, it was about money, but I also genuinely really wanted to have him aroundVanessa DunnIt doesn’t always work out. Leaving a partner is hard enough, but finding a new place to live on top of that can be so overwhelming that people put off a necessary breakup. TheApartments.comstudy found that when individuals have to choose between ending a relationship or keeping it going because they cannot afford to move out, 55% stayed longer.“There’s a risk of moving in too fast,” Lehmiller said. “You could end up financially tied with someone who you don’t actually want to be with.”Natassia Miller, a New York-based sexologist calls this “financial coupling” where leases and bills – not, you know, love – binds partners together. “I work with couples who have been living together for so many years, and they’re unhappy, and the only thing keeping them together is bills,” Miller said. “It’s important to be able to have the choice to walk into – or leave – a relationship because of your actual dynamic and compatibility, not because of finances.”At the same time, young women are romanticizing going it alone. They are rewatching Sex and the City, and Girls, posting about their “girl apartment” on TikTok, or taking tor/femalelivingspaceto show off their room decor, homespun paint jobs or hanging plants. One perennial pop feminist meme features a quote from Whoopi Goldberg’s 2016 New York Times interview on why she lives alone: “I don’t want somebody in my house.”I always tell friends that if they’re able to live alone, they shouldEmily SanchezMen might feel differently. The Kinsey study found that men are more likely to want to move in due to the economy than women (29% of men compared with 19% of women).Lehmiller says he sees this gender gap “consistently” in studies conducted over the past few years. “Men are just more eager,” he said. “Women are approaching relationships more cautiously than men are and taking their time, pursuing relationships on their own terms.”View image in fullscreenEmily Sanchez.Photograph: Courtesy of Emily SancehzWhen Emily Sanchez was in her mid-20s, she moved in with her now-ex boyfriend after a year of dating. Saving on rent was a big motivator, and at first it felt like “playing house” said Sanchez, who is now 30 and lives in San Diego. But she soon found that living together “put pressure” on their relationship, and Sanchez found herself putting her boyfriend’s needs before her own. “I definitely felt taken advantage of,” she said. When Sanchez finally had enough, she had to dip into her savings to afford the move to her own place, a Spanish-style apartment with high ceilings and lots of natural light.A green thumb who owns a company that sells plant accessories, Sanchez filled the place with flora and souvenirs from her travels. She posted idyllic pictures on social media, and other women messaged her, asking how she managed to move out on her own.“A lot of girls said they wanted to leave their relationships, but they were living with their partner and couldn’t afford to get out of it,” she said. “I have experience living with a partner and living alone, and I always tell friends that if they’re able to live alone, they should.”In 1936, a Vogue editor named Marjorie Hillis published her first book, Live Alone and Like It. With the kind of pluck and aplomb that used to be a requirement for glossy magazine writing, the early self-help book insisted that a single girl’s life could be just as fabulous – and maybe even preferable to – that of a married woman’s.Back then, most women who lived alone were widows, along with the smaller category of women who chose to stay single during the first wave of feminism.Some of Hillis’s tips were practical: she advised singles to pick up one hobby they could do by themselves, and one they did with other people. (“Be a communist, a stamp collector, or a Ladies’ Aid worker if you must, but for heaven’s sake, be something.”) She also preached a gospel of frivolity, encouraging single women to splurge on silk pyjamas, even if no one would ever see them: “The woman who treats herself like an aristocrat seems aristocratic to other people, and the woman who is sloppy at home inevitably slips sometimes in public.”‘It’s emotionally painful, spending every day with your ex’: the couples who live with their partners after a breakupRead moreBut mostly, Hillis railed against the notion that single living was a sign of defeat. “One of the great advantages of your way of living is that youcanbe alone when you want to,” she wrote. “Lots of people never discover what a pleasure this can be … The more you enjoyyourself, the more of a person you are.”Dunn has no regrets about moving in with her boyfriend, however quickly. But part of what makes settling down so sweet is being able to look back at how much she grew during her “single era”.“Living alone made me very comfortable with myself, and I decided that if I was going to date again I would have to be very, very confident that it was with the person who I would eventually end up with,” Dunn said. “When we moved in, yes, it was about money, but I also genuinely really wanted to have him around all of the time.”Explore more on these topicsCohabitationRelationshipsHousingRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Leo then told me he was in an open relationship, but they were on the rocksLeo and I first kissed on the dancefloor of a techno club in Hamburg 10 years ago, but we didn’t see each other again until 2020, when he messaged to say he was visiting London. Because of lockdown, we would meet up and have deep chats on park benches in the freezing cold, getting to know each other very quickly. We bonded over similar backgrounds – we’re very close to our families, who have always been loving and accepting of us being gay.We waited until the fourth date to have sex. Leo then told me he was in an open relationship, but they were on the rocks. I said if you want me, you’ll have to end it with him. So he did. Leo has only ever been in open relationships, whereas I’ve always been monogamous, which has been a bit of an issue between us. I’m also only really interested in being a submissive bottom, whereas Leo’s versatile, and I’m conscious that an open relationship would give him the chance to flip more.The idea of an open relationship is hot, but actually, it’s a lot of admin for worse sexWhen I tell other gay men that Leo and I are monogamous, it’s as though I’ve said we have the strangest kink. After a year together, we moved to Berlin, and the sex-positive culture made me more open-minded about non-monogamy. We tried opening up our relationship after I moved back to London earlier this year, but quickly closed it again. The idea is hot, but actually, there’s a lot of admin involved for what will realistically be worse sex. I love romance, and there’s something very unromantic about telling your partner about the things you’ve done with other men.Now we’re long distance, if we haven’t seen each other for weeks, there’s anticipation that the sex is going to be amazing. But if Leo is exhausted after flying into Luton at 11pm, and I have to get up early for work, it can be disappointing. Talking through the reasons why takes the pressure off.Hopefully, Leo is my for ever person, so there’s something freeing yet safe about focusing on our careers right now, then coming back together when we’re ready.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I was drained, and because I’m the dominant top, which requires more energy, I wanted to have sex less than he did. There was friction, but once we spoke about it, we both realised the other person was suffering, and that empathy made the sex even better.This is how we do it: ‘In my 50s I want to be “monogam-ish” – to have to have my cake and eat it’Read moreWhen Jake is more dominant, it shows he’s making an effort, which I appreciate. Ideally, our dominant-submissive roles would be more equal, but relationships always involve some level of compromise.Jake didn’t settle very well in Germany, and I didn’t want him to end up resenting me if I made him stay longer than the three years we’d agreed on. Since he moved back to the UK, we no longer share the intimate, everyday moments, such as cooking and watching TV together. But sex feels special again. We make more of an effort, experiment more and take a lot more time – foreplay is longer, sex is longer, and we cuddle after for longer. It feels like the beginning of the relationship.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The seller’s reviews were all five-star, and she trusted in the buyer-protection policy should something go wrong.Sold new, an Airwrap costs between £400 and £480, but Maheen did not suspect anything was amiss. “I had used Vinted many times and it was simple and straightforward. Nothing had ever gone wrong,” she says.However, after two weeks – and about four uses – she spotted a problem. “I noticed the wire began to smoke and the product seemed unsafe,” she says. Maheen contacted Dyson and was told to send in the Airwrap.Its response confirmed her fears. “I got a letter from [Dyson] confirming the product was counterfeit. It was unsafe and they wouldn’t return it to me,” she says.Maheen’s experience is far from unique. Almost two-fifths (37%) of Britons have been scammed while buying or selling on online marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay and Vinted, according to research from the credit reference agency Experian.Victims of this type of crime tend to skew younger, with more than half of gen Z (58%) telling researchers they had been scammed compared with just 16% of people over the age of 55.For almost a quarter of people losses were in the region of £51 to £100, while 13% had lost more than £250. A small number said the scam had cost them between £501 and £1,000.The most common type of scam respondents encountered – being sent fake or counterfeit products (34%) – is the one Maheen fell prey to. Next up was requests to pay off-platform (31%), and items never arriving after payment (22%).What the scam looks likeIt looks like the legitimate item and the description suggests it is – more than half of scam victims (51%) told Experian they only realised they had been scammed once their item was delivered and turned out to be fake, or failed to arrive.Photos may be low resolution or look too good – like a catalogue photo – because they have been taken from other websites.The price will be less than you would expect and if you start asking questions the seller may try to rush you into a purchase and may ask you to pay them outside the Vinted platform.What to doAlways review a seller’s profile closely and read customer reviews before purchasing an item on a marketplace. Try to obtain as much information about the product as possible before buying – for instance, ask the seller to send a video of the product. To protect yourself, stick to secure payment methods and avoid bank transfers.If the worst happens, report the incident to the marketplace and ask for a refund. They may ask for screenshots of messages and the details of the seller or buyer, plus any bank transfer details.Maheen was outside the Vinted two-day buyer protection window, but assumed she would get her money back because the product was dangerous. However, she found that it “was really hard to talk to someone”.She says: “It felt like I was talking to a bot.”With Guardian Money’s help, she has now got her money back.A Vinted spokesperson said: “The vast majority of transactions on Vinted take place without issue, and our teams work hard to ensure a smooth trading experience for all our Vinted members.“When a dispute does occur between a buyer and a seller, we will mediate, working closely with our delivery partners and potentially asking for additional information or evidence, before issuing a final decision.”If appealing to the marketplace directly goes nowhere, there are other things you can do.If you used a debit card ask your bank to make a chargeback claim. Alternatively, if you paid by credit card, try a section 75 claim – this is only an option if you have spent more than £100. If you paid by bank transfer it is more complicated, but you may be entitled to a refund under newfraud refund protections.Explore more on these topicsE-commerceScam watchScamsAppsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s a self-confessed sleep data “nerd”, mining her sleep data for insights into her general health and wellbeing, using it to inform lifestyle decisions and even occasionally to guide how much she aims to accomplish in a day.Sleep monitoring is a boom industry, mirroring what devices and apps such as Fitbits and Strava have done for physical activity. Market reports vary on the value of this industry, but it is clearly lucrative and growing rapidly. A quick search reveals a wide range of devices – rings, headbands, watches and other wrist-worn devices, under-mattress devices and bedside devices – all suggesting their use will unlock such quality sleep as to make Rip Van Winkle jealous.Is it true that … women snore less than men?Read moreAn estimated40% of Australians are not getting enough good quality sleep, and one in 10 experience chronic insomnia. “We do know there are a lot of people who do worry about their sleep and whether they’re getting enough sleep, particularly if they’re not meeting some of the recommended sleep duration guidelines,” says Dr Hannah Scott, a senior research fellow in sleep psychology at the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute in Adelaide, and co-inventor of a wearable device that tracks and treats chronic insomnia.Scott sees the rise in the use of sleep trackers as generally good news. “They’ve certainly improved awareness around the importance of sleep and around healthy sleep patterns so overall, I’d say they’ve probably had a positive effect.” But there’s a downside. “If you try harder to exercise, you’ll become fitter, but we have the opposite problem with sleep actually; that the harder you try, the harder it is to actually obtain sleep,” Scott says. “We can be creating some problems over people becoming too obsessive about trying to optimise it.” There’s even a term for it:orthosomnia, which describes an unhealthy preoccupation with sleep-tracking data.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThe most accurate picture of sleep health is derived from what’s called polysomnography, which requires a person to spend the night in a sleep laboratory with their head and body covered with electrodes that monitor and measure brain wave activity, eye movement, breathing, heart rate, muscle movement and blood oxygen levels. That provides a wealth of information such as time spent in different stages of sleep, how many times someone wakes up and how long it takes them to fall asleep, says Prof Christopher Gordon, professor of sleep health at Macquarie University in Sydney.“Wearables – and that’s lumping a lot of different devices in one word – but generally they’re not that accurate at being able to tell how long you took to fall asleep and how long you’re awake and asleep overnight, and that’s because it’s not measuring brainwave activity,” he says. That brainwave activity is used to determine time spent in different stages of sleep: stage one, two and three of non-REM sleep and REM sleep.View image in fullscreenSleep-monitoring apps and devices are a boom industry, doing for sleep what devices and apps such as Fitbits and Strava have done for physical activity.Photograph: PonyWang/Getty ImagesWhat wearables can detect and measure – in varying combinations and with varying degrees of accuracy – is heart rate, temperature, movement and blood oxygen levels, which are then fed into algorithms that determine whether the picture painted by that data is of someone sleeping soundly or restlessly awake. “It could be a device that’s specifically measuring movement only, and it’s looking at algorithms that say if your arms are moving a lot you’re awake, if it’s not moving a lot it’s sleep,” Gordon says. But “that has very little agreement with what happens in your brain in terms of the qualitative aspect of sleep”.The other challenge is that there isn’t a clear understanding of exactly what good sleep looks like, says Associate Prof Jen Walsh, director of the Centre for Sleep Science at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “It’s an area that’s debated within our profession,” she says. There’s sleep quantity – simply the amount of time spent asleep – and sleep quality, which is more complex and takes into account time spent in different stages of sleep, whether sleep is broken, how often and for how long. “Sleep quantity is quite easy to define and calculate, whereas sleep quality is somewhat harder,” she says. Current guidelines suggest adults should aim for between seven and nine hours of sleep a night but there isn’t such clear advice on what type of sleep – how much of each stage – is optimum.Sleep quality is also highly subjective and sometimes doesn’t match what even the most accurate lab-based monitoring says, according to Dr Maya Schenker, a postdoctoral researcher on trauma and sleep at the University of Melbourne. “If we feel like we slept very badly, it doesn’t matter what the watch is telling me,” she says. Even in people with chronic insomnia, sleep often looks a lot better on the polysomnography than what they subjectively report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

And Annie has noticed that if she has a glass of wine at any time in the evening, her heart rate during sleep is about 10% higher.This is where most experts see the usefulness of sleep trackers in a consumer setting: helping people understand how their lifestyle habits and behaviour affect their sleep, and making changes to improve it.“A lot of people are interested in changing their sleep habits, but it’s hard to find a place to start,” says Dr Vanessa Hill, a sleep scientist at the Appleton Institute at CQ University in Adelaide, who also consults for Samsung Health. Data alone isn’t generally enough to change behaviour, but “if your watch can send you a notification where it’s like, ‘hey, yesterday, you went on a walk at this time and it improved your sleep’, or ‘yesterday you stopped drinking caffeine around this time’ or whatever, and that helps you fall asleep faster”, that can motivate people to change, she says, “I think that’s the best potential that these kinds of trackers can have.”Stop counting sheep – and 13 more no-nonsense tips for getting back to sleepRead moreHill uses a smartwatch and a ring to monitor her sleep, and says she does check her sleep scores – particularly her heart rate during sleep, which she saysmay predict oncoming illness– as soon as she wakes up. “I look at what they’ve been overnight, because if I am getting sick or getting a cold or something like that, my heart rate variability will actually tell me before I feel any symptoms myself,” she says. “If, for whatever reason, I have really bad heart rate variability one night, I’m just like, I need to take it easy today, something’s up with my body.”Many experts stress that consumer sleep trackers are not diagnostic tools and have some important limits. “If you train an algorithm on a set population that is healthy, you’re not going to necessarily pick up the same signal out of a population with, say, peripheral vascular disease with reduced blood flow into the fingers,” says Dr Donald Lee, a respiratory at sleep physician at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research in Sydney. Sleep habits also change over the lifespan, which may not be reflected by the algorithms used.However sleep trackers do provide an opportunity to encourage healthier sleep habits, Lee says. “If we can engage people to … go to bed with a purpose, to turn out the light and go to sleep and improve their sleep habits by engaging in the conversation, it’s a good thing for the health trackers to be doing.”Explore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And yet here I was, about to embark on an epic journey, unsupported, towing a trailer with two wooden surfboards, a tent and wetsuits strapped to it. My wife, Lizzy, 62, and I had rented out our house and lent our campervan to friends, so there was no turning back.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Lizzy was also towing a trailer with two belly boards and the rest of our camping kit. She, the veteran of many long rides in her 20s – one of which took her across the Andes – was full of quiet confidence. I was excited beyond words to be setting off on a new adventure, but also terrified of what the road might reveal about me. I had no idea whether my 57-year-old body or soul could cope with cycling for days on end, climbing mountains or setting up a tent every night for three months. My first attempt at a mountain pass, in the Pyrenees some years before, hadn’t started well. I threw a hissy fit at the first hairpin, demanding of Lizzy: what’s the point?View image in fullscreenAs our route out of Roscoff took us down a narrow, overgrown track with brambles brushing our legs and panniers, I started to wonder what we had got ourselves into. Would we have to ride on paths like this all the way? What were we thinking?The plan was to cycle from home in Cornwall to Cape St Vincent in Portugal, Europe’s most south-westerly point, surfing as we went. The journey, I reckoned, would be at least 1,900 miles (over 3,000km). I had travelled to surf in Europe many times before, but only in a campervan and, in my late teens and 20s, a series of clapped-out cars.Travelling by bike would give us the kind of access to beaches that is impossible todayMy friends and I went to Europe to surf, drink cheap red wine, smoke Gauloises and live out our Californian Beach Boys fantasies. We were following in the footsteps of those who had made the trip in the 1960s and 1970s, leaving the UK to surf in the sun on world-class waves. In time, the journey became a rite of passage for all surfers: get beaten up in the powerful French shore breaks, find new waves in northern Spain and lose yourself on the wild coasts of Portugal.The prospect of doing it all again, but this time on two wheels, thrilled me. I had become disillusioned with travelling by van and needed time out. I loved the idea of chasing waves without the faff and environmental impact of van life and wondered if living with less would make me happier. Would stripping back to basics – a surfboard, a wetsuit, a tent, a meths cooker and a change of clothes – make for a bigger, more meaningful adventure?View image in fullscreenMartin and Lizzy took the ferry to Roscoff, Brittany.Photograph: Eyewave/Getty ImagesTravelling by bike, I argued while planning this trip, would allow us to follow the old roads and forgotten paths our surfing forefathers had travelled and give us the kind of access to beaches that is impossible today.Eventually the bumpy lanes outside Roscoff gave way to smooth, flowing tarmac, following the course of a muddy river, and we cruised along easily, our trailers rumbling happily behind us. Dare I hope it would all be fine?The truth was, at that point, I doubted I was up to the adventure. In 2023 I had severed my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), an injury that left me in a knee brace and on crutches for weeks. In the early days of recovery, I feared I’d never surf again.The NHS consultant told me “most people your age manage perfectly well without an ACL”. I felt the sharp sting of ageism. But I wasn’t ready to be written off just yet. I had the ligament repaired privately and, when the surgeon recommended cycling for rehab, I took him at his word.Riding ebikes made the trip possible. The psychological effect of knowing I had a little in the tank if things got difficult worked wonders, even if we rode in the mode that delivered the least power most of the time.We followedLa Vélodyssée, an 800-mile, mostly off-road cycle route down the west coast of France to Hendaye on the border with Spain, joining the Nantes-Brest canal for the first 190 miles. The riding was mostly flat and we bimbled along happily. I loved the attention we got: I guess there weren’t many middle-aged cyclists pulling surfboards along the towpath.View image in fullscreenSeignosse in the far south-west of France was the location for the first proper surfing on the trip.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyAt about 6pm each day – after about five hours in the saddle – we’d stop at a campsite, cook and collapse on to our blow-up beds. We’d prebooked some sites but mostly took our chances that something would turn up. On the one occasion it didn’t, we checked in to a hotel.

When we finally found some good waves, at Seignosse, a little north of surfing’s spiritual European home, Biarritz, hitting them was all the more satisfying.Spain, and her terrible hills, gave us a shock after the level paths through France’s maritime pine forest. Just after crossing the border we climbedJaizkibel mountainin rain and fog. It was a 5-mile slog from sea level to 450 metres, en route to San Sebastián. I resisted the urge to press the ebike’s power button despite it being a “classic climb” that has been featured in the Tour de France and Spain’s equivalent, La Vuelta.When I reached the top, I was wet, cold and exhausted – but elated. If it hadn’t been so misty, I could have looked back at France behind me and seen how far we had come. We had ridden 870 miles since leaving home and I had loved it. I had surfed some excellent waves too, at Biarritz and Hendaye, as well as Seignosse, and had got my mojo back after months out of the water. I decided it was just like riding a bike: you never forget how to do it. I was definitely ready for the more serious Iberian waves to come.View image in fullscreenMartin celebrates conquering a 600-metre mountain in Galicia.Photograph: Martin Dorey‘Smiles not miles’: a Scottish cycling tour all about enjoyment, not enduranceRead moreAfter Jaizkibel, my legs were tuned up and I was starting to relish this life-affirming trip that would see us follow the coasts of Spain and Portugal for another 1,200 miles over the next two months. We surfed some hallowed spots at Mundaka, Peniche and the World Surfing Reserve at Ericeira; mended multiple punctures; pitched our tent 67 times; climbed another 20,000 metres; and completed two legs of the Camino de Santiago. Arriving in Praza do Obradoiro, the main square in Santiago de Compostela old town, was a highlight. But we still had another 500 miles to go to our final destination of Sagres in the Algarve.I may not be as fit as I was in my 20s – but the thrill of adventure remains the same.Martin Dorey’s book about the adventure, The Way of the Waves, is published by Bloomsbury Sport (£20) on 11 September.

The length of each list, for example, varied widely.While native English speakers in the UK and Spanish speakers inSpainrattled off an average of 16 words, Germans more than tripled this with an average of 53 words ranging fromintelligenzallergiker, a person allergic to intelligence, tohodenkobold, or “testicle goblin”, someone who is being annoying.The results, researchers say, hint at how the overlooked field of social faux pas – whether it be swearing, insults or other off-limit language – can help us better understand the values, boundaries and shifting norms that shape different cultures.“These words can be more offensive, or less, they can be loaded with negativity or with irony,” said Jon Andoni Duñabeitia, a cognitive scientist and professor at Madrid’s Nebrija University. “But taken together, they offer small snapshots of the realities of each culture.”When it came to the differences between Spanish and German speakers, Andoni Duñabeitia had two theories. German, with its seemingly endless capacity to build new compound words, could simply offer more options, he said. “But it could also be that some people [speaking other languages] just don’t have these words readily available, or it’s harder for them when asked to produce them in a very neutral environment,” he said.The study, which looked at taboo words in 13 languages from Serbian to Cantonese and Dutch, and across 17 countries, revealed other differences. The word “shit”, or its translated equivalent, for example, ranked among the most frequently used in several languages, including English, Finnish and Italian, but was not in the top rankings in French, Dutch, Spanish or German.In contrast, words that sought to disparage women, such as “bitch,” turned up across cultures. “I think it comes down to the terribly sexist traditions of many countries,” said Andoni Duñabeitia, who was among the four dozen researchers involvedwith the 2024 study. “The vocabulary reflects the reality of societies where women have been mistreated, removed from everyday tasks and relegated to the background.”Sexual terms also came up repeatedly, hinting at a near-universal discomfort with topics perceived to be private or indecent.Other words, such as “feminazi”, revealed how words evolve alongside social and political change. In the current era of social media platforms, and the anonymity they often offer, researchers also traced a proliferation and hardening of the language used, laying bare how taboo words can be weaponised to target people based on race, religion, gender or sexuality.When Simone Sulpizio, a psychology professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca and lead author of the 2024 study, launched into the research, he expected to hear a cacophony of expletives related to the church. “But we were surprised because, while blasphemy was present in all of the languages, it was only among the most frequent inItaly,” said Sulpizio.The Italians who were part of the study offered up more than 24 taboo words related to the church, including 17 different versions of what researchers translated as “fucking God”.Sulpizio speculated it might be because of Italy’s proximity and longstanding relationship with the Vatican, as well as the enduring strength of Catholic tradition in the country. “So that’s an example of the impactof cultural or societal differences,” he said.Another difference was in the way people used insults. “Everybody has slurs, but depending on the culture of the country, the target of the slur changes,” said Sulpizio.The research suggested a handful of constants that hold across most cultures: men are more likely to use taboo words than women, as are extroverts. On average, peopleswear oncefor every two minutes of speech. This rate, however, can vary widely depending on the setting, the topic and the relationship between those in the conversation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They hold extraordinary power, say researchers, who say they can be wielded to inflict harm or rattle power structures or, in turn, relieve stress and elicit humour.Swearing could even confer physical benefits, Sulpizio said, citinga study that askedpeople to say a normal word or a taboo word while holding their hand in ice.“When they produced the taboo word, they were able to keep their hand longer in the ice,” he said. “So these words can be used as kind of an emotional regulation tool.”Do you speak Sylheti? Tamajaght? Klingon? Inside the Festival for Endangered LanguagesRead moreTheir wide range of uses could help to explain the persistence of these words, even as generations of parents, teachers and authority figures have actively discouraged their use and traces of them are wiped from formal written texts.“Usually the most frequently used words of a language are the most familiar words. But with taboo words, this relationship is the opposite,” Sulpizio said. “So the more familiar the taboo words are, or the more known they are, the less frequently they tend to be written in newspapers or blogs or anything like that.”The team behind a 2022 study found the use of taboo words can deeply affect the way we think, act and relate to one another. “Swearing was long dismissed as a topic of serious research because it was assumed to be simply a sign of aggression, weak language proficiency or even low intelligence,” researchers notedrecently in the Conversation. “We now have quite a lot of evidence that challenges this view, prompting us to reconsider the nature – and power – of swearing.”Explore more on these topicsLanguageEuropePsychologyFranceGermanySpainItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meats like steak are a no-go for our household.”Harris, 38, lives and works as a teacher’s assistant in Stella, North Carolina, and is one of almost 40 people who spoke to the Guardian about how they’ve been coping with the price of goods in the six months sinceDonald Trumpannounced his sweeping tariffs.On Thursday,a study from S&P Globalrevealed that companies were expected to pay at least $1.2tn more in 2025 expenses than was previously anticipated. But the burden, according to the researchers, is now shifting to US consumers. They calculated that two-thirds of the “expense shock”, more than $900bn, will be absorbed by Americans. Last month, the Yale Budget Labestimatedtariffs would cost households almost $2,400 more a year.Harris says the tariffs’ impact on her daily life contradicts promises from the Trump administration to “cut prices and make living affordable for everyone”. She said: “You see prices soaring. It has become very clear that this administration did not and does not care about the everyday lives of Americans.”Several Americans told the Guardian their weekly budgets had been drastically altered with the introduction of Trump’s tariffs.“Prices are way too high. I mostly shop at Costco and buy as little as possible anywhere else,” said Jean Meadows, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Huntsville, Alabama. “I can’t imagine that stores haven’t noticed the change. I think people are really afraid of what is coming.”That sense of apprehension is reflected in a recent poll, exclusively conducted for the Guardian, where respondents identified the tariffs asthe second biggest threatto the economy.“The bread I buy has doubled in price within a year. We live on a fixed income that doesn’t keep up with inflation,” said Myron Peeler, who is also retired and is the sole caregiver for his wife, who suffers from debilitating arthritis. The only saving grace, he said, is that his house and car are paid off.Trump shows few signs of backing away from his tariff policy – a move the White House maintains will reinvigorate American manufacturing and increased revenue from trade partners.Most recently, the president reignited a trade war with China by threatening a 100% tariff on Beijing as soon as November. This came after China moved to restrict exports of rare earth minerals needed for several everyday items from electric vehicle batteries to hospital equipment, a decision that Trump branded as “very hostile”. In an interview with Fox News, the president has admitted that the proposed tariff hike was “not sustainable”, but said he was left with little choice: “They forced me to do that”.Currently, the average US tariffs on Chinese exports hovers around 58%, according to the Peterson Institute for Economics. It’s a levy that is already taking a toll on Americans such as Michele, from north-eastern Pennsylvania.“We need to buy new tires for a car, and can’t, because affordable tires are no longer in stock and we can’t afford $250 a tire,” she said.Several people echoed Michele’s feelings about availability, describing the situation as “empty shelves, higher prices”. Natalie, who lives in New Hampshire, said she hasn’t seen certain pantry staples “for months”. She said: “The store shelves have become more and more bare … instead of multiple choices there may only be one or two, and name brands are being replaced by store brands.”At 55, Natalie is semi-retired but is due to start part-time work at a supermarket, and she has seen a price rise in nearly everything she buys regularly. “Any brand of cat food has increased anywhere from 25% to double the price. One wet food my cats like went from $1.79 to $2.49 per can,” she said.The new normal many Americans are bracing for, or already feeling, is not just the cost of groceries, for those such as Minnie, a food writer in Portland, Oregon, it’s a change in lifestyle.“I don’t shop for non-essentials. No fall shopping trips for a new sweater or jeans. And we’ll make all our Christmas presents this year,” said Minnie, 55. “We used to dine out once a week. Now we never eat out. Even fast-casual is insanely pricey. Everything is twice what it used to cost and we’re very afraid of what’s next, financially speaking.”While the US inflation ratehovers around 2.9%– a substantial drop from the spikes of the Covid era – the tariffs haven’t helped ease the impact on Americans’ wallets. Richard Ulmer, 81, who has lived in Florida for 35 years, said this year has been “the worst from a financial standpoint”, adding that “everything” from his groceries to the electric bill has become more expensive.For Cassie, a 25-year-old consultant based in Siler City, North Carolina, costs have shot up quickly compared to the “gradual price increases” during the first two years of the pandemic. Cassie has a strict $65 per week budget for groceries, but since Trump first announced his tariffs, she’s been priced out of her normal routine, which included doing most of her weekly shopping at Walmart.“Now I must visit at least four different stores in the area and other towns, often driving longer distances to find the best prices,” she said. “During the summer months and the Mexico/Latin America tariff announcement, Walmart and other stores in the area ran out of bananas for around two weeks. No one could get bananas in my area.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Pete Hegseth said “three terrorists were killed” in the operation, which was “conducted in international waters”.“These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the western hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are – they will be hunted, and killed.”In a post on his Truth Social platform just hours earlier, Trump had blamed Petro for encouraging the mass production of illegal drugs, saying the leftwing leader “does nothing to stop it, despite large-scale payments and subsidies from the US”.“Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately,” Trump wrote, “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely”.US military to move survivors of strike on alleged drug boat in Caribbean to nearby countriesRead moreThe remarks come after Petro said the US committed “murder” following a strike on an alleged drug boat in Colombian territorial waters in September, adding “we await explanations from the US government.”The victim of the strike was identified by Petro as Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He was allegedly killed when US forces fired at his boat on 15 September.“Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing,” Petro wrote. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.”The threat to cut off aid marks the latest point of tension between the two nations, despite historically Colombia being one of the US’s closest allies in Latin America.Late on Sunday the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the president, said Trump would soon announce “major tariffs” on the country. Colombia currently pays 10% tariffs on most imports to the US, the baseline level Trump has imposed on many countries.Trump has continued to justify the necessity for the ongoing boat attacks, despite his administration offering little information about the vessels or the identities of those on board.On Thursday, the US moved to send two survivors of the most recent strike – the sixth since early September – overseas instead of seeking long-term military detention for them.“The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin,Ecuadorand Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump said.The strike targeted a semi-submersible vessel which the president said “was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics.” Two crew members were killed and experts said the decision to repatriate the survivors meant the US military would avoid complex legal questions surrounding the detention of suspected drug traffickers. This was the first recorded instance of there being survivors, an official toldNBC.“It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,” Trump posted in the aftermath of the attack.So far, at least 29 people have been killed in strikes the administration upholds are targeting drug traffickers, raising alarm among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether they adhere to the laws ofwar.Currently, the US is building up a prominent militarypresencein the Caribbean and bordering coastlines, one that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 jets, and the authorization of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.Colombia is the recipient of the largest amount of US aid to any country in Latin America and former president Joe Biden designated the nation as a major non-Nato ally in2022. While Congress allocated $377.5m for foreign assistance for the country in 2024 with similar projections for 2025, there were restrictions put in place out of concern for Petro’s policies and his efforts to counteract the drug trade.In September, the Trump administrationassertedthat Colombia was failing to cooperate in the drug war, adding them to a list of other nations for the first time in almost 30 years.More recently, they said they wouldrevokePetro’s visa while he was in New York for the UN general assembly after his “reckless” actions at a pro-Palestine protest. Petro had urged US soldiers to “disobey Trump’s order”, and “not point their rifles at humanity”.In reaction to Trump’s most recent accusations and funding cuts, Petro responded in a post on X saying: “I respect the history, culture, and people of the USA. They are not my enemies, nor do I feel them as such.”He added at the end: “The problem is with Trump, not with the USA.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpColombiaUS militaryAmericasUS politicsCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

A candid video shows their fatal confrontation with Chocobar after they served eviction orders to him and hundreds of other Chuschagasta residents of a patch of ancestral land.The jury, which included the film producer Elizabeth Karlsen, praised Martel’s “deep empathy and extraordinary journalistic and cinematic rigour”.It added: “In foregrounding present-day voices and neglected histories, Martel emerges with a portrait of – and for – an Indigenous community, and grants them a measure of the justice the courts have long denied them. Within a remarkably strong competition, our jury is proud to honour this singular achievement.”Martel has been referred to as “arguably the most critically acclaimed auteur in Spanish-language art cinema outside Latin America”. She has made a series of feature films, including La Ciénaga, the Holy Girl, The Headless Woman and Zama.In 2018,the director spoke to the Guardianabout her fascination and shock at the arrogance and entitlement of Argentina’s middle class – which she said was a direct result of Europeans arriving in the country. “Even very educated people, they can’t make the link. It’s almost like looking at a wooden boat and not realising that it was made from trees. We see the wooden boat, but not the trees,” she said.Other winners at this year’s BFI London film festival included Vincho Nchogu’s One Woman One Bra, a humorous account of one woman’s fight to keep her ancestral land, which won the Sutherland award for first feature. The Sutherland jury said the film was “at once funny, life-affirming, and deeply moving; its emotional journey stayed with us and will continue to do so.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His ties to coca long predate his political career. He rose to prominence as a union leader for coca farmersin the Chaparein central Bolivia.Peralta said the Chapare “is practically a small republic, a black hole where the state doesn’t reach … and it’s precisely whereEvo Moralesrules like a monarch”.It is there that, since last year, the former presidenthas been entrenched, protected byhundreds of coca growers, to avoid enforcement of an arrest warrant accusing him of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl. The region recentlywent monthswithout any police or army presence after pro-Morales demonstrators attacked a military barracks.12:45Tracking down Evo Morales, Bolivia’s fugitive ex-president, in his jungle hideout – videoThe Chapare is one of two regions in Bolivia in which coca cultivation, which the government regulates, is concentrated. The other is the Yungas, near La Paz. The consumption of coca leaves is legal in Bolivia and widely practised for religious and cultural reasons as a digestive aid, stimulant and remedy for the effects of high altitude.Quirogahas saidthat “the coca from the Yungas has been, is and always will be legal, ancient and traditional”, but the coca from the Chapare has “a single purpose: drug trafficking”. Paz Pereira, though less outspoken than his rival, has said in the past that coca from the Yungas was “good”, while that from the Chapare was “bad”.Reyes Rodas agreed that part of the Chapare’s coca ended up as cocaine, but said it was a mistake to criminalise all cultivation there.Aquilardo Caricari, the secretary general of theCSCIOB, one of the country’s largest unions of Indigenous peoples and coca growers, said most of the Chapare’s coca production wasnot sold through the government-regulated marketbut that this was a logistical issue – the market is 112 miles away – and that most of it was for personal use. When any diversion to trafficking was identified, he said, the producer was reported to the authorities.The CSCIOB is among the organisations protecting Morales. As both presidential candidates have said they wouldenforce thearrest warrantif elected, Caricari said the vigil had been reinforced.“We know that the political target of the North American empire is Evo Morales, and what they want at all costs is to get rid of this leadership – something we will not allow,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasEvo MoralesDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

I have not actually at this point in time resigned from the Nationals.”Several Nationals MPs including theleader, David Littleproud, are holding out hope that Joyce could be convinced to remain with the party.But the 58-year-old has all but shut the door on that prospect. Joyce on Monday pointed to an irreparable breakdown in his relationship with Littleproud, citing the leader’s decision to effectively bar him from campaigning outside his electorate during the May election and then dumping him from the frontbench to promote “generational change”.“Obviously the relationship with David was less than spectacular. I mean, I think if we say anything else, it’s not being truthful,” Joyce said in an interview with ABC radio on Monday.“I wish people all the best. I just, I’m not going to leave sort of bitter and twisted and angry. I just, you know, honestly, I wish people all the very best. That’s what I actually do. Like most things, you feel a lot better when you’re not angry. So I’m not angry now because I’ve said I’m getting out.”Nationals MP Michael McCormack – who also once led the party – said he hoped Joyce did not defect.“Barnaby’s been a force of nature for regional Australia and he’s done a lot of good things,” McCormack told the ABC.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsBarnaby JoycePauline HansonOne NationNational partynewsShareReuse this content"

This affected more than 7,500 customers, leaving many out of pocket for procedures they were entitled to claim.Bupaadmitted to the misconduct in June 2025and reached an agreement with theAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission(ACCC) to pay a $35m fine. The $14.1m bonuses is the equivalent of 40% of the proposed fine.The federal court has yet to decide whether the fine is appropriate.Bupa concedes it misled thousands of members to wrongly believe they did not have insurance for certain medical treatments during the five-year period. According to the ACCC, some customers upgraded their insurance when they did not need to.When the proposed $35m fine was first announced, Bupa’s chief executive, Nick Stone, said “we are deeply sorry for failing to get things right for our customers and are saddened by the impact this has had on them and their families. This should never have happened”.Australians remain deeply sceptical about the value of private healthcare – it’s time for radical reform | Anthony ScottRead moreThe ACCC said at the time that some Bupa customers “delayed, cancelled or went without treatment for which they were, at least partially, covered under their health insurance policies”.Adocument outlining Bupa’s undertaking to the ACCCshows that the insurer voluntarily implemented a “remediation program” to address harm caused in 2021, three years before the bonuses were paid. The document also shows Bupa had cooperated with the ACCC’s investigation for four years before it was eventually taken to court.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAs at 30 June, the insurer had so far paid $14.3m in compensation to people affected by 4,100 wrongly assessed claims.Corporate disclosures reveal Bupa’s health insurance executives had, by that time, already been awarded millions of dollars for the company’s “strong improvements in both business outcomes and customer experience”.Bupa’s bonuses are just one example of bonuses being awarded to top staff, despite community outrage and regulatory sanctions over their company’s actions.Qantas is facing pressure to curtail generous bonuses afterthe federal court found it illegally sacked 1,800 workers. So too is childcare giant G8 Education,whose chief executive secured a short-term bonus of $534,426 last year, despite multiple safety breaches and the employment of a man subsequently charged with multiple child sexual offences.Corporate law expert Helen Bird, a senior lecturer at Swinburne university, said bonuses were key to determining the culture of an organisation and what behaviours are considered acceptable.“If you want to know how a company is really governed, then you’ve got to understand how it rewards its executives,” Bird said.Multimillion-dollar bonuses ‘send the wrong message’During the 2023-24 financial year, one senior Bupa employee was awarded an annual bonus of $2.5m, with payment of $2m deferred until a later year. The bonus was more than double the position’s $1.1m salary.Another 19 managers shared in bonuses totalling $11.6m, with $5.5m of that deferred to later years.Childcare executives paid six-figure bonuses despite outrage over alleged abuse and safety failuresRead moreThe bonuses have been condemned by the ConsumerHealthForum of Australia’s chief executive, Dr Elizabeth Deveny, who said “it’s pretty hard to believe these executive bonuses are in line with community expectations”.“When a company has breached consumer trust, multimillion-dollar executive bonuses send the wrong message,” Deveny said. “It reinforces the perception that profits come before people.“I imagine there are a lot of people who had their claims incorrectly denied who are scratching their heads asking themselves why these bonuses were deserved.”A Bupa spokesperson repeated the insurer’s apology and said the breaches were “not the result of any one individual’s actions or decisions, rather they were caused by cumulative failures in our systems, processes and in the training of our people”.“A significant part of total executive remuneration is based on criteria that is strictly linked to how the business performs,” the spokesperson said.Bupa also indicated bonuses were cut in response to the ACCC’s action. It is not known whether this included clawback provisions for the deferred bonus payments.Many of the employees subject to the ACCC proceedings no longer work at Bupa.“In line with our approach to executive remuneration and accountability framework, we’ve taken appropriate action in response to these issues,” the spokesperson said.“This includes disciplinary steps and/or financial penalties where appropriate.”Until 2024, companies like Bupa were not required to disclose executive bonuses. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority introduced a mandatory disclosure regime to “shine additional light on how executives are incentivised and on the consequences for poorly managed risk”.The Australian Medical Association’s president, Dr Danielle McMullen, did not criticised Bupa directly but said she remained concerned about executive pay at the expense of patient outcomes.Explore more on these topicsExecutive payExecutive pay and bonusesHealthPrivate health insurancenewsShareReuse this content"

Some were left in the forest for six weeks after the first deaths, contrary to the government’s public statement that all were taken into care once the first deaths were recorded.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailPostmortems, known as necropsies, performed on seven of the koalas showed they were malnourished and emaciated, but most of the reports obtained by Guardian Australia did not conclude a cause of death.The koalas were moved – or translocated – as part of a project aiming to reintroduce the species to an area where the species was “locally extinct”.The documents, some released to Guardian Australia under freedom-of-information laws and some obtained by the NSW Greens after a parliamentary order, show the panel of external scientists and department staff that advises the Minns government on scientific licensing of koala translocations recommended the environment department conduct captive feedingtrials with the koalas before releasing them near Bega.Mathew Crowther, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Sydney and member of the panel, said independent experts on the panel thought the translocation plan was “particularly risky” because the koalas were being moved a long distance and the department had not done enough work to establish why they were not already living in the South East Forest.He said the department had assessed which tree species were in the south-east, but panel members were concerned there had been no examination of nutrient and toxin levels in the leaves.View image in fullscreenThe NSW Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson.Photograph: Steven Markham/AAP“I suspect that either the nitrogen in the leaves wasn’t high enough and/or the toxins were too high,” Crowther said. “Koalas, they have really tight diets … if the nitrogen isn’t high enough and the toxins are high, the koala basically can’t survive. It can’t get enough nutritional content.”More than half of koalas relocated to NSW forest died in failed government attempt at reintroductionRead moreThe documents show department officials rejected the panel’s suggestion of a captive feeding trial on the grounds there were “significant risks in containing koalas in enclosures, including adverse health outcomes associated with additional stress, potential for injury, decline in body condition and climbing fitness”.The NSW Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the documents suggested the department was so determined to progress with the translocation it led to “a reckless indifference to the welfare and fate of the individual animals”. She said she had referred the deaths to the RSPCA for an investigation into possible animal cruelty.“It is clear that independent expert advice was sidelined,” Higginson said. “Licences [to move the koalas] were granted in the face of the identified risk of failure and death, animals were left to die after the first koalas were found starved to death and then what took place can only be described as a coordinated cover-up of the truth.”The documents show discrepancies between what the government told Guardian Australia when it first reported on the issue in July and what was being discussed internally.The environment department initially said three koalas died over two days in April and that necropsies on two of the animals suggested they likely died of septicaemia, a bloodstream infection.The department said the remaining 10 animals were then taken into care but four more died. The six remaining healthy koalas were returned to their original habitat in the Upper Nepean State Conservation Area, west of Wollongong.At the time, a department spokesperson said the team working on the project was investigating a potential link between “septicaemia in koalas and adverse weather conditions, as the mortalities occurred four to five days after a significant rainfall event”.But according to two department reports released in the cache of documents, the first sign of trouble in the South East Forest was when a female koala was found on the ground suffering dehydration and with its ear tag stuck in its collar on 2 April. It was treated and returned to its original habitat near Wollongong.Over the following two days, two koalas were found dead in the South East Forest. A third had to be euthanised. Department staff then caught the remaining nine koalas for health checks. Six had lost weight and muscle mass and were taken into care, but three females were deemed healthy and re-released in the south-east and monitored.Two of the group of six koalas in care died. Of the three that remained translocated, one was observed “unusually low in a tree” in early May, moved into care and found dead in its enclosure nine days later. Another was found on the ground close to death in late May and died while being taken to a vet. The third was recaptured five days later.That koala and the four surviving koalas in care were ultimately returned to their home in the Upper Nepean. But the first koala female that had been removed from the south-east on 2 April was found dead and decomposed during a welfare check, increasing the death toll to eight.The necropsy reports for seven of the dead koalas showed signs of pneumonia or sepsis in a couple of animals, but that all were suffering “emaciation”, “undernutrition” or poor body condition.Higginson said she was particularly concerned by a necropsy report that showed one of the translocated female koalas was carrying a joey. The joey was found dead in the female’s pouch during a health check after the first koala deaths in April. The adult was re-released in the South East Forest, but was one of the animals that later died.The documents show emails between department officials reported that the expert panel advising on whether the translocation should go ahead could not reach a consensus but that the proposal “largely was not supported”.The panel made recommendations to address its concerns, including proposing a captive feeding trial before releasing the koalas in the south-east, but these had “largely not been accepted” by the department.Instead, the email chain showed the department’s scientific licensing unit approved the translocation because it was a priority to meet a target of having eight koala translocation projects as part of a state conservation strategy for the species. Officials said “uncertainty around survival is part of the project” and the translocation team had given careful consideration to the habitat and built “checks and balances” into the project.An environment department spokesperson said the translocation project attempted to re-establish a once healthy koala population in the south-east and the team working on the project considered advice from “a range of different experts”.“In some instances, there was conflicting advice amongst the panel, veterinarians and other experts,” the spokesperson said. “A robust review is under way to examine all of the circumstances, including the planning, advice, implementation and post-release monitoring and response.”They said the review was expected to be finished by December.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In contrast to the moderate Erhürman, the hard-right nationalist had been openly backed by Ankara.News of the result was met with scenes of euphoria in the Turkish-occupied north. Analysts described the electoral win as a potential gamechanger on an island that has been ethnically split for more than 50 years between Greeks in the internationally recognised south and Turks in the north.“His win offers hope for peace on Cyprus,” the former MEP Niyazi Kızılyürek said on Sunday. “Supporters say they expect real change in everyday life, starting with confidence-building measures, and everyone expects that he will want to resume negotiations based on UN resolutions very soon.”View image in fullscreenErhürman’s supporters celebrate his resounding win.Photograph: Yiannis Kourtoglou/ReutersThe outcome, he told the Guardian, would be “a test” for Greek Cypriots. “Its easy when the opposite side doesn’t want to talk, which was the case with Tatar. Now they will be forced to respond to a charismatic Turkish Cypriot leader who wants to sit down and negotiate.”UN-brokered negotiations to reunite Cyprus have been on pause sincethey spectacularly broke downin the Swiss mountain town of Crans-Montana eight years ago – the longest hiatus in the peace process ever.Polls had indicated a neck-and-neck race between the election’s two main contenders.The scale of Erhürman’s victory showed that the decidedly secular Turkish Cypriots were tired of isolationist policies that had seen the territory become increasingly aligned with the Islamist leadership of the ruling AKP party in Ankara, as well as wanting a shift towards Europe. The community has long complained of its identity being eroded under the influence of Turkey, the only country to acknowledge the breakaway republic.“Supporters of Erhürman see themselves as an autonomous ethno-political community, not as Turks of Cyprus, and they want to keep it that way,” said Kızılyürek, adding that the children of Turkish settlers born in the north had been especially appalled by what they perceived as the “anti-democratic turn” of Turkey in recent years.“They voted for Erhürman in a big way because they want their future to be in the European Union,” he said.View image in fullscreenErsin Tatar speaks to the media after casting his ballot.Photograph: Birol Bebek/AFP/Getty ImagesCyprus has been divided since 1974 when a coup aimed at union with Greece – engineered by the military junta then in power in Athens – prompted Turkey to invade and seize the island’s northern third.

Not once did he sit down at the negotiating table, and look where that got us. We need hope and only Mr Erhürman can offer that.”Explore more on these topicsCyprusEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It features golden eagles and is covered in 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds. The French culture ministry said eight items of jewellery were stolen, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gave to his wife, Marie Louise.1:06‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in rapid heist, says French minister – videoOther jewels stolen included a sapphire necklace and sapphire earrings worn by Napoleon’s stepdaughter Hortense, who became the queen of Holland, and which was also worn by the 19th-century queen Marie Amélie.The French interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, visited the scene and toldFranceInter radio that “priceless” jewels “of unmeasurable heritage value” were stolen after what was clearly a well-organised raid.The thieves struck at 9.30am local time on Sunday and Nuñez said it took them seven minutes to make off with the jewels. He said: “They stole jewels which have a real heritage value, an inestimable heritage value.”View image in fullscreenPolice officers examine a basket lift beside the Louvre on Sunday.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APThe thieves approached the building from the outside, at an area where building work was taking place. A truck and a basket lift were used to access the museum. They used an angle grinder and power tools to break windows and enter. Nuñez said it was the work of “an experienced team who had clearly scouted the location”.He said three or four suspects had fled – their route was known and police were investigating whether it was a gang known to them for other crimes. Investigators were studying footage from security cameras.Nuñez would not confirm what jewels were taken but said the thieves targeted two glass cases. The gilded Apollon gallery of the Louvre, the ornate decoration of which was commissioned by the Sun King, Louis XIV, has a collection of historic crowns, diadems and sovereign jewellery. It is one of the museum’s most spectacular rooms. Pieces usually on display there include three historic diamonds, the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia.TheParisprosecutor, Laure Beccuau, said the thieves did not target or steal the world-famous Regent diamond kept in the same gallery.A graphic showing which part of the Louvre that the theft took placeNuñez said the museum was evacuated to preserve evidence and to allow investigators and forensics teams to carry out their work. He later wrote on social media: “Targeting the Louvre is targeting our history and our heritage.”The Paris prosecutor has opened an inquiry into the theft and work is under way to estimate the value of the stolen pieces.Police are hunting for four thieves. The culture ministry said alarms went off when the display cases were opened and museum security guards intervened and called police. The thieves fled, leaving their equipment behind them.Le Parisien newspaper reported that the thieves had been dressed in building attire, wearing yellow hi-vis jackets.The French culture minister, Rachida Dati, was first to announce the incident. “A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre museum,” she wrote on social media. She used the French wordbraquage,which can mean robbery or hold-up. She added: “No injuries reported. I’m on site with museum staff and police.”Dati confirmed that one stolen piece of jewellery was recovered outside the museum where the thieves had fled.View image in fullscreenRoyal jewellery on display in the Apollon gallery in 2020.Photograph: Stéphane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty ImagesAt least one person had entered the museum, a member of her team told Agence France-Presse, without adding anything about any possible theft.The Louvre said it was closing for the day “for exceptional reasons”, without providing further details on what had been stolen.Politicians were quick to react. Ariel Weil, the Socialist mayor of Paris’s central area, said he was “shocked” and that it seemed like a storyline from a film. He told Le Parisien: “It’s hard to imagine that it was seemingly so easy to burgle the Louvre.”Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, said: “The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture. This robbery, that has allowed thieves to take the jewels of the French crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on X: “The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our History. We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.”One of the largest arts centres on the planet, the Louvre attracts more than 8 million visitors a year. Its works range from classical sculpture to the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci’s 16th-century masterpiece and the world’s most famous portrait.View image in fullscreenInvestigators near a possible point of entry for the thieves at the museum.Photograph: Poitout Florian/ABACA/ShutterstockIn January, Macron announced a bigrenovation of the museumafter its director said that visiting the overcrowded building had become a“physical ordeal”.In a note to the cultural ministry leaked to the media in January, the Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, had said the space below the museum’s glass pyramid entrance was not properly insulated from the cold or heat, tended to amplify noise, and wasuncomfortable for the public and the staff.Des Cars also raised the alarm over water leaks, failing infrastructure and temperature swings that endanger the conservation of works of art. Visitors faced overcrowding and substandard facilities, she said.The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous was in 1911, when theMona Lisa vanished from its frame.An Italian painter and decorator, Vincenzo Peruggia, had hidden all night in a museum cupboard before taking the picture from its frame and leaving the building, apparently unseen. It was 24 hours before anyone noticed the painting was missing.The poet Guillaume Apollinaire and the painter Pablo Picasso were both questioned by police. The painting was recovered three years later in Florence and returned to Paris.The most recent theft in the Louvre dates to 1998, when a painting by the 19th-century French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was removed from the wall. It has never been found, but its disappearance led to a review of security at the museum.Several museums across France have beentargeted by thievesin recent months. Last month, criminals used an angle grinder to break into Paris’s Natural History Museum, stealing gold samples with a street value of €600,000 but priceless to scientists and researchers.Last November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay Museum in Paris targeting a popular exhibition, Pocket Luxury, which featured small precious objects from the 18th century. Seven valuable tobacco boxes were stolen, some of which had been on loan from the Louvre and the UK’s royal collection.When Macron pledged this year that the Louvre would be “redesigned, restored and enlarged”, he said he hoped the annual number of visitors would rise to 12 million.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I’ll keep my head held high, including at the prison gates,” Sarkozy toldLa Tribune de Dimanche. He has been ordered to present himself at the gates ofLa Santéprison in the south of Paris early on Tuesday morning. He said he had asked for “no privileges” in his treatment behind bars.Sarkozy, 70, toldLe Figarothat he had packed family photos and three books, as permitted for the first week. “I’m bringingThe Count of Monte Cristoand two volumes of the biography of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils,” he said.He is expected to be held in solitary confinement for his own security, in an individual cell of about 9 metres squared. He will have no mobile phone, but will have a small television. A security-controlled phoneline will allow him contact with his lawyers and family. He is expected to have the right to two visits a week from family. He told Le Figaro that he’d been advised to take earplugs. “At night you hear lots of noise, shouting, screaming,” he said.‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen from Louvre in raid by ‘experienced’ thievesRead moreSarkozy will be able to leave his cell for one hour a day, to walk in an interior courtyard, with the opening to the sky protected by wire mesh. Three prison guards will accompany him when he leaves his cell.“My life is a novel and this ordeal is now part of it,” Sarkozy told Le Figaro. He said: “They wanted to make me disappear but this will make me be reborn.”La Santé prison has held some of Frances’s most famous prisoners in its 158-year history, including the terrorist Carlos the Jackal and the war criminal Maurice Papon.Sarkozy’s son, Louis, who is preparing to run for mayor in Menton on the French Riviera next spring, urged supporters to stand near Sarkozy’s home in the 16tharrondissement ofParisto cheer him off as he is driven to prison on Tuesday.Sarkozy wasfound guilty last monthof criminal conspiracy over a scheme to seek funding from the regime of Gaddafi for his victorious 2007 French presidential election campaign.View image in fullscreenMuammar Gaddafi and Sarkozy meet in Tripoli, Libya, in 2007.Photograph: Sipa Press/REX/ShutterstockThe lead judge, Nathalie Gavarino, justified the five-year prison sentence by saying the facts of the case were of an “exceptional gravity” and “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.During the trial, the public prosecutor had told the court that Sarkozy entered into a “Faustian pact of corruption with one of the most unspeakable dictators of the last 30 years” to gain election funding from Gaddafi.Sarkozy was acquitted of three separate charges of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding.At his trial, Sarkozy denied wrongdoing and said he was not part of a criminal conspiracy to seek election funding from Libya. He has appealed against his conviction. A new trial is expected in about six months. But the nature of Sarkozy’s prison sentence means he must go to jail as his appeal process plays out.The former president’s lawyers are expected toformally ask for his releaseas soon as he arrives at the prison, and a court will have two months to examine the request. The court could order Sarkozy’s release under judicial supervision or home arrest with an ankle tag. It could also decide against letting him out of prison if, for example, it deems it the only way to prevent evidence tampering or witness intimidation.Althoughthe allegations of a secret campaign funding pact with the Libyan regimeformed the biggest corruption trial Sarkozy had faced, he had already been convicted in two separate cases and stripped of France’s highest distinction, the Legion of Honour.Sarkozy had previously become the first former French head of state forced to wear an electronic tag after being convicted in aseparate case of corruption and influence peddlingover illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge. In that case, he was given a one year jail term but was able to serve it with an electronic tag worn around the ankle. He wore the tag for three months before being granted conditional release.The presiding judge in the criminal conspiracy trial receiveddeath threatsfrom unknown people after the verdict last month, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to publicly call out such attacks as “unacceptable”.Explore more on these topicsFranceParisNicolas SarkozyMuammar GaddafiEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Palestinian officials said dozens died in the retaliatory airstrikes.A senior Egyptian official said “round-the-clock” contacts were under way to de-escalate the situation as regional powers scramble to shore up the ceasefire, though hopes rose that a complete collapse could be avoided when both Hamas and the Israeli military issued statements saying they were committed to the agreement.Senior US officials, possibly including the vice president, JD Vance,were expected to arrive in Israelin the coming days for what observers said was a clear effort to hold Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, to the deal signed in Sharm-el-Sheikh earlier this month.Even before Sunday’s violence, tensions had been running high in recent days with a dispute between Hamas and Israel over the return of the remains of 28 deceased hostages held by the militant Islamist group. Israel has said Hamas is delaying the return of some hostages’ remains in violation of the ceasefire deal.Palestinian officials inGazaaccused Israel on Saturday of violating the ceasefire 48 times and killing dozens of Palestinians since the deal brokered by Trump was signed 10 days ago.There was no official confirmation from Israel of the move to suspend all aid, which was widely reported in Israeli media as well as by international news agencies citing security officials. Earlier on Sunday, Israel announced that the crucial Rafah crossing with Egypt would remain shut “until further notice”. Moves to delay the opening of Rafah last week prompted widespread international condemnation.The deal signed last week between Israel and Hamas raised hopes of an improvement in the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza. A surge of aid was one of the key elements of the 20-point deal brokered by Donald Trump.The new Israeli restrictions will mean renewed suffering for many in Gaza, where famine was declared in parts in August. Fuel and medical supplies are also desperately scarce, particularly in the north, where destruction is most severe.The Israeli military said its strikes into Gaza came after Hamas attacked Israeli troops “operating to dismantle terrorist infrastructure” in the southern city of Rafah. Maj Yaniv Kula, 26, and Staff Sgt Itay Yavetz, 21, “fell during combat in the southern Gaza Strip” the military said, the first Israeli fatalities since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.Israeli planes then began targeting what it said were tunnel shafts and military infrastructure in the area and also launched strikes in the northern town of Beit Lahia.In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said he had directed the military to take “strong action” against any ceasefire violations but did not threaten an immediate return to war – as demanded by his far-right allies in the ruling coalition.On Sunday evening an Israeli security official told Channel 12, an Israeli TV network, that Israel “did not want to bring down the ceasefire” and implied that Israel was aware that some Hamas militants were operating without orders from commanders.Later, a military spokesperson said that Israeli forces, “following a series of significant strikes in response to Hamas’s violations”, had “begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”.Among targets hit by Israel on Sunday was a makeshift coffeehouse on the coastal side of al-Zawaida town in central Gaza, where six Palestinians were killed, while two people were killed near the Al-Ahli soccer club in the Nuseirat refugee camp by a second strike, Palestinian officials in Gaza said. Awda hospital, which received the casualties, said the attack in Nuseirat also wounded eight.A third strike hit a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis in the south, killing at least one person, according to Nasser hospital.Gaza’s civil defence agency said the strikes killed at least 33 people on Sunday. There was no independent confirmation of the claim.Izzat al-Risheq, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group remained committed to the ceasefire despite the reported clashes in Rafah with Israel forces. “It is the occupation that continues to violate the ceasefire and provide excuses for its crimes,” he said.Hamas said its communication with its remaining units in Rafah had been cut off for months and “we are not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas”. A delegation from the organisation arrived in Cairo on Sunday to being talks over the second phase of ceasefire negotiations.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians fill containers with fresh water from a public tap in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where two people were killed on Sunday.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ceasefire deal also stipulated that all Israeli hostages, living and dead, would be returned and nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners freed. Last Monday Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but as of Saturday evening had returned the remains of only 12 of the 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza.‘The loss of education is the loss of the future itself’: Gaza’s children and teachers on two years without schoolRead moreHamas says the war’s devastation and Israeli military control of areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned.On Saturday night, Hamas returned two caskets, which were identified by forensic doctors as containing the remains of Ronen Engel, a 54-year-old photographer who was killed on 7 October in a kibbutz in southern Israel and whose remains were taken to Gaza, and Sonthaya Oakkharasr, a Thai national who was killed in the Be’eri kibbutz.Engel was a photojournalist and volunteer ambulance driver for Magen David Adom. His death was confirmed in December 2023. His wife, Karina, and two daughters, Mika and Yuval, were also kidnapped but werereturned during a deal in November 2023.Ronen Engel was a photojournalist and volunteer ambulance driver.Photograph: Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/ReutersOn Saturday night, the US state department said there were “credible reports” that Hamas would violate the ceasefire, saying a “planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement”. If such an attack took place, it said, “measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire”.The US statement was understood to be referring to Hamas’s crackdown on clans that are opposed to its rule, many of which are backed and armed by Israel. Videos circulated last week of Hamas carrying out public executions of clan members.View image in fullscreenA truck carrying humanitarian aid at the crossing into the Gaza Strip at the Rafah border on the Egyptian side on Saturday.Photograph: ReutersAs part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned 15 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, bringing the total it has returned to 135. However, they have been returned with no names, only numbers.Meanwhile,Gaza’s ruinswere being scoured for the dead. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian death toll above 68,000, according to the health ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross. About 1,200 died in the Hamas raid into Israeli in October 2023 that triggered the war, and 251 were abducted.With Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

The father of four had been displaced 11 times during the war inGazaand was struggling to find adequate food for his children amid a worsening hunger crisis.When a ceasefire was announced last week, Baba thought he could finally relax. Though his home was still plagued by chaos, at least he knew his family would not be struck by an Israeli bomb.The fleeting peace, however, was shattered on Sunday morning by a wave ofIsraeli airstrikes across Gaza, after Israel claimed Hamas militants targeted its troops in southern Gaza.“I felt the end of the false sense of safety we were clinging to. We had barely started to move freely between areas again, and now we are back to fear and caution,” said the 48-year-old from Beit Lahiya in north Gaza.Nine days into the ceasefire, Palestinians in Gaza are increasingly worried that the fragile truce could collapse and full-scale war will restart. They have been here before; in Marcha ceasefire ended after Israel resumed bombingand declined to move to a second phase of a ceasefire that would have permanently ended the war.There are parallels with last March.Israeland Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire to facilitate the return of Israeli hostages, but deep disagreements remain over how to implement the second phase of the US-drafted plan to move to a permanent truce.On Sunday, residents wondered if there was even still a ceasefire. Israel unleashed a wave of airstrikes targeting south, north and central Gaza in what it said was a response to an attack on its soldiers byHamasmilitants earlier in the day.“I fear that the ceasefire could collapse at any moment, especially now. Since the ceasefire began, not a single day has passed without attacks or casualties. And yet, we cannot say a word,” said Baba.In Gaza City on Saturday, a funeral was held for the victims of an Israeli strike the day before. A car carrying a family wanting to check on their home in Gaza City had strayed over the withdrawal line which marked where Israeli troops were still operating in Gaza. Israeli tanks fired two shells at the car,killing 11 members of the Abu Shabaan family, including seven children.“Shreds, shreds, they are in shreds. All of them. They are torn to pieces. I don’t know if I am saying goodbye to my son or my daughter,” Umm Mohammed Shaaban told Al Jazeera while attending the funeral of her family.Israeli troops are still occupying about 50% of Gaza, denoted on maps by a thick yellow line that indicates where civilians can go in the first phase of the ceasefire. Civil defence officials said there was no way for people to know when they had crossed over the line.Israeli officials have since said they will be physically marking the line with large concrete blocks. “The truce is fragile, the truce is on paper. On the ground, we are dying. This is the reality, this is the truce. It is a truce coloured in red, it is all blood,” a man attending the funeral for the Abu Shabaan family told Al Jazeera.Despite the intense day of violence, Palestinians still clung on to hope that the two sides could work out their disagreements and that the ceasefire might hold. The return of Israeli bombing after just a fleeting moment of relief was a nightmare too painful to imagine.“I hope the ceasefire continues, and that our social, economic and political life improves so that one day we can return to our homeland. I know the north has become a disaster zone, unfit for living, yet we still have the will to rebuild and start again. This can only happen if the ceasefire holds,” said Baba.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

I think after such bloodshed and destruction it will take some time to move in any positive direction,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University, who is now in Cairo.But the way in which the war ended has already had a significant impact on the politics of the region.Efforts to counter Trump’s ill-received “Riviera” plan for Gaza earlier this year brought regional powers together in a new way. This has now moved up a gear. Rapid implementation of Trump’s new 20-point plan is forcing rivals to set aside differences and collaborate very closely under significant pressure, after years of competition across the Middle East.Reaching an agreement on the first phase of the plan depended on US pressure on Israel but also Qatar andTurkeyleaning heavily on Hamas.Qatar is now firmly in Trump’s good books, but so too is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s veteran leader, praised by the US president at last week’s hastily arranged summit in Sharm el Sheikh, the Egyptian resort, as“a tough cookie”but also a “friend”. This was not always the view of the mercurial US president, and is not one shared by Egypt’s ruler, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who was nominally his co-host at the summit.Trump’s peace plan is just about holding together, but may be unravelled by two unresolved issues | Rajan MenonRead moreYet here, too, there has been a shift. Turkey, Egypt and possibly Jordan are seen as the most likely candidates to offer their soldiers forthe new international stabilisation force for Gaza. For both Turkey and Egypt this offer opportunities but risks too. They will seek to minimise friction, at least in the short term.Keen observers spotted other details from the summit that suggested bigger potential shifts.Among the leaders at Sharm el Sheikh was Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani, who faces a tough battle to win a second term at elections in less than a month. Heposed for a thumbs-up picturewith Trump and described Tony Blair – the US president’s pick for a leadership role of the “peace council”, a body of Palestinian technocrats meant to be set up to run Gaza under the 20-point plan – as a“great friend of Iraq”. This too may raise some eyebrows round the region, and farther afield.Iraq has been part of Iran’s sphere of influence since the aftermath of the 2003 war, but this could begin to change now, said Michael Knights, head of research at the global advisory Horizon Engage and a long-termIraqanalyst.“You can see Iraq being pulled now towards the Arab orbit and that is a major shift,” Knights said, adding that he understood that Baghdad was even considering contributing troops to the planned international stabilisation force in Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iran’s brief war with Israel made brutally clear its own military shortcomings. Its hugely costly nuclear programme is undoubtedly damaged even if we do not know by how much. European, UK and US sanctions have been reimposed.In addition, the ceasefire seals the demise of the coalition of militant groups of varying competence, autonomy and commitment that was a centrepiece of Tehran’s strategy of “forward defence”. Hezbollah is a shadow of its former self in Lebanon and facing an uncertain future, including possible disarmament. The friendly Assad regime in Syria is no more. Hamas has just stopped fighting and may also be forced to give up all its weapons that could threaten Israel.“The ceasefire could act as an engine of integration within the region. It will reopen all the talk of major land connections from the Gulf to the Mediterranean, as well as the broader conversation about the [diplomatic and economic] normalisation of Israel,” said Knights.For the moment, every leader in the region is well aware of public anger over the war in Gaza, which has been devastated by an Israeli offensive that has killed 68,000. But the ceasefire means that a conversation about expanding the Abraham Accords, the normalisation agreements agreed five years ago by four Arab states, is now theoretically possible, though here the question of a future Palestinian state looms large.“Trump has said the deal that he brokered goes well beyond Gaza and he was referring to normalisation with Israel, probably with Saudi Arabia and also possibly Indonesia, perhaps others. This is going to happen sometime,” said Abusada, the political science professor.Explore more on these topicsMiddle East peace talksMiddle East and north AfricaIranIraqTurkeyEgyptIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It said this rise was below the 10-year average for the average October bounce of 1.1%.Rightmove said some of the recent slowdown in activity could be attributed to a strong September in 2024, which was boosted by the first Bank of England rate cut in four years, setting a high benchmark for a year-on-year comparison.However, property experts said buyers, sellers and high street lenders were “hitting pause” before the budget. “[There are] some continuing jitters about what the upcoming budget might contain,” Rightmove said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similar legislation was enacted in 1917 to remove the titles of peers and princes who fought against the British in the first world war.One senior Labour backbencher and select committee chair described Andrew as a “disgrace” and said he “brings shame on himself and those associated with him”.“I would delight in voting for a parliamentary motion to strip him of all his titles,” they said.Asked by the BBC if he would support such legislation, Miliband said “the royal family will have to make its own decisions about what other steps can be taken” but that they had suggested “they didn’t want to take up parliamentary time with this”.Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, called for “a proper thorough investigation into what happened”.“It’s very clear the sense of entitlement thatPrince Andrewhas comes with being a prince and being part of the monarchy. The bigger story here is the monarchy itself. This is why I think the king has closed up shop. It poses some very difficult questions about how power operates in this country,” he said.George Foulkes, a Labour peer, wrote to the clerks of the Commons and Lords on Sunday night asking them toreview rules restricting parliamentarians from asking questions about the royal family.Foulkes said that early this year, the Lords table office rejected questions he tried to ask on Andrew and his 10-year role as a UK special representative for trade and investment, which the prince finally gave up in 2011 after a string of controversies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Sunday Foulkes called for the rules to be reviewed “in light of recent events”.Meanwhile, more than 1,000 letters were sent to MPs over the weekend urging them to push for a “full-blown parliamentary or independent inquiry into the royal Epstein scandal”.Supporters of the campaign group Republic wrote to their MPs accusing them of being complicit in their silence and urging them to call for an immediate investigation. Republic have called for an inquiry to look at actions taken by the Met police and for Andrew to face prosecution.“It is not credible to believe that the Met would not have informed senior royals of Andrew’s attempts to use them to smear Giuffre. There are also questions as to why the Met continues to refuse to investigate, interview or charge Andrew,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“Public anger is what’s going to push this forward and there is a palpable anger among the public who can see that Andrew being stripped of the use of his titles is no punishment at all.”The Guardian publishedan extract from Giuffre’s posthumous memoir last weekin which she detailed her first encounter with the “entitled” prince and said he “believed having sex with me was his birthright”.The Mail on Sunday published messages Andrew allegedly sent to Ed Perkins, then the queen’s deputy press secretary, in 2011 saying he had asked one of his close protection officers to obtain information about Giuffre.According to the messages, Andrew told Perkins he had given the officer Giuffre’s date of birth and nine-digit social security number and claimed she had a criminal record in the US. The email was sent hours before the publication of an infamous picture of Andrew with 17-year-old Giuffre.Her family has said she had no criminal record. There is no suggestion the police officer complied with the request.Another leaked email obtained by the Mail on Sunday suggests that Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, took Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, then 20 and 19, to visit Epstein in New York after he was released from prison.After a newspaper interview given by Ferguson in 2011 in which she said her association with him was a “terrible error of judgment”, Epstein wrote to Paul Tweed, his UK-based lawyer, in April 2011, and said she was “the first to celebrate my release”. A source close to Ferguson said that neither she nor her daughters had any recollection of such a visit.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchyMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

They are weak. They are foolish. They are incapable of displaying true courage themselves, so they look to harm those who are. They are obsessed with personal gain at the expense of group success. They cannot cope with disappointment and personal inadequacies so they seek to bring down others to their level.”She added: “I want you to know … I passed my suspicions of who is responsible for this treachery to head office and a thorough investigation is already under way. The guilty parties will be expelled from the Reform party without delay. They will have no political future.”It came as James Orr, an academic who is influential within Donald Trump’s administration, was appointed a senior adviser to Nigel Farage.Reform UK welcomed Orr, an anti-abortion theologian at Cambridge whom JD Vance once described as his “British sherpa”, to his role on Sunday night.Zia Yusuf, the party’s head of policy, described him as “a brilliant academic, theologian, thinker” who had been “a bastion of common sense and patriotism at Cambridge University”.Kemkaran was facing pressure on Sunday over her comments in the footage, which was of a meeting which took place in late August. The leader of Medway council issued a statement saying he would be writing to her to seek clarification after she told Reform councillors at the leaked meeting that other leaders of Kent councils who she had met did not like her because she was a woman.“To suggest I don’t like her because she is a woman is utterly ludicrous,” said Vince Maple, the Labour Medway council leader. He said her comments flew in the face of the “collaborative approach” Kent councils had to date when it came to working together over local government reform (LGR) plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we don’t balance the books you can forget Reform winning the next election. It’s that crucial.“If we can avoid putting up council tax by the full 5%, that is going to be the best thing that we can do to show that Reform can actually run something as big as Kent council, because let’s not forget we are the shop window in KCC. People are looking at us, they are judging us every single day, every single minute of every single day. Nigel knows that. He is super-aware that we are the flagship council.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKKentLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

He claimed that Indians come to America to “drain our pockets” before returning toIndia, “or worse … to stay”.His remarks have sparked widespread anger. Since 29 September, residents along with regional and national Indian American groups have crowded Palm Bay city council meetings and demanded that he step down.On Thursday night, the council voted 3-2 to formally censure Langevin. During the meeting, Rob Medina, the mayor who also serves on the council, said: “We’re all overwhelmed by everything. This nation was founded on immigrants … We are all part of the very fabric of the flag, our banner, the United States of America.”Hindus for Human Rights, a national advocacy organization, released alettercalling the remarks “overtly bigoted, dehumanizing, and dangerous” and urged Republican governorRon DeSantisto suspend Langevin from his role.Doge-ish comes to Florida: a DeSantis loyalist is going after ‘waste’ in Democratic citiesRead more“If your office fails to act decisively, it sets a dangerous precedent: legitimizing hate speech by elected officials and normalizing hostility toward minority communities,” the letter added.The Asian American Hotel Owners Association also strongly condemned the remarks, saying during a council meeting earlier this month that they “echo some of history’s darkest rhetoric, drawing disturbing parallels to the language of hate that has led to violence and persecution around America”.Florida Republicans, such as Representative Mike Haridopolos and Senator Rick Scott, as well as several Democratic politicians, have also spoken out against Langevin’s comments.“The Brevard Republican Party does not condone or share Mr. Chandler Langevin’s position with regard to the Indian community and culture here in our County,” Brevard county’s Republican party chair, Rick Lacey, said in astatement. “Even though Mr. Langevin is a registered Republican, his views are his, and his alone.”Florida’s Democratic party chair, Nikki Fried, also released astatement, saying: “Chandler Langevin’s comments towards the Indian American community are vile and reprehensible. The people of Palm Bay deserve better leadership than someone who so proudly displays his hateful ignorance through divisive and racist rhetoric.Speaking to theWashington Postearlier this week, Langevin said his intention was to spark “discourse” on immigration. “I’m not the first Republican to make a mean tweet,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFloridaUS politicsUS immigrationIndianewsShareReuse this content"

He said Trump’s decision to commute his sentence came as a surprise.“I had no expectations, I wasn’t even aware until I learned it off of the chyron of mainstream media inside of the prison myself,” he said. “Other inmates saw it and called me over.”Bash pressed Santos on whether he had received favorable treatment as a “loyal ally” of the president.“There’s a lot of people who were upset with President Biden who pardoned his entire family before he left office in an unprecedented move,” Santos quipped back. “Pardon me if I’m not paying too much attention to the pearl-clutching of the outrage of my critics.”Trump has issued several pardons and commutations during his second term so far,beginningwith the “full, complete and unconditional” presidential pardons for about 1,500 people who were involved in theJanuary 6 attackon Congress.In February, hepardonedformer Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of corruption based crimes, including trying to sell a US Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama.As part of his plea deal, Santos had agreed topaynearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture. When asked on State of the Union if he was planning on paying back the restitution, he said if it is “required of me by the law”.“I’ve been out of prison for two days. I agreed to come here to speak with you candidly and openly and not to obfuscate,” he said, visibly frustrated. “If it’s required of me by the law, yes. If it’s not, then no. I will do whatever the law requires me to do.”In a separate appearance on Fox & Friends Weekend earlier on Sunday, Santos said he no longer had to pay restitution and thanked Trump, praising him for having “such an amazing will for second chances”.Back on CNN, he went on to say he was confident that “if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off the cross, he would have had critics. That’s just the reality of our country.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge SantosTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Our bandmate. Our heartbeat,” the band wrote.“Sam Rivers wasn’t just our bass player – he was pure magic. The pulse beneath every song, the calm in the chaos, the soul in the sound.Limp Bizkit review – nu-metal elders can still rock the party like it’s 1999Read more“From the first note we ever played together, Sam brought a light and a rhythm that could never be replaced. His talent was effortless, his presence unforgettable, his heart enormous.”Fred Durst, the band’s frontman and lead vocalist, posted a video Sunday morning that recounted how they met at a club in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, and went on to music stardom and performances around the globe. Durst said he has shed “gallons and gallons of tears since yesterday”.“He really did have an impact on the world and his music and his gift is the one that’s going to keep on giving,” Durst said. “I just love him so much.”The cause of Rivers’ death was not revealed.Rivers, 48, had spoken of heavy drinking that had caused liver disease. He left the band in 2015 and received a liver transplant before reuniting withLimp Bizkitthree years later.Durst said he and Rivers shared a love of grunge music, naming the bands Mother Love Bone, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.“He had this kind of ability to pull this beautiful sadness out of the bass that I’d never heard,” Durst said, calling Rivers “so talented I can’t explain.”Limp Bizkit formed in Jacksonville in 1994 and rose to fame in the late 1990s with their eclectic and heavy sound that blended metal, hip-hop and punk influences.They achieved mainstream success with their albums Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), which topped the charts in the US.Their off-the-wall sense of humor is reflected in the titles of their mega-selling 2000 album, “Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,” and a single released last month, “Making Love to Morgan Wallen.”Rivers was one of the founding members of the band, along with vocalist Fred Durst, drummer John Otto, guitarist Wes Borland and turntablist DJ Lethal.“Rest easy, brother. Your music never ends,” they said in the Instagram post.DJ Lethal added in a comment below the band’s post: “We are in shock. Rest in power my brother! You will live on through your music and the lives you helped save with your music , charity work and friendships. We are heartbroken 💔 enjoy every millisecond of life. It’s not guaranteed.”Limp Bizkit has scheduled a tour of Central and South America to begin in Mexico City in late November.Explore more on these topicsLimp BizkitMetalPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Their goal is to stymie the Maha-led effort to curb Americans’ consumption of soda and ultra-processed foods.To carry out the plan, the companies have turned to a partially formalized network of for-hire pollsters, strategists and political financiers with deep ties to the national Republican party – several of whom have taken steps that obscure their connection to the effort and to one another. In the process, the industry has also been aided less directly by a loose coalition of free-market ideologues who have previously worked to advance Trump’s deregulatory agenda.The effort features Maga influencers hired by a firm that promotes “anti-woke” movies; an obscure research group Lee Zeldin was working for whenDonald Trumppicked him to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency; and a media outlet backed by rightwing billionaires Leonard Leo andCharles Koch, among others.The ongoing influence campaign is being spearheaded by the American Beverage Association with help from the Consumer Brands Association, two prominent trade groups in the food industry. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, the three largest soft-drink corporations in the United States, as well as packaged-food conglomerates like General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Mondelēz and Nestlé, are among those that pay dues for the right to have a say in either or both of the trade groups’ strategies.All three soda-makers identified the Maha efforts as significant threats to their bottom lines in their most recent annual reports, delivered to investors after Trump nominated Kennedy to be secretary of US Health and Human Services.CokeandDr Pepperwent as far as to suggest such risks would be compounded if unnamed “government officials” were to voice health concerns about their products.The three soda makers did not respond to questions about the lobbying effort.The companies’ most pressing political concerns are two related RFK Jr-backed efforts: one to ban schools from serving foods with petroleum-based dyes, and the other to bar individuals receiving Snap benefits from using the federal nutrition assistance to purchase soft drinks.Their not-so-subtle message to conservative lawmakers, delivered directly by lobbyists and indirectly via both an industry front group and paid social media influencers: oppose the Maha efforts or face a Maga backlash.“Working-class families and individuals across America rose up to vote for President Trump on the promise of a new era that would lift them up, not leave them behind again,” the beverage lobbydeclaredearlier this year in an unsigned memo as some of the first Maha-themed nutrition efforts were gaining conservative support in places like Utah and Arkansas. Supporting the Snap restrictions, the group continued, “would betray those voters and that promise”.To date, the Maha nutrition efforts have largely stalled inside the Beltway but found far more success outside of it. A dozen states have already requested,and received, waivers from the US Department of Agriculture allowing them to restrict how Snap benefits can be used, androughly a half dozenhave passed legislation restricting food dyes in school meals.The Utah state representative Kristen Chevrier, a Republican whose Snap and school-meals bills were signed into law by her governor in March, says that’s likely because the industry’s influence is concentrated in the nation’s capital. “It’s easier for the big food industries to control the federal government then it is for them to control a whole bunch of different states,” she said in an interview.Chevrier, who describes herself as “a Maha mom before Maha was a thing”, said the lobbyists who approached her focused far more on their own profits than any political backlash she might face. Their priority was “how much money they were going to lose if people stopped buying soda with Snap dollars”, she said. “The lobbyists were sitting there at the table with me and I said: ‘Do you have any idea what this sounds like? That you’re more concerned about the money you’re going to lose than you are about the health of the vulnerable population that you’re serving?”Mystery firms and ‘lethal precision’Communications obtained via a public records request confirm that industry lobbyists attempted to use the Maga-versus-Maha messaging in their bid to derail the nutrition bills at the state level. And they’ve done so with veteran GOP strategists serving as middle operatives, creating the appearance of distance between the companies and their preferred narrative.In late February, for instance, as two Maha bills were moving through the Arizona legislature, soda lobbyist Michael Gardnerreached outto lawmakers to make his client’s case against the Snap legislation, which was ultimatelyvetoed by the governor. He closed by directing the elected officials’ attention to a then-recent article headlined “Trump voters want SNAP users to be able to buy soda”. The underlying source for that claim was a poll paid for by the American Beverage Association itself.The firm hired to conduct the survey, Public Opinion Strategies, isowned by Glen Bolger, who previously worked for the National Republican congressional committee, the House GOP’s main campaign arm. The American Beverage Association paid Bolger’s firm nearly $2m in 2023, the most recent year for which the trade group’stax filingsare publicly available.Bolger and his firm are also part of a larger,formal network of political shopsrun by Phil Cox, who was once a top executiveat Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family’s primary dark-money group, and who is currently on the board of the Senate Leadership Fund and WinRed. Cox’s network, GP3 Partners, includes more than a dozen other firms andboasts onlineof its “proven ability to play with lethal precision at scale”.Completing this particular lobbying spin-cycle – from industry-funded poll to news coverage the industry’s lobbyists could use to pressure lawmakers – was the outlet in which the article about the survey appeared, the Center Square. Despite claiming to be a provider of “high-quality statehouse and statewide news”, it has been identifiedby journalism expertsat Columbia University as a purveyor of “pink slime”, meaning, partisan talking points presented as objective journalism. The Center Square is run by the Franklin News Foundation, a conservative non-profit that has received substantial funding from Donors Trust,Leonard Leo’s primary dark-money vehicle, and that ispart of the State Policy Networkof rightwing thinktanks backed by Leo and the Koch family. (Chris Krug, the publisher of the Center Square, said in an email: “The Center Square maintains editorial independence, free from any external influence.”)As Gardner was working to derail Arizona’s Snap bill on behalf of the soda makers, a second industry lobbyist, the Consumer Brands Association’s Erin Raden, was waging a similar, albeit more convoluted, effort in opposition to the state’s school-meal bill, the records show.In a Marchemailto one of the bill’s sponsors, Raden argued against the legislation and then, much as Gardner had, closed by pointing toan articleposted by a rightwing news outlet that suggested Trump voters wanted such decisions left to the president. “I know you are hosting a town hall tomorrow and thought it might come up,” Raden wrote to the Republican senator Janae Shamp, who had introduced the bill in Arizona’s upper chamber.This time, the underlying poll on which the article was based was conducted by the Tyson Group on behalf of Plymouth Union Public Research. Unlike Public Opinion Strategies, which is well-known within certain Washington DC circles and publicly discloses its ties to GP3, Tyson Group has a far smaller and less transparent public presence. Its website listsjust five employees. However, the firm doesn’t disclose publicly that all five of those individualsalso workat P2 Public Affairs, a much larger and more prominent conservative consulting firm – one that, like Public Opinion Strategies, is alsopart ofCox’s GP3 umbrella organization.The metadata on an internal memo for subsequent Tyson polling likewise shows that document was created by Katherine Swetman, who is not listed on Tyson’s site as an employee but is listed on P2’s as a marketing manager specializing in “targeted messaging”. (P2 and Tyson did not respond to questions about their structure or involvement in the campaign. The Consumer Brands Association said in a statement that it did not pay for the poll but believes “most voters across the country” would prefer a national standard for food additives.)Plymouth Union Public Research is even more opaque. The group, also known as PUP Research,describes itselfonline as a 501(c)6 non-profit, but there is currently no record of it in the Internal Revenue Service database of such tax-exempt organizations. The group did not respond to questions about its leadership and staff. The firm does, however, show up in theethics paperworkZeldin filed in January as part of his confirmation process. In that filing, Zeldin disclosed serving as a director at the research firm from October 2024 to the time he filed the report on 11 January 2025.While PUP Research doesn’t disclose its leadership or employees, an apparent sister organization known as Plymouth Union Public Advocacy, or PUP Advocacy, does. Theadvocacy firm’s websitesuggests it launched earlier this year with a seven-figure paid campaign in support of Trump’s agenda, and that it is led by a trio of GOP veterans.TheTrump administrationat times pushes back on the idea that Maha’s nutrition agenda is an affront to its base. Earlier this year, after the Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders applied for one of the Snap waivers, the American Beverage Association labeled Sanders and the head of the USDA, Brooke Rollins, as the “food police” on X. (The American Beverage Association’s CEO, Kevin Keane, has undertaken a tour of conservative podcasts and conferences, pushing a similar line that the government shouldn’t be “making decisions for people” when it comes to nutrition.)The post drew a swift rebuke from Rollins’s X account. “It’s disappointing that the American Beverage Association’s leadership dragged its entire membership–and the patriotic American workers and their families they employ and represent–into direct conflict with this Administration’s priorities for American health, well-being, and taxpayer protection,” she wrote. “These priorities–which those same American workers voted to endorse–will prevail.” She tagged Kennedy in her response.Paid Maga influencersAs industry lobbyists were making their case to lawmakers directly, an industry-funded front group, Americans for Food and Beverage Choice, was running a small-dollar Facebook ad campaign featuring the industry’s Snap-related polling in at least nine states, according to theMeta ad library database. The non-profit bills itself as a grassroots organization, but according to its2023 tax filing, the most recent available, each of the four individuals who served as either a director or officer of the organization that year also was employed at the American Beverage Association,including Keanehimself.Meanwhile, a group of Maga-aligned influencers were taking the same pro-soda message nationwide by posting client-approved talking points on Elon Musk’s X – all while not disclosing they were being paid to do so. “We cannot allow ‘Make America Healthy Again’ messaging to be used to force needy Americans into not buying certain things,”tweetedconservative influencer Eric Daugherty, adding: “President Trump literally has a Diet Coke button in his Oval Office.”The paid-influencer campaign was firstdocumented by Nick Sortor, a conservative journalist and podcaster, who obtained internal documents from the social media marketing agency behind the effort, Influenceable LLC.Who are the rightwing influencers filling Trump’s head with visions of antifa?Read more“This campaign highlights the dangers of government overregulation, with a specific focus on current efforts to restrict soda purchases through food-aid programs,” the company’s instructions to the influencers read. “The narrative emphasizes how such regulation is an overreach that unfairly targets consumer choice, especially considering the president himself is a Diet Coke enthusiast.” For good measure, the influencers were also encouraged to sharea photo of Trumpdrinking a soda while riding in a golf cart.After being called out by Sortor, Daugherty and at leastone other influencerdeleted their posts. “Yeah, that was dumb of me,”Daugherty posted. “Massive egg on my face. In all seriousness, it won’t happen again.”Influenceable LLC is run by Camron and Liam Rafizadeh, brothers who have made a name for themselves by trafficking in anti-LGBTQ+ memes and pro-Trump talking points online. In 2019, the pair founded Today Is America Inc, whichdescribes itselfas “the fastest-growing pro-America Gen Z, Anti-woke company”.While Influenceable’s website does not list any specific political campaigns it has worked on, IRS filings show that it was paid$110,000 in 2023by the Center for Renewing America, a Christian-nationalist organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump’s current director of the office of management and budget.Keane has denied that the American Beverage Association was behind the Influenceable campaign. Nonetheless, the proposed talking points strongly echo the industry’s – including one that appears to cite the very poll the group paid for and then used to lobby state officials in Arizona and cited in the Facebook campaign run by the front group that Keane leads. “Polling shows,” the final talking point given to the influencers reads, “a majority of Trump voters oppose restrictions on soda purchases through SNAP.”Josh Voorhees is an investigative editor at Fieldnotes, a watchdog organization focused on the oil and gas industryExplore more on these topicsRepublicansFood & drink industryHealthTrump administrationFoodRobert F Kennedy JrUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That fight is essential to protecting democracy itself.”According to a tracker by the non-profit law journal Just Security, at least 30 lawsuits have beenfiledby unions against the Trump administration. Here are three of the most significant areas they are trying to push back.1. Attacks on laborIn March, Trumpissuedan executive order, invoking national security, which sought to rescind collective bargaining rights for two-thirds of federal workers: over a million employees. In August, Trumpissuedanother executive order, seeking to rescind collective bargaining agreements at additional federal agencies.“President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with him; he will not tolerate mass obstruction,” the firstorderstated. Everett Kelley, president of American Federation of Government Employees (Afge),calledit the “single most aggressive action taken by the federal government against organized labor in US history”.Six labor unionsfileda lawsuit challenging the order, which unions argue is unlawful. “It’s clear that this order is punishment for unions who are leading the fight against the administration’s illegal actions in court – and a blatant attempt to silence us,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the US, said in astatementat the time.View image in fullscreenLiz Shuler.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe unions initially won a sweeping injunction, only for this to be overturned by a federal appeals court. The administration promptlystripped hundreds of thousands of federal workersof their union contracts in August. Court proceedings in the case are continuing.In June, a federal judge ruled that the Transportation Security Administration mustreviveits collective bargaining agreement, at least while a legal challenge works its way through the courts, after the Department of Homeland Securitycancelledit in March. Atrialhas been set for 2026.2. Workforce cutsTheTrump administrationhas tried to drastically reduce the size of the federal government, including by reclassifying thousands of federal jobs as at-will positions, firing probationary workers, and pushing a controversial deferred resignation program, which many workers say they felt threatened and intimidated into taking.“Both people who took the deferred resignation program offer and those who stayed were forced to choose between two bad options,” said a former Department of Energy employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.The employee accepted the deferred resignation program as their maternity leave ended because they were fearful of potential layoffs at the agency. “I feel a lot of grief for my job, the great people I worked with who have also left, and my dreams for the projects I was so excited to lead,” they said.Unions have filed a string of lawsuits to challenge initial firings, reclassifications, and resignation program.Litigationin these cases continues.3. Dismantling agenciesBeyond efforts to dismiss, or drive out, many employees from the federal government, Trump’s administration has also sought to break apart some of the agencies they work for.Organizations such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh), the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Voice of America, USAID and theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau(CFPB) have all been in the sights of the White House.A blizzard of lawsuits were filed by unions in a bid to slow, and ultimately stop, these attempts. “The Trump administration’s rash move to decimate the Niosh workforce is not only unlawful but shortsighted,” Bonnie Robin-Vergeer, Public Citizen Litigation Group attorney,saidin May. “In bypassing Congress and effectively shutting down the agency, [the administration] violated federal laws and exceeded its power under the constitution.”Many of the targeted departments remain open, for now, although large numbers of their employees are on leave, pending the ultimate outcome of legal battles over their future. Although unions initially won an injunction preventing Trump from gutting the CFPB, this was overturned by a judge by a DC circuit panel in August. The unions are seeking to appeal.The White House did not comment on the lawsuits. An automated response said the press office “may experience delays” during the federal government shutdown, and took the opportunity to blame Democrats for both parties’ failure to reach a deal to reopen the government.“Of the scores of lawsuits that have been filed since January, for the most part, the unions that have filed them, or the individual employees that have filed them, have won in the trial court,” said Catherine Fisk, Barbara Nachtrieb Armstrong professor of law at the University of California Berkeley. “In many cases, if they’ve gotten to a court of appeals, they have won there, they have prevailed in making the preliminary showing necessary to get the court to order the government to stop what it’s doing and to reinstate the workers while the case gets litigated.”Fisk pointed to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which regulates every aspect of hirings, promotions, discipline, and firings of federal civilian employees.On the temporary injunction blocking Trump from firing federal employees during the government shutdown, Robin Tholin of Altshuler Berzon, a law firm representing plaintiffs Afge and Afscme in the lawsuit, said: “The law plainly does not permit this administration’s scheme to order mass firings across the federal government for their own political advantage, including by illegally keeping federal employees working during a government shutdown to carry out the firing of their fellow employees.”Once these cases have made their way through the lower courts, the question turns to what happens next – or, as Fisk put it, “how far the US supreme court is going to go in allowing the Trump administration to do whatever it wants”.The supreme court overruled two injunctions initially won by Afge, which had temporarily halted large-scale reductions of the federal workforce while lawsuits worked their way through lower courts.No one is sure what will happen next. “I can’t hazard a guess on whether the majority of the court is prepared to declare civil service protections for federal civilian employees unconstitutional,” said Fisk. “It seems shocking, because there has been civil service protection for federal civilian employees since the mid-late 19th century.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsTrump administrationUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Meats like steak are a no-go for our household.”Harris, 38, lives and works as a teacher’s assistant in Stella, North Carolina, and is one of almost 40 people who spoke to the Guardian about how they’ve been coping with the price of goods in the six months sinceDonald Trumpannounced his sweeping tariffs.On Thursday,a study from S&P Globalrevealed that companies were expected to pay at least $1.2tn more in 2025 expenses than was previously anticipated. But the burden, according to the researchers, is now shifting to US consumers. They calculated that two-thirds of the “expense shock”, more than $900bn, will be absorbed by Americans. Last month, the Yale Budget Labestimatedtariffs would cost households almost $2,400 more a year.Harris says the tariffs’ impact on her daily life contradicts promises from the Trump administration to “cut prices and make living affordable for everyone”. She said: “You see prices soaring. It has become very clear that this administration did not and does not care about the everyday lives of Americans.”Several Americans told the Guardian their weekly budgets had been drastically altered with the introduction of Trump’s tariffs.“Prices are way too high. I mostly shop at Costco and buy as little as possible anywhere else,” said Jean Meadows, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Huntsville, Alabama. “I can’t imagine that stores haven’t noticed the change. I think people are really afraid of what is coming.”That sense of apprehension is reflected in a recent poll, exclusively conducted for the Guardian, where respondents identified the tariffs asthe second biggest threatto the economy.“The bread I buy has doubled in price within a year. We live on a fixed income that doesn’t keep up with inflation,” said Myron Peeler, who is also retired and is the sole caregiver for his wife, who suffers from debilitating arthritis. The only saving grace, he said, is that his house and car are paid off.Trump shows few signs of backing away from his tariff policy – a move the White House maintains will reinvigorate American manufacturing and increased revenue from trade partners.Most recently, the president reignited a trade war with China by threatening a 100% tariff on Beijing as soon as November. This came after China moved to restrict exports of rare earth minerals needed for several everyday items from electric vehicle batteries to hospital equipment, a decision that Trump branded as “very hostile”. In an interview with Fox News, the president has admitted that the proposed tariff hike was “not sustainable”, but said he was left with little choice: “They forced me to do that”.Currently, the average US tariffs on Chinese exports hovers around 58%, according to the Peterson Institute for Economics. It’s a levy that is already taking a toll on Americans such as Michele, from north-eastern Pennsylvania.“We need to buy new tires for a car, and can’t, because affordable tires are no longer in stock and we can’t afford $250 a tire,” she said.Several people echoed Michele’s feelings about availability, describing the situation as “empty shelves, higher prices”. Natalie, who lives in New Hampshire, said she hasn’t seen certain pantry staples “for months”. She said: “The store shelves have become more and more bare … instead of multiple choices there may only be one or two, and name brands are being replaced by store brands.”At 55, Natalie is semi-retired but is due to start part-time work at a supermarket, and she has seen a price rise in nearly everything she buys regularly. “Any brand of cat food has increased anywhere from 25% to double the price. One wet food my cats like went from $1.79 to $2.49 per can,” she said.The new normal many Americans are bracing for, or already feeling, is not just the cost of groceries, for those such as Minnie, a food writer in Portland, Oregon, it’s a change in lifestyle.“I don’t shop for non-essentials. No fall shopping trips for a new sweater or jeans. And we’ll make all our Christmas presents this year,” said Minnie, 55. “We used to dine out once a week. Now we never eat out. Even fast-casual is insanely pricey. Everything is twice what it used to cost and we’re very afraid of what’s next, financially speaking.”While the US inflation ratehovers around 2.9%– a substantial drop from the spikes of the Covid era – the tariffs haven’t helped ease the impact on Americans’ wallets. Richard Ulmer, 81, who has lived in Florida for 35 years, said this year has been “the worst from a financial standpoint”, adding that “everything” from his groceries to the electric bill has become more expensive.For Cassie, a 25-year-old consultant based in Siler City, North Carolina, costs have shot up quickly compared to the “gradual price increases” during the first two years of the pandemic. Cassie has a strict $65 per week budget for groceries, but since Trump first announced his tariffs, she’s been priced out of her normal routine, which included doing most of her weekly shopping at Walmart.“Now I must visit at least four different stores in the area and other towns, often driving longer distances to find the best prices,” she said. “During the summer months and the Mexico/Latin America tariff announcement, Walmart and other stores in the area ran out of bananas for around two weeks. No one could get bananas in my area.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Broncos coach Sean Payton ran out onto the field to argue the call and was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. That put the ball at the one and Dart took it from there.The Broncos had taken a 30-26 lead on Nix’s 18-yard keeper with 1:51 remaining.The Broncos were actually in danger of getting shut out at home for the first time in their 66-year history when they were blanked for three quarters.The Giants, who grabbed a 26-8 lead on a deflected touchdown catch with 10:22 remaining, left several points on the field on two missed extra points and a failed two-point conversion.Dart threw a trio of touchdown passes, one of them to Cam Skattebo, as the Giants built their big lead.Harvey’s two-yard TD catch came on a deflected pass, and Nix’s two-point pass to Sutton made it 19-8, but on the ensuing drive, on third-and-17 from the Denver 41, the Giants got their own ricocheted touchdown when tight end Theo Johnson hauled in Dart’s pass after it went off wide receiver Wan’Dale Robinson’s hands and raced into the end zone.Trailing 26-8, the Broncos scored twice sandwiched around Justin Strnad’s interception that set up his offense at the New York 19. First, Nix scored on a seven-yard keeper, then threw a two-point pass to Franklin to make it 26-16 with 5:13 remaining. Then he hit Harvey from two yards out to make it 26-23.The Broncos’ comeback came on a day the franchise honored the late Demaryius Thomas by inducting him into the team’s ring of fame.By the halftime ceremony, the Giants had taken a 13-0 lead highlighted by Dart’s 44-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Benninger in the first quarter and his 13-yard strike to Scattebo in the second quarter for the rookie running back’s first career TD grab.New York made it 19-0 on Tyrone Tracy Jr’s 31-yard scamper late in the third quarter, but the two-point conversion failed.Philadelphia Eagles 28-22 Minnesota VikingsJalen Hurts gave his lagging offense a jolt by throwing for 326 yards and three touchdowns, Jalyx Hunt returned an interception for a score, and the Philadelphia Eagles rebounded from back-to-back losses by hanging on to beat the Minnesota Vikings 28-22 on Sunday.Hurts went 19 for 23 in the highlight-reel revival of the passing attack that helped the Eagles (5-2) win the Super Bowl last season, hitting AJ Brown for two touchdowns and DeVonta Smith for a career-high 183 receiving yards that included a 79-yard score.Facing third-and-9 from their 44 with 1:45 left and the Vikings (3-3) still holding two timeouts, Hurts dropped back and dropped a 45-yard rainbow into Brown’s arms to seal it after he beat former teammate Isaiah Rodgers with a slick double move up the sideline. Rodgers, in his first season with the Vikings, also got beat on Smith’s touchdown.Carson Wentz went 26 for 42 for 313 yards on an erratic afternoon, getting picked off twice in his own territory and struggling on the other end while the Vikings had to settle for Will Reichard’s field goals on five of six possessions inside the 20.Wentz said during the week he’s too far removed from his time with Philadelphia to carry a grudge into this game, having made Minnesota his sixth stop in six seasons, but he didn’t give his original team his best performance – particularly in the red zone.Washington Commanders 22-44 Dallas CowboysDak Prescott threw for three touchdowns, including a 74-yarder to CeeDee Lamb, DaRon Bland returned an interception 68 yards for a score after Jayden Daniels left with a hamstring injury and the Cowboys beat the Commanders 44-22 on Sunday.Lamb had 110 yards on five catches after a high ankle sprain kept him out of the previous three games, when George Pickens sparkled without his new sidekick, then had just as much of an impact with them sharing the spotlight again.Pickens’ 44-yard catch keyed a 35-second touchdown drive for a 27-15 lead in the final minute of the first half after Daniels had scored on a one-yard run with 45 seconds to go before the break.Javonte Williams ran for 116 yards a touchdown for Dallas (3-3-1).On the first possession of the second half for Washington (3-4), Daniels, who has already missed two games with a knee injury this season, injured his right hamstring while losing a fumble on Shemar James’ sack. The AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year grabbed behind his leg after getting dragged down by James as the ball came out.Marcus Mariota replaced Daniels, and his first possession ended when he scrambled left and threw deep the other way to Jeremy McNichols. Bland was waiting for the throw and went untouched on the pick-six. Bland set an NFL record two years ago with five interception returns for touchdowns.Green Bay Packers 27-23 Arizona CardinalsJosh Jacobs ran for a go-ahead, one-yard touchdown with 1:50 remaining, Micah Parsons had a career-high three sacks and the Packers rallied from an early 10-point deficit to beat the Cardinals 27-23 on Sunday.Green Bay (4-1-1) fought through a sluggish first half to win their first road game of the season. The Packers had their share of adversity this weekend – the team’s travel was reportedly delayed roughly five hours on Saturday because of mechanical issues with their airplane in Wisconsin.Arizona (2-5) had a chance to win the game on its final offensive drive but Jacoby Brissett’s fourth-down pass was batted away in the end zone with six seconds left. Brissett – filling in for the injured Kyler Murray – threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns.The Cardinals have lost five straight games by a combined 13 points. They’re just the third NFL team to lose by four points or less in five straight, joining the 2017 San Francisco 49ers and 1984 Cleveland Browns.Jacobs was a game-time decision because of an illness and calf injury, but produced his third straight two-touchdown game. He finished with 55 yards rushing and also ran for a seven-yard touchdown in the third quarter.Green Bay’s Jordan Love completed 19 of 29 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown.Indianapolis Colts 38-24 Los Angeles ChargersDaniel Jones threw for 288 yards and two scores, Jonathan Taylor had his third three-touchdown game of the season and the Colts beat the Chargers 38-24 on Sunday for their NFL-leading sixth win.The Colts (6-1) also snapped a five-game skid in Los Angeles after losing to the Rams at SoFi Stadium last month. They hadn’t beaten the Chargers, Rams or now-Las Vegas Raiders in L.A. since 1986. Overall, the Colts hadn’t beat the Chargers since Sept. 25, 2016, in Indianapolis.Off to their best start since 2009, the AFC South-leading Colts led 23-3 at halftime while holding the Chargers to 10 rushing yards on six carries. The Colts scored 2 1/2 minutes into the game on Taylor’s 23-yard TD run and never looked back.Jones was 23 of 34. Taylor had 16 carries for 94 yards.The Chargers (4-3) never led while losing for the third time in four games despite a career-high 423 passing yards and three touchdowns by Justin Herbert. His 37 completions set a franchise record.Carolina Panthers 13-6 New York JetsBryce Young threw a touchdown pass before leaving with an ankle injury, Jaycee Horn had two interceptions of Tyrod Taylor after New York benched Justin Fields and the Panthers beat the winless Jets 13-6 in a snoozefest Sunday for their third straight victory.It marked the first time since Young was drafted with the No. 1 overall pick in 2023 that the Panthers (4-3) have a three-game winning streak with him as their starting quarterback – but he was unable to finish this one.And now the concern is if Young will be out for any extended time.Young went to the locker room late in the third quarter, appearing to walk with a slight limp. The Panthers announced his return was questionable before ruling him out.Andy Dalton took over with 34 seconds left in the quarter when Carolina got the ball back leading 13-3 following an interception by Horn in the end zone. Young was sacked by Jowon Briggs for a 12-yard loss on his last snap before the Panthers punted.Las Vegas Raiders 0-31 Kansas City ChiefsPatrick Mahomes threw for 286 yards and three touchdowns in less than three quarters of work, Rashee Rice caught two of the TD passes in his return from a six-game suspension, and the Chiefs beat the Raiders 31-0 on Sunday.Rice finished with seven catches for 42 yards in his first game since Week 4 last season, when he tore his ACL in a collision with Mahomes. He made it back from the injury in time to participate in the offseason and training camp, then was suspended before the start of the season for his role in a high-speed car crash on a Dallas highway in March 2024.Rice’s return sparked an offense that scored on its first five possessions and finished with 434 yards in all.It didn’t help Las Vegas to play most of the game without star pass rusher Maxx Crosby, who left with a knee injury.The Chiefs (4-3) were nearly as good on defense, though, holding the Raiders to three first downs and 96 yards while beating them for the 10th time in the last 11 matchups. Geno Smith finished 10 of 16 for 67 yards, while Ashton Jeanty, one of the NFL’s top rookies, carried just six times for 21 yards.View image in fullscreenPhiladelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts tries to avoid a tackle from Minnesota linebacker Eric Wilson during the first half of Sunday’s game.Photograph: Abbie Parr/APNew England Patriots 31-13 Tennessee TitansDrake Maye threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns and the New England Patriots beat the Tennessee Titans 31-13 Sunday in coach Mike Vrabel’s first game against the franchise that fired him in January 2024.The Patriots (5-2) won their fourth straight to keep them atop the AFC East and spoil Mike McCoy’s debut as Tennessee’s interim head coach.Fans chanted “Vrabel, Vrabel” as the clock ticked down.With a 135.9 passer rating, Maye became only the third player under the age of 24 with at least 200 yards passing and a passer rating of 100 or higher in six straight games in NFL history. He joined Patrick Mahomes (seven consecutive in 2018) and Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino (six in 1984).Linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson had two of the Patriots’ five sacks and returned a fumble four yards for a touchdown. Harold Landry III had the final sack against the team that released him in March, and Marcus Jones had an interception in the final minutes.New Orleans Saints 14-26 Chicago BearsDennis Allen’s defense dominated his former team, and the Bears beat the Saints 26-14 on Sunday for their fourth straight win.Allen, the Bears’ defensive coordinator, had to like what he saw in his first game against the Saints since they fired him as head coach midway through last season after two and a half years. The Bears forced four turnovers and sacked Spencer Rattler four times.Montez Sweat set the tone with an early strip-sack that led to a field goal. Nahshon Wright set up the game’s first touchdown with a long interception return, and the Bears (4-2) overcame a spotty performance by Caleb Williams to match their best streak since the 2018 NFC North championship team closed the regular season with four straight wins. They also had a much easier time after winning 25-24 at both Las Vegas and Washington.New Orleans (1-6) continued their worst start since opening 1-7 in 1999 under then-coach Mike Ditka, the Hall of Famer and Super Bowl-winning coach with the Bears.Miami Dolphins 6-31 Cleveland BrownsQuinshon Judkins scored three touchdowns and the Browns snapped a three-game losing streak with a 31-6 victory over the Dolphins on Sunday.Judkins, the 36th overall pick in April’s draft, had 84 yards rushing on 25 carries. He is the first Browns running back with three rushing scores in a game since Nick Chubb in 2022.Cormerback Tyson Campbell, acquired from theJacksonville Jaguarson 9 October, returned an interception for a touchdown on the first play of the second half as the Browns (2-5) got over the 17-point hump for the first time in 12 games.Rayshawn Jenkins added an interception and fumble recovery as the Browns had four takeaways in a game for the first time in nearly two seasons.Los Angeles Rams 35-7 Jacksonville JaguarsMatthew Stafford threw three of his five touchdown passes to Davante Adams and the Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 on a rainy Sunday at Wembley Stadium.Stafford, who has thrown 12 touchdowns with no interceptions in his past four games, also connected with rookie receiver Konata Mumpfield and rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson in the London rout.The Rams (5-2) are off to their best start since their Super Bowl-winning season in 2021. Star receiver Puka Nacua missed the game with an ankle injury.The only highlight for the Jaguars (4-3) was rookie two-way star Travis Hunter getting his first NFL touchdown. It made the score 28-7 in the fourth quarter.Adams, who caught two touchdown passes in the first half, then added a third on a one-yard jump ball that sent Jags fans to the exits.Explore more on these topicsNFLLos Angeles RamsJacksonville JaguarsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Little wonder there were smiles, Verstappen knows he is back in the fight.‘For sure, the chance is there’: Max Verstappen hopeful he can retain titleRead moreVerstappen beat title rival Lando Norris into second and with Norris’s McLaren teammate, andchampionship leader, Oscar Piastri managing only fifth from sixth on the grid, the meeting in Austin has set up an enormously tense run-in as the season enters its final five meetings. Norris has now closed to within just 14 points of his teammate.For Verstappen the victory has put him emphatically back in the title fight. He now trails Piastri by 40 points and Norris by 26. His hopes for a fifth drivers’ title remain a long shot, he needs to keep winning and forMcLarento fumble, but on this form and with the car looking increasingly impressive he will revel in bringing the pressure to bear and has far more experience than Norris and Piastri in closing out at the sharp end of a championship.Once Verstappen had held his lead from the start he was indomitable out front. He was without doubt aided in that any potential challenge from Norris was stymied when the McLaren driver lost second place to Charles Leclerc through turn one. The Monegasque made a blistering opening on the quicker soft tyres, a gamble from Ferrari that paid off at Norris’s expense.After which Norris duelled with Leclerc all race until with a spirited effort at the death he claimed back second for good, but all the while Verstappen had made hay and was gone. Leclerc took third but Piastri, never really on the pace all weekend in Austin, could make no charge forward as his championship lead became slender indeed.With the leaders all one-stopping, strategies were largely matched and Verstappen, enjoying clean air out front, needed no second invitation to grind out the kind of relentless win that notably marked his previous titles.View image in fullscreenLando Norris tries to find a way past Charles Leclerc in Austin.Photograph: Nick Didlick/APThe turnaround for Verstappen has been little short of extraordinary. Piastri had 104 points over him after the Dutch GP at the end of August, with the main consideration at the time being when and which McLaren driver might secure the championship.Since then, in the space of four grands prix and one sprint, well over half that advantage has been erased and Verstappen has taken three GPs and one sprint win from four meetings. Five races and two sprints are still to come and it is worth observing that since the Dutch GP neither McLaren driver has finished in front of the world champion.The timing has played its part. McLaren ceased development of their car some time ago, shifting resources to the 2026 model, butRed Bullcontinued to address the failings that had stymied them all season. Since the new team principal, Laurent Mekies, took over from Christian Horner in July, that they have been successful in doing so has been increasingly evident.In recent meetings on a variety of circuits and conditions the team appear to have solved the narrow operating window that was hampering performance, an achievement Verstappen has admitted that “nobody expected”.When asked his reaction had someone suggested he would be in this position back at the Dutch GP, he was blunt. “No I would have told them he was an idiot,” he said.He has cited a “different philosophy”, a new working approach that suggests the RB21 was never quite the undriveable beast the first half of the season indicated but rather that its consistent performance had to be teased out. Every indication after this sweeping victory in the US is that they have done so and Verstappen is now wielding it with joyful precision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet at no point this weekend did either of the McLaren drivers look like they had the edge on Verstappen.The sprint crash was costly with both Norris and Piastri taken out, but in qualifying Norris was still three‑tenths off Verstappen’s pole time and in race pace, even McLaren’s previous ace in the hole for so long, being able to work its tyres harder and longer, had been at least matched in the US by the Red Bull.Quick GuideUS Grand Prix results and standingsShow1Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1hr 34mins 161sec2Lando Norris(GB) McLarenat 7.959sec3Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrariat 15.3734Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrariat 28.5365Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLarenat 29.6786George Russell(GB) Mercedesat 33.4567Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bullat 52.7148Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauberat57.2499Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F1at 1:04.72210Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martinat 1:10.00111Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bullsat 1:13.20912Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martinat 1:14.77813Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedesat 1:15.74614Alexander Albon(Tha) Williamsat 1:20.00015Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haasat 1:23.04316Isack Hadjar(Fra) Racing Bullsat 1:32.80717Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpineat 1 lap18Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Kick Sauberat 1 lap19Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpineat 1 lapDNF: Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams5 laps completedFastest Lap:Antonelli1min 37.577secs on lap 33Drivers' standings:1Oscar Piastri346pts, 2Lando Norris332, 3Max Verstappen306, 4George Russell252, 5Charles Leclerc192, 6Lewis Hamilton142, 7Kimi Antonelli89, 8Alexander Albon73, 9Nico Hülkenberg41, 10Isack Hadjar39, 11Carlos Sainz Jr38, 12Fernando Alonso37, 13Lance Stroll32, 14Liam Lawson30, 15Esteban Ocon28, 16Yuki Tsunoda28, 17Pierre Gasly20, 18Oliver Bearman20, 19Gabriel Bortoleto18, 20Franco Colapinto0, 21Jack Doohan0Constructors' standings:1McLaren678pts (champions), 2Mercedes341, 3Ferrari334, 4Red Bull331, 5Williams111, 6Racing Bulls72, 7Aston Martin69, 8Sauber59, 9Haas48, 10Alpine20Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Stella was insistent this weekend that the team had no intention yet of prioritising either driver to see off a threat from Verstappen – but after the US GP that consideration has surely become all the more pressing and one amplified by the inexorable assuredness Verstappen demonstrated in Austin.Lewis Hamilton was fourth for Ferrari and George Russell finished sixth for Mercedes.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenRed BullMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe it is blind hope but they know that their team have been able to raise their level in some of the very biggest Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim. They know there have been signs of improvement this season. And was this not a good time to play Liverpool?It is often the case that it is the prompt for a sharp reality check. After all, nobody ever really knows which United will turn up. Here, it was the version that Amorim has craved, the one he has claimed has been ready to show itself on a regular basis.Slot concedes Liverpool face challenge after Manchester United’s Anfield winRead moreUnited had not won at Anfield for nine years. They had never previously recorded back-to-back league victories under Amorim. They chased the demons from their backs with a performance and result to offer the promise of better times.They rode their luck.Liverpoolhit the woodwork three times through the dangerous Cody Gakpo. And, in the 87th minute, before the eight that were added on for stoppages, Gakpo somehow blew a close-range header when unmarked in front of goal. That was the point at which Liverpool knew it would not be their day; their losing run in all competitions now extending to four.Minutes earlier, United had produced the moment that will stand the test of time. Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s early goal after a second-half surge from Liverpool and it felt as though the scene was set forthe championsto push for the winner.United had other ideas. Driven by the outstanding Matheus Cunha, they showed their character. And when Bruno Fernandes shaped a wonderful first-time volleyed cross from the left on the second phase of a United corner, there was Harry Maguire to head them in front. Remember this game last seasonwhich finished 2‑2when Maguire had lifted over a stoppage-time chance to win it? This time, he was the hero.View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo is mobbed by his teammates after opening the scoring inside 62 seconds.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAFor Liverpool, it added up to a third successive league defeat, a result that left them four points behind the league leaders, Arsenal. The situation is hardly drastic and yet it is clear that all is not well for Arne Slot and his expensively regeared team, the cohesion and conviction lacking.Virgil van Dijk, the captain, talked of how Liverpool were too rushed, their decision-making rash. It was also an eye-opener to see how open they were when they lost possession, how they allowed United to play, starting in the very first minute.Alexis Mac Allister had been poleaxed after jumping for a high ball in the middle of the field with Van Dijk and Mbeumo; the replays showed that Van Dijk caught him with a stray elbow while Mbeumo also seemed to leave something on him. United played quickly, Mbeumo jumping up to make a run in behind. It was Fernandes out to Amad Diallo, whose pass set up Mbeumo’s finish from a tight angle.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo scores Liverpool’s equaliser from close range.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersSlot cut an agitated figure in the early going. He watched the patch‑up operation on Mac Allister, which left the midfielder playing on in a rugby‑style scrum cap. How had it not been a foul on him? Slot was even more perplexed when Gakpo blasted over a cross in the 18th minute, which hit Diallo’s hand. The decision was that it was not in an unnatural position.The first half flew by, chances at both ends. Liverpool moved up through the gears to advertise the equaliser but United more than held their own. They were happy to play long and there was a confidence about their work on the ball, plenty of nice interchanges. Cunha, in particular, showed his personality in possession.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the prompt for a patch of pressure at the other end, United rueing a big miss by Fernandes: it was a cut‑back from Diallo and the captain’s shot from about 12 yards kissed the outside of the post.Giorgi Mamardashvili would drop a Cunha cross and he was almost punished by Mason Mount, while there was a vital tackle from the Liverpool goalkeeper to thwart Mbeumo after a loose Milos Kerkez pass. Mamardashvili then kept out Mount from distance.Back came Liverpool. Twice, Alexander Isak failed to finish before the interval, the second one the clear opportunity after a through-ball from Ibrahima Konaté. Isak was to the right of goal; Senne Lammens saved well with his feet. In between times, a Gakpo cross deflected off Fernandes and came back off the far post.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes jumps for joy after providing the assist for Harry Maguire’s winner.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesLiverpool pushed on after the second-half restart, Gakpo once again hitting the upright after a swerve inside and, with Slot turning the dial firmly towards attack with his substitutions, Salah lashed another chance wide.Liverpool deserved the goal that brought them parity. It was scruffy, United struggling to clear their lines and the final pass came from Federico Chiesa, one of the many forward‑thinking changes. Gakpo had a tap-in. Maguire, though, summoned the most stunning of responses.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Georgia’s Nika Egadze was third with 259.41.Simone Biles on ice: Ilia Malinin shows his only rival is perfection itself | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreA slight under-rotation on one quad was the only obvious flaw, but Malinin felt there was plenty left to polish.“I think I’ll be improving a lot more,” he said. “I think I can take away a lot from this competition. It was such fun and I’m really looking forward to the future season.”It extended Malinin’s unbeaten run to nearly two years since his last defeat, at the same event in 2023. Remarkably, he did not need to attempt his trademark quadruple axel, a jump only he has ever landed in competition.The Grand Prix de France, first of six events leading to December’s Final, serves as an early test for contenders ahead of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in February.There was cause for celebration for the home crowd as Olympic ice dance champion Guillaume Cizeron and his new partner Laurence Fournier Beaudry produced a captivating free dance to win gold at their first international competition together.Third after the rhythm dance despite a fall at the end of the programme, they climbed to victory thanks to a sweeping performance to the soundtrack of The Whale, scoring 133.02 in the free and 211.02 overall – 0.8 points ahead of Britain’s Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson (210.24).“It’s really heartwarming to be at home with this amazing crowd and this amazing partner,” Cizeron said. “We were really looking forward to doing our debut here and it couldn’t have gone better.”“There’s always apprehension, of course,” he added. “But I think that with experience and each other’s energy, we manage to let go and get into our characters and the magic of the moment.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Over a longer period, their home record is just three wins in 18 games, leaving Frank to face the line of questioning that stalked his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou.“It’s not that simple,” Frank said of Tottenham’s struggles at home. “We performed well against Burnley, Wolves and Villa, but not against Bournemouth. A clear draw became a defeat today. The fans were good, and helped with what they could. They would have loved a 3-0 win and the place rocking, but it wasn’t to be. We looked quite good, but lost 2-1 due to two top quality goals.”View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers celebrates after scoring Aston Villa’s first goal of the season.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersVilla in contrast are flying, with this hard-fought victory appearing to confirm their pre-international break revival could become permanent. After five successive wins in all competitions the misery of a disappointing,PSR-affected summerand slow start to the season seems like a distant memory.As Frank suggested the visitors’ goals were worthy of winning any game, with Rogers beating Guglielmo Vicario with a long-range curler from the edge of the area and Buendía capitalising on some quick-thinking from Matty Cash and Lucas Digne.While Buendía has been pivotal to Villa’s recent revival with goals in previouswins against Fulhamand Feyenoord, it is Rogers’ strike which may have long-term significance.The 23-year-old scored 14 times last season but began this campaign in the doldrums in a summer where he had been linked to Chelsea, so replicating his international form, after scoring forEngland against Wales, for Villa would be a huge boost for Unai Emery.The Spaniard also declared himself equally impressed with another goal-shy England star, Ollie Watkins, who gave Villa an extra attacking edge when he came off the bench for the final half hour.“Morgan is playing and scoring, but he’s helping the team for 90 minutes,” Emery said. “He has that capacity. He was always doing his task. He’s a hard worker. When you work you show your skill. Watkins didn’t score or assist, but he played fantastic for 30 minutes. They are both very important for us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amadou Onana could only clear Mathys Tel’s corner as far as the edge of the Villa penalty, from where Tel played the ball back out to Kudus on the left flank.Kudus’ cross found João Palhinha at the back post for the Portugal midfielder to head back across goal to Bentancur, who scored with a well-controlled half-volley from just inside the penalty area. Kudus thought he had doubled Tottenham’s lead two minutes later, but was offside after running on to Micky Van de Ven’s long through ball.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Bentancur gives Tottenham a first-half lead.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesVilla’s only attempt on goal in the opening half-hour was a shot that flashed past the far post from Matty Cash, whose every touch was booed in a legacy of his reckless challenge on Bentancur two years ago. The Polish international’s tenacity created a rare opening seven minutes before half-time, with his pressure on the ball creating a half chance for Rogers, who took full advantage to score.Rogers struck the ball well, but it beat Vicario in the middle of his goal and he looked faintly embarrassed as he collected it from the back of the net, one of his first touches of a hitherto quiet afternoon.Villa were more competitive in the second half, with Donyell Malen hitting the side-netting just before the hour, but their winner was still unexpected. A cleared corner fell on the halfway line to Cash, who showed great vision to attack the ball and play a thunderous half-volley to the right for Digne, who released Buendía. The Argentine cut in from the flank and beat Vicario to seal the points.Rogers and Buendía showed real quality in crucial moments in a manner which proved beyond Tottenham, who continue to be troubled by familiar failings.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He ended two ahead of a three-man group of Ireland’s Shane Lowry, England’s Alex Fitzpatrick and the South African Thriston Lawrence, who also made 65 – which included an eagle on the 14th.New Zealand’s Daniel Hillier had looked to also be in contention after going into the turn six-under for the day – only for a double-bogey seven on the par-five 14th to scupper his chances, with more dropped shots at the next and then again on 18. The Masters champion, Rory McIlroy, placed in a tie for 26th at 11 under, finishing with a final round of 71, which had two bogeys on the front nine and another at the 14th.Fleetwood, who rattled off four successive birdies from the seventh, was happy to get another long overdue individual tournament victory under his belt – and make the most of a special family moment.“I had said for all the good that has happened this year, a couple of things have disappointed me, that my DP World Tour sort of has, so another win feels great,” the Southport golfer said in an interview on the DP Tour website.View image in fullscreenEngland's Tommy Fleetwood savours his first DP World Tour win since January 2024.Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images“We were at home last week and we were driving the buggy.

But all day today, I had in my mind could I put myself in a position where I can actually make that moment happen?“It is just one of those little things, it means a lot to me. It means so much to me.

Cody Gakpo struck the woodwork three times and missed a gilt-edged opportunity to head home a second equaliser in the 87th minute. But having lost toCrystal Palace,Galatasaray,Chelseaand nowUnited, the Dutch coach conceded he has a job on his hands to end Liverpool’s damaging run.“As a manager you constantly face challenges,” said Slot. “When you start and you need to win games, when you go to a bigger club, when you are the successor of Jürgen Klopp and people are saying: ‘This is the biggest challenge you have ever faced.’ Now we have lost four times in a row and that is also a challenge. The life of a football manager is also an ongoing challenge.View image in fullscreenArne Slot gives tactical instructions to his players during Manchester United’s win at Anfield.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“But do we lose confidence? I can not see that yet because every game we’ve lost we were able to create in the second half an unbelievable amount of chances. If we can keep producing what we are doing and maybe do a few things a little bit better, then there is every reason to expect that we will win football games again. Of course there is also the part that, apart from the two goals we conceded, we conceded maybe two or three more chances. This is constantly the struggle we have when we are 1-0 down, then you need to take a bit more of a risk.”Slot felt the referee, Michael Oliver, should have stopped play before Bryan Mbeumo’s 62-second opener because of a head injury sustained by Alexis Mac Allister. The Liverpool midfielder required four stitches in a cut. But the head coach said: “The main thing I should do now is not complain at these kind of things. We should have done much better after Macca was on the floor but the health care of the players is important and if a player needs four stitches you would hope everyone understands he needed treatment. But we could have done better and that is not the reason we lost. The reason is we missed far too many chances to win a game of football.”Amorim said United’s spirit and composure was key to victory at Anfield, particularly after Gakpo levelled for Liverpool late on, but insisted the finest result of his turbulent reign would not change any targets for the season.The United head coach said: “I want you guys [the media] to continue with the narrative that you have so I will not increase the goal. What we need to do is try to win three games in a row now and forget about top four or top six. We already said we want to go to Europe. This doesn’t change nothing. We are the same team we were 90 minutes ago.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forces at the scene arrested nine suspects and detained 16 others for questioning.”A Maccabi statement read: “Following the police’s decision, it was determined that the Tel Aviv derby will not take place tonight.”It came after Maccabi supporterswere informedlast week that they would not be allowed to attend November’s Europa League game against Aston Villa in Birmingham.Birmingham’s safety advisory group – made up of local stakeholders, West Midlands police and event organisers – said the decision had been made due to a high risk of violence based on “current intelligence and previous incidents”.The decision caused political uproar, with the prime minister, Keir Starmer,condemning the moveon Thursday and several figures urging for the ban to be lifted.“This is the wrong decision. We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets,” he said. “The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”Ayoub Khan, the independent MP for Perry Barr in Birmingham, reiterated his opposition toMaccabi Tel Avivfans being allowed to travel in a post on X: “Shame on all those disgraceful politicians and news anchors that conflated this matter!“It was never about religion but everything to do about hooligans!

Juventus thought they had equalised in the 36th minute when Jonathan David slotted home from close range, but the Canadian’s effort was ruled out for offside in the buildup.‘Rashford is a role model for me’: Abu Kamara’s journey from Hull to La LigaRead moreEarly in the second half, Kempf required treatment for a cut to his forehead after an accidental clash with his teammate Jacobo Ramón but was able to continue with heavy strapping. Juventus continued to struggle and Paz doubled Como’s lead in the 79th minute with a brilliant solo effort on the break.The 21-year-old Argentinian cut inside from the right, gliding past Andrea Cambiaso before curling a left-footed strike beyond the visiting goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio. Victory moves Cesc Fàbregas’s side up to sixth in the table, above Juventus on goal difference.Paz has contributed to eight of Como’s nine league goals this season with four goals and four assists in seven matches, the most inSerie A. After the game, Fàbregas revealed he spoke to his former Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger, before the game.“I thank [Arsène] because at 16 he believed in me, just as I believe in Nico Paz, who is a champion,” Fàbregas told Dazn. “I’m very confident about his future because I can recognise when a player has the mindset to become a top player. If he continues like this, he can go wherever he wants.”Juventus, meanwhile, face a tough task to end their winless run in midweek – they go to the Bernabéu in the Champions League on Wednesday. They began the league season brightly but the goals have dried up since their 4-3 win over Inter last month.Tudor brought on the striker Dusan Vlahovic for the midfielder Manuel Locatelli in the 77th minute, two minutes before Paz’s goal. “I don’t know who else plays with two strikers and two wingers, probably only us,” Tudor said.“We believed this setup was the best for the team and I think it was the right choice regardless of the result … but against a side like Como you have to run a lot.

Sean Dyche and Roberto Mancini are among the candidates who have been sounded out.Nottingham Forest approach Dyche and Mancini after Postecoglou sackedRead moreMarinakis has turned his interest to Silva, whose buyout clause has been reported to be as high as £13m. Forest recognise it would cost to extract Silva from his contract at Craven Cottage, which expires at the end of the season.Forest are mindful of financial restrictions, having sacked two managers this season and furnished the squad at a cost of about £200m this summer, but Marinakis is a longstanding admirer of Silva having appointed him at Olympiakos, where the Portuguese coach won the Greek Super League in 2015-16.Crucially, Silva is thought to be interested in the Forest job, with the club among the favourites to win the Europa League at the outset. The 48-year-old coach has been atFulhamsince 2021 and in England has also managed Everton, Watford and Hull in the Premier League.Silva was linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2023, only to sign a three-year deal keeping him at Craven Cottage until 2026.There was unrest in the summer of this year as Fulham were slow in the transfer market: only the Brazilian forward Kevin arriving as a permanent outfield signing, with two loans in Samuel Chukwueze from Milan and Jonah Kusi-Asare, a teenager from Bayern Munich who is yet to make a first-team appearance.Silva would be joining his fifth Premier League club, should he depart Fulham, where he has established the London club in the top division; this is their fourth in succession after promotion was secured from the Championship in 2021-22.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that was what he endured as he led his players off the Kenilworth Road pitch past a seething Luton fanbase, who two years ago were loving life in the Premier League.A 2-0 defeat by Nigel Clough’s Mansfield was no disgrace, a finely balanced contest decided by the chances Luton failed to take and those that Mansfield did. It was a loss that left the hosts 14th inLeague One, eight points off the playoff spots, but Clough was positive about Luton’s prospects of turning things around under Wilshere, and surely that is correct. It would be wrong, though, not to note that there was an eerie note of fatalism in the ground, even as an apparent new era was only just getting under way.‘A full-circle moment for me’: Jack Wilshere confirmed as Luton managerRead moreWilshere said the end of the match would not tarnish his memory of the beginning, when the former Arsenal star was serenaded on to the pitch with chants of “Super Jack” and the crowd were on their feet applauding. “It was probably one of the best moments of my career,” he said. “I felt the love, I heard the noise.” He also put the result down to technical errors, albeit mistakes that allowed a longstanding lack of confidence among his players to come to the surface.“When you come from the Premier League straight to League One in two seasons, there obviously is something [going on],” he said. “So we knew that we have to find out what it is, and I think we know what it is. We just have to find ways of being able to give the players more confidence. I’ve said to them before, I want them to really feel the belief I have in them, and that doesn’t change.”Quick GuideLeague One roundup: Salech on target as Cardiff take top spotShowReyes Cleary's stunning goal forBarnsleyfrom inside his own half was the highlight of a 2-2 draw atBradford,with the Bantams manager, Graham Alexander, calling the 60-yard strike \"world class\".Patrick Kelly earned the visitors a point, cancelling out goals from Antoni Sarcevic and Stephen Humphrys.Yousef Salech firedCardiffto the top of the League One table in a 2-1 home win overReading. Lewis Wing had given the hosts the lead, but after Omari Kellyman had pegged them back, Salech struck to secure the three points. That was enough to ease the Welsh side aboveStevenage, who lost 1-0 atLincolnafter Rob Street's first league goal for the Imps.AFC Wimbledonare level on 25 points with Stevenage and Bradford after a 2-1 win atPlymouththanks to goals from Omar Bugiel and Marcus Browne, as areStockport, who beatExeter1-0 with Nathan Lowe the scorer.Jack Wilshere's first game asLutonmanager ended in defeat as his side went down 2-0 at home toMansfield. Hatters striker Nahki Wells saw a first-half penalty saved before Rhys Oates and, from the spot, Tyler Roberts struck for the visitors.Northampton'sSam Hoskins was also successful from 12 yards in a 2-1 win atDoncaster, who had taken the lead through Ben Close before Ethan Wheatley levelled.Archie Collins handedPeterborougha 1-0 win at fellow strugglersBurtondespite Tom Lees' late red card, and Sam Nombe wasRotherham'smatch winner as they beatLeyton Orientby the same scoreline.Maleace Asamoah firedWiganto a 1-0 home victory overPort Valedespite playing the second half with 10 men after Dara Costelloe's dismissal, while managerlessBlackpoolsurrendered two points at home toWycombewhen Jack Grimmer cancelled out Ashley Fletcher's goal in the 12th minute of stoppage time.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The link between a team and its fans is almost as crucial to a club’s success as that between players and coach. When one side is at odds with the other, bad results often follow. Increasingly in the modern era, however, fans and players seem to mirror each other. That lack of confidence and belief Wilshere noted in his players, was also clearly detectable among the support.Luton recorded their biggest crowd of the season, at 11,784, but the atmosphere in the town and around the ground was subdued. Among the crowd was Elk Walsh, from Adelaide, who had followed Luton all of his life because of his parents’ affiliations and was now making his first trip to the ground. Walsh described himself as “eternally hopeful” in the manner you would expect from someone who had flown across the world to watch lower league football. But he also described Wilshere’s appointment as “spinning the wheel” and was still upset at the club’s decision to dispense with the stalwart midfielder Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu in the summer. More frustrating still, he said, was his team’s failure to score goals: “I feel like we’re never going to score sometimes, like we’re battling against an invisible force and I don’t understand why.”View image in fullscreenLuton fans display a welcome message to the new manager, Jack Wilshere, and the assistant, Chris Powell, at the start of the match.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThat invisible force was present on the Kenilworth Road pitch again as Luton emerged from a sticky opening period to take control of the game, but never scored. Their best player, Jordan Clark, who sat in Wilshere’s old No 10 position and impressed with some delicate touches, saw a beautiful effort clawed out of a top corner by Mansfield’s Liam Roberts on the half-hour. Almost immediately after he won a penalty with a slaloming run, only for Nahki Wells to strike a tame effort into Roberts’s midriff. Seven minutes after that, Wells misplaced a pass awfully in the centre of the field and theMansfieldstriker Rhys Oates was able to hit an effort almost identical to Clark’s, albeit with the one key difference that it flew into the back of the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An ungainly handball on the hour led to a penalty which Tyler Roberts rolled past Josh Keeley, and Mansfield eased their way to victory. Luton, meanwhile, struggled to make a pass or take a decision that wasn’t the wrong one.How do a club and the town they belong to pull themselves out of a spiral of doom and gloom? For Wilshere it is a case of sticking together, learning lessons and building confidence. For Clough, who had taken charge of a remarkable 1,544th game as a manager and has Mansfield ninth, there is also a question of expectations and perspective.“We’re at Mansfield enjoying life in League One,” he said. “We’ve been in it for a season and a bit now, the first time that the club has stayed in the division for 35 years. So we’re enjoying ourselves and if we get anywhere near the top six, it’ll be a major bonus. Luton are expected to be in that top six, and it’s a different thing to deal with. Completely different.”Explore more on these topicsLuton TownJack WilshereMansfieldLeague OnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Neither McLaren driver has won since Zandvoort five races ago – after which Verstappen was 104 points off the lead.Piastri, a former F2 and F3 champion, acknowledges the need to turn around his form but remains happy with his position with five rounds remaining and 141 points to fight for.“I’d still rather be where I am than the other two,” Piastri said. “Definitely Max and Red Bull have found a lot of pace since the summer break as well. We saw flashes of it at the start of the year, but it’s been consistent since then.“I’ve been in fights that were as close or at this point even closer than what they are now. So I’ve got the evidence for myself that things can still turn out well and I still fully believe that I can win the championship.“This weekend has obviously been tough and the gap has come down a little bit in the last few weekends.”Pole-sitter Verstappen completed a perfect weekendat the Circuit of the Americas, having alsowon Saturday’s sprint from pole, by easing to a lights-to-flag win byalmost eight seconds from Norris.Norris’ hopes of victory were undone by losing out to Charles Leclerc at the start and he had to overcome a race-long duel with the Ferrari driver to clinch second in the closing stages.What has appeared a two-way title fight for the entire season is now a three-way battle, but Piastri remains relaxed aboutthe threat of Verstappen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following a dominant win in Austin the Red Bull driver was adamant he could still yet take his fifth title and was enthused at the chance to do so.Verstappen cruises to victory in F1 US Grand Prix to pile pressure on McLarenRead moreVerstappen won with a flawless drive from pole to flagat the Circuit of the Americas, and in so doing narrowed the gap to the championship leader Oscar Piastri to 40 points. In what is now a three-way title battle Lando Norris, who took second place, is just14 points off Piastri.Until this weekend Verstappen has been very circumspect in assessing his chances of competing for the title, despite winning two of the previous three races. However, after the ­victory in Austin he acknowledged that it was now game-on.“For sure, the chance is there,” he said. “We just need to try and deliver these kinds of weekends now till the end. So, just try whatever we can. I think it’s exciting, and I’m just very excited to the end.”The Red Bull has proved to be increasingly competitive in recent races and indeed had the edge on the previously dominant McLaren, but Verstappen also conceded that he and the team would have to be at the top of their game to overcome the deficit in the five remaining meetings.‘Rather be where I am’: Oscar Piastri remains confident in F1 title hopes as lead narrowsRead more“I know that we need to be perfect till the end to have a chance, so that’s what we just need to focus on,” he said. “It’s super close and just attention to detail will make the difference. Trying to get the best setup on the car every weekend and then try and not make mistakes, so that’s what we’ll try to do.”Piastri, who has seen his 104 point-lead over Verstappen more than halved in the last four meetings remained bullish that he could still close out the championship despite what is now a ferociously close fought battle.“I’d still rather be where I am than the other two,” he said.“I’ve been in fights that were as close or at this point even closer than what they are now. So I’ve got the evidence for myself that things can still turn out well and I still fully believe that I can win the championship.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Borthwick has immediately responded to calls to involve a player who evidently possesses the qualities to thrive at Test level, despite the headline-grabbing performance over the weekend being the first time he started for Saracens in the Prem. The 6ft 5in wing has represented his country at under-18 and under-20 level.The former England captainOwen Farrell is overlooked by Borthwick, as expected, despite being available again after his return from a spell with Racing 92 and the absence due to injury of the inside-centre Seb Atkinson of Gloucester. Fraser Dingwall, Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade are among Borthwick’s midfield options – with Tommy Freeman of Northampton also aiming to continue hisdesired switch to outside-centre.Slade orchestrated Exeter’s dominant 38-0 win against Exeter on Sunday, scoring 23 points, while Harlequins’ Chandler Cunninham-South is included by Borthwick despite going off injured at Sandy Park.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earlier Heather Knight’s third ODI century in her 300th international set up the exciting finale.India were left needing 27 off 18 but, defying England’s recent reputation of falling to pieces under pressure, Linsey Smith conceded just four runs from the 48th over and then defended 14 off the last to ensure England came out on top.England beat India by four runs to book World Cup semi-final spot – as it happenedRead moreSmith had earlier taken the crucial wicket of Smriti Mandhana, whose 88 from 94 balls looked to be taking India to a straightforward victory until, hobbling with cramp caused by the sweltering humidity, the Indian vice-captain sent a catch into the hands of long-off with 55 runs still needed.Still, with six wickets in hand, the match was India’s to lose, and their clutch all-rounder Deepti Sharma hit just enough boundaries to keep them in touch, bringing up her half-century in the 46th over. But Richa Ghosh holed out to Knight at cover the very next ball, before Deepti herself slog-swept into the hands of Sophia Dunkley at deep midwicket in the next over, leaving too much for Amanjot Kaur and Sneh Rana to do.Tournament hosts India are now fighting it out with New Zealand for the fourth semi-final spot and will need to beat the White Ferns on Thursday – plus avoid defeat in their final match against Bangladesh – to be sure of qualification.View image in fullscreenNat Sciver-Brunt hugs teammate Emma Lamb after England’s win.Photograph: Matt Roberts-ICC/ICC/Getty Images“I can’t quite comprehend what’s just happened,” Smith told Sky Sports. “The fight that we showed at the end there was amazing. For me, it was trying not to overcomplicate it too much. I’ve been practising that death plan all week, trying to bowl a tight line into their heels.”With both teams still pushing for a place in the semi-finals, this was the tournament’s standout crunch match to date, and the capacity Indore crowd were treated to a nailbiter – albeit not the result they had been hoping for.Knight’s century enabled England to post 288 after choosing to bat first. “I was desperate to put in a statement performance on a big-cap occasion and I’m really pleased that I did that,” Knight told Sky Sports.View image in fullscreenSmriti Mandhana’s 94-ball 88 proved to be in vain.Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/MB Media/Getty ImagesIt was a formidable total that would have required India to pull off a record run-chase – but nonetheless there was a feeling that England had undershot on a very good batting track. Knight’s run-out in the 45th over, wrongly chancing the arm of Amanjot Kaur at deep square leg, proved to be the catalyst for a very on-brand collapse: England lost five wickets for 31 runs and what should have been a 300+ total crashed and burned. The head coach, Charlotte Edwards, who had chosen to keep the faith with her established lineup despite unconvincing showings against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, might well have raised an eyebrow in the dugout.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Capsey dismissal was a smart piece of cricket to a poor piece of decision-making: Deepti spotted the batter’s pre-meditated reverse, adjusted her line, and tangled her up so much that the ball ended up in the hands of cover.Earlier, India’s swing-queen Renuka Singh Thakur – brought back into the XI for this match due to England’s recent struggles against new-ball movement – had been unlucky to finish wicketless after a hooping five-over opening spell. Instead, it was Deepti who broke England’s 73-run opening partnership in her first over of the day, bowling Tammy Beaumont round her legs. However, England’s tormentor with the ball could not quite finish the job with the bat.View image in fullscreenEngland celebrate after the wicket of India’s Deepti Sharma.Photograph: Sahiba Chawdhary/Reuters“I’m so, so happy,” a relieved Nat Sciver-Brunt told Sky Sports. “We haven’t really been tested towards the end of our innings with the ball. Everyone showed how calm they were and were really clear in what they wanted to do.”Meanwhile her opposite number, Harmanpreet Kaur, will be as much under pressure as ever, despite her own run-a-ball 70 in Indore. India once again failed to use the DRS system effectively: twice in the England innings they reviewed on-field decisions which replays showed were drifting down leg, taking their tally of unsuccessful reviews up to eight. It might not have cost them the match against England but if the trend continues it could yet cost them a place in the semi-finals.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupIndia women's cricket teamEngland women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The seller’s reviews were all five-star, and she trusted in the buyer-protection policy should something go wrong.Sold new, an Airwrap costs between £400 and £480, but Maheen did not suspect anything was amiss. “I had used Vinted many times and it was simple and straightforward. Nothing had ever gone wrong,” she says.However, after two weeks – and about four uses – she spotted a problem. “I noticed the wire began to smoke and the product seemed unsafe,” she says. Maheen contacted Dyson and was told to send in the Airwrap.Its response confirmed her fears. “I got a letter from [Dyson] confirming the product was counterfeit. It was unsafe and they wouldn’t return it to me,” she says.Maheen’s experience is far from unique. Almost two-fifths (37%) of Britons have been scammed while buying or selling on online marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay and Vinted, according to research from the credit reference agency Experian.Victims of this type of crime tend to skew younger, with more than half of gen Z (58%) telling researchers they had been scammed compared with just 16% of people over the age of 55.For almost a quarter of people losses were in the region of £51 to £100, while 13% had lost more than £250. A small number said the scam had cost them between £501 and £1,000.The most common type of scam respondents encountered – being sent fake or counterfeit products (34%) – is the one Maheen fell prey to. Next up was requests to pay off-platform (31%), and items never arriving after payment (22%).What the scam looks likeIt looks like the legitimate item and the description suggests it is – more than half of scam victims (51%) told Experian they only realised they had been scammed once their item was delivered and turned out to be fake, or failed to arrive.Photos may be low resolution or look too good – like a catalogue photo – because they have been taken from other websites.The price will be less than you would expect and if you start asking questions the seller may try to rush you into a purchase and may ask you to pay them outside the Vinted platform.What to doAlways review a seller’s profile closely and read customer reviews before purchasing an item on a marketplace. Try to obtain as much information about the product as possible before buying – for instance, ask the seller to send a video of the product. To protect yourself, stick to secure payment methods and avoid bank transfers.If the worst happens, report the incident to the marketplace and ask for a refund. They may ask for screenshots of messages and the details of the seller or buyer, plus any bank transfer details.Maheen was outside the Vinted two-day buyer protection window, but assumed she would get her money back because the product was dangerous. However, she found that it “was really hard to talk to someone”.She says: “It felt like I was talking to a bot.”With Guardian Money’s help, she has now got her money back.A Vinted spokesperson said: “The vast majority of transactions on Vinted take place without issue, and our teams work hard to ensure a smooth trading experience for all our Vinted members.“When a dispute does occur between a buyer and a seller, we will mediate, working closely with our delivery partners and potentially asking for additional information or evidence, before issuing a final decision.”If appealing to the marketplace directly goes nowhere, there are other things you can do.If you used a debit card ask your bank to make a chargeback claim. Alternatively, if you paid by credit card, try a section 75 claim – this is only an option if you have spent more than £100. If you paid by bank transfer it is more complicated, but you may be entitled to a refund under newfraud refund protections.Explore more on these topicsE-commerceScam watchScamsAppsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Recent pop-ups include experiences linked to Minecraft, Jurassic World and Squid Game.As big money has rolled into the sector, so too has a desire from companies to rely on solid gold intellectual property to bring in the crowds – with mixed results.“We’ve looked into a lot of immersive experiences,” says Hollywood financier Chip Seelig, who has backed Come Alive!, the London-based theatre experience inspired by the hit 2017 film The Greatest Showman. “While even [prime] intellectual property doesn’t guarantee a success, we find it very hard to attract audiences without recognisable global IP. So we think it is a critical item to success.”Seelig’s TSG Entertainment co-financed and produced the Hollywood blockbuster. Even before its release he had spied the opportunity to bring it to life in a real-world experience, and struck a rights deal with 20th Century Fox, now owned by Disney.Disney is also launching its own more traditional theatre-style version of The Greatest Showman in a world premiere at the Bristol Hippodrome in the spring.While shows such as Come Alive! have proved a success – it recently extended its run at the former home of the BBC Earth Experience for another year – costs involved in real-world productions mean that commercial success is far from certain.The plight of traditional theatre provides a cautionary tale for the booming immersive entertainment sector.A recent analysis by the New York Times found that none of the 18 commercial musicals that opened on Broadway last season have yet made a profit, and at least three with $20m (£15m) budgets closed less than four months after opening.And since the end of the pandemic, only three of 46 new musicals – those not based on existing, familiar IP – have become profitable to date.Another significant issue facing the relatively nascent experiential industry is that a gold rush mentality has resulted in an increasing number of operators launching events that fail to live up to expectations.Last year, an unofficial event called The Detroit Bridgerton Themed Ball, which charged ticket holders between $150 and $1,000,went viral for all the wrong reasonswhen attendees were shown sitting on the floor, eating KitKats and watching a solitary pole dancer as the evening’s entertainment.Similarly, Glasgow’s shoddy Willy Wonka experience, billed as a “celebration of chocolate in all its delightful forms”,made global newswhen police were called after families who had spent hundreds of pounds on the event that left children in tears became furious, and it was abruptly cancelled.The most recent production tocome in for criticismis Elvis Evolution, which opened in London’s ExCel centre in the summer with tickets priced from £75 to £300. It was initially advertised as a concert experience that would use “AI and feature holographic projections of the star”.An initial promise of a “lifesized digital Elvis who will perform iconic moments in musical history on a UK stage for the first time” ended up with AI being used to “upscale archive footage”.Layered Reality, which created the show, said it clarified there would be no hologram by the time tickets went on sale and had been “overwhelmed” by praise from attendees.One attender said the experience was “absolutely atrocious” and one VIP ticket holder said it was a “shambles from start to finish”.While some fans enjoyed it – one said she“loved every minute”– reviews have been mixed. The Telegraph gave it one star and even Time Out, which was more positive with a three-star rating, alluded to a“noticeable amount of booing”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are a lot of smart people realising experiential is where the present is meeting the future.”He adds: “Netflix, Apple, Amazon and others have done a phenomenal job of raising the bar of quality and quantity of content coming into your living room.

If only the supreme court would do the sameSun 19 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTShareAt a time when Donald Trump has declared war on the truth, it was heartening to see two federal district court judges have the courage to call out Trump’s rationales for sending troops to Portland and Chicago as blatantly untrue – one of the judges said that rationale was“untethered to the facts”.And at a time when the United States supreme court has been so craven and deferential toward Trump, it was gratifying to see that these lower court judges had the guts to do what the high court’s six conservative justices have been utterly unwilling to do: speak truth to Trump’s power.As Trump seeks to deploy the national guard to city after city, he has peddled untruth after untruth about Portland and Chicago. In late September, he said Portland was“war-ravaged”, with Ice facilities “under siege” from“domestic terrorists”. Later he said Portland was“burning to the ground” and has “insurrectionists all over the place”. Trump likened Chicago to“a war zone” and said federal facilities in Illinois “have come undercoordinated assault by violent groups”.While legal tradition calls for judges to show considerable deference to the president, it would be foolish and dangerous for judges to give much deference to Trump’s statements, considering how spectacularly dishonest he is. Trump still maintains that the2020 election was stolen.He has said thatUkraine began its warwith Russia. He said thatnoise from windmills causes cancerand that the nation’s social security database lists3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. The Washington Post found that Trump made an outrageously high30,573 false or misleading statementsin his first four years as president.After Trump sought to deploy national guard troops to Portland, state and city officials went to federal court to seek an emergency order to block Trump’s plans. District court judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee to the federal bench, wrote that judges owe “a great level of deference” to presidents, but she was nonetheless wise enough and brave enough not to swallow everything Trump said about the situation in Portland. Using courageous, clear-eyed language, Immergut wrote that “‘a great level of deference’ isnot equivalent to ignoring factson the ground”.On 27 September, Trump sent a directive ordering Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, to provide “all necessary Troopsto protect War ravaged Portland”. In assessing the case,Judge Immergut explainedthat under federal law, sending in the guard would be legal only if there were a danger of invasion, rebellion or other disorder that regular law-enforcement forces couldn’t handle. Rejecting Trump’s efforts to create an alternate reality to justify using troops,Immergut wrote that there was “substantial evidencethat the protests at the Portland Ice facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days – or even weeks – leading up to the President’s directive.”She noted that the day before Trump issued his directive, law enforcement in Portland had “observed approximately eight to 15 people at any given time out front of Ice. Mostlysitting in lawn chairsand walking around. Energy was low, minimal activity” – far from a “war-ravaged” city with “domestic terrorists”. Immergut granted a temporary order blocking Trump’s efforts to send in the Guard, concluding that his justification for doing so “wassimply untethered to the facts”.In a slap at Trump, Immergut also wrote that his directive to Hegseth was “not ‘conceived in good faith’”. Noting that the US has a long “tradition of resistance to government overreach” and “military intrusion into civil affairs,” she warned of Trump’s assault on “this historical tradition,” which “boils down to a simple proposition:this is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law.”(On Wednesday,Immergut extended the temporary block on troopswhile the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit weighs lifting one of her orders.)When Trump sought to send the national guard to Chicago, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago sued to stop him, and another courageous district court judge, April Perry,blocked Trump’s militaristic muscle-flexing. In seeking to justify the deployment, Trump asserted that Chicago was “like a war zone”, but Judge Perry found there was no evidence that order couldn’t be maintained with just regular forces, ie without the national guard.Like Immergut, Perry was courageous and clear-eyed in calling out Trump and his administration for their lack of credibility. “I simply cannot credit [the Trump administration’s] declarationsto the extent they contradict state and local law enforcement,” Perry said from the bench. “DHS’s [the Department of Homeland Security’s] perception of events are simply unreliable.”Perry added: “I have seenno credible evidence that there is danger of rebellionin the state of Illinois … Deportations are up. Arrests are up … The courthouse remains open and always has …There is no evidencethat the president is unable, with the regular forces, to execute the laws of the United States.” (On October 16, a three-judge appellate panelupheld Perry’s order, saying: “The facts do not justify the president’s actions in Illinois.” Referring to the often tense protests at Ice facilities, the panel added: “Political opposition is not rebellion.”Everyone who believes in democracy should thank these two judges for refusing to accept Trump’s concocted rationales for deploying troops as part of his effort to show how powerful he is, to intimidate blue cities and to normalize the use of troops across the US.If only the supreme court’s six-person conservative supermajority was as willing to stand up to Trump’s false claims. Ever since Trump returned to office, the supermajority has ruled repeatedly in his favor, often acting as if Trump is a benign, truth-telling president acting in good faith to comply with the law. The conservative justices seem blind to the reality that Trump is the most authoritarian-minded president in US hist0ry, one for whom district court judges felt the need to issueover 180 orders – an extraordinary number – blocking or temporarily pausingTrump’s actions because they deemed those actions unlawful.It’s past time for the supreme court to be far more clear-eyed and less deferential toward Trump. In a case in which the Trump administration ordered massive Department of Education layoffs, the court unfortunately gave agreen light to those layoffs, which went far to gut the department. The court seemed inexplicably blind to the facts, namely Trump’s publicly-stateddesire to eliminate an agencythat Congress had created.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And in a case involving deportations, the justices should laugh out of court Trump’s patently false claim that members of the Tren de Aragua gang from Venezuela constitute a “predatory incursion againstthe territory of the United States”.Far too often the conservative supermajority has treated Trump like an innocent lamb as it has acceded to his power-grabs – most notably, his efforts to fire officials from independent agencies and to seize more and more of Congress’s spending powers. My advice to the supermajority: if you, with your eagerness to embrace the widely challengedunitary executive theory, want to cede more executive power to presidents, then do it under a cautious, law-abiding president such as George HW Bush or Jimmy Carter – and not under a norm-smashing egomaniac seeking to grab as much power as he can.TheTrump administrationhas appealed the Chicago case to the supreme court; the high court may well hear the Portland case as well. If the conservative supermajority defers to Trump, accepts his “untethered” claims about a supposed emergency situation and allows troops to be sent in, that will dangerously open the door to Trump sending troops into any and every city he wants. And that will be a very big step toward Trump bringing martial law to city after city and state after state.Millions of us keep waiting and waiting for Chief Justice John Roberts and the five other conservative justices to do far more to preserve our seriously endangered democracy and far less to grant more power to our seriously authoritarian president.As unflinching truth seekers and truth tellers, Judges Immergut and Perry are model jurists that the supreme court and the rest of the judiciary should follow.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS justice systemOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS supreme courtChicagoPortlandcommentShareReuse this content"

With fiscal disobedienceEric ReinhartBy holding back federal tax revenues, Democratic governors can turn a one-sided assault into a constitutional showdownSun 19 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 16.29 EDTShareAgainstIllinois governor JB Pritzker’s objections, Donald Trump’s Pentagon has ordered hundreds of national guard troops to join his regime’sassault on Chicago communities. Trump subsequently called for Brandon Johnson, Chicago’s mayor, and Pritzkerto be jailedfor not supporting his agenda. These are simply the latest steps in Trump’s plan not to govern as the president of all Americans but to rule as the dictatorial head of a punitive factional state. Federal funding to Democratic cities is beingslashed through executive maneuvers; the justice department is conductingpolitically targeted investigations and arrests; and the military is being deployed to intimidate fellow citizens. Los Angeles, Portland, my home town of Chicago and other cities have been cast as enemies to be subdued, not communities to be served.Thisweaponization of federal powerrepresents a sharp break with constitutional tradition. It’s not merely ideological hostility; it is economic coercion and the exercise of violence in service of a president’s whim. The Trump regime is selectively starving Democratic jurisdictions of federal funds, even as their residents continue to pay billions in federal taxes, with blue statesaccounting for over 60%of the federal government’s revenue. We are being compelled to subsidize our own political subjugation.As the anthropologist Janet Roitman argued in herstudy of taxation and sovereigntyin central Africa, acts of “fiscal disobedience” emerge not simply as refusals to pay but as political interventions that expose ruptures in the reciprocal obligations underlying fiscal authority. Taxation is never merely technical. It is the material expression of political belonging and shared obligation. When the state weaponizes fiscal power against certain communities while continuing to demand unquestioned revenue from them, it undermines its own claim to legitimate authority. In such contexts, withholding or conditionally redirecting tax flows can become a way to re-politicize the fiscal relationship. It makes explicit that the state has already broken the social contract. Blue states today occupy precisely this position: forced to fund a federal government that is actively targeting them, their residents and their institutions.Faced with this reality, Democratic governors need more than legal complaints and rhetorical protest. They need fiscal strategies of resistance commensurate with the scale of the attack. And one of the most provocative – and potentially powerful – ideas available is the creation of state-administered escrow accounts, or “in trust” funds, to temporarily hold federal tax revenues until the federal government upholds its constitutional obligations and withdraws its authoritarian threats.This may sound radical, but it is less secessionist than it may at first appear. It would not involve refusing to pay federal taxes outright, which would open individual taxpayers to prosecution. Instead, the state would act as a temporary custodian, receiving payments from residents and businesses equal to their federal tax liabilities, holding them in trust for the federal government, and releasing them only when certain constitutional conditions are met – such as the partisan cessation of federal defunding and the withdrawal of military deployments unauthorized by targeted states.Such a maneuver would constitute a form of civil disobedience by a state, legally risky and certain to entail confrontation. But Democratic cities and states, progressive non-profits, universities, non-white immigrants, and public health institutionsare already facing direct conflict with Trump’s government. This strategy would reset the terms of the conflict and reclaim power against an increasingly brazen Trump regime. It would also underline for everyone the authoritarian, violent nature of the federal government’s tactics rather than allowing them to proceed underthe thin guise of “law and order”, as Trump leverages hiscontrol over legal systemsto wage war against his personal enemies. It would transform what is now a one-sided assault into a constitutional struggle.How it could workStates could establish this system through legislation to create a tax receivership fund, explicitly designated as a trust account for federal tax liabilities. Residents and businesses would make payments into this account instead of directly to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The state would acknowledge these payments as received on behalf of the federal government, and pledge to remit them in full once specific, legally defined conditions were met – say, the restoration ofsuspended federal fundingand reversal of other punitive actions that violate constitutional guarantees.Importantly, this scheme does not purport to nullify federal taxes or claim state sovereignty over them. It functions as a conditional remittance mechanism, akin to an escrow arrangement in contract law. Of course, the Trump-controlled IRS, which has already beenweaponized by the regime, would not quietly accept this. It would likely treat payments into the state trust as non-payment and impose penalties. Legal challenges would ensue. But that is precisely the point: to force a constitutional confrontation over whether the federal government can target states for political punishment while continuing to demand unquestioned fiscal obedience.For such a strategy to work, it cannot be the isolated action of a single state. A state acting alone could be punished, scapegoated, or financially squeezed into submission. But if multiple states act simultaneously, they can transform isolated legal defiance into a coordinated assertion of constitutional co-sovereignty.Here, article I, section 10 of the constitution could offer an eventual tool: interstate compacts. These are agreements between states – subject to congressional consent, and thus not likely legally viable until and unless Democrats win back congressional majorities – that allow them to formally coordinate policy, pool resources, and create collective governance structures. With or without congressional approval, blue states could form a “fiscal sovereignty compact” to coordinate the legal, fiscal, and political strategies involved in holding federal taxes in trust. It could standardize escrow mechanisms across member states, ensuring legal coherence and shared administrative capacity; create a pooled legal defense fund to support court battles; coordinate triggers for releasing funds, so that the federal government faces a unified set of demands; and protect against selective federal retaliation by presenting a united front representing tens of millions of residents and trillions in economic output.This compact would not need to involve all blue states to be effective. A coalition of economically powerful states – such as California, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Washington – could represent a staggering share of federal revenue. If even a portion of federal tax remittances from these states were held in trust, the federal government would face not an isolated legal challenge but substantial fiscal obstacles to its current belligerence.Building an anti-fascist federalismTrump’s use of the federal government to punish political enemies represents an authoritarian turn in American governance. It betrays the basic premise of federalism – that states are coequal entities within a constitutional framework, not mere provinces under imperial command – that was the supposed cornerstone of the Republican party before it sold what little soul it had to a conman. Lawsuits and press conferences are inadequate responses to this kind of assault. What’s needed are mechanisms that translate state and citizen dissent into material leverage. Escrow accounts, when deployed through a coordinated strategy, do precisely this: they turn the flow of money, the lifeblood of federal power, into the explicit site of political struggle.Such a move could have wide-rippling political effects. It would give residents a concrete way to participate in opposing the Trump regime, transforming legal disputes into collective political action. It would also force the supreme court, which isincreasingly aligning itself with Trumpagainst the constitution, to directly confront fundamental questions about the balance of state and federal power. Given the corruption of the courts, courtroom victory is neither the expectation nor the point in this strategy; it is instead to use the law to draw clear constitutional and fiscal battle lines – to make states active protagonists rather than passive targets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

They are not wrong to note the risks. Under current federal tax law, states have no role in federal revenue collection. Courts might enjoin such efforts quickly. Administratively, state governments would need to build new fiscal infrastructure to receive and track payments. And Trump will seize on any opportunity to paint blue states as “insurrectionists” who must be violently crushed – but the regime is already inventing fictions to justify this regardless of on-the-ground realities.Acknowledging risks is not the same as accepting them as decisive. The legal barriers to fiscal disobedience are formidable in part because the federal government has never before faced coordinated, large-scale challenges of this kind from wealthy states representing a majority of national tax revenue. The courtsare not mechanical; they arepolitical actorsthat respond to the balance of power and the perceived legitimacy of claims. Even if states ultimately lose in court, the process itself would publicly expose the authoritarian abuse of fiscal powers,force constitutional confrontationrather than quiet capitulation, and potentially reshape the political terrain.As is evident from Chicago – where I am writing this with Black Hawk helicopters flying overhead night and day and where my friends, patients, elected representatives, and neighbors are being assaultedin their homes,in hospitals, andon the streetsby federal agents acting with total disregard for either reality or legality – a rapidescalation of political violencein America is well under way. The Trump regime has made clear that it will continue to expand its campaign of violence with total impunity if we do not respond. In this context, refusing to counter fascism because retaliation might follow is not prudence; it is surrender.State-administered escrow accounts will not solve the crisis of American democracy, but they could help shift the terrain of struggle away from unilateral federal domination and toward a contested, negotiated, and coordinatedanti-fascist federalismmuch better equipped to contest the destruction of US democracy.Trump is breaking the outer limits of the constitutional order and bending law to his advantage. It’s time for blue states to do the same.What’s giving me hope nowAlthough I’ve written above about large-scale strategy, it is small everyday acts of care between neighbors and co-workers seeking to protect one another within my Chicago community that give me confidence fascism will not consume us. I collaborate with local mutual aid and organizing collectives – such as theCHAAD Project, which supports vulnerable Chicago bar and restaurant workers – to remember that genuine change in society arises from giving and receiving care, and sharing joy and hospitality, with those around you. It is only from that basis that collective ethical and political life can acquire power great enough to topple fascism – and to replace it with a genuine democracy that fosters difference rather than seeking to annihilate it.Eric Reinhartis a political anthropologist, psychiatrist, and psychoanalystExplore more on these topicsUS politicsFighting BackDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS taxationcommentShareReuse this content"

In both, I learned the value of the quiet rituals observed while no one is watchingSun 19 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 18.39 EDTShareWhen I was leaving London for Melbourne, my eldest sister-in-law told her kids not to forget the “tradition” – to throw a bowl of water behind me as I stepped out the door. Just a small splash on the ground, a gesture older than borders. “La har azaab po aman se,” she whispered in Pashto under her breath – may all hardship stay away from you. The little ones giggled and waved their goodbyes as they spilled the water, somewhere between shy and amused.My mother used to do this too, back in Afghanistan. Every time I left for a journey, especially international ones, she’d quietly follow me to the gate with a bowl of water, whispering prayers I couldn’t always hear. But this moment, between two western cities, with children growing up in a world so far from where that habit began, felt different. It was softer. Bittersweet. Like watching an old song being hummed in a new language.Positive thinking can make success feel like the only acceptable option. But humility allows for grace | Jackie BaileyRead moreI grew up between Kabul and Karachi; two cities that always felt like they were on the edge of something. One broken by war, the other always just holding itself together amid all sorts of hardships of a city outgrowing itself but starved of resources and infrastructure. In both, I learned that people survive not just through faith but through the small things they do when no one’s watching; the quiet rituals and little beliefs that live in everyday life. They’re not loud, not official. But they’re full of love and hope.I saw it all around me. In the way my grandmother would suggest a black cloth by the door after someone recovered from illness or we bought something “precious” – to keep the evil eye away. In the way my aunt would burn esfand herb above her children in a pot when they came home from a wedding or party looking too beautiful and getting too much attention. In the way my other sister-in-law would put a tiny black dot behind her baby’s ear when he smiled too much – just to hide some of that beauty from the world. “People are not very nice and too much goodness invites jealousy and negativity,” she’d say. “It’s better to be a little hidden.”Drawing on my own encounters, I’ve come to see how these seemingly small gestures – the fragrant smoke of esfand to lift heaviness, the rhythmic pull of qawwali, the quiet assurance of a taweez tied around a wrist – hold more than superstition. They carry virtues: grounding, comfort and a deep sense of protection. None of these things were in any book of religion. No one ever sat down and taught them. They were just picked up, like pebbles from the ground, passed from women to girls, from grandmothers to mothers to daughters – and sometimes to sons who were paying attention.Even the most religious people I know – people who prayed five times a day, who fasted every Ramadan, who could quote the Qur’an by heart – still do these little things. They didn’t see them as separate or wrong. Just part of faith and tradition woven together into everyday life, to feel safe and at peace.When I moved to Melbourne, I carried some of those things with me. Not in boxes but in habits. I still whisper Ayatul Kursi before a flight, even if I’m late and running through the airport. I still avoid sweeping the house at night, not because I’m scared but because I remember my mother saying, “You’ll sweep away your blessings”.My generation agonises over how to act and what to say. We have to learn to go with the flow | Bertin HuynhRead moreSometimes I think these little rituals stayed with me more than the big teachings. Not because they were more important but because they were more personal. More human. They helped us make sense of a world that often didn’t make sense. Especially back home where things could change overnight, where life was unpredictable, where people had lost so much.And they remind me that spirituality itself isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice, woven into daily life. It takes on local colours while pointing to something universal. I’ve seen echoes of it elsewhere in the chanting circles of Indigenous Australians, where voices rise together in rhythm and prayer; in the protective rituals of other communities, each finding its own way of asking for peace. Across cultures, people reach for these small, invisible shields.I still remember the trees outside a mosque in the bazaar of Kabul. People used to tie little strips of cloth to its branches; one for each prayer they made.Because these rituals are more than just old habits. They are threads that connect us to our past, whispers of love carried across generations and subtle ways of finding peace in a world that so often feels chaotic. Maybe one day, they will fade. Maybe the children who threw water behind me in London won’t pass the tradition on to their own kids. But as long as we live, humans will search for these quiet, innocent acts of hope and protection gestures that don’t always make sense on paper but make all the difference in the heart.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsReligionMaking sense of itIslamMindfulnesscommentShareReuse this content"

They are mostly bought by investors who then rent them to local professionals: three years ago, a report on early sales of flats in one developmentsaid that 40% of early buyerswere from Australia, China or Singapore.Ten minutes’ walk away, you can witness a very different spectacle. Every Monday night, a charity called Liverpool In Armshands out foodin the city centre, to queues of people. Some are homeless; others have a house or flat to live in, but can’t afford to eat. While I wasreporting on the city’s housing crisisfor the Guardian’s video series Anywhere But Westminster, I watched its volunteers in action for the best part of an hour: they told me the need they try to meet has doubled since last year.I spoke to a 50-something man who had failed to keep up with a £20 weekly surcharge and the rent on his flat, and then had his benefits withdrawn by the Department for Work and Pensions’ sanctioning regime: he suddenly had nowhere to live, and was clearly in a state of complete disorientation. The same was true of Jimmy, who was sleeping rough, and described being endlessly tortured by one of the city council’s cruellest policies: its insistence on summarily disposing of people’s tents, with everything they contain.15:25The city that reveals Britain's biggest problem: there's nowhere to live – videoI asked him about the prospect of somewhere permanent to stay, and his eyes filled up. “I’ve got more chance of sleeping in that bed there,” he said, and he pointed at a sumptuous double bed, festooned with cushions and pillows, in the illuminated window of Primark.The next morning, I went to an advice servicerun by the Merseyside Refugee Support Network, full of the frantic bustle of very fragile lives. In a warren of rooms next to a city-centre church, there was a steady stream of people faced with one of the asylum system’s cruellest features: the fact that, with a handful of exceptions, if you are granted residency in the UK, you will now be served notice of the need to leave accommodation funded by the Home Office in a matter of weeks. The result, as I saw, is a rapid pipeline to living on the streets.They arrived in an upstairs room, carrying letters from the Home Office contractor Serco. A man from Eritrea, who carried the sense of someone who was utterly terrified, showed me the instructions issued to him and his wife: “The Home Office has told us you have been granted permission to stay in the United Kingdom. You are still required to leave the property no later than 12 noon, which is [on] the date given in the attached notice to quit.”He was being helped by a volunteer who had come to the UK to escape war in Sudan. “They’re going homeless – they have not any choice,” he told me, before he described what often happens next: the handing-over of tents and sleeping bags, and another increase in the numbers of people who huddle in Liverpool’s doorways.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most recent datashows 12,764 householdson the city’s social housing waiting list. But one figure is particularly shocking: reflecting the fact that most local authorities now lack either the means or will to build anything more than paltry amounts of new social housing, thecity’s “additional social rent dwellings” in 2023-24totalled – and read this slowly – five.In the last year alone, private rents across the cityhave gone upby an average of 9.6%. While I was in Liverpool, I met a single mum called Helen, who works for the local ambulance service. Up to now, she has rented the house she shares with her 15-year-old son – which has damp walls, ceilings covered in mould and an upstairs window that won’t shut – for £600 a month. But her landlord recently hit her with a no-fault eviction notice – because, she suspects, he is set on charging a new tenant the £1,400 monthly rent he now gets for similar properties, which are presumably in a much better state.The numbers of people waiting for social housing, she told me, means that unless she and her son endure a spell of homelessness, they are highly unlikely to get that kind of help. So she is trying to somehow find a way through all this impossibility, with precious little idea of what comes next. As we talked, she mentioned a seemingly indelible part of the online conversations she sees about people in her predicament. “I see the messages on Facebook [that] blame the asylum seekers: ‘If it wasn’t for these people coming over on the boats, you’d get your house.’ That upsets me tremendously. Cos it’s not right.”None of these are specifically Liverpudlian problems: they form one particularly vivid element of a national story split between an ever-growing crisis, and housing policy that is still nowhere near to convincingly dealing with it. On the upside, the renters rights bill – which offers people such as Helen a range of new protections – isabout to receiveroyal assent. Ministers say their £39bn social and affordable housing plan willdeliver at least 180,000 homesfor social rent by 2036. But spending on that policyhas been backloadedto the end of the current parliament – and besides, the target amounts to only 18,000 a year. On the ground, therefore, everything still feels terribly fragile and uncertain.In London, housing policy is about to undergo the utterly absurd change that wasrecently decriedby my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty, whereby developers will be free to build even less “affordable” housing in return for even greater public subsidy. Liverpool city council, meanwhile, has just started a public consultation on its target of 30,000 new homes over the next 15 years, but any hardened specifics on social housing are hard to come by (its latest draft Local Plan says the council will require large developments to set aside 10% of homes for social rent, but clearly, this won’t get near current levels of need). This is the focus of a brilliantly energised new campaign called Help –House Everyone in Liverpool Properly. It keeps its collective eye on the city’s gleaming new developments, and also wants to steer the local conversation about housing away from blaming outsiders, and blurring the politics of housing into asylum and immigration: the city’s crisis, they say, should bring people together rather than pulling them apart.Which brings us to a particularly disquieting shift. Liverpool has long been credited with the so-called“scouse exceptionalism”that supposedly makes its peopleless proneto belligerent expressions of national identity and Little Englandism. But in many neighbourhoods, there are now streets festooned with union flags and St George’s flags. In the midst of what I heard about its housing shortage, they began to look like a desperate, distorted show of a fear laced with defiance, and proof of an unshakable political fact: that if you make people feel scared about something as basic as the roof over their heads, they will sooner or later start to behave in very unsettling ways.John Harris is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Bookmakers may withhold odds on the outcome. In the US-China race for 21st-century primacy, Xi is sprinting ahead, assisted by spur-heeled Trump’s many missteps.It’s amazing that debate still rages, in the UK and US, about the character and aims of China’s expansionist regime. Its aggressive, worldwide economic empire-building, suppression of basic rights inHong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet, regional sabre-rattling and ubiquitouscyber-espionage, allow only one conclusion.Even as British MPs argued over whether Beijing is anenemy or an investment opportunity, Xi was providing an unequivocal answer. China’s drastically expanded global export controls onrare-earth mineralsand magnets, over which it exercises a near monopoly, are the deliberately damaging act of a hostile power.These materials are essential for manufacturingmost electronic devices, including phones and cars. The security implications are alarming. Rare-earth products are used in cruise missiles, combat jets, nuclear submarines, drones and other modern weapons systems. China’s new rules will prohibit their use for any military purpose. Governments are scrambling to find alternative supplies. This embargo,if enforced next month, potentially compromises western arms supplies to Ukraine and defences against Russia, Beijing’s ally.China also intends to control use of these materials byoverseas-based manufacturersand supply chains. The US has asserted similar extraterritorial jurisdiction since 1959. Now Beijing is playing Washington at its own imperious game – and weaponising trade for political purposes. Trump blew a fuse when the measures were announced,threatening 100% tariffsand cancellation of his planned meeting with Xi. Amid market panic, he backed off. But tit-for-tat trade penalties continue, stoking fears of global economic downturn.As usual, Trump has no plan, no idea what he’s doing. Not so Xi. He is demonstrating that if Trump insists on a full-blown trade war,he will go toe-to-toewith the White House windbag. The rare-earths diktat could be a negotiating tactic, or a side-product of Chinese Communist party (CCP) politicking. But that’s probably wishful thinking. Analysts detect a fundamental shift. After initially biding his time, Xi is goingon the offensive.What has caused the shift? It’s the realisation in Beijing that Trump’s reckless America First policies are alienating old and new friends alike, creating a vacuum it can fill. US global influence and leverage is plummeting, reflected in disrupted alliances in Europe and Asia, weakness in confronting authoritarian regimes in Russia and Israel, the virtualelimination of US foreign aidand soft-power outreach, and contempt for the UN and the international rules-based order.China is staring at an open goal. Hardheaded Xi plays airhead Trump: it’s an embarrassing mismatch. Yet the slower-witted in Washington still don’t get it. “The president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China,” JD Vance crowedlast week. It would be rewarding to play the vice-president at poker.Does Vance realise, for example, that – to quotethe Center for Strategic and International Studies– “China [with unlimited access to rare minerals] is rapidly scaling up its munitions manufacturing capacity and acquiring advanced weapons platforms at a rate estimated to be five to six times faster than that of the US”? Does Vance realise the US islosing the tariff fightit started? “Since Trump launched the trade war this year, Chinese exporters have had considerable success finding new markets. Last month, China’s year-over-year exports to the US fell by 27%, but exports as a whole were still up by 8.3%,” noted James Palmer in Foreign Policy.In contrast, US farmers have lost their crucial China soya bean market to Brazilian producers, perhaps permanently. With the holiday season approaching, American consumers facerising prices. Most toys and up to 90% of Christmas goods sold in the US aremade in China.As the US retreats, Xi advances, determined to make China the polestar of a revamped, multipolar world. RecentChina-hosted summitsattended by the autocratic leaders of Russia, India, North Korea and Iran highlighted this refashioning of the global order in China’s image, under Chinese tutelage. Beijing is extending its influence via the Brics group of developing nations, by bolstering the much-denigrated UN system and by establishing new institutional frameworks to woo the global south. As Trump raised tariffs on much of the world, China moved to make African importstariff-free. As Trump slashes foreign aid, Beijing pursues its “global development initiative”. As Trump threatens to attack neighbourssuch as Venezuela, Xi promotes his “global security initiative”. Everywhere, the US islosing geopolitical and moral ground– or is in serious danger of doing so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They claim his priorities, and China’s “core interests”, are unchanged: internal stability, national sovereignty, unchallenged CCP control, economic and social development. Yet, paramount at home after more than a decade in power, Xi’s ever bolder, confident actions belie such comforting theories. On present trends, the Sino-American struggle for primacy will inexorably intensify. Thanks to Trump, more fall guy than tough guy, it’s a struggle the US looks set to lose.For the UK, this prospect is worrisome, to put it mildly. Scorned by Beijing, patronised by Washington, decoupled from Europe and reduced to the role of lonely bystander incapable of articulating a coherentChinapolicy, Britain can only hope it avoids becoming collateral damage.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

New adaptations of Austen and Brontë could explore everything from slavery to death in childbirthSun 19 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 15.54 EDTShareNews that Andrew Davies – the man behind thenation’s most beloved Pride and Prejudiceadaptation – is planning to have Jane Austen’s Emma die in childbirthdrew gasps from audiencesat Cliveden literary festival last weekend. Davies is planning to explore the dark undercurrents of Austen’s work in adaptations of Emma, Mansfield Park and unfinished novel The Watsons, and while his ideas may shock those fans wedded to Austen as a romcom author, I couldn’t be happier.I have always loved a period drama, especially literary adaptations. A few years ago, though, Austen fatigue set in for me. Maybe it’s the fact I’ve seen at least three Emmas and three Pride and Prejudices, and read each of her novels at least thrice. There are so many other stories in the world, many waiting to be discovered and adapted. Unless there was some new spin or interpretation being offered, I simply stopped being interested.As such I enjoyed Sanditon – what joy to have Austen’s West Indian heiress brought to life. But Emma with Anya Taylor-Joy bored me, and the less said aboutNetflix’s Persuasion(“now we’re worse than exes; we’re friends”), the better.If comments from readers of the Times are anything to go by, audiences will get in a froth about how “woke” Davies’s adaptations are when they make it to our screens, especially in their approach to slavery. Austen makes passing reference to slavery in Emma and Mansfield Park; in the latter it is clear that this is where the Bertram family have made their money. So why not show scenes making this explicit? Why not show Sir Thomas and Tom brutally quashing a slave revolt on their plantation in Antigua? Contemporary readers will probably have inferred this as the purpose of their trip in the novel. The moment when Fanny, the protagonist, brings up the topic of slavery and is met with dead silence by her cousins may feel subtle to us – to her 19th-century readers, it would have been the opposite.As for death in childbirth, I can’t be the only Austen lover who has always wondered about what happens to her heroines after the “happy ending”. Austen herself knew women who had died this way, as so many did. There’s a reason why the wedding makes a good place to stop, as anyone in the 19th century would have understood. It’s not that Austen sanitises and sugarcoats, it’s that modern readers – and many screenwriters – do. Think about how radical it felt when Joe Wright opted for more mud and a handful of farmyard animals in his more realist adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. That, amusingly, shocked viewers at the time, and yet what he created in his depiction is a Longbourn that feels vivid and true. Making tangible certain aspects of Austen’s works – or even filling in some of what is unspoken – isn’t necessarily an attempt to shock, but about providing a setting that feels real. Everything doesn’t have to feel so mannered. Period dramas such asHouse of Guinness, with its depictions of childbirth and its portrayal of the horrific legacy of the great hunger inflicted on Ireland by the English, have really raised the stakes.I’ve always embraced the darkness in literature. Being technically what the internet calls a “Brontë girlie”, I grew up being repelled and fascinated bythe red roomin Jane Eyre, and by Bertha Mason’s madness, before falling head over heels for Wuthering Heights at 14. But when it comes to dark themes, is there such a thing as going too far?The Brontë girlies have been in revolt overEmerald Fennell’s forthcoming Wuthering Heightsadaptation, which not only has a white Heathcliff and looks to have put the actors in costumes from the “wrong” period, but according to test audiences opens with a scene in which a nun gropes a recently executed man’s penis. You do find yourself wondering if it’s necessary, when the source material manages to be fairly depraved already. Heathcliff hangs a puppy and digs up Cathy’s body, for instance. Wuthering Heights is famously difficult to adapt, but I rather liked Andrea Arnold’s2011 social realist film.Amusingly, there was a debate at the Cheltenham literature festival a few years ago with the immortal title “Heathcliff versus Darcy: who is the bigger shit?”. I think the jury is still out. Heathcliff may have murdered a dog, but until we know how Darcy makes his money it’s all to play for. One of the panellists, Dolly Alderton, described Darcy as a “conceited, bullish and rude snob who, as my fellow millennials would say, needs to check his privilege”. (Willher Netflix adaptationreflect this? Now that would be new.)I’m wary of purists – as all creative people should be. If anything, I’m often in favour of going further, of having screenwriters and directors of period drama make concrete the dark undercurrents of so much 19th-century literature. That Andrew Davies is talking about exploring, for example, the “psychopathic” Frank Churchill’s hold over Jane Fairfax in Emma is only to be welcomed. As for Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights, it sounds utterly appalling and I will be there at the doors of the cinema the moment it opens.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But after his death, he followed me everywhereJonas Hassen KhemiriHis absence shaped me. But as my father lay dying in a Stockholm nursing home, I longed to hear him explainSun 19 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 14.24 EDTShareMy father died nine months ago and last night he drove me home in a taxi.We knew something was wrong when my father stopped taking his insulin and started leaving his flat at night without his shoes because there were “people in the plants” and the floor was made of “muddy water”. After several tests, he wasdiagnosed with Lewy body dementia, which causes hallucinations and a rapid decline in cognition.He moved to a nursing home in central Stockholm, and I told myself everything would end well. Dad would finally get proper medication, physical therapy, new teeth, foot care and eye treatment for his declining vision. I imagined coming by with my sons, and we would finally be able to talk about everything: why he disappeared, what we might have done differently and why I still held on to the naive hope that he would apologise.In the first weeks in the home, he would often tell the nurses the story of how he met my mother. He was a 21-year-old Tunisian store detective, using his impeccable eyesight to catch shoplifters in a mall in Lausanne, Switzerland. She was an 18-year-old Swedish student secretary who was in the country to learn French. They met at a pub. He quoted Baudelaire. She went back toSweden. Years of letters. A reunion in Stockholm.After their first kiss, Dad asked Mom what her family name, Bergman, meant in Swedish.“Mountain man,” she said. He couldn’t believe it. His family name, Khemiri, also meant “mountain man” – but in Arabic. Cue strings. Cue destiny. Cue love for ever,for ever ever, forever ever? (André 3000 voice). Their names connected them in a world that seemed to claim their love was impossible, because they didn’t share class, background, religion, skin colour and a mother tongue.It wasn’t 100% true. Khemiri doesn’t literally mean “mountain man” in Arabic. But my father was from Jendouba, Tunisia, near the Kroumirie mountains, and Kroumirie kind of sounds like Khemiri, so I guess it was true enough. My father’s most crushing loss was the divorce. When Mom told him he had to move out, Dad cursed me and my brothers: “Your mother will never be able to raise three boys on her own,” he said. “You will end up homeless drug addicts.”He disappeared. I spent my life trying to prove him wrong. I became a writer, my middle brother an actor, the youngest a psychiatrist. None of us are homeless. But whenever I’ve gone through a breakup since, I hear my father’s voice: “I told you not to trust anyone.”After my father moved to the nursing home, I received a fellowship inNew Yorkand moved to the US with my family. He never forgave me for leaving Sweden. He would call five times a day to let me know the nurses were trying to poison him. Mossad had bugged his room. His plants were still full of people, and the muddy water on the floor was rising by the day. He wanted to go to Tunisia, or Paris, or New York. He wanted to be anywhere but there.“Nobody has come to see me in weeks,” he said, which was strange because I knew my brothers had been there the day before. “All I need is some physical presence,” he added, which struck me as slightly ironic, since all his now-grown children had felt the same way when he disappeared.When we hung up, my sons asked me what was wrong with Grandpa. I tried to explain. I told them: he’s sick, he’s old, he comes from a poor background, a complicated country, he had eight siblings, his mother couldn’t read or write, he worked all his life to achieve financial stability, he was convinced money could create freedom and help him escape a painful past he never wanted to talk about. He had a thousand dreams, sold watches, imported perfumes, drove subways, bartended, taught languages – always dreaming of that big break that would turn everything around.“Did he ever get rich?” my oldest son asked.“It depends on what you mean by rich,” I said. “He managed to save some money. But he lost a lot of people along the way.”I hugged my sons and promised myself I wouldn’t repeat my father’s mistakes – knowing full well I would make my own.Afew months before his death, he called me to say he was lost in the city. It was raining, someone had stolen his leather jacket and he couldn’t find his way back to the nursing home. His voice trembled with fear. “If you turn on the camera, I can guide you,” I said. It took him a few minutes to find the button. He showed me his surroundings. “But Dad,” I said, “You’re sitting in your room.” “Are you sure?” he said, looking at his walls, his TV, the Tabarka jazz festival poster, as if for the first time.A few days before he passed, I was in Paris to give a reading from my latest novel, The Sisters. It follows three siblings over 35 years as they try to break free from a family curse. I chose a chapter about a father who forces his son to cut off his hair and then helps a female shopkeeper who is threatened by a drunk. The chapter ends with this line: “I enjoyed turning my father into a story; somehow, it gave me power over him, it seemed like the only power I had.”The next day, my brother texted: “Dad has stopped eating and drinking. The doctors are considering palliative care.” I just stood there, blinking at the screen, trying to process how utterly powerless my stories were in the face of death.I flew to Stockholm and spent three days and nights with my brothers at his bedside. He was breathing but couldn’t speak. He was looking at us but didn’t recognise us. He looked like a baby bird, with thin wings for arms and empty holes where there had once been white teeth.“He can still hear you,” the nurses said, and we believed them.We didn’t leave his side. We played Satie on repeat. We told stories. Do you remember that time when he caught two rabbits by hand, killed mosquitoes lurking on the ceiling with towels, pretended to eat a wasp, danced like James Brown, defended us from racist skinheads, quoted Disney films, forgot our girlfriends’ names, warned us never to get involved in politics, told us we were crazy for trusting the banking system. Sure, death seemed to be winning, but our stories put up a good fight.Dementiahad transformed his mind into a desert, but I imagined our stories planting seeds that might wake him up. Soon, terminal lucidity would kick in. Soon he would speak. We kept hoping for an ending that would make sense.One afternoon, we filled the hospital room with people: my mom, my brothers’ girlfriends, their children, older kids keeping their distance from his stiff body, toddlers climbing into bed without fear. For a moment, I saw the flutter of a smile on his lips. But still no words.My middle brother was the last one to hear him speak. The day before I arrived, Dad looked up and said: “Tell Per-Olof I still love his daughter.” Per-Olof Bergman, my Swedish grandfather, died in 1993. My parents divorced in 1995. My father died in 2025.Ihave spent 22 years writing about families, perhaps as a rebellion against death. Every time I receive a call telling me someone has died, my brain whispers: “You can write about this.” It happened when my first girlfriend took her own life. When a childhood friend died in a car crash. When my grandfather died, and my grandmother, and my cousin and my uncle.For years, I felt guilty about that reflex. Now I see it as a defence mechanism – an illusion of control: “Don’t worry. You’re not powerless. You can come up with an evocative first sentence and an effective ending. You can turn your loss into words and replace everyone who dies with sentences.”His breaths grew shallow. We forgave him, we cried. We waited. He didn’t wake to say he loved usAnd on some level, we all do this: we lose and we tell stories. We tell stories and then we die. The best-case scenario is that time kills us. No wonder we search frantically for control, for narrative structure, for a happy ending.But sitting next to my dying father, I didn’t think about writing. Maybe because I’d already mourned him. Once, he told me: “Everything you have, you got from me. You wouldn’t be a writer without me.” I think he was right, but I suspect his absence shaped me more than his presence.His breaths grew shallow. We said our goodbyes, we forgave him, we cried. We waited. We waited some more. We said goodbye at least eight times.At 2.30am, the third night, his breathing slowed. I woke my brothers. We sat beside him. His forehead was cold. Long silences. Then another breath. Silence. Breath. Silence. Breath. Then silence. A brief moment of pain. A gurgling sound. Silence.He didn’t wake to say he loved us. He didn’t explain why things turned out the way they did. He breathed, and breathed, and then he stopped.After his death, I flew to Tunisia to collect letters, photos and meet mourning cousins and aunts. Even though he was gone, I kept seeing him everywhere. He drove every car, stood behind every bar. The security guard who told me the mosque in Tunis was closing had his eyes. The bald man who tried to lure me down an alley in the souk had his hands and homemade tattoos. My aunt had his smell; my uncle his laughter. I had never been to Tunisia without him – and my brain wouldn’t allow him to die.Back in New York, he appeared less often. In April, a young version of him sold halal food on 47th Street. In June, a middle-aged version refereed my son’s flag football game in New Jersey. “Didn’t the referee look like your grandfather?” I asked on our way home. My son had headphones on and didn’t respond.My father died eight months ago and last night he drove me home in a taxi. I leaned forward to see if it was really him. Same neck, same hair, same shoulders. But when we hit a pothole on Flatbush Avenue, he turned to me and said: “Sorry.”Jonas Hassen Khemiri is a Swedish novelist and playwright.

One was ofan essay I wroteabout my favourite childhood superhero,She-Ra– the other a blank lined sheet with a prompt: “How does Fidge explore the impact of role models in her childhood?”Once the initial questions of “has her account been hacked in order to flatter me before requesting several hundred Bitcoins?” and “is the plural of Bitcoin Bitcoin?” and “there’s been a huge mistake” (not really a question) left my mind, I did what many others would do: I allowed myself three to five minutes of quiet pride, forwarded the photos to my mum and went back to work.Throughout the day, though, as I diligently filed paperwork and questioned how many exclamation marks are too many for an email, memories of my own exams kept showing themselves.Almost 20 years ago, I was one of many silent students carefully writing their name into tiny squares, chest pounding. My nerves stemmed from obvious reasons – a test environment and a then-undiagnosed anxiety disorder – but also from specific pressure at feeling I not only had to do well, but doparticularlywell.As my son prepares to graduate high school, I’m feeling nostalgic for the many parenting milestones I’ve bid farewell | Vivienne PearsonRead moreI completed the VCE in Melbourne, but each state has a weighting system affecting each subject that contributes to final scores. My classes were entirely humanities subjects, which I knew would be scaled down more than others. I was reminded of this constantly, by friends, friends’ parents, the manager of my after-school job: why choosetwoEnglish subjects andnomaths?!Thepush for Stemis even greater now, but if I had my time over I’d still choose English language and literature. These classes opened my mind and excited me in ways that still affect me today, and I say that without hyperbole (which, as a side note, is a great word to use in an essay).Mrs Feeney led English language, making conjunctions thrilling and creating lively debates about dangling modifiers. As a literature teacher, Mrs Di Stefano introduced me to Helen Garner and Isabel Allende, turning what could have been dry readings into drama classes, challenging us to not only read the texts but experience them.All books from both classes remain on my bookshelf.Reading the question posed to last week’s English class, I’m not sure I could answer it myself. For one, my ability to analyse written texts and name specific intricacies of grammar is not what it used to be (forgive me, Mrs Feeney). But mainly because the last few days have made me want to rewrite the essay altogether – the one in this year’s exam came from an editor’s prompt to write about a childhood hero.If given that prompt today, I’d want to write about those teachers, and thank them for encouraging us to follow our interests even when those were called “easy” or “pointless”, neither of which were true.On the off-chance a young person stumbles across this article because they’ve misspelled “Deep-frost Fridge” in Google, let me give a suggestion. Don’t study Stem if analysing dangling modifiers is what gets you excited. Nurture that excitement – it’s where energy originates. Build on that energy, you’ll need it. Because before you know it, you’ll be reminded of high school and ask yourself how 20 years have gone by.Then you’ll see a teenager walk past in complicated pants and be jolted back to reality.Deirdre Fidge is a writer and social worker who has written for ABC’s Get Krack!n and The Weekly with Charlie Pickering, and the BBC.

Now she’s telling her own stories, starting with a cast of ‘young kings’Sun 19 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareDays before we meet,Letitia Wrightfound herself cheek-by-jowl with a far-right march in London. This is the year when St George’s flags have been displayed in suburban windows and tied to lamp-posts, and when thousands of people – some more intimidating than others, especially to people of colour – have marched on the centre of the capital and beyond. A friend of Wright’s was visiting the city, and they had moseyed down to the South Bank, unaware of what awaited them. “It was jam-packed,” she says, recalling their struggle to get out of the fray. “I  was in the middle of it, and then I was out of it. They were doingtheirthing – and I was doing mine.”The actor has played refugees twice: once in the BBC Three dramaGlasgow Girls, where she portrayed a Somali teenager, Amal, and then in the 2022 film Aisha, where she took on the role of a woman from Nigeria navigating Ireland’s often Kafkaesque immigration system. With this insight – and as a black woman – how does it feel to see far-right rhetoric being spread in the way that it is now? “Sometimes people need to see the humanity behind these things that they assume the worst of, which isn’t true,” she says. “And I’m an immigrant, my parents are immigrants … It’s an interesting conversation. And it’s interesting to see [it unfold] in a country that has done so muchtoother countries historically …” She was close to the London Eye when she caught sight of the march, but also a rainbow in the sky. “I try and find the peace,” she says, sounding – understandably – a little exhausted by it all.View image in fullscreenWith Josh O’Connor in the film Aisha.Photograph: Sky UK/Bernard Walsh/ Cornerstone 2021Dwarfed by an oversized hoodie and a mop of black braided locks, the 31-year-old has doe eyes, perfect makeup-free skin and – in contrast to many of the glamorous shots that pop up if you search for her on Google Images – a sort of androgynous cool. For someone who is currently, in her words, “working a night shift” (more on that later), she’s holding up. A few weeks after we meet in east London, Wright will be visiting schools in this same area to speak to students about her directorial debut, Highway to the Moon, a striking short film inspired in part by the blight of knife crime. But today – drowning in her sweatshirt – she looks as if she could be of school age herself.It’s close to 10am on a Monday morning when we meet; Wright is eating a pot of fruit and offers me one, too. She’s casual, driven (she frequently describes herself as “relentless”), occasionally straight-talking, and often playful (“I cracka lotof stupid jokes,” she tells me). She’s also a bona fide movie star, a stalwart of the Marvel Cinematic Universe who has appeared in four of its superhero epics, including Black Panther in 2018, with another on the way (Avengers Doomsday, due for release at the end of 2026). As tech-savvy princess Shuri, she led Wakanda Forever (2022), the highest-grossing female-led superhero movie in US box office history. For those who had been following her rise, it would probably have come as little surprise: at 21, she starred in Urban Hymn, directed by Michael Caton-Jones, who gave Leonardo DiCaprio his breakout feature film role in 1993’s This Boy’s Life. On the release of Urban Hymn, hesaid of Wrightthat he had “not felt like this about someone since Leonardo … my instinct is [that] she can be as big as she wants”. Elsewhere, Wright has – among other things – snagged an Emmy nomination for her role in Black Mirror’s macabre episode Black Museum, and appeared in Steve McQueen’s landmark anthology series Small Axe, as Altheia Jones-LeCointe, the Trinidadian scientist turned British Black Panther.View image in fullscreenIn an episode of Steve McQueen’s landmark series Small Axe, 2020.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/McQueen LimitedWright grew up in Tottenham in north London, having moved from small, rainforest-covered Guyana in South America with her parents when she was seven years old. In a world of industry nepo babies, her background is refreshingly normal: teacher mum, a dad who worked in agriculture, and two younger siblings, now 18 and 19. While she is the inspirational big sis, it wasn’t always that way. As a teen, she says, acting was her biggest goal, but she was light on connections and knowhow. Certainly, no one else in her family had attempted anything vaguely similar. “It’s like …” she pauses, looking for the right words. “What the hell?! No one else is passionate? No one’s relentlessly chasing after their dreams?”Wright had an unconventional route into the industry, sending DIY headshots to agents as a teen until one finally acquiesced and invited her for an audition. “The assistant’s name was something like Emily,” she laughs. “So I was annoying poor Emily, like: here’s me again! Here’s my headshot, here’s my CV!” As well as bagging an agent, she spent some of her teenage years training at the Identity School of Acting, where her classmates included the future Star Wars lead John Boyega. Wright was an extra on his 2011 breakthrough film Attack the Block, about an alien invasion on a London estate. “He’s super talented, and seeing his dreams come true because of the hard work that he put in allowed us also to believe thatourdreams could come true,” she says. Boyega is “a big brother” to her.Wright is now pursuing another dream, as the writer, director and producer of Highway to the Moon. It’s a project she has described as “a love letter to black boys”, and one that reimagines the pastel-hued Arizonan desert as a liminal space. There, teens whose lives have abruptly ended meet one another in a commune and try to make sense of their new reality (the lead character, Micah, arrives still dressed in his school uniform).My friend losing her brother and seeing her grieving him was really hard. I just thought about all the family that he left behindIt was inspired in part by the death of the model Harry Uzoka, whose murder by fellow model George Koh made headlines in 2018. “I felt really confused. How did a well-known model, a young trailblazer in his industry, get stabbed to death by his friend? It didn’t add up. Usually we are told that these young men are part of a gang, or some other stereotypical explanation for their actions. I immediately began to wonder: why are our black boys hurting each other like this?”It was also inspired by the death of Wright’s friend’s younger brother, Kwasi Anim-Boadu – known as Junior – in a knife attack in London’s Finsbury Park the same year, and the pain she observed the family go through. “It made an impact,” she explains. “My friend losing her brother and seeing her grieving him was really hard. I just thought about all the family that he left behind, where his spirit was, and the spirit realm. It’s different when you’re seeing these things on the news – when you’re like, that’s over there. But when it’s closer to you, you start looking at it differently.” She wanted, she says, to make a project “that looked at what it means to have unity and love – they have that in ‘the inbetween’. And also what it means to regret not having that here.” It’s important, she says, for young boys to see themselves in a different light. “I want people to see black boys in a way that is not connected to a stereotype, but to take in their emotions, complexities, hopes, dreams, disappointments and fears.” She is also making the film for “other black boys to see themselves as worthy, beautiful and to know that their lives have a meaning. To embrace self-love that will transfer into love for their brother.” She refers to her cast as “her young kings”.Much care has clearly gone into Highway to the Moon’s futuristic, arresting visuals. Wright had to get special permission to film on the land of the Navajo nations, while her inspirations included the Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan, whose exhibition There Is Light Somewhere brought together black history with space and astrology. Meanwhile, incubating new talent clearly also means a lot to her. She first came across Kenyah Sandy, who plays Micah, in Small Axe (he appeared in the fifth episode, she was in the first), while some other members of the promising young cast came from a New York summer camp where Wright spent a week as a guest teacher. She went on to pay for acting classes for the boys for three months out of her own pocket. “It’s opening up an opportunity for them,” she says, buzzing with excitement. The film sees Micah question his new surroundings, while connecting with other young men who extend positivity to one another and to themselves, uttering lines such as, “I’m destined for greatness” and, “I am my brother’s keeper”. Wright says she was inspired by the affirmations that the boys had said to one another as they huddled around the campfire. Her script is poetic, but impactful; among its lines: “You created wounds, similar to the deep, dark pits on the surface of the moon, intomybody.”The most important thing is that kids see it and have these conversations. How does it affect you? How does it inspire you? What did you like about it? What didn’t you like about it?The school tour is an important part of the puzzle for Wright. “It’s for them, it’s for young kids, so I’ve always planned that – the most important thing is that kids see it and have these conversations. How does it affect you? How does it inspire you? What did you like about it? What didn’t you like about it? Just bringing it directly to them and praying that it sparks the heart of someone.”While she hasn’t turned her back on acting, Wright clearly has big aspirations for her career as a producer and director. She has her own production outfit, 3.16, founded in 2020 and named for the Bible verse John 3.16 about Christian salvation. “I wanted to create a nurturing environment for storytellers, and for myself,” she says. “I wanted to just create.” The idea, she says, is to start “very small, very simple, two short films a year”, before building up to feature films. Ultimately, she says she would love to work with other production companies; she’s an admirer of arthouse darlings turned Hollywood heavyweights A24 and Barry Jenkins’ Pastel (Aftersun, Moonlight): “I take a lot of inspiration from them,” she says. “And the boldness of their storytelling.”Wright has always been an intense actor. I mention her early but memorable role in Russell T Davies’s 2015 series Banana, and its post-watershed companion show Cucumber, about gay life in Manchester, and interwoven stories of love, loss and lust. As a lead in Banana and a recurring character in Cucumber, she played Vivienne “Scotty” Scott, a shy, sheltered young lesbian who develops a sudden, stupendous crush on an older woman she sees in the supermarket, played by Gentleman Jack’s Rosie Cavaliero. “Oh man, I love that character,” Wright says, wistfully. “It’s still one of my favourites today – very quirky, very weird.” Wright was a Bafta Breakthrough Brit in the year that Banana came out; by 2019, she would bag its Rising Star award, and by 2024 she would be on the judging panel.In 2015, though – and specifically the period after she had filmed Urban Hymn – Wright was close to packing it all in. She had just signed with an agent in LA and was about to start work on a film with Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning when she found herself suffering from what she would later describe in that Bafta Rising Star speech as “a deep state of depression”. She returned home to London, where she dedicated several months to Bible study. In previous interviews, she has described this period as crucial to the development of her Christian faith, something that she is still committed to today. Did she ever worry about not being able to get back into the industry? “Those questions did come up,” she says, looking thoughtful. “Those questions of: if you do take a break, will you be able to come back to acting? Will you be able to pick things back up? And I think the desire for clarity and the desire for my mental health to be improved outweighed that.”Back in Hollywood, she auditioned for a new Marvel project,Black Panther, which became the first blockbuster black superhero movie. Ryan Coogler’s film brought home more than $1bn at the box office. When it won three Oscars, Adele and Beyoncé were among the stars partying with Wright at the cast afterparty. “I didn’t realise how big a deal it was until the premiere. I knew we were making something amazing, but when it came out, how it impacted the world … I was really proud of myself, and it made me remember my sacrifices as that 17-, 18-year-old girl.”It was also the project where she met and became close to the late Chadwick Boseman, whose seemingly sudden death (he had not made his colon cancer diagnosis public) in August 2020 can still feel hard to comprehend. In Wakanda Forever, as the characters mourn King T’Challa, it’s clear they are also mourning Boseman, and the tears that Wright cried were surely for both the actor and his character. His death, she says, is “something we continually try to process and to understand”. She pauses. “It’s a hard thing to talk about. Wakanda Forever was an opportunity to honour my brother that way and continue the thing we started. But it’s one of those questions I’m just going to have to ask God – why did that happen? I know that my brother’s resting and that I’ll see him one day; that gives me a bit of comfort.”View image in fullscreenWright with Lupita Nyong’o and Chadwick Boseman in Black Panther, 2018.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyI missed a lot of opportunities when [Boseman] was here doing promotion, and he would say, ‘Let’s have dinner.’ I was like, ‘I’m going to see you on set.’ I thought I’d have for ever, and I didn’tHas her grief changed over time? “It is one of those things … it comes in waves,” she says. “It really depends. Sometimes you can be completely fine and joyous and celebratory, and thinking about everything that he achieved, and sometimes you’re just upset.” Keeping in touch with Boseman’s wife, Taylor Simone Ledward Boseman, is a comfort, and they speak often. It has also taught her a lot, Wright says, about “cherishing people, really cherishing moments. I missed a lot of opportunities when [Boseman] was here doing promotion, and he would say, ‘Let’s have dinner.’ I was like, ‘I’m going to see you on set.’ I thought I’d have for ever, and I didn’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At the end of 2020, she shared a video on X (then Twitter) by a pastor who espoused anti-vaccine and transphobic views. Wright has since staunchly denied endorsing those beliefs; in a2022 interviewwith this paper, she said: “Those are things that I am not and I apologised and I’ve moved on.” With the benefit of hindsight, I ask whether she feels she was treated unfairly by the media. She was far from the only celebrity to be linked to content that was critical of the Covid vaccine, but was among those who got the most flak. In 2023,Rolling Stone publisheda piece with the headline: “Why was Letitia Wright dragged more than Ant-Man star Evangeline Lilly?” I expect Wright to be a little testy, but she is happy to talk about it. “I feel, upon reflection, that as a society we hold each other accountable … It’s about learning from it, which is what I’ve been able to do. Learn from it, and improve as a person.” It must have been pretty awful in the moment? “I learned from it. I grew from it,” Wright repeats. “I had an opportunity, and I took it.”In 2024, Wright gained her first executive producer feature credit on Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot, a film about a church in East Texas where 22 families adopted 77 children from local foster care. While the Wall Street Journal described it as “a big-hearted film made with a homespun sincerity”, its release was clouded by links between the film’s distributors – the Christian production company Angel Studios – and the right-wing US news site the Daily Wire, something Wright was not made aware of at the time.Wright saidon social mediathat she did “not condone using this beautiful film for divisive political purposes”. Was it frustrating having to clarify things, and to distance herself?“Do you work as a freelancer?” she asks me.Yes, I say.“So if there’s a particular company that you are working with and they’ve done something that’s not part of the agreement, what would you do?”Explain that it wasn’t part of the agreement and that I didn’t know about it – so more or less what you did. But was it frustrating to have to do that?“No, not frustrating at all. It was just a simple procedure … My job was just to bring awareness to something that’s important. If there’s a section or part of a team that doesn’t align, you have to say something. And I did that as gracefully as possible.”We move on to other subjects. As an actor, producer and now director, Wright has been firmly in the bosom of the industry for some time. And now, in her early 30s, she is thinking about what’s next. “I still want to achieve a lot more,” she says. “But it doesn’t feel so pressing.” As for settling down and having a family: “When it happens, no one will know.” She’s notoriously private – “extremelyprivate”, she clarifies with a laugh. So much so that she won’t even tell me where she lives, other than that it is in east London, but that she’s currently staying south of the river.Not Your Superwoman review – Letitia Wright and Golda Rosheuvel are magnetic in mother-daughter dramaRead moreFor the moment, though, she remains booked and busy. Later that day, she will head over to west London’s Bush theatre for another performance ofNot Your Superwoman, the play that is keeping her busy for eight performances a week. It’s a two-hander that also stars Bridgerton’s Golda Rosheuvel, who plays her mother. Its writer, Emma Dennis-Edwards, has described the play as an exploration of “the family dynamics of Caribbean women, the way resilience, humour and strength exist alongside silence, pressure and unspoken struggles”. The goal, Wright says, was to make “something that was a reflection of what we’ve experienced in our life, and that a lot of women can relate to – especially a lot of black women. We have people from all walks of life in the audience. It’s really, really beautiful.”View image in fullscreenOn stage last month with Golda Rosheuvel in Not Your Superwoman.Photograph: Rich LakosIt’s far from her first rodeo on stage: she has appeared in two plays by her Black Panther co-star Danai Gurira. Next year, she will make her NationalTheatredebut in Tracey Scott Wilson’s The Story, about “an ambitious black reporter who defies her editor to pursue an incendiary lead”. What does she get from theatre that she perhaps doesn’t from film and TV? “Theatre is the mecca of everything, in terms of how everything has started for us in terms of acting,” she says. “I love all the art forms, but the discipline that comes with theatre is different, and there’s the opportunity to try something new every night.” Occasionally, of course, things go wrong, but by now she’s a master at styling it out. “I have a Guyanese flag I take out of my bag in one scene, and the bag just wouldn’t open one night,” she says, wincing. “Golda was like: all right, let’s get this open. The audience was looking at us, and she just turned around and went: ‘We really need what’s in the bag!’ They were cracking up laughing, and when we finally got it open, the audience just roared.”The show went on; Wright won’t let anything stop her. I get the sense she hasn’t stopped frantically pushing herself her whole life. “It’s that thing of, ‘just try’,” she says. “You never know what’s on the other side of trying. And many people don’t. I really want to maximise my potential. I do not want to die super full – I want to die empty.”Highway to the Moon is available to watch on arts platformwepresent.wetransfer.comfrom 20 October.Main portrait: Stylist: Rudy Simba Betty.

What if we covered ecocide and pollution in the same way?Julia ShawSun 19 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareWhenever you read, watch, or listen to the news, you’re likely to be exposed to stories of violence and murder. As a criminal psychologist, I’m often asked to comment on these cases to pick apart the motives of the perpetrators. People want these kinds of insights because murders feel frightening and horrifying, but also oddly compelling. There’s a level of focus and fascination, and the way these crimes are covered profoundly influences our perception of what the most urgent problems facing society are.One day it struck me that the world would be a very different place if environmental crimes were treated in the same way as murders. So, why aren’t they? And should they be?At the moment such crimes can, mistakenly, feel distant and abstract. If someone came into your flat and set fire to your furniture, stole your valuables, killed your pet, added poison to your water … what would you do? You’d be terrified. You’d go to the police. You might want revenge. You’d certainly want justice. It would be entirely obvious to you that a crime had been committed.In reality, environmental crime is just like this, but even worse because it happens at scale. The problem is that it doesn’t alwaysfeelthat way. But criminals releasing noxious gases into the air, cutting down protected forests, fishing illegally or polluting rivers do injure us in concrete ways. And that’s before you consider the broader impacts on biodiversity and climate change.It’s easy to default to the well-worn stereotype of evil corporations watching the world burnPart of the difficulty in appreciating this is that we tend to conflate all kinds of environmental harm in a way we just don’t when it comes to more familiar crimes. People intuitively understand the difference between hate speech and murder, even though both are acts of aggression. No one thinks of them as interchangeable. But thatishow we tend to think of environmental crime: people who don’t separate their recycling or fly a lot are conceptually tossed into the same category as those who perpetrate heinous acts of degradation. We need to stop putting mundane ignorance or selfishness in the same bucket as serious green crimes, and focus on the ecological equivalent of serial killers.It’s helpful to define what environmental crime is. Put simply, it happens when someone breaks the law – negligently, recklessly or deliberately – and causes environmental damage by doing so. Sometimes, specific green laws are broken by releasing high levels of toxic material into the air, water or soil, destroying protected plants or killing endangered animals. There are also more tangential crimes, such as committing fraud to get around fishing permits, laundering money to hide the proceeds of illegal mining, or engaging in corruption to facilitate wildlife trafficking.It’s easy to default to the well-worn stereotype of evil corporations watching the world burn while raking in the proceeds of exploitation and extraction. And while corporate misconduct is part of the problem, it’s often organised crime syndicates doing the dirty work. These more closely resemble the dangerous world of drug traffickers than men in suits making decisions based on greed.For example, in the context of wildlife trafficking, crime bosses with money and connections in China might hire middle-men in Mozambique who head into towns to recruit desperate local people willing to poach elephants or pangolins. Guards and customs agents are bribed to turn a blind eye to ivory and pangolin scales being smuggled across borders. Paperwork is forged and financial experts set up shell companies and launder money, pretending that the syndicate trades in “plastic pellets”. The same kind of structure applies if we’re talking about illegally mined minerals, toxic waste or timber harvested from protected areas.These mafia-style operations are perhaps easier to conceive of as serious wrongdoing than the image of environmental crime we might have had in our heads. And while money is often the driving force, it isn’t theonlymotivator, just as “power” isn’t the only reason people commit murder. If we ask the perpetrators why they did it, their answers can be as revealing as the explanations given for other kinds of crimes. In general, there are six psychological drivers: ease, impunity, greed, rationalisation, conformity and desperation.And if you’re tempted to turn around and say that environmental crimes don’t happen because of individuals, but because of “the system”, I hear you. Social structures, ideologies and politics have a profound impact on human behaviour. Using this term – thesystem– can feel like a profound contribution to a difficult discussion, underpinned by the desire not to over simplify. But exactly who, or what, isthe system?A serial killer also lives in a society, and we can blame society for any hardships they may have faced. But if on a true-crime show I were to simply cite “the system” as a motive for murder, people would want me to be more precise. We understand that choices are involved, and motives are personal, not just systemic. Otherwise, wouldn’t we all be criminals? The same goes for those whose unlawful activity damages the environment – they are neither just victims of the system, nor purely motivated by greed.I’ve tried to illustrate how a strange double standard seems to apply to how we write and talk about environmental crime – and therefore how we think about it more generally. Imagine a world where it occupied as much space in our news feeds and podcasts as gangs and murders do. We’d hear about the damage done, and also about the efforts to catch and punish the perpetrators. This would have a number of benefits: it would act as a deterrent for potential criminals; it would counteract the kind of eco-anxiety we feel when we think “no one is doing anything”; and it would also help set new social norms, making it clear that crimes which damage the ecosystems that sustain us are as serious as personal crimes. Putting them in the same psychological category as murder would mean we could better appreciate what’s really at stake.Dr Julia Shaw is a criminal psychologist atUniversity College Londonand author ofGreen Crime: Inside the Minds of the People Destroying the Planet and How to Stop Them.Further readingHow to Save the Amazonby Dom Phillips (Bonnier, £22)The Petroleum Papersby Geoff Dembicki (Greystone, £10.99)Cobalt Redby Siddharth Kara (St Martin’s Press, £24.99)Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe big ideaPollutionGreen politicsCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as soon as the light went on, the house caught fire – and it’s been burning ever since.”David Harewoodis talking about Othello, ahead of a new production from the Tony award-winning director Tom Morris that opens in London’s West End on 23 October. The production, which also features Toby Jones as Iago and Caitlin Fitzgerald as Desdemona, sees Harewood return to the role almost 30 years after his landmark performance at the National Theatre.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When he took onOthelloin 1997, it was the second time he’d done so in his then-short career. The first was at the Swan theatre in Worcester six years earlier – an opportunity for him to familiarise himself with a text he’d certainly revisit in the future, his agent at the time told him. Now he was at the Cottesloe (renamed the Dorfman in 2014) as the first Black man to play Othello on a National Theatre stage.The venue was significant not only because of his race – it was still rare for Black actors to be cast in the part, directors instead often choosing to put white actors in blackface – but also because it was the same space in which Laurence Olivier set the gold standard for the character decades earlier. Olivier’s 1964 performance, which later aired on the BBC, shows the actor thickly painted and shiny with blackface makeup, capped with a kinky dark wig. In interviews he described going down to the docks to study Black people so that he could perfect their movements and mannerisms. The performance became a blueprint: to this day, it is still heavily referenced as aspirational. Even Harewood, who made aBBC documentary in 2023about the strange and racist practice of blackface, describes Olivier’s Othello as “flawless”.Shakespeare’s tragedy follows Othello, a Moorish general in Venice. Through manufactured evidence, Othello’s ensign, Iago, convinces him that his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful. Consumed by jealousy, Othello murders Desdemona, only to discover her innocence too late – a revelation that drives him to take his own life.View image in fullscreenBard act to follow … Mandela Siobhan and Ken Nwosu in Othello.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe modern stage performance history of Othello in the UK begins with Rudolph Walker at the Malvern FestivalTheatrein 1966. Of course there were performances by Black actors before him – Ira Aldridge, Paul Robeson, Errol John – but it was after Walker that attitudes towards casting Black people in the role began to significantly shift. Walker was received well enough in Malvern that he would be cast in the role again multiple times, including at the Young Vic theatre, but not so much as to immediately end the blackface tradition. When, for the Othello that was recorded as part of its Shakespeare Collection in the 1980s, the BBC had the opportunity to cast him or indeed any other Black actor (the American James Earl Jones was blocked by Equity, which threatened to thwart the production with a strike unless a British star was cast), it was a blacked-up Anthony Hopkins who was chosen to play the lead role.It is true that Shakespeare rarely wrote parts specifically for Black actors. Othello is one of just three prominent characters in his repertoire explicitly written to be played by an actor of darker skin tone, and the only lead role. This fact, plus what could be described as a lack of imagination in the theatre industry when it comes to the Bard’s plays, creates a sense not only that every Black male actor is hoping for their turn to play Othello, but also that their aspirations are somewhat restricted to that hope, because they are less likely to be cast as Romeo, for example.Lucian Msamati – who played Iago at the RSC in 2015, believes there is racism in the idea that actors be restricted in their roles by the colour of their skin. His upbringing across Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe meant that everybody from the president to the pauper looked like him, and so playing outside his race was never a big deal. “I’m an actor, I was never a Black actor until I came here,” he says. The topic of whether he should be allowed to play Iago, written as a white character, was hotly debated among the backlash when his casting was announced.View image in fullscreenAs you light it … Hugh Quarshie as Othello and Lucian Msamati as Iago.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRecalling a conversation he’d had during the run with a fellow cast member, a white man who expressed a desire to play Othello, Msamati said he responded: ”You have a way in with originality, with integrity, that is true to the story – whyever not?” While there are definitely some who’d argue that white people should not play Othello at all, there seems to be more of a consensus that it isn’t simply white actors playing the part that’s the issue, but rather white actors using racist stereotypes to imitate Black identity in their portrayals.Harewood not only disagrees with the idea that all Black male actors are essentially Othellos-in-Waiting but rejects the notion that their aspirations should be so limited by race. Before he was ever cast in the title role he was much more interested in Iago, Othello’s villainous standard-bearer, which by line count is the bigger undertaking of the two – some might argue it’s also a more interesting character. “I think you’ll probably find as many Black [male] actors who want to play Hamlet. I want to play King Lear, I want to play Macbeth – this is the third time I have played Othello, but I’d be just as excited to play Richard III.”Ken Nwosu – who has just finished playing Aaron in Titus Andronicus at Hampstead theatre – also wouldn’t say he’s always dreamed of playing Othello specifically. He was always sure, however, that Shakespeare would feature prominently in his acting career. He recalls being asked at his drama school audition where he saw himself in 10 years’ time, and immediately answering: “The RSC”. Nwosu was first cast to play the Moor as understudy to Hugh Quarshie just three years after graduating from Drama Centre London. Looking back, he says he felt a bit too young for it at the time but the experience was formative, and definitely cemented his ambition. Last year, almost a decade later, he reprised the role inOla Ince’s productionat the Shakespeare’s Globe’s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.While many Black actors who’ve performed Othello have done so at the beginning of their career, using it as a platform to showcase their acting ability or develop their craft to prepare them for more high-profile projects,Chiwetel Ejiofortook a different route. His Olivier award-winning Donmar Warehouse performance came after starring in Hollywood movies such as Children of Men, American Gangster and Love Actually. Like Harewood, he played the role as a youngster, fresh out of drama school, and then returned to it some years later. At that point there was still a relative scarcity of Black performers on stage in any capacity, and certainly not in leading roles. Simultaneously, it was at the tail end of all those conversations about whether Black people should be in Shakespeare at all. “I felt like there was a lot more to that conversation – not just with the part but about what the meaning of Othello was in the culture at the time,” Ejiofor says.View image in fullscreenScroll with it … Ewan McGregor and Chiwetel Ejiofor at the Donmar Warehouse in London.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyHe believes Shakespeare was able to tap into something much more ahead of his time in terms of his positioning of Black characters. “The critique of racism is so strong in Othello,” he says. “The critique of Iago is so strong, as is the critique of Brabantio, Desdemona’s father. All of these characters that Shakespeare is writing as petty and racist and jealous – even though that system ultimately does bring down Othello – is still a critique of that system. If we’re trying to get into the psychology of Shakespeare’s attitude to Blackness, it’s very rich and progressive in many ways.”TheBritish Black and Asian Shakespeare Performance Databasereveals a stark illustration of the way in which Black actors are limited by the colour of their skin. It’s a digital archive created and maintained by Dr Jami Rogers at the University of Warwick to celebrate the contributions of Black, Asian and minority ethnic performers to the history of Shakespearean performance since 1930. According to the database, 72 different Black actors have played Othello in 93 different productions in that time. By contrast, six different Black actors have played King Lear across seven productions, and the same numbers apply to Hamlet. There’s no accurate number for how many productions of Hamlet or King Lear have cast a white actor in the lead role but a conservative guess could easily put it in the hundreds, if not thousands of productions over the course of the last century. There’s a gross double standard at play here – white actors are given access to roles written for darker-skinned actors, while Black actors are effectively limited from playing all roles, including the ones that are, essentially, written for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I think I just screamed at her for two-and-a-half-hours.” With the wisdom of the years passed, he’s able to look at Shakespeare’s words with an appreciation for the full depth of their intention. “It isn’t just rage – it’s loss, it’s hurt, it’s self-loathing, it’s insecurity, it’s vulnerability. Anybody who’s been in a loving relationship or a marriage knows that when you do have arguments, they’re not a full-tilt 10 – they’re twos and threes and then nothing and then twos and fives and then nothing. It’s a kaleidoscope of emotion.” Coming back to the part has also given him a greater appreciation for the skill required in the undertaking: “It’s a real opportunity to test yourself technically as an actor. I wasn’t old enough and I wasn’t experienced enough to just enjoy the language and the verse.”It is perhaps because Harewood is a different person today that he is seeing things in the play he didn’t see before. He’s an older man, carrying the complexities of a lifetime, which have taught him that “when you embrace your vulnerability, it gives you a hell of a lot of strength”. He’s been amazed at just how emotional rehearsals have been right from the start because the script touches upon so many feelings. In 1997, he says, he was overly preoccupied with offering an authentic portrayal of Blackness above all else: “I wanted to bring that believability – I wasn’t free enough to have fun and play the role.”This time, he is less concerned with that authenticity as he once was. He has examined his vulnerabilities and insecurities and is weaving those into the character. He is uniquely able to identify with Othello in the time leading up to Desdemona’s murder because of his well-documented struggles with his own mental health. “I think the character does go into a form of psychosis – and I’m drawing on my own experience because during my psychosis I did a whole lot of things I didn’t want to do because the voices in my head told me to do them.”Being the first carried with it a huge pressure. He was aware of how his performance might influence the careers of those coming after him: “One wants to not just open the door but kick it down for the people behind me.” But the role itself is also profoundly challenging – not just because of the racism but also the misogyny, which rears its ugly head mostly in the second half where Othello slaps Desdemona in public. “We all deify Shakespeare. We all think he is a genius because of the things he talks about and yet a lot of his women are quite weak and subservient. It is hideously misogynistic and we are trying to play against that. When we started looking at those elements in the play this time, I felt awful. I felt like a monster. And then you’re playing into the stereotype of the Black monster – I found that really difficult.” He’s grateful to have a drama therapist in the rehearsal room to remind him he is an actor, playing a part.While there’s no doubt that the play was written for a blackface performance, Harewood is keen to eradicate the ways in which the outdated tradition transforms Othello’s race into a dramatic device that drives the action and advances the plot. “Blackface is full of trope and I think some of those tropes inform the play.”Dr Jason Allen-Paisant also examines the insidious nature of blackface in his award-winning poetry collection Self Portrait as Othello. Just as in the forthcoming production, his work seeks to de-couple Othello’s actions from the fact of his race and skin colour. “One of the reasons I am interested in this Shakespeare is that it is, paradoxically, both an erasure and a record,” he says. “At the same time as recording the existence of Black people in 16th-century Italy, it simultaneously erases the same by reducing Black identity to a pack of stereotypes.” The narrative of his book is significantly driven by the objective of creating a backstory for Othello. “These myths have an enduring power. I wanted to imagine for him the density of a real character, with a real story,” he says.Countless productions have given in to racist interpretations of Shakespeare’s original script, presenting Othello as a man who murders his wife because violence is inherent to Black identity. One of the things Harewood is most concerned with in that respect is to restore dignity to Othello’s character. “He loves, hard. There’s no honour in what he does, but there’s heart in it. I want the audience to leave the theatre thinking it’s a sad tragedy because a great man was corrupted.”Othello is at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, 23 October to 17 January.Explore more on these topicsTheatreDavid HarewoodWilliam ShakespeareOthelloChiwetel EjioforfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is an appropriate image, given that so many early readers – from BookTokkers to fellow authors – have reported weeping uncontrollably during the book’s final third.For King, the reaction was unexpected. “I certainly felt a lot of emotion while I was writing. Not sobbing, more a deeper grief,” she says. But she describes the writing of her sixth novel, which begins with a 1980s college love story then revisits the same characters in middle age, as a joyful experience. “It was really great to just go back to the 1980s and college. It was a relief.”King’s latest novel shares a “connective thread” with Writers & Lovers, her bestselling 2020 tale of a 31-year-old woman waitressing while striving to establish herself as an author, which counts Curtis Sittenfeld, Elizabeth Strout and Madeline Miller among its fans. Like that book, and 2014’s Euphoria, inspired by the life of 1930s anthropologist Margaret Mead, Heart the Lover features a love triangle (actually, in Euphoria the triangle is more of a square). This dynamic feels true to life, King says, at least in her experience: “You go through droughts with relationships and then it just pours.”Yet King did not intend to write a love story this time. She was working on a “political murder mystery” titled Mercury Island during the pandemic. “I had about 90 pages, and I had run out of steam. I had a dead body on the first page, and I didn’t care how he died,” she laughs. Then her friend Ann Patchett sent her the manuscript of Tom Lake. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, she’s having so much fun. And I am having so much fun reading this.’”So she flipped to the back of her notebook and started writing Heart the Lover’s first scene.King’s writing is warm and big-hearted – even when characters behave badly they are presented with sympathy – and she comes across the same way, speaking from the house she shares with her husband in Portland, Maine. She is curious, chatty, has a cascade of long, curly blond hair and exudes a sense of hearty outdoorsiness – she hikes and, as she tells me with a wince, “Dare I say, I have gotten really into pickleball.”For all her buoyancy, she is devastated by the political situation in the US; her voice cracks when she talks about her fears for voting rights, and about the tech companies who strike her as “intent on pushing us away from each other – actively, deliberately – with seemingly no conscience or sense of responsibility. It just breaks my heart.”We Americans have always had an exceptionalist point of view, as though that authoritarianism would never come hereGiven the darkness of this moment, she admits that in the run-up to publication she sometimes wished she had written that political murder mystery, and not a love story, after all. At times she worried that the book’s title – taken from a card game the characters play – was too “schmaltzy”. One of her two grownup daughters even told her: “‘You use that title, you will ruin your career.’ That really haunted me!”In the end, though, she decided to “go all in”. “Falling in love produces all of these great feelings and chemicals and hormones,” she says. “The extraordinary thing is that you can read a novel and feel those same things.” She is well aware that love stories are sometimes discussed “in a belittling way. I really want to push back against that, because I don’t know what else we have if we don’t have love?”King knew she wanted to be a writer from her first high school creative writing class. But the road, she says, was “very, very, slow”. She studied English as an undergraduate, and a master of fine arts in creative writing at Syracuse University, then, similarly to her Writers & Lovers protagonist, Casey, paid the rent waiting tables. Her first novel was published when she was 36.She says she developed writerly, watchful instincts during her “chaotic” Massachusetts childhood, which encompassed periods at home alone with her unhappily married parents while her two older siblings were at boarding school, and then the acquisition of 14 step-siblings after her parents divorced when she was 11, remarrying three times between them. Her father “was a really serious alcoholic. I don’t know how he got all these wives to marry him!” she says. Each family setup was so different. “There were four different cultures. I became very adept at watching for signs of how that culture operated, how I would survive best and how to protect myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She and Blume are now friends, having met during an online event during the pandemic. That “has been an incredible honour. She gave me everything. I feel like I would not have this career if I hadn’t read her books.”These days, she is a diverse reader. “I always keep a copy of Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse on my desk, as well as The Evening of the Holiday by Shirley Hazzard,” she says. She is a longterm devotee of Tessa Hadley, Strout and Colm Tóibín, and citesMy Friendsby Hisham Matar, about three Libyan exiles living in London, as a recent favourite. At the moment it is “useful to read dissident literature about countries in authoritarian crises. I’ve read a lot of those books all my life – now it’s with a totally different perspective. We Americans have always had an exceptionalist point of view, as though that would never come here. And so I think those stories are so important – but we also need to balance our reading so we don’t get terrified into numbness and inertia.”That, in the end, is why she decided to embrace her accidentally written love story.Fiction“allows us to see things from so many perspectives. That is such an important part of living communally,” she says. When we connect with others through fiction, it reminds us “that the huge majority of people on this Earth are genuinely good and have love in their hearts”.Heart the Lover by Lily King is published by Canongate (£18.99).

A candid video shows their fatal confrontation with Chocobar after they served eviction orders to him and hundreds of other Chuschagasta residents of a patch of ancestral land.The jury, which included the film producer Elizabeth Karlsen, praised Martel’s “deep empathy and extraordinary journalistic and cinematic rigour”.It added: “In foregrounding present-day voices and neglected histories, Martel emerges with a portrait of – and for – an Indigenous community, and grants them a measure of the justice the courts have long denied them. Within a remarkably strong competition, our jury is proud to honour this singular achievement.”Martel has been referred to as “arguably the most critically acclaimed auteur in Spanish-language art cinema outside Latin America”. She has made a series of feature films, including La Ciénaga, the Holy Girl, The Headless Woman and Zama.In 2018,the director spoke to the Guardianabout her fascination and shock at the arrogance and entitlement of Argentina’s middle class – which she said was a direct result of Europeans arriving in the country. “Even very educated people, they can’t make the link. It’s almost like looking at a wooden boat and not realising that it was made from trees. We see the wooden boat, but not the trees,” she said.Other winners at this year’s BFI London film festival included Vincho Nchogu’s One Woman One Bra, a humorous account of one woman’s fight to keep her ancestral land, which won the Sutherland award for first feature. The Sutherland jury said the film was “at once funny, life-affirming, and deeply moving; its emotional journey stayed with us and will continue to do so.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Give me the dark side of 19th-century life any dayRhiannon Lucy CosslettWhy sanitise or sugarcoat the classics? New adaptations of Austen and Brontë could explore everything from slavery to death in childbirthSun 19 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 19 Oct 2025 15.54 EDTShareNews that Andrew Davies – the man behind thenation’s most beloved Pride and Prejudiceadaptation – is planning to have Jane Austen’s Emma die in childbirthdrew gasps from audiencesat Cliveden literary festival last weekend. Davies is planning to explore the dark undercurrents of Austen’s work in adaptations of Emma, Mansfield Park and unfinished novel The Watsons, and while his ideas may shock those fans wedded to Austen as a romcom author, I couldn’t be happier.I have always loved a period drama, especially literary adaptations. A few years ago, though, Austen fatigue set in for me. Maybe it’s the fact I’ve seen at least three Emmas and three Pride and Prejudices, and read each of her novels at least thrice. There are so many other stories in the world, many waiting to be discovered and adapted. Unless there was some new spin or interpretation being offered, I simply stopped being interested.As such I enjoyed Sanditon – what joy to have Austen’s West Indian heiress brought to life. But Emma with Anya Taylor-Joy bored me, and the less said aboutNetflix’s Persuasion(“now we’re worse than exes; we’re friends”), the better.If comments from readers of the Times are anything to go by, audiences will get in a froth about how “woke” Davies’s adaptations are when they make it to our screens, especially in their approach to slavery. Austen makes passing reference to slavery in Emma and Mansfield Park; in the latter it is clear that this is where the Bertram family have made their money. So why not show scenes making this explicit? Why not show Sir Thomas and Tom brutally quashing a slave revolt on their plantation in Antigua? Contemporary readers will probably have inferred this as the purpose of their trip in the novel. The moment when Fanny, the protagonist, brings up the topic of slavery and is met with dead silence by her cousins may feel subtle to us – to her 19th-century readers, it would have been the opposite.As for death in childbirth, I can’t be the only Austen lover who has always wondered about what happens to her heroines after the “happy ending”. Austen herself knew women who had died this way, as so many did. There’s a reason why the wedding makes a good place to stop, as anyone in the 19th century would have understood. It’s not that Austen sanitises and sugarcoats, it’s that modern readers – and many screenwriters – do. Think about how radical it felt when Joe Wright opted for more mud and a handful of farmyard animals in his more realist adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. That, amusingly, shocked viewers at the time, and yet what he created in his depiction is a Longbourn that feels vivid and true. Making tangible certain aspects of Austen’s works – or even filling in some of what is unspoken – isn’t necessarily an attempt to shock, but about providing a setting that feels real. Everything doesn’t have to feel so mannered. Period dramas such asHouse of Guinness, with its depictions of childbirth and its portrayal of the horrific legacy of the great hunger inflicted on Ireland by the English, have really raised the stakes.I’ve always embraced the darkness in literature. Being technically what the internet calls a “Brontë girlie”, I grew up being repelled and fascinated bythe red roomin Jane Eyre, and by Bertha Mason’s madness, before falling head over heels for Wuthering Heights at 14. But when it comes to dark themes, is there such a thing as going too far?The Brontë girlies have been in revolt overEmerald Fennell’s forthcoming Wuthering Heightsadaptation, which not only has a white Heathcliff and looks to have put the actors in costumes from the “wrong” period, but according to test audiences opens with a scene in which a nun gropes a recently executed man’s penis. You do find yourself wondering if it’s necessary, when the source material manages to be fairly depraved already. Heathcliff hangs a puppy and digs up Cathy’s body, for instance. Wuthering Heights is famously difficult to adapt, but I rather liked Andrea Arnold’s2011 social realist film.Amusingly, there was a debate at the Cheltenham literature festival a few years ago with the immortal title “Heathcliff versus Darcy: who is the bigger shit?”. I think the jury is still out. Heathcliff may have murdered a dog, but until we know how Darcy makes his money it’s all to play for. One of the panellists, Dolly Alderton, described Darcy as a “conceited, bullish and rude snob who, as my fellow millennials would say, needs to check his privilege”. (Willher Netflix adaptationreflect this? Now that would be new.)I’m wary of purists – as all creative people should be. If anything, I’m often in favour of going further, of having screenwriters and directors of period drama make concrete the dark undercurrents of so much 19th-century literature. That Andrew Davies is talking about exploring, for example, the “psychopathic” Frank Churchill’s hold over Jane Fairfax in Emma is only to be welcomed. As for Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights, it sounds utterly appalling and I will be there at the doors of the cinema the moment it opens.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So it’s a cosmic twist of televised fate thatSimon’s opening duet partnerfrom the much-balleyhooed 50th anniversary special is hosting tonight, the third episode of the 51st season.Aside from her status as a pop hitmaker, Sabrina Carpenter has an acting pedigree. Girl Meets World, anybody? She’s clearly a favorite at 8H: aside from her memorable appearance on the 50th, she served as musical guest for May’s season finale and her song Espresso was the basis for the popularDomingo sketch, also relaunched for the 50th. This time she’s serving double-duty. Let’s see how Ms. Please Please Please meshes with a recently-refreshed cast as the show grappled with a 12-minute late start-time thanks to an overrun football game.Last season when Ariana Grande hosted, she went viral with her Domingo sketch during which a bridal party warbles through a spin on Carpenter’s songEspresso, which inadvertently reveals that the bride played by Chloe Fineman, is cheating on her clueless husband (Andrew Dismukes) with Domingo (Marcello Hernández). So tonight, instead of a political cold open, the show decided to kick things off with another chapter in the adventures of homewrecker Domingo. In this one, husband Dismukes is turning 30, which prompts Carpenter and friends to detail more cheating adventures to the tunes of Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra and Alex Warren’s Ordinary. They also sing to The Fate of Ophelia, the Taylor Swift track. The superstar was a long-rumored cameo for tonight’s episode as she continues to roll out The Life of a Showgirl, on which Carpenter also appears. Spoiler alert: she never showed.Carpenter is center-stage and in lieu of singing (she will do that later), she delivers a hodgepodge of bits, many of which tied to the hyper-sexualized lyrics she regularly sings about. “I’m not just horny, I’m sexually charged and I love to read,” she cracks. Hercontroversial album cover?She jokes that hand was actually Bowen Yang yanking her hair back at the 50th. Meanwhile, a moment where Carpenter heads into the crowd was flat. What do you expect when you’re chatting with actual audience members (including a self-proclaimed venture capitalist)? Kenan Thompson comes in to wrap things up; he’s been on the show (23 years) just a tad longer than Carpenter’s been alive (she’s 26).SNL’s always gotta cater to the times and with podcasts still a culture-dominating artform, they tackle the trend with this sketch where members of the female cast including Fineman, Jane Wickline and Carpenter all do pitch-perfect impressions of pre-teen boys who love snacks. Meanwhile, since James Austin Johnson’s Trump impression was MIA from the cold open (surprising, especially in light of the day’s headline-grabbing No Kings protests) he inexplicably shows up on the show to talk about candy, too. Johnson’s Trump also gets philosophical about his life, and the possibility of getting into heaven. “It’s been a good run, and a great time,” he muses of his life.It’s spooky movie season, and what’s scarier than having to follow through on (gasp!) plans? Here, Carpenter is paired with Ben Marshall as a couple reeling with the possibility, nausea and anxiety that comes with the prospect in the motif of a Blumhouse-produced horror flick with lines like: “They want to do drinks here and then go to that viral ramen place!” It all leads Marshall to shriek “Just tell them we have Covid!” It should be noted that he’s the member of Please Don’t Destroy who was promoted to feature player after the trio was split up at the start of the season. He subsequently makes multiple appearances throughout the episode, proving his staying power.Then a recurring sketch that combines the perkiness and style of 1995’s classic Will Ferrell and Nancy Walls skitWake Up and Smilewith the naive raunchiness of the show’s Christmas classicDelicious Dish: Schweddy Ballswith Molly Shannon and Ana Gasteyer. Here, cast member Ashley Padilla (who replaces Heidi Gardner who previously starred in the sketch) channels Walls, while Mikey Day plays the Ferrell-counter in a QVC rip. They invite guest Carpenter who is selling a travel pillow that, um, looks like a lady’s certain private part. Cue the puns and vagina jokes. The twist here is that opposed to Schweddy Balls, these characters know full-well what the pillow looks like, and are mortified. “Blur this!”And a one-two-three. Carpenter plays a motivational dancer, whatever that is. The joke here is that she falls and is so concussed, she starts talkingnonsense, to borrow the name of one of her signature songs. Though, sometimes the best moments are the unplanned ones. Here, a dummy that’s supposed to break through a window falls short, prompting Thompson to give it the heave-ho the rest of the way. The mishap causes Fineman to break character, arguably the most charming moment of the show.Lorne Michaels knows his audience; he’s always said that one’s favorite SNL cast is whoever they watched growing up. So here’s another nod to middle school kids, this time in the form of an infectious pop song about, well, grinding at a school dance. The show needs to target the youngest viewers in order to stay relevant, of course. Meanwhile, Bowen Yang handily takes lead vocals in the pre-tape, a smart way to utilize him, considering Yang announced earlier in the day that he was skipping out on the live portion since he’s being honored in Los Angeles tonight at the swank Academy Museum Gala. Not a bad reason to play hooky.Multiple Goegre Santos gags ricocheted through the second Weekend Update of the season with the recent news of Trump pardoning him. “President Trump has released what everyone has been asking him to release,” Colin Jost quipped before shouting out Santos.Meanwhile, Hernández plays his Movie Guy character; dressed like an usher in a thick accent, his movie segment goes off the rails as he actually hasn’t seen much. “Balck Phone 2, ring ring?” he says. “Sorry you have the wrong number. I have not seen that one yet.”Meanwhile new cast member Tommy Brennan makes his Update debut, combining Norm MacDonald’s dry delivery with the midwestern charm of Bill Murray with jokes about growing up with a milkman and his retro handsomeness. “I’m from a family of eight kids,” he says. “That’s probably the wrong choice.”You know how washers and dryers play a little ditty when they’re done with a load? Well, what if they sang? Ladies and gentlemen, that’s the concept of this sketch. Luckily, it knew full well how insane it was. When Dismukes’ character decides to buy one, charmed by the singing dryers, he goes to pay for it with a sack full of money with a dollar sign on it, a’la a Looney Tunes cartoon. If you’re going to be silly, may as well lean into it.The deliciously stupid train continues here, as cast member Ashely Padilla, who is quickly turning into a female utility player appearing in a number of sketches since last week’s premiere, simply cannot stop farting in front of her well-meaning office colleagues, Carpenter and Marshall among them, who want to celebrate her birthday. The sketch eventually devolves into her asking what everybody makes. “Great birthday everybody,” she says. “I farted and got demoted.”In the grand tradition of T Sean Shannon’sBear City, and an array of short films from future directorial heavyweightAdam McKay, here writer Martin Herlihy becomes a rare SNL writer honored with a taped piece branded with his name. Timed to Halloween (one of the episode’s only nods to the upcoming holiday), Herlihy harkens back to Eddie Murphy’sWhite Like Me(1984) with a hidden camera social experiment of what people would do if they walked into a theater where the audience was full of Frankensteins. Throw in a Mary Shelley reference and multiple accusations of racism, and you have yourself an aptly weird end to a show that basked in its stupidity.Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveSaturday Night Live recapUS televisionTelevisionSabrina CarpenterTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our bandmate. Our heartbeat,” the band wrote.“Sam Rivers wasn’t just our bass player – he was pure magic. The pulse beneath every song, the calm in the chaos, the soul in the sound.Limp Bizkit review – nu-metal elders can still rock the party like it’s 1999Read more“From the first note we ever played together, Sam brought a light and a rhythm that could never be replaced. His talent was effortless, his presence unforgettable, his heart enormous.”Fred Durst, the band’s frontman and lead vocalist, posted a video Sunday morning that recounted how they met at a club in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, and went on to music stardom and performances around the globe. Durst said he has shed “gallons and gallons of tears since yesterday”.“He really did have an impact on the world and his music and his gift is the one that’s going to keep on giving,” Durst said. “I just love him so much.”The cause of Rivers’ death was not revealed.Rivers, 48, had spoken of heavy drinking that had caused liver disease. He left the band in 2015 and received a liver transplant before reuniting withLimp Bizkitthree years later.Durst said he and Rivers shared a love of grunge music, naming the bands Mother Love Bone, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.“He had this kind of ability to pull this beautiful sadness out of the bass that I’d never heard,” Durst said, calling Rivers “so talented I can’t explain.”Limp Bizkit formed in Jacksonville in 1994 and rose to fame in the late 1990s with their eclectic and heavy sound that blended metal, hip-hop and punk influences.They achieved mainstream success with their albums Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), which topped the charts in the US.Their off-the-wall sense of humor is reflected in the titles of their mega-selling 2000 album, “Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,” and a single released last month, “Making Love to Morgan Wallen.”Rivers was one of the founding members of the band, along with vocalist Fred Durst, drummer John Otto, guitarist Wes Borland and turntablist DJ Lethal.“Rest easy, brother. Your music never ends,” they said in the Instagram post.DJ Lethal added in a comment below the band’s post: “We are in shock. Rest in power my brother! You will live on through your music and the lives you helped save with your music , charity work and friendships. We are heartbroken 💔 enjoy every millisecond of life. It’s not guaranteed.”Limp Bizkit has scheduled a tour of Central and South America to begin in Mexico City in late November.Explore more on these topicsLimp BizkitMetalPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

His second, 1929, out this week, takes readers “Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How it Shattered a Nation”.It’s been 16 years between books, but Sorkin hasn’t been idle. A columnist for the New York Times, he founded its DealBook newsletter and summit; he’s a Squawk Box co-anchor for CNBC; and after Too Big to Fail was filmed by HBO, he co-created Billions, a huge hit for Showtime starring Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti.After Too Big to Fail, Sorkin said, he was “often asked about 1929. I actually didn’t know much. I had readJK Galbraith[The Great Crash, 1929, published in 1955] and a couple other books. And most people I knew, we would all sort of talk about 1929 as this terrible calamity, but nobody … knew what actually happened – who the people were, what they said to each other, what the motivations were, what the incentives were, what the lessons actually were.”This month’s best paperbacks: Jonathan Coe, Tessa Hadley and moreRead moreThe short version of what happened in 1929 is that a stock market built on fast credit and wild speculation suffered a series of falls culminating in the Black Thursday crash on 24 October, in Galbraith’s words a day “measured by disorder, fright, and confusion”.Combined with factors including protectionist tariffs and rising unemployment, the crash was a key signpost to a devastating global depression.“About a decade ago,” seeking a way into the story, Sorkin went on vacation and “like a real nerd, downloaded some books to a Kindle … and I remember reading them, thinking: ‘Wow, this is so much more interesting than I knew,’ but also feeling most of the books about this period were written in the 1930s, some in the 40s, 50s. I think there’s one that was maybe the 70s. And a lot of them were written by economists … told through charts and data and economic systems. And I wanted the human drama.View image in fullscreenThe cover of 1929.Photograph: Viking/Penguin“One of the lessons of writing Too Big to Fail was, we talk about business and the economy oftentimes in big numbers and structures and systems, but it really is ultimately about people and the decisions they make. So I thought: ‘Maybe there’s an opening to write a book like that.”A visit to Harvard allowed a look at the papers of Thomas Lamont, a partner at JP Morgan, including transcripts of White House talks with President Herbert Hoover. Allowing for myriad commitments and the challenges of pandemic-era research, Sorkin’s book was a go.As influences for a book based on first-hand sources found in countless archives, Sorkin cites business classics: Den of Thieves by James B Stewart, about insider trading; Liar’s Poker by Michael Lewis, about bonds traders; and Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, about the fall of RJR Nabisco.“Widening the aperture”, a phrase Sorkin uses to describe a project that encompasses earlier panics (1907, 1921) and the long aftermath of 1929, he also looked to Walter Lord’s A Night to Remember, from 1955, as “really the definitive in-the-room account of the sinking of the Titanic” and “actually a little bit like a mental model … [for] a way I wanted the reader to be able to feel.”The crash of 1929 was indeed like a shipwreck. Livelihoods were lost when the market capsized, though Sorkin confirms that one image in the popular imagination, of ruined brokers leaping from Wall Street windows, is not what actually happened. For a while, it seemed the economy might recover. It took other factors, prominently including the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, to bring about depression.As Sorkin’s book comes out, Donald Trump’s tariffs and their effects are in the news. Sorkin said he wrote with an eye on current events but preferred not to oversell such parallels, instead seeking chiefly to present relatable characters.“I’m always trying to understand where the drive comes from, where the motivation comes from, for whatever the decision is that people are making,” Sorkin said, citing experience gained “in the context of Billions and the making of the movie Too Big to Fail” as well as “what I try to do with my journalism every day.“Oftentimes it was to try to understand: ‘Well, what is it that’s driving Charlie Mitchell?’ … or: ‘What was it about Carter Glass in his childhood that led him to be this sort of very unique character?’ Similarly with Lamont and John Raskob and so many others.”View image in fullscreenThe front page of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper.Photograph: Icon Communications/Getty ImagesMitchell, CEO of National City Bank, a casualty of the crash, was hauled before Congress and into court on tax charges. Glass was a senator from Virginia who drovereformto protect ordinary Americans from Wall Street excess. Raskob, an executive at DuPont and General Motors, chaired the Democratic National Committee.One way Sorkin seeks to make such characters relatable is to depict their use of technology to master fast-moving markets – analog telephones in serried ranks on desks above Wall Street now home to computers. He’s also happy to compare key players to equivalents today.Considering Glass, a Virginia conservative, Sorkin looks to a current senator from Massachusetts, decidedly more progressive, the force behind theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed after 2008 to protect ordinary investors.“If Elizabeth Warren was a racist, that’s who [Glass] would be,” Sorkin laughed. “But what, to me, was so interesting about [Glass] was also that … he was cited after the 2008 financial crisis as one of the great bastions of the regulatory world. I think liberals really loved him. They thought that he was really trying to hold Wall Street to account.“And I went into this project thinking about that narrative, and … as the story progresses, it is so much more complicated than that. I’m not sure Elizabeth Warren would be citing Carter Glass today if she really understood the full dynamic of howthe Glass-Steagall Billwas created.“I thought of Glass-Steagall [also named for Henry B Steagall, a congressman from Alabama] as this famous bill that broke up the banks and was really meant to end the casino [gambling on the markets], and then you realize … the real movers weren’t even politicians, to some degree they were bankers who were trying to screw each other. And maybe it just represents how this world is actually no different than it is today, in many ways, in terms of how the sausage gets made.”Among those bankers, Sorkin found Mitchell “sort of a villain, but not really” and compelling because “I love characters that are not black and white. And he was so interesting to me because he was as famous as Jamie Dimon [CEO of JPMorgan Chase] would be today. But there were aspects of [Mitchell] that might have been more like a Michael Milken,” the insider trader jailed in 1990 thenpardonedby Trump in 2020.“Charlie Mitchell created credit and leverage in the system to loan money to ordinary investors, which in large part is what led to the crash. Michael Milken revolutionized the debt markets and the credit markets in the 80s by loaning high-yield bonds, or what people call junk bonds, to less good credits. And they both were arrested. The outcome was slightly different, but they were both hated.”Knowing today’s titans well – it was his question that memorably prompted Elon Musk totell critics “go fuck yourself”– Sorkin is well placed to make comparisons. Regarding another key character in 1929, the Tesla, SpaceX and X owner duly enters the chat.View image in fullscreenAndrew Ross Sorkin.Photograph: Mike Cohen“To me, John Raskob is like Elon Musk. Think about a businessman who was involved in everything. Cars, obviously, General Motors, and [Raskob] gets involved in politics … starting to try to damage the reputation of Hoover by doing all of these back-channel projects. And then he’s building the equivalent of a spaceship, the Empire State Building. And he also happens to have 13 children.”Among the supporting cast, there’s Hoover, the technocratic president who rebranded the post-crash “panic” as a “depression”, inadvertently sealing his reputation as a failure, left to watch Franklin D Roosevelt save the day. Sorkin also depicts Winston Churchill, a decade away from his finest hour as British prime minister, in debt to his shirtmaker, playing the Manhattan markets anyway, wandering Fifth Avenue, there to be hit by a car.Financial calamity brings political fallout. In the second half of 1929, Sorkin’s story moves to Washington and attempts to hold Wall Street accountable. As in 2008, most main players avoided serious penalties.Clearly, Sorkin is going to get more questions about what 1929 might teach us about 2025 and aUS economyshowing signs of trauma, Trump-induced or not.He said: “There are a lot of parallels that I imagine people could draw out. I mean, look at the idea today and the idea back then of democratizing finance.”In 1929, “democratizing finance” meant opening the markets to ordinary Americans through unchecked credit.“Today,” Sorkin said, “what do they talk about democratizing finance? They just passed a bill that Trump signed that’s going to allow private equity and venture capital and private credit into your 401(k) plan. That’s all about democratizing finance. Crypto is now a thing that’s about democratizing finance. Obviously, the tariffs are almost a super-direct parallel.”Another Trump obsession, bending the central bank to his will, is also foreshadowed in Sorkin’s book.“There’s the whole debate the Fed is having in the spring of 1929 about whether to raise or lower interest rates,” Sorkin said. “To some degree, [there are] even debates about the independence of the Fed … So I think there’s lots of things that do seem familiar.”1929 isoutnowExplore more on these topicsBooksBusiness and finance booksEconomicsEconomic policyUS economyStock marketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a shame then that her latest work, We Caliban, inspired by The Tempest, doesn’t manage to convey her rich ideas around this key character. We begin with a letter from Elizabeth I to Walter Raleigh from 1584, giving him licence to set out and conquer foreign lands, then maps of Caribbean islands, their original names crossed out and replaced with Anguilla, Grenada, Barbuda. Jeyasingh’s postcolonial take on the text seems clear, Prospero the invader forcing native Caliban into servitude. But having established this on stage, the idea dissipates into something much more impressionistic, the conceptual thrust is lost. We’re led into a story and then left stranded, like a Milanese duke and his daughter on a remote island.View image in fullscreenTender connection … Shobana Jeyasingh Dance: We CalibanPhotograph: Foteini ChristofilopoulouJeyasingh’s dancing is always well wrought. Her background is in the Indian classical form bharatanatyam, melded with western contemporary dance, and she has a classicist’s feel for proportion and precision, an acute (no pun intended) sense of angle and line. Character is less of a concern – the dancers aren’t “acting”, as such – and the effect is flat. Prospero, with his book and his staff, controls in fairly benign fashion. Caliban gets more interesting. Dancer Raúl Reinoso Acanda (formerly of Cuba’s Acosta Danza) has two key duets: first with Miranda, where there is resistance, or resentment, perhaps, but also a connection between them that leads to tenderness. Then after the colonists have left, a second enigmatic duet (with an unnamed woman, one of the island’s original inhabitants). This one is cool and careful, the two are fascinated, yet wary and distant – their fingers only just touching in a long stretched pose. They look at the audience rather than each other, but they seem to have a kind of mutual understanding. What’s going on here? The fallout, perhaps of trying to rebuild yourself when you’ve been stripped of what was essentially you? Caliban now trying to work out how to be himself, how to live, how to trust?The music, by Thierry Pécou, is an unpredictable patchwork of melodies, textures, sounds and silences, which never lets you get comfortable; fitting for a work that’s frustratingly hard to get a handle on.AtWarwick Arts Centre, 21 Oct; further tour dates to be announced in spring 2026.Explore more on these topicsDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes they are forcibly toppled, such as in the case of 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, whose bronze statue wasrolled into Bristolian waters in 2020. But several years before that, there was protest over Yale University’s Calhoun College, named in honour of 19th-century alumnus, John C Calhoun, a white supremacist and zealous advocate of slavery (the college was renamed after Grace Murray Hopperin 2017).The demand for its renaming is the subject of this debut play by writer-actor Jamie Bogyo, who is a Yale alumnus himself. A fictive statue of Calhoun sets the culture wars into full swing; a petition, organised by Omar (Ivan Oyik), is circulating the dorms. Connor (Bogyo) is its main opponent. He rails against virtue signalling and snowflakes, but insists he is not racist (“I voted for Obama”). He also tries to co-opt his Black room-mate, Isaiah (Ernest Kingsley Jr), for his cause. Meanwhile, Connor’s girlfriend, Annabelle (Céline Buckens), who comically manifests all the signs of white guilt, has ambitions to become president of Yale’s Women’s Leadership, but is pipped by freshman Stacy (Bola Akeju).View image in fullscreenStatue toppling … Bola Akeju and Céline Buckens.Photograph: Helen MurrayIt is a lively setup which tries to wrestle with intersecting themes of race, gender and privilege, with dynamic direction from Roy Alexander Weise and lovely a cappella interludes. But the tone seems that of a broad campus comedy, complete with sophomoric sex, joshing and a silly masturbation scene. The Obama era language might be emphatic but feels dated.Omar is made to seem goofy so that he resembles a sitcom character rather than an anti-racist firebrand with a blind-spot around gender. Stacy is overplayed as the ambitious Black student from the wrong side of the tracks and Connor is converted to the liberal cause after a single argument with Isaiah, while Isaiah’s own turn to a more politicised Black identity also feels too abrupt.Connor as a whole seems too nice, too apologetic, to be the hard-right nemesis he is supposed to be, so there is not enough tension between characters. You get the impression that they would all be part of the No Kings campaign if they were students today.There are a few strong scenes, such as an argument between Omar and Isaiah but not all of its grenades detonate. The a cappella remains a pleasure; Connor and Isaiah make good their rifts through music and both Bogyo and Kingsley Jr sing exquisitely, but the question of whether a Simon & Garfunkel song can save this friendship at the end does not carry quite the emotions it should.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreChichester Festival theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

And yet here I was, about to embark on an epic journey, unsupported, towing a trailer with two wooden surfboards, a tent and wetsuits strapped to it. My wife, Lizzy, 62, and I had rented out our house and lent our campervan to friends, so there was no turning back.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

She, the veteran of many long rides in her 20s – one of which took her across the Andes – was full of quiet confidence. I was excited beyond words to be setting off on a new adventure, but also terrified of what the road might reveal about me. I had no idea whether my 57-year-old body or soul could cope with cycling for days on end, climbing mountains or setting up a tent every night for three months. My first attempt at a mountain pass, in the Pyrenees some years before, hadn’t started well. I threw a hissy fit at the first hairpin, demanding of Lizzy: what’s the point?View image in fullscreenAs our route out of Roscoff took us down a narrow, overgrown track with brambles brushing our legs and panniers, I started to wonder what we had got ourselves into. Would we have to ride on paths like this all the way? What were we thinking?The plan was to cycle from home in Cornwall to Cape St Vincent in Portugal, Europe’s most south-westerly point, surfing as we went. The journey, I reckoned, would be at least 1,900 miles (over 3,000km). I had travelled to surf in Europe many times before, but only in a campervan and, in my late teens and 20s, a series of clapped-out cars.Travelling by bike would give us the kind of access to beaches that is impossible todayMy friends and I went to Europe to surf, drink cheap red wine, smoke Gauloises and live out our Californian Beach Boys fantasies. We were following in the footsteps of those who had made the trip in the 1960s and 1970s, leaving the UK to surf in the sun on world-class waves. In time, the journey became a rite of passage for all surfers: get beaten up in the powerful French shore breaks, find new waves in northern Spain and lose yourself on the wild coasts of Portugal.The prospect of doing it all again, but this time on two wheels, thrilled me. I had become disillusioned with travelling by van and needed time out. I loved the idea of chasing waves without the faff and environmental impact of van life and wondered if living with less would make me happier. Would stripping back to basics – a surfboard, a wetsuit, a tent, a meths cooker and a change of clothes – make for a bigger, more meaningful adventure?View image in fullscreenMartin and Lizzy took the ferry to Roscoff, Brittany.Photograph: Eyewave/Getty ImagesTravelling by bike, I argued while planning this trip, would allow us to follow the old roads and forgotten paths our surfing forefathers had travelled and give us the kind of access to beaches that is impossible today.Eventually the bumpy lanes outside Roscoff gave way to smooth, flowing tarmac, following the course of a muddy river, and we cruised along easily, our trailers rumbling happily behind us. Dare I hope it would all be fine?The truth was, at that point, I doubted I was up to the adventure. In 2023 I had severed my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), an injury that left me in a knee brace and on crutches for weeks. In the early days of recovery, I feared I’d never surf again.The NHS consultant told me “most people your age manage perfectly well without an ACL”. I felt the sharp sting of ageism. But I wasn’t ready to be written off just yet. I had the ligament repaired privately and, when the surgeon recommended cycling for rehab, I took him at his word.Riding ebikes made the trip possible. The psychological effect of knowing I had a little in the tank if things got difficult worked wonders, even if we rode in the mode that delivered the least power most of the time.We followedLa Vélodyssée, an 800-mile, mostly off-road cycle route down the west coast of France to Hendaye on the border with Spain, joining the Nantes-Brest canal for the first 190 miles. The riding was mostly flat and we bimbled along happily. I loved the attention we got: I guess there weren’t many middle-aged cyclists pulling surfboards along the towpath.View image in fullscreenSeignosse in the far south-west of France was the location for the first proper surfing on the trip.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyAt about 6pm each day – after about five hours in the saddle – we’d stop at a campsite, cook and collapse on to our blow-up beds. We’d prebooked some sites but mostly took our chances that something would turn up. On the one occasion it didn’t, we checked in to a hotel.

When we finally found some good waves, at Seignosse, a little north of surfing’s spiritual European home, Biarritz, hitting them was all the more satisfying.Spain, and her terrible hills, gave us a shock after the level paths through France’s maritime pine forest. Just after crossing the border we climbedJaizkibel mountainin rain and fog. It was a 5-mile slog from sea level to 450 metres, en route to San Sebastián. I resisted the urge to press the ebike’s power button despite it being a “classic climb” that has been featured in the Tour de France and Spain’s equivalent, La Vuelta.When I reached the top, I was wet, cold and exhausted – but elated. If it hadn’t been so misty, I could have looked back at France behind me and seen how far we had come. We had ridden 870 miles since leaving home and I had loved it. I had surfed some excellent waves too, at Biarritz and Hendaye, as well as Seignosse, and had got my mojo back after months out of the water. I decided it was just like riding a bike: you never forget how to do it. I was definitely ready for the more serious Iberian waves to come.View image in fullscreenMartin celebrates conquering a 600-metre mountain in Galicia.Photograph: Martin Dorey‘Smiles not miles’: a Scottish cycling tour all about enjoyment, not enduranceRead moreAfter Jaizkibel, my legs were tuned up and I was starting to relish this life-affirming trip that would see us follow the coasts of Spain and Portugal for another 1,200 miles over the next two months. We surfed some hallowed spots at Mundaka, Peniche and the World Surfing Reserve at Ericeira; mended multiple punctures; pitched our tent 67 times; climbed another 20,000 metres; and completed two legs of the Camino de Santiago. Arriving in Praza do Obradoiro, the main square in Santiago de Compostela old town, was a highlight. But we still had another 500 miles to go to our final destination of Sagres in the Algarve.I may not be as fit as I was in my 20s – but the thrill of adventure remains the same.Martin Dorey’s book about the adventure, The Way of the Waves, is published by Bloomsbury Sport (£20) on 11 September.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Also known variously as “breakfast casserole” and “egg dish”, strata is an American brunch favourite that, according to the great US chefSohla El-Waylly, is best described as “the love child of frittata and bread pudding”, while the dish’s name comes from the fact that it’s assembled in layers. Like all the best leftovers recipes, those layers are eminently flexible, but what all strata have in common are stale bread and eggs. The rest is largely up to you.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ll be honest, rich as it is, strata is not something I’d tackle before lunchtime, so I was relieved to read the lateJames Villas explainthat, “in the South, a strata is traditionally served on an informal dinner buffet or at a casual supper”. Whenever you plan to enjoy it, however, note that, as per America’s favourite cookbook,The Joy of Cooking, if need be the ever amenable strata “can be assembled and refrigerated overnight, then baked the next day, leaving you nothing to do but brew the coffee”. Or mix the bloody marys.The breadThis recipe should comfortably accommodate any savoury bread you wish to use up – rye bread, corn bread, even garlic bread will all give your strata a slightly different character – though I’d avoid anything too delicate, such as brioche.Samuel Goldsmith suggestssliced baguette in the spinach and tomato version in his Tinned Tomatoes Cookbook, there’s a smoked salmon one with bagels onFood52andmultiplecroissant-based takes online.Most writers, however, call for either a “quality white sandwich loaf” or “supermarket-style ‘French’ or ‘Italian’ bread”, for which I use a supermarket ciabatta. I prefer the more robust, chewy texture of the latter, or sourdough; the white tin loaf all but dissolves into the custard, especially when used fresh. For this reason, I’ve suggested crisping the slices up in the oven first. Arlyn Osborne,writes on Serious Eatsthat drying the bread in the oven “extracts moisture while leaving the crumb’s structure intact, making oven-dried bread a better option than stale bread”. She adds thatthe restructuringof starch molecules during the staling process makes for tough, rather than crunchy bread. However, this is first and foremost a recipe that’s about using up leftovers, so if you have thoroughly stale bread already, by all means skip that step – it will still be good.View image in fullscreenArlyn Osborne oven-dries her bread, rather than using stale bread, which ‘extracts moisture while leaving the crumb’s structure intact’.Most strata involve cubes of bread, which is odd, because, as Villas notes rather tartly, “if the primary ingredients are not arranged in alternate layers, the dish is not a genuine strata but an ordinary casserole”. Thick slices will,as Cooks Illustrated observes, help keep the layers intact and make for a neater end result. (Again, if you’re using a loaf that doesn’t lend itself to slicing, just cut or tear it into chunks instead.)The custardThe recipes I try are divided between those who make their strata with an enriched white sauce thickened with flour, such as Villas’ and chef and writer Amy Thielen’s; and those, such as Cooks Illustrated, Osborne and Melissa Clark in the New York Times, who prefer an egg custard (which seems to be the more common modern choice). The benefit of the former is that it’s cheaper, less temperamental and can be made as rich or plain as you like simply by adjusting the number of eggs you beat in at the end. But a dish of bread baked with a starchy sauce could be accused of being rather stodgy, especially first thing in the morning. The custards are more delicate and almost quiche filling-like in the case of those containing heavy cream (the US equivalent of British whipping cream.Because this is, in theory, a breakfast dish, I’ve come down on the egg custard side of the argument, but my testers find some examples offputtingly “fluffy”, bringing back traumatic memories, they claim, of school dinner flans. I put that down to the high milk content – the more water in the emulsion, the more risk of it breaking in the heat of the oven. Mixing the milk with something that’s higher in fat, such as cream, is good insurance, and makes for a firm, silky result rather than a watery, weepy one. I’ve gone for tangy creme fraiche, but any thick cream will do the job.View image in fullscreenAmy Thielen favours an egg custard, and includes layers of sliced, cooked eggs.Thielen brings some Minnesota flairto the “egg dish” in her book The New Midwestern Table by including layers of sliced, cooked eggs rather than whisking raw ones into the sauce. However, although we enjoy the rest of her dish, the baked hard-boiled eggs are deemed a bit dry and rubbery; Clark’s idea of cracking raw eggs on to the top of the strata halfway through baking feels a better choice if you’d like extra protein.The flavourings and ingredientsStrata are a good vehicle for more than old bread – leftover vegetables, meat scraps and ends of cheese can all go in, so it’s worth bookmarking this recipe for Twixmas. The recipes I try use spinach (both fresh and frozen) baby leaves, curly kale, ham, bacon, leek and mushrooms, as well as soft goat’s cheese and several sorts of hard stuff including gruyere, mild cheddar and parmesan. The golden rule is, as so often in baking, to make sure you get rid of as much water as possible before introducing them to the other ingredients, which means pre-cooking the vegetables. (Loth as I am to disagree with the great Villas’ The Glory of Southern Cooking, raw mushrooms do tend to leak a lot of water, frying the bacon and so on.Clark’s recipe whizzes greens (baby kale, mustard greens, chard) and herbs into the custard itself, turning it a vibrant green, which looks great, though my testers and I miss the texture of the layer of leaves. She also introduces parmesan to the custard itself, which, if you want cheese to be more of a seasoning than a star player, is a great idea. If you hanker for the stretchy pull of melted cheese, however, then deploy a milder, softer variety as a layer in its own right; gruyere, emmental, red leicester, double gloucester or a medium cheddar are all ideal candidates, but, again, it’ll work with just about any combination you have handy. Match your seasonings to the ingredients: mustard, Tabasco, fresh thyme … if it wouldn’t be out of place in a quiche, or folded into scrambled eggs, it’s a fairly safe bet in a strata, too.View image in fullscreenMelissa Clark’s strata whizzes greens and herbs into the custard, turning it a vibrant greenI’ve gone for a classic combination of spinach (this is a great place for the frozen variety), leek and cheese, with a grating of nutmeg, but replace those as you see fit; an easy way to judge how much you need of a particular ingredient is simply to scatter it across the base of the baking dish to see if you can get two layers out of it. Garlic and nutmeg feel inevitable with spinach, but if it’s too early in the day for the former as far as you’re concerned, you could always leave it out, or indeed replace it with spring onion, shallot or a mild red onion.If you’re thinking of having this for lunch or dinner, you might also want to consider replacing some of the liquid in the custard with chicken or vegetable stock, or flavouring it with a few spoonfuls of dry white wine reduced by half, as in Cook’s Illustrated’s recipe; both give it a slightly more complex, dare I say sophisticated flavour profile. No one wants that at breakfast time.The resting and cookingThielen is the only one not to give the custard a chance to soak into the bread before baking, proving that if you’re running late, the situation is not irretrievable. That said, the layers will hold together better if they’re left to sit – I don’t find much difference between Cook’s Illustrated’s single hour and Villa’s six, and you can even leave them to mingle overnight, if you wish, preferably with a weight on top to help with more crisply defined strata.As with anything custard-based, keep the oven temperature moderate to avoid it curdling – 160C ((140C fan)/325F/gas 3) rather than the 180C ((160C fan)/350F/gas 4) called for by many recipes – and leave it to rest before serving, because eggs taste far better warm than hot.Strata doesn’t freeze well, but it can be made a day ahead. These quantities can be easily scaled up or down, too.Perfect strataPrep20 minChill1 hr +Cook1 hr 50 minServes4-6About 250g bread– I like sourdough or ciabatta1 tbsp olive oil1 small leek, trimmed and finely sliced250g frozen spinach, defrosted, or about 500g fresh spinach, wilted in a large pan with a splash of water2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedSalt and black pepper6 eggs100gfull-fat creme fraiche, or double cream175ml whole milkNutmegButter or oil, for greasing100g grated cheese(eg, gruyere, emmental, medium cheddar)Unless your bread is already rock hard and crunchy, heat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/gas ½.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Birmingham’s dining scene often leans towards the intense. I recall a hazy afternoon seven years back at theDigbeth Dining Club, a ramshackle food market inside an old factory with few seats, loud music, breakfast cocktails and baos; it was a thoroughly chaotic way to take on board calories. More recently, I loved the city’sAlbatross Death Cult, which served 12 courses of scintillating, seafood-focused finickiness to a pounding, darkwave industrial-goth soundtrack.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And, now, it is the turn of 670 Grams to bombard my senses Brummie-style, in Digbeth’sCustard Factory development. Chef Kray Treadwell began cooking at the city’s well-loved and much-missedPurnell’s, followed by a stint at Michael O’Hare’sThe Man Behind The Curtainin Leeds. By 2021, he had been namedMichelin’s UK young chef of the yearafter creating, with head chef Sacha Townsend (also formerly of several O’Hare projects), this kooky, monochromatic, moody restaurant that plays semi-loud hip-hop.View image in fullscreen670 Grams, Birmingham: ‘Bombard your senses Brummie-style.’The decor is kitsch crypt, and very dark in places, with not a single 50-watt bulb in the house. The bathroom is purposefully styled with all the cosiness of Renton’s“worst toilet in Scotland” in Trainspotting. No actual overflowing toilets, I stress, but every wall festooned in graffiti and a toilet roll holder made out of a Polaroid camera. Pre-drinks in 670 Grams’ lobby, meanwhile, take place around fancy coffee tables and surrounded by moody art. It all feels a bit like being in an exclusive 1980s Soho hotel during a power cut.Restaurants such as this – edgy, ballsy, disruptive – will always be a difficult sell to some audiences. The menu, which is painstakingly executed over six or 12 courses, is a cascade of small, meaningful bowls – an earthy bone broth here, a sliver of Jemison Park trout there – all of which just ooze flavour and, like all the best superheroes, turn up with an origin story. Meat and two veg this is not. Instead, expect the likes of a glossy half-inch of eggless custard-topped carabinero prawn with a smear of sambal and a sharp hit of lime, which is odd and delightful in equal measures. Similarly intriguing is a chunk of Cornish bluefin tuna in a froth of eel milk with a little jersey royal potato. Can you milk an eel? Is it the new new dairy alternative?View image in fullscreen‘Odd and delightful in equal measures’: 670 Grams’ carabinero with prawn head caramel and savoury custard.Courses turn up at a steady pace, brought by both Treadwell himself and his very capable staff. One highlight is two voluptuous, wobbling barbecued Cornish mussels in a Thai-ish turmeric sauce with a sweet hit of caramel apple; they are served with “sourdough” that is more like a crouton. 670 Grams is not a place to arrive famished and hoping for a slap-up. Rather, it is very clearly a journey, an exploration, a culinary art exhibition or a high-concept dining experience, or indeed any of those other terms I’ve ever used to define dinners of this kind (of which I’ve eaten hundreds), where chefs cook at a sublime level, but dish up such minuscule amounts.The bottom line, however, is: would I remember this fancy-schmancy teensy dinner? And the answer is a resounding yes: there is something wildly likable about Peterhead Market cod laced with koji onion and sesame cauliflower, and a brief but meaningful portion of Staffordshire texel lamb cooked in jerk-influenced spices and served with a slice of barbecued hispi cabbage. The lamb comes with a rich sauce made from sheep’s milk and further hints of that jerk rub. Every element of 670 Grams’ menu is doubtless sketched out, cogitated over and measured to within an inch of its life.View image in fullscreen‘Brief but meaningful’: 670 Grams’ Staffordshire texel jerk lamb with barbecued hispi, sheep’s milk bread and jerk sauce.Any hopes that the dessert courses might provide some much-needed refuge from all this intensity are immediately dashed when they bring out carrot cake with a frosting made of lamb fat. That would have been the point when my old Aunt Pat, God rest her soul, would have clutched her pearls, grabbed her handbag and flounced out mumbling loudly about her Women’s Institute recipe. Being a brave sort, I stayed put, and it turns out that lamb fat does, in fact, work rather nicely in a sweet icing. And isn’t lamb and carrots a classic combo, anyway? Even so, I won’t be looking for lamb-flavoured sponge cakes turning up in a Greggs meal deal any time soon.View image in fullscreen‘Marvellous’: 670 Grams’ tribute to Cadbury’s Fruit & Nut bar features Pedro Ximénez-steeped prunes, tulakalum chocolate foam and almonds.The marvellous final course was much safer ground: a tribute to the local Cadbury’s factory and its belovedFruit & Nut bar, albeit one made with tulakalum grand cru chocolate, prunes steeped in pedro ximénez and almonds.
