Caravaggio’s CupidWallace Collection, London, until 12 AprilJust one painting but it is one of the world’s very greatest, and most dangerous. The shock of the old hits you in front of a naked Cupid who has clearly been portrayed from life, his raw, laughing features apparently coming straight from the mean streets into the gallery. This young love god is an anarchist, and Caravaggio paints like the antichrist, mocking civilisation, symbolised by the musical instruments at Cupid’s feet. Love doesn’t so much conquer all as destroy everything. See it, then try to forget it.2.Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of PaintingView image in fullscreenBacon reborn … Drift, 2020-2022, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates/Jenny Saville/DACS/GagosianNational Portrait Gallery, LondonGiant wounded faces have haunted me since I saw this formidable, almost surgical examination of Saville’s paintings. She emerges as the bloodstained, meaty successor to Freud and Bacon, a painter of modern flesh whose eye-popping variations of scale and searching human compassion make for a mighty artist. Yet Saville can be gentle as well as scary. Her intimate studies of motherhood and Degas-like pastels of lovers draw you in deeply. An artist in full, who can awe you or melt your heart as she looks openly at life.3.Theatre PicassoTate Modern, London, until 12 AprilThe surreal staging of this exhibition in a mockup of a proscenium arch theatre – playing with the very tradition of perspective that Picasso abolished, with a vista of his paintings dramatically lit on stage flats – is like something the surrealists might have come up with. Picture it as Marcel Duchamp curating Picasso. It beautifully returns his masterpieces to their avant garde origins. Free from reverence, the savage dream of The Three Dancers – and The Acrobat’s impossible yet human, all-too-human body – explode with all their original revolutionary power. A liberation, a joy and the kind of show that puts Tate Modern back up where it belongs.4.Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty YearsView image in fullscreenOak Passage and Dock Drawing, both 2025, by Andy Goldsworthy at the Royal Scottish Academy.Photograph: Stuart ArmittRoyal Scottish Academy, EdinburghFrom the rug of shorn fleeces on the gallery steps, past a barbed-wire screen and into an eerie room laid with stones from a cemetery that made it feel as cold as death, this exhibition was uncannily gripping. Goldsworthy has been making his environmental art for five decades and yet this show stressed his brilliant new works. It proved the power of art to bring the country into the city, to take you into lonely places of the imagination with installations of Romantic solitude. He should be invited to work in the Tate Turbine Hall next.5.Hamad Butt: ApprehensionsWhitechapelArtGallery, LondonThe infra-thin barrier between life and death – as fragile as a glass bulb full of poison gas – haunted this exhibition that resurrected a lost genius. Butt was part of the Goldsmiths-educated generation of Young British Artists in the early 1990s, but his premature death led to him being forgotten. The marvellously morbid installations here included live flies in a work he created before Damien Hirst used them, and a piece that endangered your eyesight. In his most sublime masterpiece, beautiful but deadly alchemical bottles are suspended in a giant executive toy.6.Siena: The Rise of PaintingView image in fullscreenThe Wedding at Cana, about 1308-11, by Duccio.Photograph: Museo dell’Opera della Metropolitana, Siena/© Foto Studio Lensini SienaNational Gallery, LondonThis exhibition glowed with gold and pulsed with feeling. It made you understand why the medieval poet Petrarch asked Simone Martini of Siena to portray his beloved Laura, for this great artist stood out here as a true poet in paint. It was in 14th-century Siena that the Renaissance truly began as Martini, Duccio and the Lorenzetti brothers brought subtle, sensitive expression to the human face and body. This acute, even profound show made you see their genius for infusing sharply observed reality with mysticism.7.Ancient IndiaBritish Museum, LondonPicasso would have loved this exhibition that showed how limited and closed the western sense of form has often been. Why limit statues to four limbs and reserve sculptural empathy for human faces? Elephant-headed figures and snake goddesses abounded in this ecstatic journey to the beginnings of Indian art and its relationship with Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Stunning masterpieces like the Great Shrine of Amaravati made for a thrilling and illuminating magical mystery tour.8.Peter Doig: House of MusicView image in fullscreenPeter Doig: House of Music at the Serpentine  Gallery.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates/Peter Doig/ SerpentineSerpentine, London, until 8 FebruaryA painter whose art has often echoed music – from titles evoking country rock and scenes that look like eerie 1970s album covers to the depictions of fantastical sound systems and solitary guitarists in this show – finally does what you suspect he always dreamed of doing and turns an exhibition into a gig, or club, or festival. Giant sound systems cannibalised from old cinemas pump out his record collection as you mistily dream into his paintings. Even if you bring earplugs, the paintings alone will make you want to dance.9.Diane Arbus: Sanctum SanctorumDavid Zwirner, LondonWhat were they thinking? Why did nudists in 1960s New Jersey let the unforgiving eye of Arbus into their world? Come to think of it why did anyone pose for her? She’s Diane Arbus! She’s going to make you look like a freak! But this exhibition revealed how many people did trust her and let her into their private bedrooms and camping huts. It proved her a great modern artist in the league of Warhol and Bacon. She is one of the few photographers ever to produce such a personal, expressive, tragicomic vision.10.Mat Collishaw: Move 37View image in fullscreenPost-human … Aftermaths by Mat Collishaw.Photograph: Mat CollishawSeed 130, LondonIn Collishaw’s film, Move 37, human civilisation has finally destroyed itself. In the flooded ruins of our world, something is stirring: translucent filaments of artificial life wriggle in the green waters and evolve before your eyes into creatures at once fishlike and instectoid but also inorganic. This vision of post-human, even post-animal life has itself been “evolved” using artificial intelligence tools. Collishaw is one of the few artists engaging deeply (rather than glibly) with AI as he tries to puzzle out if it will save or destroy us.Adrian Searle’s best art shows of the year1.Peter Hujar: Eyes Open in the DarkView image in fullscreenVulnerabilities and vanities … Untitled, 1984, by Peter Hujar.Photograph: Chicago Albumen Works/Peter Hujar Archive/ARS, New York/Pace GalleryRaven Row, LondonOne of the great photographers of the late 20th century, and now the subject of Ira Sachs’s 2025 movie Peter Hujar’s Day starring Ben Whishaw, Peter Hujar’s relentless, beautifully shot black-and-white photographs filled Raven Row early this year. This revelatory show brought out Hujar’s curiosity and his unerring eye, his darkroom skills and his utter seriousness. Rolleiflex camera always in hand, Hujar captured human vulnerabilities and vanities, including his own, a prickly artist, shunning fame. New York wreathed in fog, light on the river, life and death: his subjects had no end. My show of the year.2.Ed AtkinsTate Britain, LondonLife, hilarious and hapless and interrupted, was all there in this wildly inventive exhibition that took us from scenes starring the artist’s avatar to the grim daily rounds of medieval life. At every turn there was something new: one minute Atkins at the piano, then in intimate conversation with his mother, then his entire life collapsing down a sinkhole. Jokes and intimacies abounded, with drawings of feet, Post-it cartoon notes sent to his daughter, and a long film in which actor Toby Jones reads the diaries of Atkins’s dying father. Throughout, real life came crashing in.3.Kerry James Marshall: The HistoriesRoyal Academy, London, until18 JanuaryA revelation. In this fascinating retrospective we chart Marshall’s development from quasi-conceptualist to the pre-eminent painter of Black American life and aspiration. He leads us back to imagined images of enslavement in Africa, to elegaic scenes in the housing projects and to gaggles of black schoolkids in the museum. Shuttling between uneasy nights in stuffy rooms, Afrofuturist fantasies of space travel, parlours filled with mementos of JFK and Martin Luther King and visions of imperious, imaginary female black painters at their easels.4.Gerhard RichterFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, until2 MarchNow 93, Richter can appear conservative and radical at the same time. His works could be at one moment laden with pictorial and cultural references, the next revelling in abstractions. His is an art filled with calculation and unreason, making this an exhilarating and sometimes moving show. Culminating in a room dedicated to his attempts, in 2014, to capture the horrors of Birkenau, this is more than another run-through of Richter’s long career. With his deep ambivalence about images and an equally enduring belief in art’s capacity to endure, this profound exhibition is unmissable.5.Bridget Riley: Learning to SeeView image in fullscreenProliferating complexities … Streak 3, 1980, by Bridget Riley.Photograph: John Webb/Bridget RileyTurner Contemporary, Margate, until4 MayThe vertical and horizontal stripes, the dance of coloured circles on the walls, the shimmering and the undulating, the ordering and reordering, the sneaky angles and the tones too close to call: you think you know Bridget Riley’s art and then, when you give yourself to it, all the certainties fall away. This show is just the right size to keep you grounded and alert to its proliferating complexities. You just might want to stay all day.6.Claire Fontaine: Show LessMimosa House, LondonHeartfelt pleas, smuggled messages from a Yemeni prison and painted, neon obscenities ricochet in Claire Fontaine’s Show Less. In this complex exhibition, filled with tumbling references and bringing together the surging news cycle, Marcel Duchamp’s casual sexism and multiple, adulterated copies of Courbet’s salacious 1866 painting L’Origine du Monde, Claire Fontaine (Fulvia Carnevale and James Thornhill) fill the gallery with anger, erudition, humour and hope.Charlotte Jansen’s best UK photography shows of the year1.Lee MillerTate Britain, London,until 15 FebuaryMiller is most famous for her war photographs and her fashion pictures, but the sheer, staggering scope of this retrospective at Tate Britain – the most extensive Miller show to date – proved there is to see and understand about her surrealist art, and how important her inventions and contributions to history were. Being a good photographer to Miller meant “getting out on a damn limb and sawing it off behind you.” The images are always audacious and never anodyne – you won’t walk away unscathed.2.The Face Magazine: Culture ShiftView image in fullscreenKylie Minogue by Norbert Schoerner.Photograph: Norbert SchoernerNational Portrait Gallery, LondonFilled with room after room of colour, frivolity and neoliberal fun this tribute to the photographic legacy of the Face was an irresistible, riotous romp through two decades of the groundbreaking, experimental magazine’s halcyon days with lacquered lips, bright-white youthful smiles, and cerulean skies – with a bit of medieval fantasy and the odd Tesco bag thrown in.3.Peter Hujar: Eyes Open in the DarkRaven Row, LondonPutrid, petrifying, and vertiginously beautiful, this museum-quality exhibition threw you into the decaying, dank urban streets of downtown New York, but also lifted you to moments of dizzying euphoria and perfect grace. A sharp, feeling, and sublime account of one of the 20th century’s greatest artists. Unforgettable.4.Mahtab Hussain: What Did You Want to See?View image in fullscreenDaddy Shaf by Mahtab Hussain.Photograph: Mahtab HussainIkon, BirminghamFew artists have addressed what it meant for a generation of young Muslim men to grow up in Britain in the aftermath of 9/11 and 7/11 with the caustic, confidence-eroding impact of society’s suspicion and surveillance. Hussain’s thoughtful, inventive and inquiring exhibition reclaims the camera to bring power to a community.5.As We Rise: Photography from the Black AtlanticSaatchi Gallery, LondonCarrie Mae Weems’ skin through a hole torn in her shirt, Afonso Pimenta’s finely dressed families in the favela, Jamel Shabazz’s best friends on the subway, dressed in identical outfits and mirroring each other’s pose. There were so many electric moments in this scintillating show, forging connections through shared geographies and histories, but ultimately evoking something that can’t be contained or imitated, of style, pride and panache.6.Phil PolglazeView image in fullscreenCottaging … from Bog Jobs by Phil Polglaze.Photograph: Phil PolglazeJolly Farmers, OxfordPolglaze didn’t take pictures of public lavatories for 20 years as art – they were used by criminal defence barristers in Section 28 court cases to aid the release of men accused of cottaging. He unwittingly created an important archive that, with the alchemy of time, reveals much about our society’s changing values, attitudes and laws on sex, liberty and truth. You can almost smell the urinals.7. Merry Alpern: Dirty WindowsTramps, LondonArtist Peter Doig and his partner Parinaz Mogadassi bought a derelict boozer near Kings Cross, London, where they put on this scorcher of a show with the Parisian journal Magma: works from Merry Alpern’s controversial 1990s series, shot in secret from her friend Norman’s apartment, looking into the bathroom window of an illegal den of drugs and prostitution frequented by Wall Street workers. The pictures take no prisoners and leave you wondering which is worse: the dirty deeds in the bathroom, or our compulsive voyeuristic tendencies?8. Jennie Baptiste: Rhythm and RootsSomerset House, London,until 4 JanuaryAnother show capturing 1990s nostalgia, Baptiste’s feverishly cool portraits of the stars of dancehall, hip-hop and R&B posture, pose, and jostle for attention in this banger of a show. Baptiste grew up in the era of MTV and HMV, and began taking these pictures in the early 90s. Her pictures have that unique power – her subjects look iconic and untouchable yet they feel easy and familiar, like a glossy poster you had Blu-Tacked to the wall in your teenage bedroom.9.Joy Gregory: Catching Flies With HoneyView image in fullscreenLove of the darkroom … Blonde Contact Sheet by Joy Gregory.Photograph: Joy GregoryWhitechapel Gallery, Londonuntil 1 MarchGregory’s love of the darkroom began as a schoolgirl, and it instilled a lifelong passion for photography. Everything at her gorgeous retrospective at the Whitechapel attests to her fascination with beauty and precarity. It’s rich in experimentation, with her striking adaptation of Victorian techniques such as cyanotype and salt printing, self-portraiture and film, illustrating her resourcefulness and rigour. Gregory’s work is a national treasure.10. Harley Weir: The GardenHannah Barry Gallery, LondonLife is messy and often cruel. Weir gets this and evoked it so perfectly in this head-spinning, deeply touching show which grappled with ageing, loss, and grief, with new and old pictures, including some smirched with the egg-freezing treatment letrozole, and intimate pictures of the artist’s dad, who was diagnosed with Benson’s disease, a degenerative disorder affecting visual recognition. Weir is a brilliant, provocative photographer of the sensual, the sexual and the bodily but is always asking profound questions about life and what we give our attention to. I walked out in a daze.Eddy Frankel’s best art shows of 20251. Peter Doig: House of MusicSerpentine Gallery, London, until 8 FebruaryPutting some massive speakers in an exhibition so visitors can listen to jazz while looking at your paintings should be a recipe for a gallery covered in spew. The idea is gross. But this isn’t just any painter, and these aren’t just any speakers. The brilliant Doig refurbished a giant old cinema soundsystem for this show at the Serpentine, invited guest DJs to play a bunch of crackly old records, and created a hugely atmospheric love letter to music in the process, filled with some of the darkest and most amazing paintings he’s done in years.2. Wayne Thiebaud: American Still LifeView image in fullscreenGetting viewers salivating … Pie Rows, 1961.Photograph: Wayne Thiebaud/Wayne Thiebaud FoundationCourtauld Gallery, LondonThiebaud knew how to get viewers salivating. The pioneering American pop painter created a world full of delectable cakes, sweets and gumball machines, a universe of treats and candies laid out in American diners and on deli counters. He died in 2021 at 101 years old, and had a huge influence on the development of American art, but this was his first UK institutional exhibition – it’s staggering it took this long. Not only is his work a smart, conceptual takedown of consumerism, capitalism and the American dream, it’s pretty damn beautiful too.3. Arthur Jafa: Glas Negus SupremeSadie Coles HQ, LondonIn 75 years, when future critics start compiling a list of the best artworks of the 21st century, Jafa will be all over it. He’s part-archivist, part-historian, part-DJ, he’s a sampler of visual culture and his show at Sadie Coles HQ was incredible. Combining found imagery of Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and crime scene photos with looped videos of Prince funking out, the whole thing was an ultra-affecting, groovily hypnotic, confrontational paean to black culture’s beauty and endurance.4. Merry Alpern’s Dirty WindowsMcGlynn’s Staff Accommodation, LondonUp in the damp, squalid former staff quarters of this once iconic King’s Cross pub, American artist Alpern delivered a squalid lesson in voyeuristic, shocking photography. The show was based on a series of photos from the 1990s, when Alpern pointed her camera at the back window of a New York gentleman’s club and captured cropped, uncomfortable views of all the sordid activity that takes place in those sorts of private places. Excellently tense photographs, presented in an awesome, unusual gallery space.5. Ed AtkinsView image in fullscreenDisquieting … Hisser by Ed Atkins.Photograph: Markus Tretter/Ed AtkinsTate Britain, LondonLife, what’s it all about? Well, birth, death and a lot of post-it notes, according to British artist Atkins. His big solo exhibition at Tate Britain was as devastating as it was disarming, disconsolate as it was disquieting. He played with CGI, explored painful themes and doodled on thousands of sticky notes. The result was a very contemporary look at mortality, boredom and technology that felt miles away from the staid, conservative painting shows that have dominated UK institutions post-pandemic.6. Anselm Kiefer: Early WorksAshmolean Museum, OxfordThis brilliant show of the German art megastar Kiefer’s first steps, from early photographs to heartwrenching landscape paintings, was proof that he’s dedicated his whole career, right from the start, to confronting the horrors of his nation’s past. Whether referencing German mythology, the music of Wagner or just painting the countryside, everything in this show was tainted by the war and the enduring legacy of Nazism. Not as big or overwhelming as his later, more famous work, but just as powerful.7. Kerry James Marshall: The HistoriesView image in fullscreenWall-to-wall five-star reviews … Untitled (Blanket Couple) by Kerry James Marshall.Photograph: David Zwirner, London/Kerry James MarshallRoyal Academy, LondonThe American painter’s enormous retrospective at the Royal Academy got wall-to-wall five-star reviews. And for good reason. For over 50 years he’s been placing black figures at the centre of his huge canvases, elevating scenes of everyday black life to the level of grand, epic historical painting. Marshall treats his subjects with such heft, such importance, that it’s like seeing the art history canon being rewritten right in front of you. This show was full of contentious ideas, loads of violence, tons of glitter, and a whole bunch of brilliant painting.8. RIP Germain: Anti-Blackness Is Bad, Even the Parts That We LikeCabinet, LondonAs a mild claustrophobe I didn’t love being locked in the police van-shaped coffin at the heart of this powerful, acerbic, polemical exhibition. But young Luton-based artist RIP Germain’s exploration of how pretty much everyone in the UK drill scene has been locked up – via 101 hours of banned rap videos – was so clever, powerful and intense that it was almost worth it. The work wasn’t just about rap and prison, it was about the complicity of western audiences with their thirst for violence, gore, and true crime.9. Santiago Yahuarcani: The Beginning of KnowledgeThe Whitworth, ManchesterYahuarcani – of the Uitoto-Aimeni people of Peru – paints a world of mythical dolphin-human hybrids, rocks with eyes and shamanistic rituals. His show at the Whitworth was an ayahuasca-fuelled exercise in communing with the ancients, a diary of colonial injustices and a warning about imminent ecological collapse, all captured in swirls of psychedelic paint. Indigenous art was one of the big trends of 2025 – there were shows by indigenous artists from all over the world at almost every major UK institution, and Yahuarcani’s was probably the best of the lot.10. I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih: Feels Strangely Good, Ya?View image in fullscreenNo holds barred … Mataku Memandang by I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih Murniasih.Photograph: Danysswara/Gajah Gallery/Estate of I Gusti Ayu Kadek MurniasihNottingham ContemporaryThese days, you can only get away with horny art if it’s about exploring ideas of gender, sexuality or wider identity. But Balinese artist I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih – or Murni to her friends – dealt in pure, balls to the wall, tits out, no holds barred erotic painting. Sure, it was all combined with traditional Balinese aesthetics and spirituality, and a good bit of morbidity to boot (she died in 2006 aged just 39), but at its heart, the show was just about how life is short, so you might as well spend it shagging.Explore more on these topicsArt and design2025 in cultureArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The only escape? A high, narrow window ledgeIt was 1995, and I had spent the evening carousing and drinking neat vodka. Now I was trapped in a friend’s flat in Paris, with no phone – and he had flown to New YorkTim DowlingMon 22 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareWinter 1995: I wake to the sound of a vacuum cleaner repeatedly striking the door near my head. I’m in a small bed in a tiny room. Wherever I am, I’m hungover.I remember: I’m in Paris, after a big night out. Just the one night – I’d arrived on the Eurostar the previous afternoon with a friend. We’d gone out for drinks, then to a cool restaurant, then somewhere to drink more. The rest was blurry, but we ended up back at this apartment – owned by the company my friend worked for – drinking neat vodka until my friend remembered he was catching an early plane to New York.The last thing he’d said as I retreated to the little bedroom off the kitchen was something about the weekly cleaner coming in first thing. If you can sleep through that, he’d told me, you’ll have the place to yourself all morning.I hold a pillow over my throbbing head until the vacuum cleaner retreats. I doze off again. An hour later, I hear the door slam shut. I am alone.My train isn’t until the afternoon, so I dawdle: a long bath, two black coffees, a snoop through the cupboards. It’s an elegant apartment, with big windows and parquet floors, but it’s also under-furnished and a little soulless. I decide to spend my remaining time walking around Paris.I put on my coat, shoulder my bag and head for the door. I turn the handle and pull, but nothing happens. I try turning it the other way. Nothing. I examine the door: it has a big security lock at its centre, which appears to drive bolts into the door frame – top, bottom and both sides. Evidently the cleaner has engaged it from the outside, locking me in. To open it, you need a key.I decide not to panic. There is, I’ve noticed, a bowl full of keys on the kitchen table. Methodically, I try each on the door in turn. When none of them fits, I try them all again. And a third time.The telephone, I discover, isn’t connected (some people had mobiles in 1995; not me). I look out of the window, where Paris is going about its business, four floors down. I can’t remember the French word for help, and anyway, I wouldn’t be prepared to shout it to the whole street below – not yet. I try to calculate how long it might take for desperation to override embarrassment. A day? Two?At this point, I embrace panic. I spend some time – maybe an hour – walking in circles around the flat making an involuntary keening sound, not really expecting a result. Amazingly, I get one anyway: the bell rings.We’re separated by 20ft of narrow ledge. After a long moment of hesitation, I put on my coat, grab my bag and climb outI run to the door and pick up the entry phone: it’s a postman asking to be buzzed into the building so he can leave a parcel. In a mix of French and English, I try to strike a deal with him: I will buzz you in if you rescue me. I can hear how mad I sound, and I can also hear his voice getting fainter as he backs away from the speaker. My only remaining strategy is to wait to be reported missing.I go back to circling. An indeterminate amount of time passes. At some point I return to the little bedroom off the kitchen which, I notice, has a window that looks on to the courtyard behind the building. I open it. The courtyard is deserted, so I practise calling for help. The first attempt emerges as a choked whisper. Gradually I increase the volume, until I’m yelling. After the fifth effort, a little man appears at a window in the building opposite.“What is it?” he says.“I’m trapped in this apartment!” I shout.“What can I do?” he says. This strikes me as a very good question.On my instructions the man comes down to the front door. I buzz him in; he walks up four flights and opens the stairwell window. We’re now separated by 20ft of narrow ledge. After a long moment of hesitation, I put on my coat, grab my bag and climb out.My new friend is not encouraging – he wants no part of this. He thinks, at the very least, I should let go of my bag. But I think watching it fall four stories to smash on the cobbles below will be bad for morale. I hold the bag close to my chest, inching along the ledge crabwise, 5ft, 10ft, 15ft.I reach the corner, where the ledge takes a 90 degree inward turn. There’s a drainpipe to step round, clinging with one hand. From there it’s possible to shuffle to a point where I can more or less throw myself through the window, into his arms.I shake his hand, and thank him profusely. Then I run: down the stairs, down the street, away.The lesson I draw from this episode changes every couple of years. Initially it felt like a triumph – I didn’t even miss my train. Later on I thought of myself as merely lucky, and also an idiot. Eventually I came to regard it as an example of how, when faced with a choice between doing something humiliating and doing something life-threatening, you sometimes end up doing both. Best, when possible, to pick just one.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMy big night outFriendshipFrance holidaysFrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What a shame Labour wavers about saying soMon 22 Dec 2025 12.06 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 13.18 ESTShareWarning. This column contains good news, when it is an (un)truth widely acknowledged that only grim stories attract public attention. News must be something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed, says the old maxim. Well, battalions of interests want to suppress good news: the overwhelmingly Tory or Reform UK press and antisocial media sites don’t want any stories to surface that might do credit to aLabourgovernment.Among this deluge of disinformation and malevolence, when asked, a sour and disengaged electorate struggles to think of anything good this government has done. True, the prime minister and his cabinet are partly to blame for failing to tell their story, paint their picture, draw us a map of where they are going and why. They too often do good by stealth, afraid of what the right and business might say if they dare trumpet the strong social justice themes that drive most of what they do. But lay out what the government has done and there it is, plain as a pikestaff. There have been blunders, missteps, bad timing and wrongheaded manifesto pledges, but follow the money to define its identity. What has Labour raised from whom and how was it spent? That’s what historians will look for.Labour inherited destitute, austerity-stricken public services that voters expected to be healed overnight by a “change” government, despite a stagnant economy, deep debt, unfunded policies and an empty Treasury. Forget Harold Wilson’s verity that a week can be a long time in politics – a year and a half is not very long for the radical changes the government has made already.The list has to begin with Labour’s forever priority: children come first – this time with free breakfasts, cheaper uniforms and 500,000 more qualifying for free school meals in England, and 550,000 due to be lifted out of poverty across the UK with the abolition of thepernicious two-child limit. Nurseries for all is a liberation for families – and crucially a great educational boost, so let’s welcome 1,000 newBest Startfamily hubs in England, resurrecting the Blair-Brown flagship Sure Start policy. Many may not notice, but unsurprisingly I’m told Labour’s own polling finds that families with young children certainly do, when free childcare makes some half a million English families as much as£7,500 a year per child better off. It may take time to percolate, but these policies are monumental. Also in England you can add to that the restoration of arts to the school curriculum, and the start of a revived youth service with250 youth centres, newFE colleges, extraconstruction coursesandapprenticeships. This is familiar Labour turf: children come first.Other forever Labour beliefs are becoming visible, too: the railways are being renationalised, with rail and bus fares frozen in England, and pay-per-mileroad pricingfor all electric cars by 2028, to help promote public transport. The Employment Rights Act is a founding Labour principle, vastly improving working conditions in England, Scotland and Wales: how were zero-hours contracts ever permitted where people get no notice of their hours or wages each week, unions are barred from workplaces and workforces fired and rehired on worse pay? A new chapter has begun for millions of workers.Of course, business and its press protest – as they do about aUK minimum wage raisedby 6.7% in year one, plus another 4.1% in April. That’s a shift in power towards the workforce, after decades of money and muscle transferred to employers, causing soaring inequality. The government braved tidal waves of industry anger when employers, not workers, were made to pay an extra £25bn in national insurance. Yet the message of a pro-worker government fails to reach its target. Instead, a belligerent head of Unite is now joined by an even more anti-government new Unison leader, making a threat to Labour that, “never again will weprop up politicians hostile to unions”, despite this being the most pro-union government since 1979.The NHS staggers on – but with more than 2,000 extra GPs and 170 newcommunity diagnostic centres, waiting times havestarted to fall. Net migration has fallen steeply bytwo-thirds(which maynot be good news), but small boat arrivals rising is bad news. Wages have risen bymore than prices, but people don’t feel it yet. The Renters’ Rights Act protects 11 million private tenants in England from no-fault evictions. On spending,the largest sumshave gone to the NHS, towards the building of 1.5m new homes in England, and on green energy investment (£63bn). Animal welfare always gets a boost under Labour, who have now pickeda useful fightwith pro-hunting Reform and the Tories.The right to die bill will pass for England and Wales, thanks to government efforts. Theturn towards Europe accelerates, including rejoining Erasmus – the EU’s education and training programme –last week. Recognising the state of Palestine took too long, but no other UK government did it. For all Donald Trump’s extreme racist abuse of mayor Sadiq Khan, London’s air quality has reachedlegal clean limits for nitrogen oxidefor the first time, crime in the capitalkeeps falling(except for phone theft), and in recent years Khan has surpassed his own targets forbuilding council homes.For flavour, Wandsworth, once Margaret Thatcher’s flagship borough, now has its first Labour council since 1978,its mayor declaring: “As a borough of sanctuary and a safe haven for people who have fled war and persecution, let’s show these youngsters some warmth and love,” as he topped up donations to give every refugee child a £50 Christmas gift, unafraid of Reform-spread refugee hate.There’s plenty more, but what’s the use when this is the most unpopular government led by themost unpopular prime ministerever? (Note that the last four PMs have all been the most unpopular during their tenure). Loathing of leaders and politicians is widespread across Europe, opening the gates to demagogues. Blame the near stagnation since the financial crash all those years ago – but there are glimmers of better times from the Guardian’s economics editor,Heather Stewart, and the Financial Times economics writerChris Giles, who says: “The UK economy is not nearly as bad as you’ve been told”. The doom is overdone.What’s missing, as cabinet ministers now say more loudly, is that red thread signalling the nature of this government. Wavering and wobbling, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were never sure about daring to tell that story, peppering it with Reform-wooing distractions. Late, as ever, Labour seems to be shunningthe Maurice Glasman/Morgan McSweeney formulaof tacking right on some social policies, realising thattwice as many votersare fleeing leftwards as right.Too much is still left undone. Where is electoral reform to protect the democratic future? More than 4 million children are poor, the young are losing hope of owning a home, public services are struggling and everything needs money that isn’t there. This often feels like an unhappy country – angry, grudging, cynical. But don’t underestimate a government that’s doing far more than it gets credit for.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerWorkers' rightsChildrenMinimum wageYoung peopleRenting propertycommentShareReuse this content"

Oxygen Conservation uses Lidar laser scanning, thermal imaging to track deer and photogrammetry to build up 3D images of their estates.“We’ve taken very much a moneyball approach to the environment that’s previously been applied to sport. And that’s where you see all these threads that run through data, sport, high performance, US tech culture. We’ve brought that to the environmental world.”Campaigners and experts in natural capital who have been closely watching Oxygen Conservation’s rapid growth are sceptical about its methodology. They say it is based on significant levels of borrowing and speculative bets on the future value of its investments.Residents near Comrie in the Scottish Highlands, where Oxygen Conservation plans to build a large new 50MW windfarm, and around Dartmoor in south-west England where it bought a large hill farm, have accused the firm of ignoring local concerns and opposition.Josh Doble, the policy director at Community LandScotland, a community-ownership advisory and campaign group, said Oxygen Conservation was the most bullish of a new generation of “mega lairds” accumulating extensive land-holdings.Their profit-driven approach “raised questions about the long-term commitment to restoring nature, rather than treating land as another investible commodity,” Doble said.“If absentee investor landowners own large parts of rural Britain, they must engage with the fact that owning land comes with responsibility. If you have a risky model, you need to be very careful because you’re not just making risky decisions in a boardroom, you’re playing with people’s lives.”Despite insisting Oxygen Conservation would be transparent about its plans and its business model, Stockdale refused to confirm or deny reports from natural capital experts he had already spent £150m and planned to spend another £100m on land.He said he could not say how much he paid the brewing firm BrewDog this summer for its estate at Kinrara near Kingussie or for Dorback because their owners had requested confidentiality.View image in fullscreenThe Kinrara Estate which Oxygen Conservation.  bought from BrewDog.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianCampaigners said withholding the sale price for a Highland estate is unusual, undermined transparency and risked concealing changes in the land market.Its biggest investors include Mark Dixon, a billionaire statistician who holds most of its shares, the self-styled ethical bank Triodos and Tony Bloom, a gambling billionaire who owns Brighton and Hove Albion FC. Bloom is currentlybeing suedin a lawsuit alleging his gambling syndicate used “frontmen” to place bets. It is understood Bloom intends to file a defence to the claim.The latest accounts for its parent company, Oxygen House Group, which is also the majority shareholder in Low Carbon, the firm building its two Scottish windfarms, show the firm has two large bank loans totalling £106m to be repaid by 2033.Its critics point out that the two Scottish estates where it wants to build new 50MW windfarms, at Invergeldie near Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park, and at Blackburn and Hartsgarth estate near Langholm in the Borders, had bank loans worth £20.5m tied to them.Andrew Thompson, who helps run a local group opposing the windfarm, said residents feared those loans meant Oxygen Conservation had to push the windfarm through to pay off that debt, despite well-founded objections to the project from the conservation agency NatureScot and the national park authority. “Otherwise they’re completely screwed,” he said.View image in fullscreenA stream on the Kinrara Estate bought by Oxygen Conservation.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianStockdale claimed Oxygen’s investments are already worth more than £300m, and said its backers could see returns as high as 15% a year because the price of its carbon credits would climb to up to £180 a tonne and its biodiversity net gain credits were already worth £25,000 each.The average price for carbon in the UK last year was £37 a tonne. He said the appetite for premium credits had been proven when Burges Salmon, the law firm which acts for Oxygen Conservation, paid £125 a tonne earlier this year. The civil engineering firm Arup also paid £100 a tonne to a nature capital firm called Nattergal which owns rewilding estates in eastern England this year.He said one way to pay its investors was to sell off its estates after five years or so at a significant profit, with Oxygen Conservation remaining in charge of running the estate.He said wealthy investors including pension funds and international companies were willing to pay well above market rates for these credits, similar to some drivers preferring a Prius over a Ford. European investors were clamouring for Oxygen Conservation to invest on the continent.“We’re taking more risk, we’re pushing this out, we are doing things faster and different. I’ve been able to do that because of an incredible set of investors, an incredible team. Please don’t judge us by the norm, we aren’t trying to be,” Stockdale said.Explore more on these topicsRewildingConservationTrees and forestsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Elegantly shoehorned into the gargantuan hangar that was originally the broadcasting centre for the 2012 Olympics, it’s an Amazon warehouse crammed with global treasures, setting visitors off on an odyssey of “curated transgression” through an immersive cabinet of curiosities.View image in fullscreenElegantly shoehorned … V&A East Storehouse by Diller Scofidio + Renfro.Photograph: © Hufton+Crow2.Ismaili Centre by Farshid Moussavi, Houston, USSubtly abstracting Islamic architectural precepts for the current age, a new social and cultural centre for Houston’s Ismaili community, which will also be enjoyed by the wider public, evokes an experiential serenity that recalls the laconic simplicity of minimalist art. Beautifully built and characterised by an inviting sense of openness, it’s “a renewal rather than a reproduction”, says its architect Farshid Moussavi; a nuanced distillation of geometric and spatial possibilities set within a luxuriant garden landscape.3.Hans Hollein Transforms, Pompidou Centre, ParisAs the Pompidou Centre bids adieu fora five-year long renovation, its final architecture show was devoted to the work of Austrian architectHans Hollein, a postmodernist provocateur who navigated the currents of the avant garde for five decades while designing everything from exquisite jewellery shops to pneumatic structures. Infamously, he proposed reducing architecture to a series of pills contrived to conjure spatial and sensorial experiences without going to the bother of actually constructing a building.4.Space House: Squire & Partners, LondonSomething of an architectural bogeyman in his day,Richard “Colonel” Seifertspecialised in monumental office developments, such as London’s Centre Point and Tower 42 in the City, once the UK’s tallest building. But he is now coming in from the cold, with renewed interest in his unapologetically modernist oeuvre. The remodelling of Space House in Kingsway breathes bold new life into one of his distinctive “corncob” towers, with 90% of the original structure retained and restored.5.The Craft of Carpentry,Japan House, LondonView image in fullscreenExacting, beautiful .. Craft of Carpentry exhibition at Japan House, London.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonThe tools and techniques of the exacting and beautiful craft of Japanese carpentry temporarily transformed the basement gallery of London’s Japan House into a woody wonderland of chisels and saws, mortises and tenons, and brackets of infinite intricacy. Jointing techniques rejoice in esoteric appellations, such as ant’s head, shell mouth and scarfed gooseneck. Celebrating master carpenters with the reverence of a high priesthood, it was a dazzling exposition of the skills behind centuries of timber architecture and joinery.6.Gradel Quadrangles, New College, Oxford, by David KohnLove it or hate it (and apparently the students love it), David Kohn’s gorgeously eclectic housing for venerable New College channels Tolkien, Gaudí and the Teletubbies in a fruity melange of rhubarb-and-custard coloured stonework, a serpentine roof clad in polygonal scales, and a chubby tower embellished with carvings of pangolins, moles and moths. Not merely picturesque decoration, it calls attention to their plight as endangered species while pepping up the Oxford skyline.View image in fullscreenExuberant assemblage … Design and Disability at the V&A.Photograph: Peter Kelleher7.Design and Disability atthe V&A, LondonV&A, London, until 15 FebruaryIn asserting that disability-led culture and design is much more than just ramps, this exuberant assemblage features self-tightening shoes and a hands-free vibrator, among other ingenious and pleasure-seeking devices. Designing for disabled people tends to be treated as a monolithic, tick-box exercise, but this thoughtful show explores its multifaceted expansiveness, with a welcome and overdue focus on design by disabled people, who could teach us all a thing or two.8.Kharkiv Architectural Guide by Ievgeniia GubkinaFrom Cossack military fortress to legendary modernist city, Kharkiv is now in Russia’s firing line in its attritional war against Ukraine, with 8,000 of its buildings damaged or destroyed in the last three years. Completed two months before the invasion and combining poignant personal reflection with analytic rigour, this “anti-guide book” keeps Kharkiv’s architectural riches, including the constructivist gem of the Derzhprom building, intact and alive in people’s minds as a model for the city’s postwar future.View image in fullscreenIntact and alive … the Ukrainian cinema and concert hall, Kharkiv.Photograph: Pavlo Dorohoi9.Khudi Bari prototype housing, Bangladesh, by Marina TabassumIn response to climate-driven displacement in Bangladesh, Marina Tabassum worked with affected communities to devise a practical and affordable modular housing system. A rigid and highly resilient frame of bamboo with steel connectors is designed to withstand the impact of wind and water, while corrugated sheet metal roofs simplify transport and maintenance. Facades can be made from any locally sourced material and the entire module can be rapidly assembled and dismantled by three people using basic tools.10.Intelligens: 19th Architecture BiennaleAlways a curate’s egg, this iteration of the Venice Architecture Biennale was curated by Italian architect and aspiring tech bro Carlo Ratti, better known for hisrobotic bartending experiments. Amid an incoherent cacophony of ideas and installations – 3D printing with bacteria, the future of space suits – highlights were hard to discern. Nonetheless, Estonia’s naff cladding exposé, Poland’s take on superstition and buildings, and Bahrain’s proposition that climate comfort is a form of social equity all stood out.Catherine SlessorThe best design of the year, as chosen by designersKusheda Mensah x Hem: Palma poufChosen byShawn Adams, co-founder of POoR CollectiveView image in fullscreenThoughtful … Kusheda Mensa’s Palma pouf in Copenhagen.Photograph: Emily ColeDuring the 3daysofdesign festival in Copenhagen, Hem debuted a highly anticipated pouf created by designerKusheda Mensah, marking an important milestone for the Swedish furniture brand. The launch is Hem’s first partnership with a Black designer, underscoring both Mensah’s growing influence and the brand’s commitment to broader representation in contemporary design. The pouf had already generated considerable excitement for its thoughtful form and cultural relevance, making the debut one of the festival’s most widely discussed moments.Wuka wearable hot-water bottleChosen byAnoushka Rodda, co-founder of Templo branding agencyI’d love to put the newWuka wearable hot-waterbottle into the mix because it says so much about how things are shifting in women’s health. These days there are more practical products that actually make our lives easier. I remember back when I first got my period wearing the biggest, most itchy pads and being in so much pain. That’s a world away from the thoughtfully designed purposeful products which are available now.Frances Priest’s ceramics collection Motif | Line | ColourChosen byAdam Nathaniel Furman, designer and authorFrances Priest’s new collection of vessels, on show in her solo exhibition at Blackwell House in Cumbria, is a set of ethereal columns, pinched inwards at their tops and bottoms. They are dusted in dense but limpid motifs that flutter over the ceramic surfaces like the autumnal ghosts of a leaf fall. They seem to be moving yet so delicate as to almost fade into translucency. I have been enamoured with Priest’s oeuvre for some time. I promise that anyone who encounters her vessels in person will fall deeply in love …Noah Davis exhibition at the Barbican, LondonChosen byLewis Dalton Gilbert, curator and creative director of A Vibe Called TecView image in fullscreenDelicately portrayed … Noah Davis, 1975.Photograph: Kerry McFate/Noah Davis/David ZwirnerI was lucky enough to see Noah Davis’s paintings at the gallery he created, The Underground Museum in LA. What I wasn’t prepared for was the thoughtful design of this exhibition (by studios Freehaus and A Practice for Everyday Life). It brought Davis’s practice to life and delicately portrayed his ideas, adventures and artwork. I will always sing about his work to the rooftops, but less is said about the power of great exhibition design.Showtown museum, BlackpoolChosen byAmber Butchart, curator and fashion historianI am ahuge fanof the seaside and Blackpool is one of my favourite places. This year I visited Showtown – the museum that celebrates the entertainment heritage of this razzle-dazzle-loving town. It’s a great visit for anyone interested in Blackpool’s rich history of magic, circus, illuminations and dance, and is especially good for family visits. The museum’s design allows visitors a glimpse behind the scenes at everything from Punch and Judy puppet shows to the town’s famed drag cabaret Funny Girls. I am in love with their collection of clown costumes, which includes examples by renowned French costumier Gérard Vicaire.View image in fullscreenGlimpse behind the scenes … Showtown museum, Blackpool.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianAlice Gomme’s textile archive at Twos, LondonChosen byTamsin Clark, director of Tenderbooks, bookshop and event spaceFor three days in April the tiny shop space Twos on Hackney Road showed a selection of extraordinary clothing fromAlice Gomme’s textile archive for sale. Her collection of rare garments and repaired textiles were found in European rag yards, and to view these salvaged clothes up close was remarkable. I found myself noticing small details in the wear of a collar or the fade of a pattern. This was an opportunity to look at the overlooked. As Gomme explained in an accompanying publication: “Looking at these pieces helps us connect to the past. Each piece, each repair holds a memory.”Oríkì: Material Affirmations in Three Actsmonograph by Nifemi Marcus-BelloChosen byAndu Masebo, product designerView image in fullscreenNifemi Marcus-Bello exhibition Material Affirmations: Oríkì Acts I-III at Tiwani Contemporary, Nigeria.Photograph: Erik BenjaminsNamed Oríkì after the Yoruba practice of praise poetry, the first monograph of Nigerian-born artist Nifemi Marcus-Bello coincided with his solo exhibition at Tiwani Contemporary, Nigeria. The canon of the mainstream design world has long centred on “the West” – its movements, its narratives and its influence on our collective imagination. In Nifemi’s practice, I find a profound significance in his directing of his work toward his country of birth. To me, his work signals a shift in the culture: a moment when the eyes of the world are turning toward new centres of creativity, expanding the very idea of where design leadership can emerge, changing how the history of design will be written in the future.Le Corbusier executive desk in The Electric Kiln show, LondonChosen byEmma Glynn, creative director, WedgwoodThis lived-in exhibition occupied a building which was once British potter Emmanuel Cooper’s studio and home, now restored, owned and lived in by curator Rajan Bijlani. Every piece had its own quiet brilliance, from Lucie Rie to Frank Auerbach, but Le Corbusier’s executive desk stayed with me long after. The engineering is so perfectly judged that it grounds the entire space; its calm authority, precision and purity of purpose are a true feat of design. The remarkable works in this show were so purposefully curated they felt like part of the living space. The whole experience was a privilege – an immersive, quietly meditative dialogue of material, technique and memory.Ibraaz cultural institution, LondonChosen byEva Langret, director of Frieze art fairIbraaz opened this autumn to great acclaim. Created by Kamel Lazaar Foundation – a non-profit cultural organisation rooted in Tunisia and across the Middle East and north Africa – it brings a much-needed space for art and ideas from the Global Majority to the city. Set in a Grade II–listed building in Fitzrovia and redesigned by architect Sumayya Vally, it draws inspiration from diasporic spaces in London. Built in the early 20th century, the building has transformed from a synagogue to a residence, a club, and now a cultural centre. It’s a place for artists and thinkers to meet, exchange ideas and build new connections. Ibraaz launched with work by artist Ibrahim Mahama based on his research into Ghana’s post-independence history, and its upcoming programme spans talks, screenings, music, and residencies.Loewe teapotsChosen byTF Chan, director of Collect art fairView image in fullscreenExceptional … Suna Fujita’s teapot at Milan Design Week 2025.Photograph: LoeweAt this year’s Milan Design Week, Loewe stole the show with an exhibition of25 teapotscommissioned from the world’s leading artists. One, by Japanese ceramicist Takayuki Sakiyama, looked as though it was poured from soft-serve ice-cream. Another, by Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola, resembled a lumpy squirrel, meant to be held by its tail. A third, from Pritzker Architecture prize laureate Wang Shu, was a mint-green cuboid with a sliced-off corner in place of a spout. These vessels were whimsical and puzzling, but consistently brilliant – a testament to erstwhile creative director Jonathan Anderson’s knack for convening contemporary craft talent. It also offered proof, amid an arms race of ambitiously scaled installations at design weeks around the world, of the value of small objects of exceptional quality.Mary Woolaston statue by Marcia Bennett-MaleChosen bySumitra Upham, associate director of curatorial and public practice at Wellcome InstituteView image in fullscreenInspiring healing … Marcia Bennett-Male and her Black Mary statue in Calthorpe Community Garden, King’s Cross.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesThis remarkable public statue, handcrafted by British artist and stonemason Marcia Bennett-Male, honours Mary Woolaston. As legend has it, Mary was a Black woman and keeper of a well in 17th-century King’s Cross known for its chalybeate waters that she supplied to people as a form of healing. The absence of Black working-class histories has left her story overlooked, but this statue can now be seen at Calthorpe Community Garden in Camden – the former site of the well. It has been designed to inspire communal healing and remind us of our shared humanity. The work forms part ofthe Black Mary Project, an initiative to honour Mary and her well.Seat for Surrender by Carlos H MatosChosen byIngrid Schroder, director of Architectural Association SchoolArchitect and sculptor Carlos H Matos’s Seat for Surrender was produced for the group exhibition A Stubborn Man and a Hermit Walk Into a Bar,which was shown at Mexican architect and muralist Juan O’Gorman’s iconic 1940s Nancarrow House in Mexico City. Made from plywood boards, the chair manages to capture the socialist and nationalist political spirit of O’Gorman’s architecture. The strength and quiet humour of the piece is typical of Matos’s creative work.Compiled by Alice FisherExplore more on these topicsArt and design2025 in cultureArchitectureDesignExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Starmer has alsopreviously insistedhe could not see any circumstances where the UK rejoined within his lifetime.However, several pro-European ministers – including Streeting, David Lammy, Peter Kyle, Liz Kendall, Bridget Phillipson – are believed to be among those who would like to see the government go further.It comes as ministers position efforts to “reset” EU relations – after a landmark summit with Brussels earlier this year – among the government’s top priorities for 2026. Last week Labour announced it had agreed terms for theUK to join the Erasmus+EU student exchange programme in 2027.In a report setting out a “business manifesto for the EU reset”, the BCC said the government needed to prioritise its efforts to minimise trade friction for exporters to help boost the UK economy.Quoting frustrated survey respondents, it said firms were finding it increasingly difficult to navigate changes to EU and UK laws since the first post-Brexit trade deal was introduced in 2020.“Since Brexit our export sales have virtually stopped. The TCA has had no impact in recovering any sales into the EU,” said one small manufacturing firm in Greater Manchester.Drawing a link to Labour’s tax-raising budgets, a small retailer in Hampshire said: “Work has stopped coming to [the] UK due to high taxes and no longer being part of the EU. As a result, lots of companies have shut down and thousands of people have lost their jobs and been out of work for over two years.”The BCC said it had made five key proposals for talks with Brussels in 2026. This includes a deal to cut border checks on animal and plant products, finalising linkages between the UK and EU’s emissions trading schemes, establishing a youth mobility scheme, securing full UK participation to SAFE – the EU’s defence fund – and enhancing cooperation on VAT and customs simplification.A government spokesperson said: “This government is removing red tape and trade barriers to support jobs, business, and growth. That’s exactly why we reset our relationship with the EU and are making strong progress in negotiations.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyEuropean UnionEuropeBrexitKeir StarmerForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He sold more than 30m albums.He was born in 1951 inMiddlesbroughto an Italian father and Irish mother, and had six siblings. “To be Irish Italian in a coffee bar in Middlesbrough – I started my life as an outsider,” he later said.View image in fullscreenChris Rea performs at Salle Pleyel in October 2017 in Paris, France.Photograph: David Wolff/Patrick/RedfernsAs a young man he dabbled in music while working labouring jobs, including in his father’s ice-cream factory, and considered being a journalist. He eventually joined a band aged 22, Magdalene, which had previously featured David Coverdale (later of Deep Purple). He then joined another band, the Beautiful Losers, but struck out solo when offered a record deal, releasing his debut single, So Much Love, in 1974.His first flush of success came in the US, where his 1978 song Fool (If You Think It’s Over) reached No 12 and earned him a Grammy nomination for best new artist. He struggled to match that achievement for some years – likening industry machinations in this period to “a big manure heap of bubbling stuff. I had no control over it, I didn’t know what to do” – though the 1983 album Water Sign was a hit across Europe and helped to turn his fortunes around.The late 1980s were his most commercially successful period: finally embraced in the UK despite often sitting outside the dominant trends in pop, 1987’s Dancing With Strangers began a run of six UK top 10 albums, two of them reaching No 1.The 1988 compilation album New Light Through Old Windows contained his biggest hit, Driving Home for Christmas, originally recorded in 1986. It made little impact on its first release, but the gentle, sentimental song about the communal pleasure of its title has continued to grow in popularity ever since, reaching a chart high of No 10 in 2021.Rea originally wrote it at a low ebb when he was without a manager, out of a record contract and actually banned from driving – he had to be driven home by his wife from London to Middlesbrough because he couldn’t afford the rail fare. He wrote the lyrics on the car journey, but didn’t complete the song until a few years later.“I used to be terrified the song would ruin any credibility I had left, but now we have a laugh with it,” hetold the Guardian in 2016. “If I’m ever stuck on the M25, I’ll wind the window down and start singing, ‘I’m driving home for Christmas’ at people in cars alongside. They love it.”View image in fullscreenChris Rea, in his studio in 2005.Photograph: Richard Ecclestone/RedfernsRea’s chart success waned somewhat in the 2000s, when, beginning with 2002’s Dancing Down the Stony Road, Rea turned away from pop and back towards the Delta blues that had originally inspired him.Appropriately, given he often fixated on cars and roads in his songs, Rea was a motor racing enthusiast who raced models by Ferrari and Lotus, and participated in the 1993 British Touring Car Championship. For the 1995 Formula One season, he joined the Jordan team as a pit mechanic. “I really didn’t want to do the VIP thing, so I was in charge of Eddie Irvine’s right-rear tyre,” he later said.He supported Labour, and in 2017 wrote an unreleased song in praise of Jeremy Corbyn called What’s So Wrong With a Man Who Tells the Truth?View image in fullscreenChris Rea posed backstage at the Venue in London in March 1983.Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsRea suffered a number of health issues during his life. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and eventually had his pancreas removed along with parts of his stomach and small intestine in 2001. The procedure caused him to become diabetic.Chris Rea: how we made Driving Home for ChristmasRead moreHe had a stroke in 2016, which he described as a “very scary moment … I got it into my head that my perception of pitch had gone with the stroke. And it took a lot of convincing from people saying there’s nothing wrong with what you’re playing.” In 2017, he collapsed on stage during a concert in Oxford, and was taken to hospital to recover.Rea is survived by his wife Joan, whom he began dating aged 17, and their daughters Josephine and Julia, both of whom Rea named hit songs after.Explore more on these topicsChris ReaPop and rockMiddlesbroughnewsShareReuse this content"

Police have released the ethnicity of each man charged.They include multiple counts of rape, administering a substance to overpower his victim to allow sexual activity, voyeurism, possession of indecent images of children and possession of extreme images.The alleged victim, Young’s now ex-wife, Joanne Young, 48, has waived her right to anonymity.Young was previously a Conservative councillor from 2007 to 2010 on Swindon borough council. He was the cabinet member for culture, regeneration and economic development until 6 May 2010. More recently he was the chief operating officer at the consultancy firm Pracedo.Five other men have also been charged with offences against the victim and are due to appear alongside Young at Swindon magistrates court on Tuesday.Norman Macksoni, 47, of Sharnbrook, who police described as a black British national, has been charged with one count of rape and possession of extreme images. Dean Hamilton, 46, of no fixed abode, who police said was white British, has been charged with one count of rape and sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual touching.Conner Sanderson Doyle, 31, of Swindon, described as white British, has been charged with sexual assault by penetration and sexual touching. Richard Wilkins, 61, of Toothill, Swindon, who police also said was white British, has been charged with one count of rape and sexual touching. Mohammed Hassan, 37, of Swindon, described by police as British Asian, has been charged with sexual touching.The offences are alleged to have taken place between 2010 and 2023.Det Supt Geoff Smith of Wiltshire police said: “This is a significant update in what is a complex and extensive investigation.“The victim in this case, Joanne, has taken the decision to waive her automatic legal right to anonymity.“She has been supported by specially trained officers from the beginning of the process and she has made the decision following multiple discussions with officers and support services.”James Foster, a Crown Prosecution Service specialist prosecutor, added: “The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the prosecution of Philip Young, Norman Macksoni, Dean Hamilton, Conner Sanderson Doyle, Richard Wilkins and Mohammed Hassan with a number of offences – following a police investigation into alleged serious sexual offences against Joanne Young over a period of 13 years.“Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to charge and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings.“We have worked closely with Wiltshire police as they carried out their investigation.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He can say something and he can do something about this and meet with the solicitors or family members of the hunger strikers and he can show a bit of humanity.”I’m on hunger strike in a British prison. This is why | Amu GibRead moreReferring to the Irish republican hunger strike during the Troubles that culminated in the death of Bobby Sands and nine others, she added: “We should not repeat the hunger strike of 1981, and we should not have to look at things in retrospect and wonder how things went so wrong when we have an opportunity to fix it now.”Alam, 33, a pharmacist, said that the family were told on Monday that Ahmed was discharged late on Sunday night “but we haven’t received any phone call from him, so we don’t know how he’s doing or why he went in the first place”.A repeated complaint of relatives and friends has been that they have not received updates when the prisoners are hospitalised.Zuhrah is believed to still be in hospital afteran ambulance arrived at HMP Bronzefield on Wednesday afternoon. Protesters gathered overnight on Tuesday accusing prison staff of refusing to allow her transfer to emergency care.Her designated next of kin, her friend Ella Moulsdale, 21, said last week: “Imagine … someone you love and not knowing if they’re alive … I have no confirmation that she was inside that ambulance, that she is being treated in the hospital.”View image in fullscreenAmu Gib.Composite: Prisoners for PalestineFrancesca Nadin, of Prisoners forPalestine, said: “Unlike the British government, the hunger strikers cannot take a Christmas holiday, as they continue to be locked up in prison cells, suffering immensely away from their families. Their lives are in grave danger and they may die at any moment. We have been forced to threaten the government with legal action to get justice for the prisoners, and will not stop until we achieve that.”The legal letter, sent by Imran Khan and Partners, said the claimants had a “legitimate expectation” from official policy documents “that the proposed defendant would convene a review meeting of individuals ‘most likely to bring about the resolution of the situation’, including ‘those suggested by the individual’ refusing food, to ‘address the reasons for their refusal’”.It called for a reply by 2pm on Tuesday “given the urgency of the situation in respect of our clients’ deteriorating health”.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said on Monday: “We strongly refute these claims. We want these prisoners to accept support and get better, and we will not create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes.”All the hunger strikers are in prison awaiting trial charged with offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage during protest actions.The Guardian view on the Palestine Action hunger strikers: the government is trying to ignore this protest | EditorialRead moreThey will have served more than a year in jail before standing trial. The other current hunger strikers are Heba Muraisi, 31, who is on day 50,Teuta Hoxha, 29, who is on day 44, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day, because he has diabetes, and is on day 16.Alam said: “I can’t really get the words together to [describe] how I feel because how do you put into words what it means when your baby brother is on a knife’s edge?”There is understood to be concern in government about the condition of the prisoners, but also extreme caution about setting a precedent even to facilitate a meeting with Lammy, given the number of prisoners who are forced to spend lengthy periods on remand because of the court backlog.Officials have been told to give regular updates, including on how the prisoners can be persuaded to change their minds and be given support to do so.But sources at the Ministry of Justice said there were very limited powers for the department to do more in terms of legal recourse or medical help that was not already being offered. Deaths in custody from hunger strikes were very rare, officials said, and most ended their strikes voluntarily.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionProtestPrisons and probationPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDavid LammyUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

The contract between the Post Office and Horizon, which was marked “Commercial in Confidence”, saidFujitsuwas liable for penalty payments of £100-£150 per faulty transaction with the Horizon IT system.There have been more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal, which involved operators being wrongfully prosecuted due to the faulty Horizon computer system. The system showed erroneous shortfalls on accounts, which the Post Office then demanded operators cover on penalty of suspension and prosecution.The contract, which was found on the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry’s website, says: “If the reconciliation service identifies that any transaction data held on the ‘central database’ located at the data centre is found to be inconsistent when compared to the records of the transaction that was completed at the branch … the reconciliation service shall obtain authorisation from the Post Office prior to amending the centrally held transaction data.”Paul Marshall, a senior barrister for post office operators, told the BBC: “The Post Office conducted both the criminal trials of postmasters and the group litigation of 2019 on the basis that it knew of no substantial problems with the Horizon system.“Yet this shows that in 2006 there was a very big, recognised problem with Horizon maintaining data integrity between Post Office branch offices and Fujitsu.“The Post Office, for 20 years, was saying the only explanation for shortfalls in branch accounts was postmaster incompetence or dishonesty.”Lee Castleton, a post office operator who was wrongly accused of false accounting and went to court in 2006, told Channel 4 News the revelation made his “physically sick”.He said: “Really, you’ve got a group of people in two companies that wrote a contract for something that they’ve said repeatedly was never required. And it’s just sickening for all the distress and victimisation of the group, of all of our group.

There was the sound of a lot of water.“I opened the back door to see why we were tilting and realised it was not raining at all and it was the water running away under the boat. I jumped on the back and stepped off, and that bit was going down at that second. The back went eight foot in the air and I landed on my front.”Wood moored his boat, which he has lived on for eight years, on Sunday night. He said he watched it go down nose-first on Monday morning, and that his neighbour got out just in time before his craft went down backwards.Other people in the vicinity thought they were caught up in an earthquake when the collapse began, and there were fears that water would flood into the nearby town of Whitchurch inShropshire.There are no reported casualties and people were being assisted by the fire service, according to West Mercia police.View image in fullscreenThe scene near Whitchurch, Shropshire.Photograph: Andy Kelvin/PAShropshire fire and rescue service said it had received reports of a canal bank collapse at about 4.22am, with large volumes of water escaping into surrounding land. “Three boats had been caught in a developing sinkhole approximately 50 metres by 50 metres in size and crews helped more than 10 members of the public to safety,” it said in a statement.“Firefighters have been working in challenging conditions with unstable ground and rapidly moving water. Crews immediately established upstream and downstream safety sectors and began mitigating water flow using barge boards and water gate systems.”Scott Hurford, the fire service area manager, said about 12 residents from boats moored nearby were being supported and relocated to a welfare centre at the former Whitchurch police station.He added: “A major incident was declared at 5.17am. However, as of 8.30am, the situation was stable with water flow reduced and there is no ongoing search and rescue activity.”The breach took place on the Llangollen canal near New Mills Lift Bridge in Whitchurch. The canal was among those flagged this year by the Inland Waterways Association as being an “amber risk”.The independent charity has mapped Britain’s network of canals and rivers, which are under strain from funding shortfalls and growing climate pressures, and flaggedthose at particular financial and environmental risk.Areas of concern included the Midlands, where higher-ground reservoirs feed several canal systems and where droughts are expected to worsen.The Canal and River Trust, a charity that maintains 2,000 miles of historic canals and rivers in England and Wales, said it was investigating the cause of Monday’s incident and working with agencies to restore water levels on either side of the breach as soon as possible.At the scene, Sho Abdul, a member of the Shropshire county council cabinet, told theShropshire Starnewspaper: “There are three or four canal boats that have been impacted by the sinkhole, which rapidly happened. The lack of casualties is an absolute miracle.“We were so shocked when we saw it. It’s an absolute crater, it’s devastating, especially for the people who use this area often.”Explore more on these topicsShropshireRiversEnglandWater transportnewsShareReuse this content"

But what should ministers do about it?Richard PartingtonSenior economics correspondentThe idea of a customs union has gained traction, but agreeing a deal would be far from straightforwardMon 22 Dec 2025 09.39 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 15.24 ESTShareAlmost a decade on from the Brexit vote, the verdict is clear. Britain’s immediatedoomsday economic scenariomight not have come to pass. But after years of political paralysis – and with the eventual introduction of tougher trade barriers in 2020 – trade, investment and growth in living standards have all suffered.Just as it was on the morning after the 2016 referendum, the big fight is about what the government should do in response.At the weekend, Wes Streeting became the latest frontbench Labour politician tocall for a deeper trading relationshipwith the EU. His remarks were interpreted as a suggestion that Britain could join a customs union with the EU – something that Keir Starmer hasruled out.As the UK’s single largest trading partner, the idea has its advocates. UK exports of goods and services to the EU were worth £358bn (41% of the global total) last year. Imports were worth £454bn (51% of the UK total).Under the trade and cooperation agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government, Britain has tariff-free trade with the EU. However, access is limited by other rules and restrictions – and falls significantly short of the UK’s previous membership of the EU single market and customs union.Goods exports in particular have been negatively impacted. Volumes collapsed immediately after the end of theBrexittransition period in January 2021, and remain short of 2019 levels in real terms.While this coincided with the Covid pandemic – making it harder to untangle the Brexit impact – economists have shown the UK clearly suffered a weaker period for its trade in goods than for other G7 countries, and that activity would have been considerably stronger under a remain scenario.Services exports to both the EU and non-EU countries also fell in 2020, but have recovered more strongly since. However, for some sectors, loss of access to the single market has had a big impact:particularly in the City of London, where financial services exports have lost significant market share in the EU.Labour’s manifesto was clear it wanted “no return” to either the single market or customs union. The main stumbling block would be accepting freedom of movement – perceived as a significant driving force behind the leave vote.Instead, the party promised to “work to improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, by tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade” – including a veterinary agreement to ease food trade, a deal to help touring artists, and an agreement on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.In the UK-EU “reset” earlier this year, both sides took a major step towards negotiating these deals. Plans for a youth mobility scheme, as well as cooperation on energy, defence and security were also mooted.However, the economic boost would probably be limited. Any deals will take a considerable amount of time, and potential compromise, to negotiate. The government’s own assessment suggests a veterinary deal and cooperation on energy would boost UK GDP by only about 0.3% by 2040. That is much smaller than the economic cost of Brexit, estimated at 4% of GDP by the Office for Budget Responsibility.A customs union would probably have a bigger benefit.Under such an arrangement, the UK would escape some of the bureaucracy introduced by Brexit – including complex “rules of origin” requirements for exporters to access tariff-free trade, which estimates show add 2-8% to firms’ costs.The Liberal Democrats claim that a “bespoke” UK-EU customs union could deliver a 2.2% boost to the economy, and bring in £25bn a year for the exchequer.The figure is sourced from research by the consultancy Frontier Economics commissioned byBest for Britain, which campaigns for closer EU ties. However, theUK in a Changing Europethinktank warns the findings are modelled on “deep UK-EU regulatory alignment in goods and services” – something that would extend beyond the arrangements of any customs union.Agreeing a customs union deal would be far from straightforward. Rather than “rejoining”, the UK would need to negotiate a fresh agreement – similar to deals done by Brussels with Turkey, Andorra and San Marino.That would open the door to lengthy negotiations about what exactly a UK-EU customs union would look like. Experts say the EU would drive a hard bargain, and that conditions for varying levels of access would be applied – with freedom of movement and budget contributions among potential demands.Under a customs union, Britain would apply the same tariffs on imports as the EU. However, this could mean outsourcing trade policy to Brussels without the UK having formal input into the decision making.This would mean the UK would be unable to offer more favourable deals to other countries – putting at risk post-Brexit agreements. For some advocates, an independent trade policy helped Britain avoid the worst of Donald Trump’s trade war, and has opened up new opportunities. For others, such a loss would be no big deal – given agreements reached by the government so far have been shown to add little to the economy.Most economists agree that closer relations with the EU could boost growth. However, the trade-offs involved will entail years of political wrangling – both on the domestic front, and in negotiations with Brussels.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyEconomicsEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)BrexitEuropean UnionEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Sky is also launching aUK version of the long-running US satirical sketch show Saturday Night Live.Last year’s final episode of Gavin & Stacey topped the Christmas ratings with 12.3 million viewers on the day, rising to arecord-breaking audience of 19.3 millionafter catch-up figures were added. This year, the BBC has high hopes for its “Cotswoldian Noel” version of Amandaland.The comedy about a fallen-from-grace snob stars Lucy Punch as the eponymous, smug mum andJoanna Lumleyas her mother, Felicity. It was a hit when it debuted in February and was watched by more than 7 million people – a big number for a new comedy.The festive special guest starsJennifer Saundersas Felicity’s aristocratic sister Joan and marks the first time Lumley and Saunders have worked together on a sitcom since Absolutely Fabulous.An advance screening of the episode took place on the dayDonald Trump filed a lawsuit against the BBC. Asked afterwards whether comedy was required more than ever in tough times, Saunders said: “We definitely need it.”Absolutely Fabulous: Inside Out review – when Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley cackle, it’s sheer joyRead moreAmandaland co-writer and Ghosts star Laurence Rickard said: “There’s a genuine value in making people laugh when there are some things in the world which feel particularly bleak … We’re very proud to be doing something for theBBCat a time like this when it’s being attacked.”Co-writer Holly Walsh said: “We were desperate to make a British, warm Christmas special.” She said the writers wanted to “lean into every trope and cliche going” to remind viewers of Christmases past and make them feel part of a family.Both writers said they were “brought up watching all the Christmas specials”, with Walsh adding that they were “a huge deal in my house”.She said they wanted to create something for all the family – “not too shocking, but that most people would have a really good laugh to [like] all the shows we were brought up on”.Walsh concluded: “It’s that ‘Christmas special’ thing of just being part of the day, whether with your family or on your own – you’re part of something that the BBC are doing an amazing job at.”Kate Phillips, the BBC’s chief content officer, said the Amandaland special had “got it all”, with the right yuletide ingredients. “It’s funny, it’s slapstick, it’s moving. You’ll identify with so many things that happen on Christmas Day in terms of your own family,” she said.Saunders added: “Christmas specials are the hardest thing to write, because you’ve got to fulfil that expectation.” She said it was “an absolute gift” to be reunited with Lumley, who she said had emailed her when the guest role was mooted to say: “Do it or I’ll have to kill you!”Saunders also said that she hoped more young comedians – who increasingly focus on live work or social media content – would try their hand at TV as part of the genre’s resurgence.Explore more on these topicsTV comedyBBCJennifer SaundersJoanna LumleyGavin & StaceyComedyTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s relentlessly charming – and hugely moving when they talk about Dame Judi’s late husbandStuart HeritageMon 22 Dec 2025 17.00 ESTShareCast your mind back to Christmas 2017, and you might remember a slightly wacky BBC documentary calledDame Judi Dench: My Passion for Trees. On the surface, it seemed like one of those god-awful shows put together by tombola; matching a celebrity with a random subject and hoping it would pass muster.However, this was not the case. DameJudi Dench, it turned out, really did have a passion for trees. An obsessive passion, one that manifested itself in a small woodland where she named trees after friends of hers who had died. The result was unexpectedly tender and gorgeous, and the show ended up being the best thing on TV that Christmas.So it’s easy to see Tea With Judi Dench as a sequel of sorts. Like the tree show, there isn’t much on the surface to get excited about. It’s a show where someone comes to visit Dench for a cup of tea and that’s literally it. Which would be dispiriting – another brilliant career lost to podcasts – were it not for the punishing, relentless charm of the thing.Dench’s guest for the episode isSir Kenneth Branagh, and the two of them go way back: by her own calculations, Dench has played Branagh’s wife, mother and grandmother in her time, and the pair share a lovely, easy, breezy relationship. Branagh pulls up outside her house, Dench barks, “About bloody time!” and then presents Branagh with a huge portrait of his own head. It is to his eternal credit that Branagh doesn’t immediately freak out and run away.This sets the tone for the rest of the show, in which they natter away pleasantly with no real direction. They eat some potato farls. They pretend not to have read any of their reviews, even though Branagh is able to quote them extensively. At one point they potter over toSweetheart, Dench’s parrot, in the hope that it will call Branagh a “slag”.Mainly, though, they reminisce. They talk about all the times when Branagh directed Dench (“Was it headscarf acting?” she asks, self-deprecatingly, of her role in his Hamlet adaptation) and of the time that Dench directed him (it’s glossed over very quickly, but it’s implied that Branagh got in a huff and walked out when Dench tried to give him notes). They talk about people they’ve known and lost. They quote Shakespeare to each other, at length.View image in fullscreenShe’s run away with Christmas! … Tea With Judi Dench.Photograph: Sky UKWhich, again, doesn’t sound particularly appealing, because nobody in their right mind would want to spend Christmas listening to a pair of old luvvies tell each other how brilliant they are. Nevertheless, it turns out that, in her own way, Dench is actually a pretty nimble interviewer.The closest comparison I can think of is Drew Barrymore. Dench spends much of her time with Branagh sitting extremely close to him, leaning in, eyes wide open. She nods along with his stories, hanging on his every word. She is an extraordinarily intent listener, drawing out details that Branagh might not give up during a conventional interview.This isn’t a great approach for all interviews, because it tends to encourage the subject to go long, soaking up the allotted time with indulgent waffle. But for this – an edited show about two old friends with clear affection for one another – it’s perfectly pitched.Tea With Judi Dench is billed as a one-off. In an ideal world it would be a series, because surely there’s no end of actors who have worked with Dench and would love nothing more than to discuss their shared history while being insulted by her parrot. Whether that will happen is anyone’s guess.This is partly due to age. Dench – while resolutely pin-sharp and mobile – just celebrated her 91st birthday, so the idea of committing to a full series of interviews might not hold too much appeal. But also, Branagh is such a spirited interviewee that the magic of their encounter might not be easily replicated.The section on Dench’s late husband, Michael Williams, in particular, is the highlight here. Her house is full of trinkets of the pair of them, and when Branagh pulls out a tablet to show her a clip of Williams in Henry V, she’s moved to silence by the sight of him. If there’s a lovelier, more touching moment on television this month, I’ll be staggered. Judi Dench has run away with Christmas once again.Tea With Judi Dench aired on Sky Arts and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJudi DenchreviewsShareReuse this content"

His debut single, Fool (If You Think It’s Over) was a transatlantic hit, earning him a best new artist Grammy nomination (he lost to Billy Joel, an artist the single had garnered comparisons to), but Rea announced that he “despised” the song: “It’s just not me.” He chafed at his record company’s expectations: his 1978 debut album, Whatever Happened to Benny Santini? got its title after his label suggested that he might consider adopting a stage name, and he later protested that the producers he worked with made his music too glossy and “smoothed-out”.When 1989’s The Road to Hell did well, his US record label thought he could be a huge star in America if he put the hours in touring, or appeared on MTV Unplugged; Rea declined to tour and turned down the MTV offer because he’d seen Eric Clapton’s performance on the show “and it reminded me of [the middle-of-the-road BBC TV show] Pebble Mill at One. I thought ‘Oh my God, I don’t want anything to do with this’.” He did not have much time for his fellow rock stars, claiming that the only one who hadn’t disappointed him was Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour.Eventually, a life-threatening illness led him to completely reassess his career and pursue his real musical passion, the blues: he claimed that during his recuperation from the operation that saved his life but left him without a pancreas and in permanently poor health, he’d had an epiphany after finding an old Sister Rosetta Tharpe album in a drawer, bursting into tears at the sight of it. When his label rejected his 2002 album Dancing Down the Stony Road (“because it hadn’t been compromised in any way”), and suggested he make a big-name-packed duets album instead, he walked away from his deal, set up his own record company and happily saw out the rest of his career making and self-releasing the music he wanted to.Thereafter, he could be sniffy, even dismissive about the music that had made him famous, which didn’t seem entirely fair: Rea was genuinely gifted at pop-facing AOR. If you’re in the market for a soft rock weepie, it might as well be one as beautifully turned as Fool (If You Think It’s Over); whatever you make of the slick mid-80s production, On the Beach and All Summer Long are fabulously well-written songs. If you can occasionally sense Rea chafing a little at the commerciality of his sound (somewhere amid the synths and the booming rhythm track of Let’s Dance, there’s a gnarly uptempo blues-rock track fighting to get out), he would also throw his listeners the occasional curveball. A remix of Josephine – La Version Francais – famously became an anthem on the Balearic club scene, but the same could just as easily have happened to the ethereal slow-motion funk of Bombollini, from 1984’s Wired to the Moon.He concluded his British commercial breakthrough, 1985’s Shamrock Diaries, with Hired Gun, which was eight minutes long, oddly menacing in tone and nothing like the hit singles that helped propel the album into the Top 20. Little Blonde Plaits and Just Passing Through, from the following year’s On the Beach, were impressively atmospheric and faintly jazzy. The Road to Hell (Part Two) was a huge hit single in 1989, but The Road to Hell (Part One) opened the six-times platinum album of the same name with five eerie minutes of dark ambient synth, distant piano chords and Rea singing the kind of grimly hued blues song you could imagine Nick Cave performing.Chris Rea – a life in picturesRead moreStill, it came as something of a shock when Rea released Dancing Down the Stony Road: his take on blues was raw, intense, and so little concerned with studio slickness that you could hear the fretboard of his guitar buzzing, and, according to his self-penned sleevenote “everything Chris Rea was meant to be”. The initial critical reaction was that it was a one-off labour of love and that normal service would be resumed shortly, but it never was. The subsequent Hofner Blue Notes and Blue Jukebox fruitfully stirred jazz into his sound: should anyone have doubted his commitment to his new approach, 2005’s Blue Guitars was 11 CDs and 137 tracks long. If 2011’s Santo Spirito Blues and 2017’s Road Songs For Lovers made marginally more concession to the Chris Rea of old, the former was audibly more gritty and grungy in tone than anything Rea had released in his hitmaking days, while the latter contained the quite spectacularly bleak and gothic Last Train.It was a dramatic left-turn that clearly confounded at least some of his old fans: platinum-selling albums and arena tours became a thing of the past. But you rather got the impression Rea preferred it that way. “I found fame really annoying,” he once shrugged. “Anything to do with celebrity, I just don’t get it.”Explore more on these topicsChris ReaPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

This summer, the Palestinian journalistbroke downwhile reporting on starvation in his home town that is now a war zone. Abystander told him: “Persist, Anas, you are our voice”.But al-Sharif’s popularity in Gaza made him a target. In July, international agencieswarned of the dangerhe was in as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks, falsely labelling him a Hamas terrorist. His employer, Al Jazeera, insisted he restrict his reporting to the more protected al-Shifa hospital after his father and many colleagues were killed. In August, a few months short of his 29th birthday, al-Sharif and six others were killed in a direct attack on a media tent next to the hospital.In a posthumous posthe said: “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice.”Anas al-Sharif is just one of 67 media professionals who were killed in 2025 while doing their jobs, identified by press freedom advocates Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in itsannual report on journalists’ safety. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) goes even further – theyfound 111 journalistshave been killed in 2025, nearly half in Gaza.Each one of these deaths is a tragedy, an abuse of the right of journalists to bear witness. Yet it is worth remembering the story of al-Sharif, not least because he became one of the highest profile examples of the tactic of discrediting journalists by accusing them of bias.TheIsraeli military confirmedthat it targeted al-Sharif, claiming he led a Hamas terrorist cell and was “responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians” – somehow doing all of that while spending so much time on air. He had denied these accusations many times and none of the main press freedom advocacy groups – the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), IFJ and RSF, nor the UN special agencies – have found any evidence that the allegations were true.Irene Khan, theUN special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, said: “On the one hand, Israel refuses to allow any international journalists to enter Gaza, and on the other, it ruthlessly smears, threatens, obstructs, targets and kills the few local journalists remaining as the only eyes of the outside world on the ongoing genocide.” In August 2024, the CPJcalled on Israelto stop making unsubstantiated terrorism allegations to justify its killing and mistreatment of Palestinian journalists.Fiona O’Brien, UK director of RSF, told me the young journalist’s story was a “very strong example of the way the Israelis are trying to discredit journalists without producing any credible evidence. It’s a very deliberate tactic.”It is a tactic that is working. Under an international press ban that Israel is refusing to lift – an appeal was due back in an Israeli court on 21 December – international journalists are barred fromGazaexcept on escorted military trips. The ban makes telling the sort of human stories that engage the public and lead to direct political action much harder.O’Brien tells me that not only has the ban made it harder for press freedom organisations such as RSF to provide support and safety equipment for journalists under fire, the lack of eyewitness accounts also makes it easier to discredit local journalists. In a confused world in which claim and counterclaim are spread on social media, allegations are sometimes all it takes to sow seeds of doubt. And this at a time when trust in journalism worldwide is already receding at an alarming rate.More than 240 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the Hamas attack on 7 October that started the war. Many of them, including the prominent Palestinian-American Shireen Abu Akleh, were killed by Israeli snipers while wearing a press vest. Jon Williams, executive director ofthe Rory Peck Trust, which supports independent journalism, said: “Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been the world’s eyes and ears and they have paid a terrible price. Many of them were not journalists at the start of the war but, as one has fallen, the other has picked up their camera and continued their work.”Abdullah Ali, head of international communications for the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera, told me that the network had been able to replace all of the journalists killed in Gaza this year with other Palestinian journalists. In early December, the media group moved al-Sharif’s wife and two very young children to Doha.Not long after the attack on journalists outside the al-Shifa hospital this August, the RSF filed itsfifth complaintagainst Israel at the international criminal court, alleging war crimes for its treatment of Palestinian journalists. Yet they continue to be killed with impunity. And there are signs that things are getting worse.Just four years after two journalists – Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov – were awarded the Nobel peace prize for holding the powerful to account, the world’s most powerful nation is led by someone who has made no secret of his antagonism towards his critics in the media. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has sued media organisations,including the BBC, for billions of dollars. He has banned reporters from less favoured organisations from White House briefings and cut funding for public service media. He has recently restricted visas for foreign journalists.As he welcomed Mohammed bin Salman into the Oval Office he shrugged off the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by saying “things happen”.Things do happen, including the very worst atrocities and unlawful attacks on civilians and those protected by the law. With all apologies for a miserable year end message, unless journalists continue to be able to report on such terrible things, 2026 will be no better than 2025 – and it could be much worse.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

It’s not big enough, really, for you to hit the road anddrive. And if you try, you may just end up stuck in traffic on the A1, where the late Chris Rea found himself inChristmas1978, his wife behind the wheel of her Mini, he beside her as they tried to get from Abbey Road Studios in London to their home in Middlesbrough, 220 miles away.He wrote the song on a whim, scribbling down the lyrics whenever passing headlights illuminated the car interior (as he told this paper’s Dave Simpson in 2016), then put it away with his other unfinished scraps when he got home. Eight years later, he paired his lyric with some jazzy chords he’d written and a song was born. At first, he shoved it on a B-side, but in 1988 he rerecorded it for a compilation, put it out as a single, and … it was not an instant hit. Instead it was a slow burner that went from radio playlists and department store PA systems into people’s hearts over many years.It was a slow burner because it’s not grand. Christmas songs tend to wallop the listener over the head with emotion – often joy, usually signified by copying the sound of A Christmas Gift to You by Phil Spector down to the last sleigh bell. Sometimes it’s a particularly overwrought love, as on The Power of Love, or Stay Another Day, or almost all X Factor winners. They insist on a hugeness of emotion to match the symbolism of the season.Driving Home for Christmas didn’t do any of that. Sonically, it was a pre-Spector record, pre-rock’n’roll in fact – with twinkling pianos and Sinatra-grade strings over a gentle beat – so it’s not packed with the signifiers of contemporary Christmas hits. Lyrically, well, nothing much happens, very much like driving up the A1. He’s not even longing for home, or craving his baby’s love, or fighting the traffic to get there as quick as he can. He’s just sitting in traffic, looking forward to getting home.Christmas 1988 was not a vintage season for festive records. Mistletoe and Wine by Cliff Richard was the Christmas No 1, but there was no other Christmas song until Alexander O’Neal’s Christmas Song at No 30. Mary’s Boy Child (Megamix) was at 52, with Driving Home for Christmas at 53.But Driving Home for Christmas, precisely because it doesn’t impose itself, didn’t wear out its welcome in the way some Christmas songs do. Its refusal to don the sonic bells and whistles of the second half of the 80s means it hasn’t dated: it was designed to sound nostalgic, and with so many ideas of the perfect Christmas crystallised from the pop culture of the 1950s and 60s, its particular nostalgia has never aged.Rea couldn’t go the whole hog and namecheck the A1 and the landmarks on the way to Teesside, because you can’t do road songs in Britain. Instead, when he’s “top to toe in tailbacks”, he knows there’ll “soon be a freeway”. Not in Lincolnshire, there won’t.Chris Rea: how we made Driving Home for ChristmasRead moreNevertheless, its emotional restraint captures a truth for most of us – that Christmas is rarely a time of incredible drama, but one of smaller pleasures and simple joys. Most of us will never hear sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling either. Nor, if we have any sense, do we wish it could be Christmas every day. But almost all of us have sat in an unmoving car, surrounding by the grey drear of winter, and wished we were at the other end of the journey. “I take a look at the driver next to me, he’s just the same” is perhaps the most affecting line.Driving Home for Christmas was first released as a B-side because Rea thought Christmas songs were novelties, and he didn’t want to draw attention to it. It may be an atypical song for him, but it’s not a novelty. It’s a perfect cardigan in which to envelop yourself.Explore more on these topicsChris ReaPop and rockChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

But they seem largely to reflect information that has already been made publicMon 22 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 13.22 ESTShareAfter months of public outcry and pressure from within the Maga coalition,Donald Trump’s justice department released what it called The Epstein Files, with the Trump world’s typical fanfare. A media frenzy ensued. But the “files” that were released byPam Bondi’s Department of Justice left many observers frustrated and confused. The release was partial and heavily redacted; much of the information had already been made public. Media figures were incensed, and members of Congress pledged to push the Trump administration for more. The episode left Washington watchers frustrated. It fueled speculation that Trump, who had long opposed the release of the documents, had something to hide.That was on 27 February, when agroup of 15 rightwing media figureswho had taken a special interest in the Epstein case were summoned to the White House and given white binders labeled “The Epstein Files”. The release was meant to allay pressure from the president’s conspiracy-minded base and neutralize the Epstein issue, which has dogged Trump since the financier, sex offender and former close friend of the president died in prison during his first term in 2019. But those who received the binders said that there was little new information in them. The episode only further inflamed tensions and increased the salience of the Epstein issue.The Trump administration is trying to legislate trans people out of existence | Judith LevineRead moreSomething similar seems to have happened on Friday, when the Trump administration, facing a deadline set byCongressto release the totality of the Epstein files,published about 13,000of the reportedly hundreds of thousands of documents in their possession relating toJeffrey Epsteinand the various law enforcement investigations into his trafficking and sexual abuse of underage girls. Once again, the documents seemed to largely reflect information that had already been made public; they also appeared to be selectively redacted in ways tailored to preserve the president’s interests and disparage or embarrass his enemies. Once again, the highly partial release from the Trump administration raises questions much more readily than it supplies answers.The partial release of the documents represents a political defeat for Donald Trump. Long opposed to releasing the files, Trump came under fire from within his own party last month when congressional Republicans includingThomas Massey, Majorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Macesided with Democrats in demanding the release of the Epstein files. Trump’s concentrated effort to delay or prevent the release, which reportedly includedheavy pressure on the congressmembers, proved futile; he reversed course and signed the bill passed by Congress on 19 November that mandated that all the documents be released by the justice department. The partial release came late in the afternoon on the Friday before Christmas, with much of the nation’s attention away from politics and toward the upcoming holiday. Still, congressmembers argued that the Department of Justiceviolated the law, which demanded a full release of the Epstein files within 30 days of passage: Thomas Masseywrotethat the release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law”.This is not to say that nothing in the files is disturbing. Photographs, in particular, paint a disturbing image of the financier. In his Manhattan townhouse, a room that seems to have been dedicated to Epstein’s abuse contains amassage table, various lotions and oils, and largeartworks depicting nude womenon the walls. Most of Epstein’s homes in Manhattan and the Virgin Islands appear to be decorated with artwork depicting nude female figures and spotted with framed photographs of adolescent girls,whose faces are redactedin the released images. (Epstein had no children.)Many of the documents pertain to the two major investigations of Epstein’s abuse: the first, which began with the Palm Beach police in 2005 and culminated in Epstein serving a markedly lenient sentencebrokered by the then US attorney and later Trump labor secretary Alexander Acosta, and the second investigation, begun by federal authorities in 2019, which was curtailed by Epstein’s death in jail that year.There is also evidence of the government’s failures to investigate Epstein or to take the reports of his sexual predation seriously. Included in the documents is a report of a1996 complaintabout Epstein’s interest in child abuse images made to the FBI by Maria Farmer, a young artist whoonce worked for Epstein, who told authorities that the financier had stolen nude photographs and negatives that she had made of her younger sisters, then aged 12 and 16, and had asked her to photograph girls at swimming pools for him. “EPSTEIN is now threatening that if she tells anyone about the photos he will burn her house down,” the complaint reads. The FBI took no action on Farmer’s complaint; she says she was sexually assaulted around that time by Epstein and his girlfriend and procuress, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a prison sentence for sex trafficking. It would be almost another decade before law enforcement bothered to look into what Epstein was doing to girls.Other images show how routinized or banal Epstein’s abuse of girls had become. Notes taken from aNovember 2004 voicemailread, “I have a female for him.” One particularly disturbingimage, a Post-it, reads in a bubbly, childlike handwriting: “Cannot come at 7PM tomorrow b/c of soccer.” Some of the redactions appear to have been made to protect the identities of Epstein’s victims. One law enforcement list –labeled “Masseuses” – is completely blacked out, except for the numbers enumerating the names. They goup to 254.Trump does not appear often in the files that were released on Friday, but there are marks of his friendship with Epstein. He appears in photos in a drawer, in animage which was briefly removedfrom the public files over the weekend before being restored after a public outcry. In alegal complaintfiled in a Manhattan court, a woman who says she was recruited by Maxwell as a 13-year-old at summer camp claimed that Epstein took her, then 14, to meet Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. “Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J Trump, Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, ‘This is a good one, right?’” the complaint says. The claims echorecent reportingfrom the New York Times, in which one teenager’s mother says that as a 14-year-old model, her daughter was told to “dress sexy” for a party at Mar-a-Lago, where she was repeatedly offered alcohol.We’re pastors. The fight against Maga Christianity starts locally | Doug Pagitt and Lori WalkeRead moreBut if the files released on Friday offer little information about Donald Trump, theyheavily feature Bill Clinton, the former president who was a longtime associate of Epstein’s. In images, Clinton is pictured repeatedly socializing with Epstein. In one photo, taken onboard a private plane, Clinton poses with a very young woman perched on the arm of his chair, her face redacted.Perhaps the Department of Justice released these images of Clinton hoping to shift the political consequences of the Epstein scandal on to Democrats. But anyone pictured in the Epstein documents, or who can be reasonably suspected of having known about Epstein’s activities and associated with him any way, is someone the Democratic party is better off without. Clinton, in particular, is a man with numerous credible allegations of sexual misconduct that should havedisqualified himfrom good standing within his party long ago; if that was not enough, his discredited style of politics should have been. His will be no great loss.The Epstein scandal is not going away, and neither is the public outrage over Trump’s association with the dead pedophile. At its core, the Epstein saga is a metaphor for the corruption of the American elite: their amorality, their immunity from consequence, their densely incestuous relationships of mutual protection. A decade ago, Trump swept into power by wielding anger at that elite to his own advantage. But the Epstein story has revealed to everyone that he was part of that rotten core all along.

But make no mistake – the bloodshed won’t end while the Russian president believes he can still winMon 22 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 16.24 ESTShareVladimir Putin’s marathonpress conferenceon 19 December, an annual year-end event, offered no evidence that Russia may abandon the goals the president set for his “special military operation” against Ukraine in February 2022: conquering Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. True to form, Putin seemed unperturbed that nearly four years into the war his army had managed to fully occupy only Luhansk, despite having already taken control of more than a third of that region, as well as Donetsk, by 2015.Putin’s unyielding stance shouldn’t be a surprise. Soon after the invasion, Russia’s State Dumaadopted legislationincorporating these four Ukrainian regions into Russia – and this month the foreign minister,Sergey Lavrov, and the deputy foreign minister,Sergei Ryabkov, reiterated Putin’s territorial claims.Russia’s inflexibility clashes with Donald Trump’s desperate efforts to achieve a political settlement by Christmas. To meet his self-imposed deadline, Trump even tried to pressure Volodymyr Zelenskyyinto surrenderingthe parts of Donetsk that Ukraine still holds. Though Zelenskyy refused, he was willing to end Ukraine’s years-longquest for Nato membershipand adopt neutrality, in exchange for solid western security guarantees.Zelenskyy’s shift won’t mollify Putin. Russia’s longstanding – and understandable – anxiety about Nato’s expansion predates him. But Putin’s 2022 war stems from something deeper, because there’s no evidence that Ukraine was any closer to formal membership in the alliance on the eve of Russia’s 2022 invasion than it had been in 2008, when,at its Bucharest summit, Nato declared that Ukraine would join its ranks at some future, but unspecified, date.Just as they had been in 2008, Nato countries have been divided on Ukraine candidacy, indeed even more so. That matters: article 10 of Nato’s 1949 founding treaty requires unanimity to admit new members. When Nato truly wants to increase its membership, it can act with speed: note the rapid induction ofFinland (April 2023)andSweden (March 2024), both of whom applied for membership in May 2022. To explain Putin’s motivation to invade Ukraine, we must take of account of grievances rooted in history.He has stated, repeatedly andat length, that Ukrainians and Russians have been one people for centuries; that their separation into two states after the USSR disintegrated was a tragedy; that Ukraine’s south and east, home to large numbers of ethnic Russians or Ukrainians whose native language is Russian, rightly belong to Russia. In short, Putin believes Russia was robbed.Still, at his press conference, Putin applauded Trump for being “absolutely sincere” in launching negotiations to end the war, adding thatRussiaremained committed to them and would end its military offensive, providing its interests are taken seriously.Putin’s flattery has a purpose, not to mention a susceptible target. Trump haspraised Putin’s “genius”. He, like Putin, hasblamed Ukrainefor starting the war. He wants a rapprochement with Russia that includes multibillion-dollarjoint investments. He hasbacked Putin’s demandthat Zelenskyy must hold elections, despite the war, to demonstrate his democratic legitimacy. He, like Putin, disdains Europe and would prefer to cut a deal that leaves the Europeans (and Ukrainians) on the sidelines. These are all reasons for Putin to court Trump and deepen the divide between the US and Europe.Despite their convergent views and Trump’s sympathy for Russia, he hasn’t produced a deal that suits Putin. Unless he does, the bloodshed will continue. It has already taken a terrible toll on Ukraine, which is no surprise: it’s the weaker side by far. The real surprise is the Russian army’s massive losses – incasualtiesandequipment. Russia’s economy is also underincreasing stressandbarely growing, though it hardly faces collapse. But Russians’ hardships, to say nothing of Ukrainians’, won’t matter as long as Putin believes his objectives remain achievable – whether at the bargaining table, by persuading Trump to keep coercing Zelenskyy, or on the battlefield.Meanwhile, the EU has taken a major step that will reduce the chances of Russia succeeding quickly on either front by ensuring that Kyiv’s coffers won’t run dry. The bloc’s leadership had hoped to use the interest earned from the €210bn (£185bn) in frozen Russian assets to bolster Ukraine. Although that plan failed because of outright opposition from a few EU members and reservations expressed by others, the EU managed to find a different solution. It willborrow €90bn(£79bn) to support Ukraine for two years – and with no repayment obligation unless Russia pays reparations, it is something no one expects.The press coverage highlighted the EU’s disunity over the frozen Russian assets, but what is really significant is that a bloc of 27 unruly sovereign states managed to come up with the money to ensureUkrainewouldn’t collapse. Just as Putin’s words ensure the war will continue, so do the EU’s deeds. The EU’s decision is also important because it shows Europe’s willingness to act independently on the war, even if it means putting distance between itself and the US.Putin thinks democracy is the west’s weakness. We have to prove him wrong | Rafael BehrRead moreIn August, Trump remarked that Americans have no stake in Ukraine’s war because they are separated from it by a “big, beautiful ocean”. Europe lacks this geographical luxury. That, along with Trump’s newNational Security Strategy, which depicts the continent as a place drowning in problems and therefore of diminishing importance to the US, may have convinced European leaders to start acting independently.GivenTrump’s suspensionof all direct military aid to Kyiv in March, Europe’s assistance alone may not be enough to ensure that Ukrainians obtain a peace that they deem just. Then again, this has been a war of surprises, the greatest of which is that Ukraine’s army remains unvanquished.Europe has thrown Ukraine a lifeline, but we should be under no illusions. Ukraine will continue to fight with its back to the wall against an adversary that has vastly more of every war-relevant resource – and whose leader’s idea of compromise is indistinguishable from his adversary’s capitulation. Barring a sudden change in Russia’s position on the territorial question, Trump will be denied the Christmas gift he yearns for. Albeit each in their own way, Putin’s press conference and the EU’s loan package for Ukraine make it all but certain that the war will extend into the coming year.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies.

No thanks: just give me dinnerMon 22 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 16.25 ESTShareIt’s lovely going out for dinner in London. It’s a gastro capital with cuisines from all around the world. One night, Indian, French the next, Peruvian, Ethiopian. You can travel the globe without leaving Hackney.This time of year, I’m super busy planning the un-Royal Variety show – a punk pastiche of the royal version – and so I can’t be bothered with meal prep and washing up, and find myself eating out an awful lot. Most food trends I can get behind (with the exception of truffle – yuck!). But one pernicious dining trend that refuses to go away and which I detest is “small plates”.My heart sinks and I become inwardly furious when I sit down and the waiter asks: “Have you been here before?” “No, it’s our first time.” “Well, we do ‘small plates’ and we suggest you order between three and 20 per person.”It’s even more annoying than QR code menus. The last thing you want to do when you sit down with an old friend for a catch-up is immediately get your phone out and start loading internet pages and inputting your bank details – it’s a leftover from Covid that should be abolished.But back to small plates. People think I’m a hipster, being an east London drag queen, but I’ve got nothing on the purveyors of “caulifower bites”. Suddenly you’re handing out a tenner here, a tenner there, for tiny saucers of pomegranate seeds, things sprinkled in petals and a random blow-torched lettuce leaf. Just give me a bloody dinner!And then your friend inevitably says: “Let’s just get lots of things and share.” NOOO!!! Don’t make me share my dinner with you as if we’re a pack of wild cats. I will gladly share a lot of things with strangers in a Berlin dungeon, but I absolutely refuse to share a piece of pig’s cheek in Haggerston.I’m 53. I grew up in Kent in the 1970s in a perfectly normal working-class, borderline lower-middle-class household, the kind so wonderfully explored in Mike Leigh movies. It was the kind of home where the food was dished from the pan on to the plate. And then the whole plate was plopped in front of you and you were told to eat it all up – or you couldn’t go and watch Grange Hill.In small-plates hell, you end up trying to reconstruct a normal meal and paying twice the price for it. Death to small plates – that’s the hill I will die on. Unless you’re in Spain, of course; I love a spot of tapas, but that’s different. Andalucia: do your thing, honey. But Dalston: oh, grow up, and give me a pie.Jonny Woo is a performer, drag artist, writer, and co-owner of The Divine, he will be hosting his Un-Royal Variety atSoho Theatre Walthamstow26-28 November 2026.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe hill I will die onRestaurantscommentShareReuse this content"

But is saying ‘sorry’ enough?Fatma AydemirIn Germany, the neo-Nazi terrorist Beate Zschäpe has made a public display of her remorse – but remains silent on key aspects of her crimesMon 22 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 04.07 ESTShareIt’s a strange season to talk about forgiveness. While streets glow with fairy lights and shop windows promise that compassion is only a gift-box away,Germanyis once again confronted with the unresolved wounds of its recent past. The trap of the season is this: believing that every gesture of regret must be met with mercy. As if forgiveness was a resource available to anyone who is reasonable enough to move on, no matter how atrociously they have been treated.It is certainly not that simple for the families of the victims of theNational Socialist Underground(NSU). During the 2000s, the neo-Nazi terror organisation killed 10 people, nine of them immigrants, mostly small business owners, and one policewoman. Because investigators focused on probing the victims’ families and communities rather than on Nazis, the NSU was able to continue murdering without interference. German media reported on the atrocities asdie Dönermordethekebab murders, as if it was some exotic true-crime phenomenon.In 2011, when the NSU outed itself in avideoin which it claimed responsibility for the murders and several nailbomb attacks, it also exposed profound structural failures in the German state’s approach to rightwing terrorism.Subsequent inquiries revealed thatsecurity agencies had informantsin close proximity to the perpetrators, overlooked relevant intelligence, and in some casesdestroyed filesafter the group wasuncovered. As a result, the NSU case has come to be understood not only as a sequence of racist murders but as an indictment of the state’s inability – or unwillingness – to adequately recognise and confront far-right violence.Now, in ongoing proceedings surrounding the NSU, Beate Zschäpe –sentenced to lifein 2018 for her role within the NSU core cell responsible for 10 murders – recently appeared in court as a witness in arelated trial. But this time, Zschäpe took on a markedly different tone than she had before – one of remorse, or at least something that resembled it. She spoke of shame, of reconsideration, of recognition of her own guilt, which she claims only started during her own trial, ending in 2018.Back then, Zschäpedenied any involvementin the murders, and her cooperation with authorities was extremely limited. A full investigation of the murders would only have been possible with Zschäpe’s truthful testimony, since her two co-members,Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Börnhardt, had killed themselves in 2011 to evade arrest.Zschäpe had gone into hiding with the two men and had lived with them under false identities in various German cities for more than a decade. In court, she stayed silent for years. Then, in written testimony running to 53 pages, she managed to not answer any of the 300 questions asked by the victims’ relatives, who appeared in courtas co-plaintiffs. Instead, Zschäpe claimed never to have been informed in advance about the murders and bomb attacks committed by her two partners, saying she had found out about them only afterwards.Now, the 50-year-old Zschäpe has appeared in court and spoken of how “ashamed” she is. Inevitably, one has to wonder whether this shift is really a moral transformation or a more pragmatic pivot made in the hope of improving her situation in prison. Last summer, she was admitted to a neo-Nazi exit programme, promptingalarm amongthe victims’ relatives, since this could increase the chances of her early release. In 2026, Zschäpe will have served 15 years in prison, which is the minimum for a life sentence. Because of the gravity of the crimes, she will not be released next year, but the court must set a so-called minimum for her remaining term of imprisonment. Her participation in the exit programme and her public display of contrition may have an impact on the court’s decision.“There is no excuse for the murders. I will never be able to make it right,” Zschäpe said in court earlier this month. Gamze Kubasik, whose father Mehmet Kubasik was shot in the head by the NSU in 2006 in his own kiosk, was also in court that day andshouted: “Then tell us the truth!” Zschäpe responded with a silent look at Kubasik.And this silence gives more answers than all the vague words of remorse and guilt Zschäpe is now using in court. For the performance of remorse has a tradition in Germany. It fits a country that has confronted its crimes historically – or at least likes to tell itself that story. As a nation it has learned that a good mix of contrition and silence can pave the way back to social acceptance. The desire for atonement is not inherently wrong. But it becomes problematic when it is treated as a shortcut: when forgiveness is expected, although no believable effort has been made to earn it.If Zschäpe’s efforts to distance herself from the neo-Nazi ideology were sincere, she would have helped to clarify the circumstances of the murders. She can still share information, which many families are begging for, in order to understand what happened to their loved ones. But Zschäpe chooses silence. She doesn’t show by her actions that she has become a different person, she just tries to sound like one. And maybe that’s the thing with forgiveness: you don’t have to forgive somebody just because they ask for it – they have to earn it as well.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In places where large numbers of people feel disheartened about living standards and prospects, and disenchanted by democratic politics as a result, a whole range of grievances can take hold. This year’sGuardian charity appealis all about countering the alarming rise of far-right, anti-migrant and other extremist politics – and the misconceptions that fuel them. We and our partners are convinced that the fraying threads of communities can be woven back together with effort and imagination, supported by your generous donations.If polarisation is fuelled by digital capitalism’s commodification of attention – as illustrated by the role of social media ininflaming anti-migrant protests– cohesion and cooperation increase when people build bridges in real life. The charities and projects in this year’s appeal in this year’s appealmake and strengthen connections. Drawing on a range of techniques and activities, they seek to enhance confidence and reduce antagonism.The charity Locality advocates on behalf of 2,000 local organisations, ensuring that grassroots, bottom-up initiatives are not crowded out by bigger ones. The pioneering community housing provider Back on the Map is a case in point. It hasregenerateda declining and fractured part of Sunderland not for the benefit of property developers but for the people who live there. The neighbourhood is “making leaps and bounds”, one resident told our reporter.Citizens UK will use funds raised to train organisers who play a key role in harnessing community power to come up with projects such as the one above. The Hope Unlimited Charitable Trust gives grants togroups and schemes that counter divisionand hostility to migrants, and replace grievance with hope.Our other two partners are innovators in the north of England.The Linking Networkhas shown that tackling the kinds of divisions that see too many children living in separate community silos can be life-enhancing as well as worthwhile. Who is Your Neighbour? promotes conversations with a focus on resolving conflicts.The charity sector has itself been under huge pressure since the financial crisis and the Conservative austerity programme that followed. As the local arms of the state were whittled away, the voluntary sector was expected to pick up what councils could no longer support. Thelimited redistributionof health and other budgets from richer to poorer areas that Labour has embarked on with schemes such as Pride in Place andchanges to council fundingshould alleviate some of the worst injustices and hardships. But further reform of local government finance will be needed, not least because of theimpossible burden placed on councilsby central government failures on social care and special educational needs.Charities such as the ones we are asking our readers to support can help to knit back together the strands of a stressed society in a spirit of hopefulness. While they are not a substitute for democratically accountable politicians and services, they play a unique role of their own. With more than £500,000 raised, we thank you for your generosity so far.

The invention of the telegraph and the rise of the postcard were bothseenas potential threats to a more leisurely, reflective form of communication. Yet by the close of the 20th century, more letters were being sent than ever, as social correspondence began to be supplemented by a boom in business mail.From Europe’s most tech-savvy society, however, comes ominous news. As of next week, Denmark’s state-run postal service willendall letter deliveries after doing the rounds for 400 years. Around 1,500 jobs are being cut, and the country’s beloved red letterboxes are being sold off. It will still be possible for Danes to send a card or a love letter to someone far away next Christmas, but only via the shops of a smaller private company or a costly home collection.Few industry observers doubt that other nations will eventually go downsimilarroutes. To the dismay of the French public, La Poste has started toremovesome of its postboxes, while Germany’s Deutsche Post is cutting thousands of jobs. In Britain, second‑class services have beenreducedand letter volumes continue to drop, after falling from a peak of 20bn in the mid-2000s to 6.6bn in 2023-24.That may at least partly be down to unpopularhikesin the price of a Royal Mail stamp. But the direction of travel is unarguable: the online world has hoovered up business transactions and offers us multiple forms of communicating with each other more or less instantaneously. In a world of notification alerts and a blur of fingers typing on tablets and phones, the romantic image of a solitary letter writer, seated at a lamplit desk, no longer speaks to our cultural desires or reality.The interests of the minority who continue to depend on physical post will need to be safeguarded in coming transitions. Some of the rest of us will mourn the gradual passing of a genre into history. From Samuel Johnson to Virginia Woolf and TS Eliot, the most prolific exponents of the form have left us a precious patrimony, offering vivid insights into the quotidian reality of their times. In the hands of such authors, the art of writing letters became another branch ofliterature.More widely, the social historian GM Trevelyanobservedthat letters “enabled the poor, for the first time in the history of man, to communicate with the loved ones from whom they were separated”. And for countless millions, the receipt of handwritten pages from a lover, a parent or a friend served as an intimate proxy for their presence. The time set aside and dedicated to writing a letter signified an emotional investment, made tangible in the envelope delivered through another’s door.Transformation opens up new possibilities. Digitalisation is already enabling new ways of writing to emerge in an unpredictable world of literary experimentation. The Substack blog, for example, can be viewed as a kind of open letter to new online communities. On platforms such as WhatsApp, the speed of online exchanges has licensed a liberating informality that is tolerant of mistakes and encourages constant stylistic innovation.In the Victorian golden age of the epistolary form, Lewis Carrollwrotethat “the proper definition of a man is an animal that writes letters”. The future has yet to be written. Sadly though, it is unlikely to be arriving in an envelope.Explore more on these topicsPostal serviceOpinionCouriers/delivery industryDenmarkRoyal MailEuropeLiteracyLewis CarrolleditorialsShareReuse this content"

He must take up the baton for the arts, 18 December). The provision of musical education in state schools has declined in the last few decades, and although the pre-Christmas period may give us a chance to hear some lovely music, the reality is thatmost practising musiciansare the product of private schools. Parents of state school pupils may cringe at their children’s performances, with few managing their instruments, and little evidence of input from qualified music teachers.The obituary ofHumphrey Burtonin the same issue also highlights what we have lost over recent decades in the media, with the BBC Proms and a watered-down Radio 3 doing little to keep the country’s music culture alive. Kettle mentions Alan Bennett’s closing lines of The History Boys – “pass it on, boys” – which urge us to recognise the worth of what this country has inherited. Unfortunately, there is not much serious discussion of contemporary music culture in the Guardian either, to alert us to what is on offer nationally or regionally.Alan Bennett’s script for the recent film The Choral, set during the first world war, highlights that regional music-making needs local performers of all ages and genders – but, despite the efforts of local musicians and organisers, today’s audiences are likely to die out if neither the state school sector nor the national and regional media educate them.Martha WörschingLoughborough, LeicestershireMartin Kettle is exactly right. The arts in schools and beyond need more support and that is a job that only the government can guarantee. Often talent is only spotted and nurtured in private schools, as state provision is perversely encouraged to give up on it. That leads to a narrower path to later-life exploration of talent or making it your career. And that leads to intrinsic unfairness, wasted talent and a creative sector top heavy with the talented, the lucky and the rich – not just the talented. This is what world-leading specialist colleges such asTrinity Labantry to correct, by finding talent wherever it is and giving it a chance to achieve excellence. More than 80% of our UK students come from state schools.Apart from the government, there is another organisation that has been the indispensable partner for culture and society in this country – the BBC. So it is just dismal that last week’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sportgreen paperbarely alludes to the BBC’s key role as a cultural sponsor. The arts are namechecked as a genre that could be offered as a pay-extra premium service. That omission ignores the BBC’s legacy as a bringer of great art to everyone via its orchestras, its commissioning of music and drama, and its support for emerging artists and writers of all genres. Britain would be a poorer place without that legacy.I hope the government and the BBC board use the opportunity of a new charter to renew their joint commitment to keeping the arts at the forefront, not as a reminder of what we could have had with just a little thought (and a little money).Alan DaveyChair, Trinity Laban Conservatoire ofMusicand DanceArts education should be a right and an entitlement, not a luxury determined by postcode or school type. Wherever a child grows up in the UK, they should have access to meaningful creative experiences.Yet our work in schools across the UK has shown that access remains deeply unequal, a Martin Kettle outlines. Too many state schools have been forced to cut arts provision, despite clear evidence that enrichment raises attainment and wellbeing – particularly for those with the fewest opportunities.Thecurriculum and assessment review, alongside the recent Hodgereview of Arts Council England, presents a generational opportunity to reset the landscape for young people’s engagement with the arts.Scrapping the Ebacc, giving arts GCSEs parity and introducing an oracy framework and core enrichment entitlement rightly recognise creativity and communication as essential to education. The proposed Arts Council-backed cultural enrichment fund, supporting transport, tickets and staff cover, would remove existing practical barriers and bring first-time audiences into our theatres.If these reforms are to succeed, schools must be properly resourced and we must invest in specialist arts teachers. The skills young people gain through the arts are not optional extras; they prepare them for life.Mike TuckerHead of Coram ShakespeareSchoolsFoundationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromPaul F FaupelMon 22 Dec 2025 12.33 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 15.44 ESTShareWe write as “members” of the women’s liberation movement (WLM) since the earliest days in London in the late 1960s, and we read Susanna Rustin’s long read with interest and appreciation (‘Pretty birds and silly moos’: the women behind the Sex Discrimination Act, 18 December). We were drawn to the liberation politics of the new WLM (no membership forms available or needed).Rustin refers briefly to WLM statements and conference resolutions in a way that might lead younger people to imagine a more formal organising force than ever existed. The WLM was a movement, not an organisation or a party. The national women’s liberation conferences that happened in those years often functioned as national “consciousness-raising” exercises. The most important “votes” were often about adding demands to our growing list, sometimes after long and volatile debates and discussions of emerging issues.Rustin is so right that the struggles (we all spoke of struggles) taking place both around the law and equal rights, and among the women who considered themselves more radical, are fading from living memories via lived experiences. For an inclusive history’s sake, it’s time to record as many of those voices, including grassroots ones, before it’s too late.We belong to a small, voluntary group of old feminists aiming to do just that. We call our groupHowl(History of Women’s Liberation). We’re now online and have some wonderful, varied stories, fabulous photos and illustrations, and a significant amount of resource material. We want more!Sue O’Sullivan and Miriam DavidMembers,History of Women’s Liberation organising groupHaving read the long read on the background to the Sex Discrimination Act, I was astounded that there was no mention of the wartime Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) led byPauline Gower, who pioneered sex equality in the workplace in the ATA, equal pay for male and female pilots, and equality of opportunity based on merit.To the female pilots who joined the ATA this was astounding, given the sex discrimination and misogyny that they were subjected to in their prewar flying careers. These women are the subject of an excellent book by Becky Aikman that I have just finished reading: Spitfires – The AmericanWomenWho Flew In The Face Of Danger During World War II, which tellingly recounts how their experiences in the ATA opened their eyes to the need for sex discrimination to be eliminated in the US.They aspired to serve on the frontline, but this was prohibited by the ATA and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as they were not part of the armed forces. They looked to the postwar world in the US for their flying futures in civil airlines, but this aspiration was stifled by the unchanging sex discrimination, coupled with a large cadre of demobbed male USAAF pilots seeking civilian careers.Unfortunately, much the same was true here in the UK. Sadly, Gower died in 1947, aged only 36. One wonders what might have been had she lived longer and been able to continue promoting workplace equality for women and the banning of sex discrimination.Paul F FaupelSomersham, CambridgeshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For decades, City & Guilds has helped young people and adults get the skills they need to build their lives. That legacy now feels like it’s hanging by a thread due to the reported £22m cost-cutting drive.What’s just as worrying is the apparent shift from a nonprofit mindset to a profit-driven one. If education becomes just another business, there’s always a risk that profit comes before impact. For many learners – especially those with few other options – vocational training is their path forward. If prices rise or support is cut, it will hit these people hardest.Sending jobs overseas might look good on the books, but it erodes our capacity to train and assess skilled workers when the country needs them most. We need more local expertise, not less of it.Let’s not forget City & Guilds was fined last year by the regulator, Ofqual,for regulatory breaches. That track record appears to show that we can’t just trust everything will be fine. If standards were shaky before, why should we believe they’ll get better now?This isn’t just corporate reshuffling. It’s about the future of vocational education, people’s livelihoods and whether learners across the UK have real opportunities. I hope readers, policymakers and regulators pay attention not just to the bottom line but to the real impact that these changes will have on people.Michael RobinsonGosport, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They have been on a hell of a journey over 11 days of Test cricket, and now – too late – they are getting somewhere.They have reminded me of some of the students who have passed through the school where I teach: they get into the upper sixths and they’re first-team cricketers, the big boys, very confident, dominating the team, playing good cricket, think they’ve cracked the code. Then they have a gap year and go travelling, and suddenly they realise there’s a whole world out there, that life can be tough and things can be done differently. Out of their comfort zone they can mature rapidly as young men and as people. I look at England’s performance in the third Test and think that after some tough experiences, and having been forced to confront the fact that they are not what they thought they were, they have maybe turned a corner in terms of their maturity.‘It’s not up to me is it?’ McCullum wants to stay on despite England’s Ashes defeatRead moreThat might seem an odd statement given the experience in this team, but so much of their approach to cricket and to this series has been anything but mature. The leadership around this team has produced a lot of memorable rhetoric across the last few years – running towards the danger, see ball hit ball, we don’t play for draws, taking the aggressive option – but here, in the disappointment of defeat, were signs that they are on the verge of producing something actually meaningful.After the game Brendon McCullum said his players had been “so caught up and so driven to succeed that we almost got in our own way, and we stymied our talent and our skill and our ability”. What an extraordinary admission: his time in charge has been all about taking away pressure and freeing the players from fear, and here was the coach admitting that when it came to the crunch, to the biggest and toughest series his players are going to have to deal with, his methods had completely failed. I was gobsmacked by that. But now the team has found another way of removing pressure – by losing the series in double-quick time – and can go into the last two games with a fresh mindset.This is the worst-case scenario,three down with three played, the Ashes already gone. But somehow I still feel optimistic about England’s chances at the MCG. Such are the improvements I saw towards the end of the third Test I think they are on the way up, and some players are starting to show the talent and quality they have. With Australia set to be without Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon, and perhaps with their phenomenal will to win dimmed slightly by the series already being decided, if England can keep their own spirits up they should be able to end their losing run.View image in fullscreenZak Crawley impressed playing in an orthodox fashion at Adelaide.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesIn the second innings in Adelaide Zak Crawley looked every inch a Test opener – he even drew praise from Mark Waugh, who isn’t exactly inclined to shower Englishmen with plaudits. It was such a welcome sight, watching Crawley playing in an orthodox fashion, defending late and tight to his body, backing his defence against the new ball and then feeding off the scoring opportunities that inevitably came his way. For three years he has been told to go out and play his way, and perhaps he has finally realised what that should look like. When it comes to Crawley the messaging has been that he is not expected to be consistent, that his job is to set the tone. His challenge now is to be a better player than that suggests, to show real consistency with this new mindset and method and go on to be a prolific opening batter.Jofra Archer was outstandingin Australia’s first innings, combining hostility with accuracy and longevity, getting through 20 overs in stifling conditions.In his first innings Ben Stokes dug in and did exactly the opposite of everything he has spoken about for three years, proving his skill and adaptability again – he will reflect on his captaincy and his leadership on this tour, but those qualities have never been in doubt – and having spoken after Brisbane about determination and fight he led by example brilliantly. In the way they approach their batting in particular this side has completely rejected the idea that time is an important factor in Test cricket but in those conditions keeping the opposition in the field is an achievement in itself, and perhaps that contributed to Lyon’s hamstring injury. If you make the opposition bowlers work hard and fatigue their bodies, force them to spend hours on the field in high temperatures, it will impact on their performances and on their bodies. There is a value to batting time.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook has the shots but must do more to make the most of his talent.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesIt is a lesson Harry Brook needs to take on board. He has the shots, all the ingredients to go on and become a huge run-scorer, but he has not proved that he has the appetite mentally to put in the hours both in his preparation and during games to make the most of his talent in the red-ball game.He was widely criticised after getting out playing a reverse sweep in England’s second innings. I don’t mind the shot selection – a lot of modern players are very good at it and play it regularly, much as they would a cover drive.The issue wasn’t that he got out playing a reverse sweep, it was that it was a really bad, poorly controlled reverse sweep – a lot going on in terms of changing his foot position, leading to him losing his balance.I encourage young players facing spin to get well forward or to play off the back foot, and if you can do that with a straight bat it’s low risk. The reverse sweep is a high-risk shot: if you miss it there’s a good chance you’re going to get out, so it needs to be played with real control.Brook showed signs in both innings of accepting the responsibility he has and his readiness to play an innings for the team’s sake, but his decision-making still lets him down. Again, it is a question of maturity. This team has been on a hell of a ride since they landed in Australia, and they have been forced to mature rapidly, but the journey is far from over.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old was helped off in considerable pain and MRI scans confirmed Liverpool’s initial fears of a serious problem.The club have not placed a timescale on Isak’s recovery but the £125m striker had an operation on Monday and will be out for several months.The extent of the injury is a devastating blow for Isak, who has endured a difficult start to his Liverpool career beset by fitness issues. He had to play catch-up at the start of the season for Arne Slot’s team after missing the majority of pre-season at Newcastle having effectively downed tools to force through an eventual British record transfer to Anfield. The Sweden international was then ruled out for almost a month with a groin injury suffered against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League.Isak’s goal against Spurs was only his second in the Premier League for Liverpool and his third in total and his first courtesy of an assist from Florian Wirtz, a combination Slot had hoped would elevate the reigning champions this season. There is surprise at Liverpool that Van de Ven’s challenge went unpunished by the referee, John Brooks, and the video assistant referee, Stuart Attwell, in a game in which Spurs had Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero sent off.With Mohamed Salah away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt and Cody Gakpo also out injured, Slot’s attacking options are stretched as a consequence of Isak’s injury. The forward is the second of Liverpool’s summer recruits to suffer a serious injury and long-term layoff. Young defender Giovanni Leoni is out for the remainder of the season having sustained an ACL injury on his debut against Southampton in the Carabao Cup in September.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a battle of wits but there was only going to be one winner. Jiménez stuttered, moved towards the ball at a leisurely pace, waited for Nottingham Forest’s goalkeeper to move left and then set Fulham on the path to a vital victory by sending a clinical penalty into the opposite corner.This was Jiménez in his element. The Mexican is not the quickest striker around but the 34-year-old is still one of the game’s sharpest thinkers. Few, after all, can match Jiménez for accuracy from the spot. He is calmness personified in those situations and, remarkably, is now joint top with Yaya Touré when it comes to players with a 100% conversion rate from penalty kicks in the history of thePremier League.Fulham 1-0 Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreThis was Jiménez’s 11th conversion out of 11 – Dimitar Berbatov, the former Manchester United and Fulham striker, is next best on nine from nine – and it was enough to pull Fulham10 points clear of the bottom three. “In that moment he was cold,” Fulham’s manager, Marco Silva, said. “He’s a great penalty taker. He is not at his best but the last four games at home he scored twice and both goals gave us wins.”Silva was honest enough to admit that his side were not exactly flowing with confidence on the ball. ForFulham, though, it was one of those occasions when the result mattered far more than treating Craven Cottage to an evening of thrilling football. Silva’s options were limited by the absence of several key players and he was entitled to be pleased with how Fulham battled to their second consecutive win, nullifying Forest and denying Sean Dyche’s side the chance to increase their five-point lead over 18th placed West Ham.There was plenty of huff and puff from Forest but they did not play with enough attacking intent and never looked like scoring. Their passing was pedestrian and they did not do enough to disturb Fulham’s outstanding centre-backs, Joachim Andersen and Jorge Cuenca.“It was a low-level game quality wise,” Dyche said. “We started well and had a couple of decent chances. Second half we had more control but didn’t really penetrate. It’s hard to break teams down when they camp in. We shouldn’t be losing that game.”Dyche did not bother complaining about a poor game being decided by Anthony Taylor, the referee, penalising Douglas Luiz for tripping Kevin just before half-time. Forest deserved nothing. Their creative players all disappointed and they fizzled out after a couple of early efforts from Igor Jesus raised false hope.View image in fullscreenDouglas Luiz fouls Kevin to concede the penalty which proved decisive.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersFulham, whose small squad has been stretched by Calvin Bassey, Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze participating in the Africa Cup of Nations, shaded it. Kevin was lively on the left, running at Nicolò Savona and delivering dangerous crosses. Sasa Lukic shot narrowly wide. Jiménez also went close, meeting Antonee Robinson’s cross with a header that flew into the side netting.Fulham were pressing as half-time approached. Five minutes were added on, partly because of Kevin needing treatment on an earlier head injury, and the winger took advantage. The 22-year-old darted into the area from the left, drawing defenders towards him, and was sent tumbling when Douglas Luiz caught him. It was a foolish tackle from a player of his experience. The Brazilian pleaded innocence but it was a clear foul and Jiménez punished him by sending John Victor the wrong way.Forest had to wake up. They had a chance at the start of the second half, Igor Jesus lobbing over. Neco Williams threatened next, recording Forest’s first shot on target when he tested Bernd Leno from 20 yards.Fulham, sinking back, invited pressure. Unable to keep the ball, they asked for trouble. Forest, though, could not create anything clear. Murillo and Morgan Gibbs-White were overly optimistic when trying to score from improbable distances. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Omari Hutchinson were ineffective on the flanks. Kenny Tete bullied Hudson-Odoi.Alexander Isak set to miss several months of season after Liverpool confirm fractured ankleRead moreForest were blunt. Yet Fulham were passive. Silva sensed the shift. It was not a surprise when he altered the flow by introducing Tom Cairney’s perceptive passing in midfield. Cairney gave Fulham more balance with the ball. Driving forward, he almost made it 2-0 in the 72nd minute. It took a fine save from John Victor to push the midfielder’s shot wide.Forest slipped away. Dyche responded – Taiwo Awoniyi, Nicolás Domínguez and James McAtee coming on – but Fulham held firm and were the more threatening side during the closing stages.It was a night to forget for Forest. They remain in peril and know their away form must improve if they are to stay up. They had no answer for Jiménez’s cool.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In 2025, Mondo Duplantis achieved it. He broke thepole vault world record four times. Retained his world indoor and outdoor titles. Won all 16 competitions that he entered. Was voted World Athletics’ male athlete of the year. And, for good measure, was named the BBC’soverseas personality of the yeartoo.“There’s not necessarily such a thing as a perfect season,” Duplantis says on a bright December day in Monaco. He pauses. “But that’s as perfect as it can get.”Sporting dominance can eventually become sterile or dull. Thinktiki-taka-era Spain. OrMercedes-era Lewis Hamilton. Duplantis, though, remains track and field’s greatest magic trick. How, you ask, will he clear a bar that is not far off the height of an average British house? But then he charges down the runway, plants and twists and flips, and makes his audience gasp yet again.On special occasions the stuntman’s instinct to push the limits is fused with a leading actor’s ability to steal a scene. At the Paris Olympics last year, after Duplantis hadbroken his own world record, he then charged across the track to passionately kiss his fiancee, the model and content creator Desiré Inglander. The cameras captured every frame. The clip went viral. Suddenly the Swede was a global celebrity as well as a double Olympic gold medallist.View image in fullscreenMondo Duplantis celebrates in Tokyo with his fiancee, Desiré Inglander.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHow much did that moment change your life, I ask, and how often are you recognised now? “Night and day,” Duplantis says. “It’s all the time. I feel like there are so many people that know me without even knowing me, which is very weird. It’s not necessarily that 100% of people recognise me on the street. But a lot of people know the clip and the moment.”However, Duplantis insists the celebration was completely spontaneous, fuelled only by adrenaline and unbridled joy. “It wasn’t planned,” he says. “It just happened. That’s probably why it went so viral. People could feel how pure it was. You can’t really write that. It was just a pure moment of passion, success, glory and love, all at the same time – a crazy combination. It’s one of these things you never really fully understand. It’s storybook stuff. It’s not like real life. It feels fictional.”At the world championships in Tokyo this year, Duplantis repeated the trick: breaking the world record on his final jump with a 6.30m clearance before kissing Inglander again. This time he was helped by a super speedy and grippy shoe he calls “the Claw” – because it has a spike protruding from the front of it like a medieval torture device. A faster version, he says, is on its way, which he believes can help him eventually go over 6.40m.“It’s simple physics,” he says. “Energy in and energy out. If you can put more energy in and you’re faster, then you create more energy to get it out. I believe that I differentiate myself from the rest of the field in every aspect of the jump, but I think I separate myself the most on the runway, on the speed.” Which is where the Claw Mk II comes in.View image in fullscreenMondo Duplantis insists he still has plenty of ambition despite his dominance: ‘The hunger and the motivation is 100% still there.’Photograph: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesNot that Duplantis is testing it himself. Instead, he is relying on his friend, the 400m hurdles world record-holder, Karsten Warholm, and his coach, Leif Olav Alnes, to put the work in for him. “They are crazy science maniacs,” he says, laughing. “They go to Vietnam always to do super testing. I’m not very analytical at all, actually. But I know if a shoe is the fastest one for him, it’s going to be the fastest one for me because we have a similar foot-striking pattern.”Duplantis is only 26. There could easily be another 10 world records to add to the 14 he has already earned. Most probably, another couple of Olympic titles as well, by the age of 33. At that age, I suggest, Alexander the Great was said to have cried because there were no more worlds to conquer. Does Duplantis harbour similar fears?He shakes his head. “Oh, I will have everything to conquer,” he says. “You still have to have a life and some ambition. And I will push myself to be productive and find some other meaning.”Duplantis points to his burgeoning career as a music artist. His first song, Bop, has been listened to over 2m times on Spotify. His second, 4L, another 1.2m times. A third single is coming in January, and it is rumoured that he will also perform the official song for the WorldAthleticsUltimate Championship in September.But Duplantis is no mere novelty act doing it for the money: not Sweden’s answer to Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle, say, orCarl Lewis going disco after the LA Games. He is serious about developing his craft.“It’s truly an escape for me from athletics and everything in the world,” he says. “When I play golf, nothing else matters apart from that next shot. It’s the same in the studio. I’m just trying to finish whatever this conversation is that we’re having in this song, in this demo. I’m just trying to find the path.“I have a very obsessive attitude and behaviour. So it’s very common that I get really locked in, and I find myself getting a few missed texts from Desiré asking where I’m at, because she’s waiting for me to come home. Because I just have a really good time with it.”View image in fullscreenMondo Duplantis is the centre of attention after his win in Tokyo.Photograph: Photonews/Getty ImagesDuplantis’s golf handicap is a highly respectable 11, but for now working on his swing is on the backburner. “The music thing has stopped the golf,” he says. “In order to have a healthy relationship, I have to pick one hobby. You can’t have two hobbies where you’re out of the house for six hours a day, when I already do all my other stuff too. If I played golf and made music all the time, then I wouldn’t probably be getting married next year.”Longer term, Duplantis is even mulling over the idea of a career in sports politics. He certainly has the charisma for it. Watching him in Monaco, it was impressive how he spoke to everyone from dignitaries like Prince Albert II to fans wanting to say hello. He engaged. He listened. And his star power would inevitably win more than a few votes.“I’ll be the new Seb Coe,” he says. “I’ll speak it into existence.” Duplantis has a smile on his face, but he is not entirely flippant. “Honestly, why not?” he asks. “The older I get, the more keen I am.“Right now, pole vaulting is my main focus. But I want to grow track and field as much as I can because athletics is the No 1 Olympic sport. So by the time I’m in my 40s, and I’ve had more life lessons, I think I would be in a good position to help this sport.”But a future career as World Athletics president is still some way off. Especially when he still has fresh worlds to conquer in the event he has utterly dominated throughout this decade. “The hunger and the motivation is 100% still there,” he promises. “And I have had the dinner, so it’s just all dessert now.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Once built on, they are gone forever, and Sport England’s statutory consultee role is an important line of defence. Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher.”The letter adds: “This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer.”About 10,000 playing fields were sold off in the 80s and 90s before protections were introduced in 1996 and 2001. Sport England’s figures also show it protected more than 1,000 playing fields in 2021-2022.However that looks set to change, unless a public consultation that runs to 13 January is able to persuade the government to change its mind.Fields in Trust, which put together the letter, has found that almost half of Britain already lives more than a 10-minute walk from a playing field, with the poorest areas continuing to lose most green spaces to development or closure.Scott, the Fields in Trust president, urged the government to listen to the warnings from across sport.“Too many communities risk losing these very spaces,” she said. “The playing fields where children first learn to play, the parks where families spend Sunday afternoons, the pitches for weekend kickabouts between friends. I wouldn’t be where I am today without that green space in Sunderland, where I spent countless hours as a kid, and every child deserves that same chance.“I urge the government to listen carefully. We’re not asking for the impossible. We’re asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.”The government has been approached for comment. This month a spokesperson said: “There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.Sport England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSport EnglandSport politicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

For all the adoration he inspires in Egypt and throughout Africa the lack of an Afcon winner’s medal is the one major absence on Salah’s CV.After losing in two finals in 2017and 2022, Salah is desperate to fill that gap, all the more so given the possibility that his club career in Europe may be winding down, with several Saudi Pro League clubs ready to pounce onhis unhappiness at Anfield.Salah’s situation in this tournament could not be more different from the previous Afcon in Côte d’Ivoire two years ago when, ironic as it may now seem, he was accused of prioritising club over country. Egypt’s greatest player left that tournament early to return to Liverpool for treatment after a hamstring injury during a group stage game against Ghana, with the country’s most-capped player Ahmed Hassan accusing him of letting the nation down.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush celebrates after equalising with a piercing run and shot from the left.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APSalah appears to have found salvation in being reunited with his countrymen on this occasion, however, with Egypt’s coach Hossam Hassam saying “he regains his strength with the national team”, as he demonstrated by guiding them to a hard-fought win.It was clear that the start that Salah has the freedom to roam as he wishes in this team, drifting into central areas and dropping deep to pick up possession in his own half as he saw fit. He remains most threatening from the right however, and twice in the space of one first-half minute he came close to conjuring the opening goal. A lofted cross to Trézéguet produced a header that was saved by Washington Arubi before Salah cut in from the right and had a shot from the edge of the penalty area blocked. Salah created another chance in the 12th minute for Eman Ashour, which he slashed wide, his last notable contribution of a truncated evening, which ended in the 34th minute when Hassam replaced him with big striker Mostafa Mohamed in a tactical switch after falling behind. Zimbabwe’s goal stunned Egypt, who should have been cruising at that stage. Instead they were caught on the counterattack, with Emmanuel Jalai crossing from the right to Prince Dube, who produced a wonderful turn and finish from the edge of the area.Egypt continued to dominate in terms of possession, with Marmoush spurning several chances before delivering a sumptuous equaliser in the 64th minute. He collected the ball with immaculate control on the left flank before racing away from Godknows Murwira and beating Arubi with a powerful finish from a tight angle.As Egypt pushed for a winner, their substitute Ahmed “Zizo” Sayed spurned two further chances, the latter created by Salah, who inevitably had the final word.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Egypt football teamZimbabwe football teamAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It means that after five years of legal arguments a large number of the claimants in both codes face the risk of having their cases struck out before they come to trial.The appeal judge, Lord Justice Dias, ruled that the judge presiding over the management of the case, Senior Master Jeremy Cook, had been right to find that the claimants’ firm, Rylands Garth, had failed to fulfil its obligations to disclose necessary medical material to the defendants, World Rugby, the Wales Rugby Union, and the Rugby Football Union in one case, and the Rugby Football League in the other.Five years on: rugby’s brain damaged players wait and wait for the help they needRead moreThe issues are procedural, and the appeal ruling does not reflect the strength of the actual cases that will eventually proceed to trial, butthe case in rugby league in particular has been hugely undermined by this judgment. Altogether 180 of the 321 claimants in rugby league now face having their claims struck off. The number involved in rugby union is smaller, and so is the risk of strike outs, but about 20% of the total of 773 union players could be affected.Rylands Garth had been ordered to comply with their disclosure obligations by late October 2025, using what is known as an unless order. That date passed without their having done it, and Rylands Garth launched an appeal. They argued that Senior Master Cook had “erred in law and misdirected himself” and that the unless orders had been “disproportionate and oppressive, irrational and perverse”. Dias rejected the appeals on all grounds.Dias criticised the Rylands Garth solicitor Richard Boardman, ruling that given “the repeated extensions, the strong indications by the judge from early in proceedings of the need for active progression of the litigation, the gross misunderstandings of Mr Boardman about his disclosure duties and the associated puzzling nature of these fundamental misconceptions with his unconvincing explanations, it was entirely reasonable in my judgment for the judge to lack confidence in the adequacy or legal accuracy of the approach to disclosure.”Rylands Garth had provided medical material which was in their possession and that they had relied upon, but had failed to provide a quantity of other medical information that had been requested by the defendants, including GP records and medical histories. Rylands Garth argued that the size of the task made this an impossible job.Dias pointed out that “if solicitors take on substantial litigation such as this, they are duty-bound professionally, both to their lay clients and to the court in their capacity of officers of it, to ensure they have made appropriate and effective logistical and administrative arrangements to comply with the lawful orders of the court”.A spokesperson for Rylands Garth said: “We are grateful to the judge for providing greater clarity regarding the required level of disclosure of claimants’ medical records. We will continue to comply with the court’s orders as we work to fast-track the case and deliver justice for the former players we represent. To date, we have already disclosed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in support of the case against World Rugby, the RFU and WRU, as well as the rugby league defendants. Many of these documents were disclosed several years ago. The defendants have never formally responded to the claims and continue to attempt to hold up the case’s progress through the court.“The former players we represent and their families continue to suffer every day with the devastating impact of the negligence of sports authorities,” the spokesperson continued. “We reaffirm our commitment to accountability, meaningful change, and safeguarding the next generation of players.”The next case hearings are scheduled for March, but it is likely the defendants will now move to have all the affected cases struck off, which may cause more delays to the proceedings.In a joint statement following the ruling, World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU said: “We note that the claimants’ appeal has been dismissed. The judgment expressed concern that there has been a serious erosion of the court’s confidence in the way the disclosure process has been conducted, and noted that effective and fair disclosure of the relevant documents was ‘indispensable’ in the context of the case.“As such many players in the case are at risk of having their claims struck out. Player welfare remains a central priority for rugby and we shall not stand still in this space.”Explore more on these topicsSportConcussion in sportRugby leagueRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A horse like Pendil or The Dikler in the 1970s, Desert Orchid or Carvill’s Hill a decade or so later, or Denman lugging top weight to victory in the Hennessy – when it stillwasthe Hennessy, back in 2009.Or, in the here and now, a horse like Mr Vango, the second-favourite for Saturday’s Welsh Grand National at Chepstow. Even in a year when Harry Redknapp has a live runner in the King George VI Chase at Kempton a day earlier, a win for Mr Vango this weekend would quite possibly be the most popular and heartwarming result of the entire festive racing programme.Proud Welshman Sam Thomas eyes National glory after Steel Ally’s Ascot rompRead moreEverything about Sara Bradstock’s nine-year-old is defiantly, and enchantingly, old-school, from his massive frame and engine to the amount of time he has been given to develop and mature.He is the latest in a long line of proper, old-fashioned steeplechasers to emerge from the historic Old Manor Stables, near Wantage in Oxfordshire, which stretches all the way back to the legendary Golden Miller, the only horse to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup five times in a row in the 1930s, and also includes three Grand National winners trained at the yard by the late Tim Forster in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, it was home to the magnificent half-brothers, Carruthers andthe 2015 Gold Cup winner, Coneygree, who were both trained by Bradstock alongside her late husband, Mark, and bred by her father, the journalist, broadcaster and one-time amateur jockey, Lord Oaksey.In a modern age of jumping when young chasing prospects change hands for six-figure sums, Mr Vango was a “store” horse that – by design – did not line up for a race of any kind until he was a six-year-old.Plenty of his rivals on Saturday were snapped up for big money as four- or five-year-olds after showing form over fences in an Irish point-to-point or in the French provinces, to race for owners who look for an immediate return on their investment. Mr Vango was sold as a foal for €7,000 (£6,000) in November 2016, but then disappeared from view for more than five years before winning a Cambridgeshire point-to-point in February 2022. That was a few days before he was sold to join the Bradstock stable for £30,000, a relative pittance in modern jumping.Mr Vango was a winner for the yard over hurdles but had such size and strength that he was always going to be a much better chaser. His second race over fences was a 60-length success on bottomless ground in the Devon National at Exeter in February 2024, a few weeks before Mark Bradstock died.Sara Bradstock is now in her second full season as the sole licence-holder at Old Manor, and her children, Lily and Alfie, are also important members of a team that is dedicated to “keeping the legendary Bradstock magic alive”.In her first season, she saddled six winners from 17 runners, a remarkable strike-rate of 35%, that included a perfect three-from-three campaign by Mr Vango with wins in the London National at Sandown, the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock and the Midlands Grand National at Uttoxeter.The Grand National itself is now an obvious end-of-season target for Mr Vango, as his stirring, front-running success under top weight at Uttoxeter was enough to push his rating well past the cut-off point for recent Nationals. He was raised a further 3lb, to 155, after a battling second place over the National fences on his return to action at Aintree earlier this month, but can race off his old mark of 152 on Saturday.Elegant Escape, who won off 157 in 2018, and Native River –a subsequent Gold Cup winner, no less – whowon off 151 in 2016, have both defied similar marks in recent years, but a whole host of strong opponents with far less weight on their backs will be doing their utmost to stop Mr Vango doing the same.View image in fullscreenMr Vango, ridden by Nico de Boinville, powers away to win last December’s London National Handicap Chase at Sandown.Photograph: AlamyThe King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day looks like one of the strongest renewals for years, rich with established top-class chasers and fast-improving novices alike. The Savills Chase at Leopardstown on Sunday is expected to pitMarch’s Gold Cup winner, Inothewayurthinkin, against Galopin Des Champs, the Cheltenham hero in the previous two seasons.But for the steeplechasing purists, there may be nothing this Christmas to rival the sight of the magnificent, front-running Mr Vango, setting off with three-and-three-quarter miles of Welsh turf ahead of him to try to jump and gallop his rivals into submission.Explore more on these topicsSportTalking HorsesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is torture and completely avoidable. Humane alternatives, like electrical stunning, are readily available.”Other changes ina long-awaited Labour strategyannounced on Monday include outlawing hen cages and pig farrowing crates, ending puppy farming, consulting on banning electric shock collars for dogs and introducing humane slaughter requirements for farmed fish.The proposals also tighten the rules on hunting, witha ban on shooting haresduring the breeding season and an end to trail hunting, where an animal-based scent trail is laid for dogs to chase while riders follow on horseback.Labour pledged in its manifesto to extend the 2005 foxhunting ban to trail hunting. Animal welfare charities say trail hunting is beingdeployed as a “smokescreen”to carry on killing foxes.Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, said the move was “authoritarian control freakery”. He added: “You might as well ban walking dogs in the countryside as they chase rabbits, hares, deer and foxes.”Polling suggests that voters overwhelmingly support tougher rules on hunting, although Reform voters are more divided. According to findings from YouGov last year, 29% of the party’s voters thought that hunting wild animals was acceptable, compared with 65% who thought it was not. Just 21% believed hunting with dogs should be allowed.A Labour source said: “When it comes to being in touch with the priorities of working people, the horse has very much bolted for Nigel Farage. Time and again, he’s putting himself on the wrong side of issues which will keep the former Tories he’s stuffing his party with happy, but will do nothing to deliver a fairer future for Britain.“While Farage focuses on defending hunts that are often used as a smokescreen for killing wild animals, Labour is dealing with outdated laws which permit poor animal welfare practices. And at the same time we’re cutting the cost of living, reducing waiting lists and delivering the change working people voted for.”The Green party largely welcomed the government’s plans but said ministers could go further by ending greyhound racing, which faces a ban in Wales by 2030.Explore more on these topicsAnimal welfareAnimalsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.The Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.Spotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.The group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,”said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.The Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to aUS court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.Meta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.The co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.He added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”Spotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.Copyright has become a battleground between artists, authors and creatives on one side and AI companies on the other. AI tools such as chatbots and music generators are trained on vast amounts of data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected work.In the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a governmentconsultationon the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.Explore more on these topicsSpotifyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingDigital music and audioInternetPiracynewsShareReuse this content"

Materials within organs are sensitive to climatic changes, which can knock the majestic instruments out of tune.Earlier this month, Xing, Knight and their colleague Bruno Bingleypublished a paperin the journal Buildings & Cities, with preliminary data gleaned from 18 organ-tuning books associated with churches in London, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The records date back to 1966 and indicate a rise in average temperatures inside churches since then, during winter and summer periods.It reflects that churches are being heated, artificially, to a greater extent today than in the past but also that these old buildings are getting warmer even in summer months when heating systems are more likely to be turned off – a “hint” of global heating, said Knight.The average summer temperature for urban churches in the sample was 17.2C during the late 1960s. By the 2020s it had reached 19.8C.“It quantifies what we’ve seen,” said Andrew Scott, the managing director of Harrison & Harrison, a Durham-based company that builds and services pipe organs. “A rise of internal ambient temperature through the unheated summer months due to rising temperatures outside.”Organ-tuning records could be useful for climate studies, said Neil Macdonald, a professor of geography at the University of Liverpool. “As somebody that’s worked on a lot of historical records of climate and weather, I’ve never come across this,” he said. “I was fascinated.”It is possible that summer temperatures in churches could be influenced by factors besides climate breakdown, he noted – perhaps some churches were ventilated more frequently in years gone by, for example.Organ tuners care about temperature because it affects the expansion and contraction of materials such as wood and metal, commonly used in organs, Scott said.Humidity plays a role, too. One remark left by a tuner and noted by the researchers relates to a church organ in Nottingham. Part of the instrument appeared damaged and more difficult to tune than last time. “Weather? Misty,” the tuner wrote.While many churches are large, difficult-to-heat stone buildings –making them refuges for some during heatwaves– hot summer weather can still trouble an organ. A change of just one degree celsius may alter the pitch of one of these instruments by 0.8 hertz, said Scott.That means if an organ is tuned at 16C, for example, and then the temperature later rises to 20C, the notes the instrument produces can be perceptibly different.Scott’s company has tuned organs all over the world, including in Nigeria, Malaysia and India. In hot countries, keeping an organ in tune is already challenging – climate breakdown threatens to make it harder still. And besides weather, powerful heating systems in churches can affect pipe organs even more profoundly, he added.Xing said he and his colleagues hoped to analyse more organ-tuning book data and he urged anyone who owned such records tocontact him. “If we can find older ones, it would be fascinating,” he said. “I hope people realise the value of tuning books.”This article was first published byThe ReengineerExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisHeritageEnglandShareReuse this content"

These cramped crates are used to stop pigs from rolling over and crushing their young, but once in them sows cannot turn over or move around at all.While conventional battery cages were banned in 2012, this has caused the rise of “colony cages”. The battery cages kept each bird in a small wire cage, with thousands of these cages stacked side by side in a shed. Larger cages that can hold a colony of hens, known as colony cages, have been allowed.Warnings of imports of caged hen eggs as Ukraine and Poland become UK’s biggest suppliersRead moreAbout 21% of hens in the UK today are kept in enriched or colony cages. These hold up to 90 hens, and have perching spots, scratch mats and nest boxes, but generally only provide a tiny space – about the size of an A4 sheet of paper – for each bird.The birds do not leave the cages for their entire lives – until they are sent for slaughter. This does not meet their welfare needs: chickens like to bathe in dust to keep their feathers clean, scratch and peck on the ground, perch on branches and jump and fly around.The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, is to announce on Monday that her department will consult on phasing out the remaining enriched colony cages and transitioning to non-cage systems next year.Anthony Field, the head of the campaign group Compassion in WorldFarmingUK, described the move as “a landmark step forward in protecting farmed animals across Britain”. He added: “By committing to phase out cages for laying hens and farrowing crates for pigs, over 7 million hens and 150,000 pigs will benefit annually.”Also included in the changes is an end topuppy farming, the mass commercial breeding of dogs that are often kept in cramped, dirty conditions without access to proper veterinary care. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will also consult on a ban onelectric shock collarsfor dogs.The Guardian revealed on Saturday that the strategy also included a ban on shooting hares for most of the year, during their breeding season, as well as an end to trail hunting. The government will also consult on a ban on snare traps because they cause suffering to animals and can catch pets.Also in the new laws are humane slaughter requirements for farmed fish to spare them avoidable pain.Reynolds said: “We’re a nation of animal lovers. This government is delivering the most ambitious animal welfare strategy in a generation. Our strategy will raise welfare standards for animals in the home, on the farm and in the wild. We’ve already acted to improve zoo standards, end puppy smuggling and protect livestock from dog attacks. Now, we’re planning to ban caged hens, cruel snares, trail hunting, and curb low welfare dog breeding.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal welfareAnimalsEnglandFarmingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

A sudden increase in the population – a bloom – is caused by a combination of a mild winter followed by a warm breeding season in the spring. The ideal conditions meant that more of the larvae of the common octopus were likely to survive, said Slater, possibly in part fuelled by thelarge numbers of spider crabsthat have also been recorded along the south coast in recent years.‘The seabed is full of them’: English fishers enjoy surprise octopus boomRead moreThe last time an octopus bloom of the size observed in 2025 was recorded was 1950, withrecords from the UK’s Marine Biological Associationshowing the last bloom recorded prior to that was in 1900.The huge numbers of octopuses along the south coast meant they could be easily spotted in shallow waters for the first time in recent history. Video footage from divers shows octopuses gathering in groups – they are usually solitary – as well as “walking” along the seabed on the tips of their limbs. One was even filmed grabbing at an underwater camera.“The first time I dived off the Lizard peninsula this year I saw five octopuses,” said Slater. “And these are big. There are two types of octopus in UK waters. There is the curled octopus, which is quite small, only getting to about the size of a football, but these common octopuses can be up to a metre and a half wide.”Another mild winter going into 2026 meant it was possible there could be a second bloom next year, said Slater, because historically, under these conditions, the blooms have repeated themselves for two consecutive years.Octopus grabbing a camera by Matthew BradshawOctopus grabbing a camera by Matthew Bradshaw“However, it is unlikely, based on past events, that it will go on for a long time,” he said. “But the sea keeps giving us surprises at the moment so it’s quite an unpredictable situation.”The Wildlife Trusts noted some of the other “surprises, successes and joyful moments” around the UK coastline included a record number of grey seals observed by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust, as well as record numbers of puffins on Skomer, an island off the coast of Wales famed for the birds.Other wildlife was recorded in unusual places. A volunteer with Shoresearch, the Wildlife Trusts’national citizen science survey programme, recorded the firstCapellinia fustiferasea slug in Yorkshire, a 12mm mollusc that resembles a gnarly root vegetable and is usually found in the south-west.

River and urban flooding are likely – particularly where there is run-off from high ground – with additional risks of mudslides and rockslides in mountain and foothill areas.Winter storm warnings are also in effect for Yosemite national park, with the potential for 1.8-2.4 metres (6-8ft) of accumulating snow by Boxing Day. Heavy snow alongside strong winds will make travel very difficult over the festive period.View image in fullscreenGolden Gate Bridge is covered with dense fog near Fort Point as rainy weather and an atmospheric river hit the San Francisco Bay Area on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHeavy rain, lightning and strong winds are forecast across large parts ofZimbabweleading up to Christmas. A level 2 weather warning has been issued by the Meteorological Services Department from Sunday 21 December to Wednesday 24 December. Some areas are expected to see more than 50mm of rainfall within a 24-hour period. The rain will be accompanied by hail, frequent lightning, and strong winds. These conditions have been attributed to the interaction between warm, moist air with low-pressure systems over the western and northern parts of the country.Australia will see some large variations in temperatures over the festive period. Sydney, which is experiencing temperatures above 40C, is expected to tumble down to about 22C by Christmas Day, about 5C below average for this time of year. Perth is going to see temperatures gradually creep up, reaching a peak of 40C around Christmas Day. This is about 10C above average for this time of year.Explore more on these topicsFloodingWeather trackerExtreme weatherCaliforniaZimbabwe (Weather)West CoastZimbabwe (World news)analysisShareReuse this content"

AstraZeneca, Shell and Unilever were least likely to post about Pride at all from 2023 to 2025.“A tally of social media posts does not reflect the breadth of our approach,” HSBC said in a statement.View image in fullscreenHSBC says it is ‘committed to inclusion for all our colleagues and customers’.Photograph: Chris Helgren/ReutersOur analysis of the top 10 US companies – as of 1 December – revealed a similar trend. A total of 39 “Pride” posts could be found on the main customer-facing Facebook, Instagram and X accounts belonging to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Eli Lilly, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla in 2023. In 2024, the total fell 46% to 21 posts. In 2025, the number came in at 18, representing a 54% decline.The most likely US brand to post about Pride was Apple. It was the only company to buck the declining trend, with its post count rising by 22% between 2023 and 2025.The least likely companies to post about Pride included Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom and Tesla.Simon Blake, chief executive of LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, said “in a world in which LGBT people are feeling less safe and less welcome in lots of places” it was in the best interest of companies to send “clear signals” of support. However, he added how businesses were “showing up on a day-to-day basis” was a better indicator of commitment to inclusion than social media trends.“I absolutely want to ensure that it’s about walking the walk every single day of the year, rather than making a logo rainbow coloured during Pride month,” Blake said. “However, I do also think it’s important that we make sure we reflect flags and other things because it does send the signal.”He added that such messaging tells LGBTQ+ people “you’re welcome here, we want you to thrive, we want you to have all of the opportunities everybody else has”.Blake said he was optimistic about companies’ commitment to inclusion, with corporations continuing to sponsor Pride events and “a refocused energy” within company Pride networks. “I am in meetings every single week where you have very senior people being very clear that they are continuing to invest and to support LGBT inclusion in the workplace,” he said.But speaking of the political climate, he said: “Is the environment more hostile for people? Yes. Is there a global rollback of LGBT rights which we’re seeing in all sorts of places? Yes. Is the UK immune to it? Absolutely not.”View image in fullscreenPosts about Pride among the UK’s 10 biggest companies fell 92% from 2023 to 2025.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesPaul Sesay, the founder of the Inclusive Top 50 UK Employers, National Diversity Awards andElevate 1000, set up to link young people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with employers, said his research indicated that if companies reduced diversity budgets, it had an outsize effect on corporate LGBTQ+ networks because their data showed they had been the most numerous and best funded.“We hold roundtables and speak to our members all the time, and some DEI budgets have been significantly reduced in recent months,” he said.“However lots of people in companies tell me they feel DEI needed a reset to a certain degree, to simplify it and go back to basics – that it got too politicised, rather than concentrating on what it actually means: equality for everybody within an organisation.”Podcaster and workplace culture expert Bruce Daisley, a former vice-president of Twitter EMEA and YouTube UK, said: “Some organisations have maintained initiatives, but they’re just trying to do them in a lower-key way. All of it is in a context whereTrump has created fear about organisations endorsing these things.“For the groups who are nominally meant to be the beneficiaries of these things it could demonstrate the old adage – ‘a principle is only a principle if it costs you money’. A lot of people within the LGBTQ+ community, like the trans community, are finding it a difficult time.”Daisley said that the visibility of “toxic replies” and “extreme rightwing” views on X, formerly Twitter, since Elon Musk bought the platform could also deter companies from being vocal on social media.The Guardian approached all of the companies featured in the analysis for comment. Arm Holdings said “inclusion has always been at the heart of our culture and values” and that its social media presence reflected a “broad set of conversations”. Rio Tinto said diversity was “very important” to its business, and it supported staff in participating in Pride events in Brisbane, Perth, Montreal and London.A GSK spokesperson: said:“We are committed to building an inclusive culture that values different perspectives and experiences. This includes our continuing support for Pride in the UK and in many countries where we operate through social media, partnership initiatives and at Pride events.”A HSBC UK spokesperson said: “We are committed to inclusion for all our colleagues and customers and celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ community in many ways, including through an active Pride network, ambassador and mentoring programmes and as a signatory of Conduct for Business.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Quite poignant that people aren’t stopping. They walk past homeless people and they don’t see them lying on the street,” Lloyd-Morgan said.“It’s kind of like they’re stargazing. It’s quite fitting that the kids are pointing up like they’re looking at the north star.”View image in fullscreenThe Bayswater mural has also appeared outside Centre Point in central London.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesCentre Point tower has long been a symbol of homelessness crisis. It was left empty for more than a decade after being completed in 1966.The name of thehomelessness charity Centrepoint was inspired by the tower, with its founder, Rev Ken Leech, calling the building “an affront to the homeless”.The block is now multimillion-pound flats.Jason Tomkins, a Banksy expert, also thinks the mural is a “clear statement on homelessness” and told the BBC he believed it depicts the same little boy catching snowflakes with his tongue seen ina Banksy artwork that appeared in Port Talbot in 2018.“This is quite unusual for him to use the same little boy again, because he has never done that,” Tomkins said.Explore more on these topicsBanksyStreet artArtLondonPaintingHomelessnessnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early.”He continued: “The doctors do not believe it has spread and I’m taking tests to confirm their diagnosis. So, that’s it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns.“I’m counting the days until I return to my home away from home at the Westgate Las Vegas for our Valentine’s weekend concerts.”Manilow is currently in the 16th year of a residency at the Westgate Las Vegas. The singer has spent decades in the spotlight and came out as gay in 2017, after marrying his manager and long-term partner Garry Kief in secret in 2014.View image in fullscreenBarry Manilow and his husband, Garry Kief, in 2016.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImageThe pair were in a clandestine relationship for more than 35 years, and in 2023 Manilow told CNN Max how important Kieff had been to him during his rise to peak fame in the 1970s.“As my career exploded, it was just crazy. And, you know, going back to an empty hotel room, you can get into a lot of trouble if you, you know, you’re alone night after night after night,” he said.“But I met Garry right around when it was exploding. And I didn’t have to go back to those empty hotel rooms. I had somebody to cry with or to celebrate with.“I wish that young people [today] don’t have to go back to those hotel rooms by themselves, because you get yourself in trouble. I never did.

The highest proportion of people involved (33%) were aged 22-29.Harding said the law has failed to keep up with the rapid expansion of digital technologies, which has resulted in online scams now representing 40% of all recorded crime.Young people are especially vulnerable because they have grown up exposed to “get rich quick” schemes on social media, so when they are targeted by criminals “it doesn’t look so obviously a scam or illegal behaviour”.Harding added: “If you said to that same person: ‘That woman has a bag of cash, knock her over’, they never would.”This was Derai’s experience. When he was 19, he wanted to earn “quick money” to move from Manchester to London to launch his modelling career. He spotted an Instagram post that said, “Do you want to make quick money today?” on an account with pictures of “cars, hands holding £50 notes, holidays”.He replied and the following day was connected with a money mule recruiter to whom he passed his bank details and ID. The money arrived in his account within a few days – but when he tried to withdraw it, his card was swallowed by the machine and his bank account was closed. ACifasmarker was placed on his account for six years, making it impossible for him to open a new account. For work, he used his mum’s bank account, which he feared created a poor impression.“It was a bit miserable,” he said. “I was a bit depressed, frustrated that I’d done it.”Fortunately, Derai was able to persuade the financial ombudsman to remove the marker after 10 months. He is still bombarded with money mule recruitment adverts on social media, but said: “I’ve learned, I’ve grown, I wouldn’t do it now.”When I met Craig he was 13 and homeless. I still thought his life might turn around. I was tragically wrongRead moreThe Children’s Society’s national programme manager James Simmonds-Read said it is “really hard to get an accurate picture of the scale of this problem”, since data is likely to be “the tip of the iceberg”.Children he has spoken to say they regularly come across fake job adverts on social media and online gaming platforms, as well as experiencing grooming-style relationships in which recruiters pose as friends with shared interests, then ask them to “help them out”, saying it’s “risk free”.Simmonds-Read said he was working with the Home Office – which recently pledged to take action on child exploitation and money muling – to change the language, since the term “money mule” is “comparing victims to animals”.He also urged a more joined-up response, arguing that the police, social services and banks often do not fully understand the issue. He saidpreventative educationis needed to start from primary school age.Jeremy Asher, a financial fraud lawyer who founded the Financial Fraud Awareness Campaign, advised parents to watch out for children getting drawn into money muling, especially during school holidays, after seeing “an alarming number” of such cases.He said that although the fraud prevention service Cifas estimates that at least 19% of known money mules are under 21, the true figure is likely higher because no data is recorded for those under 16.Signs might include sudden influxes of money, clothes or gifts without explanation, an obsession with making money online or via social media, a secretive attitude toward phones, apps or new online contacts, and unusual bank activity or pressure to open an account, he said.Explore more on these topicsScamsCrimeYoung peopleSocial mediaFinancial Conduct AuthorityDigital mediaShareReuse this content"

Now we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law … You cannot annex other countries,” Mette Frederiksen and Jens-Frederik Nielsensaid in a joint statement.The two leaders added that “fundamental principles” were at stake. “Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders, and the US should not take overGreenland,” they said. “We expect respect for our common territorial integrity.”Trump on Sunday appointed the governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, as US special envoy to the vast, mineral-rich Arctic island. The US president has on several occasions said the US needs to acquire Greenland for security reasons, while refusing to rule out the use of force.The US president wrote on social media: “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.”Later on Monday, Trump reiterated that the US needed Greenland for “national security, not for minerals”, adding that there were Russian and Chinese ships “all over the place” and Landry would “lead the charge.”Landry, a former state attorney general who took office as Louisiana governor in January 2024, thanked Trump, saying it was “an honour to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US”.Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, told Danish television on Monday he would summon Washington’sambassador to Copenhagen, Ken Howery, to the ministry in the coming days “to get an explanation”.Rasmussen said he was “deeply upset by this appointment of a special envoy”, and “particularly upset” by Landry’s statement, which he saidDenmarkhad found “completely unacceptable”.He added: “As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty.”Arctic security remained a key priority for the EU, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, António Costa, said on Monday. “Territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. These principles are essential not only for the European Union, but for nations around the world,” they posted on X.Von der Leyen and Costa added that the EU stood “in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland”.Sweden “will always stand guard over international law”, the Swedish foreign minister, Maria Malmer Stenergard, said. Her Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth Eide, said Oslo “stands 100% behind Denmark”.He said it was clear that the appointment underscored Trump’s intention to make Greenland part of the US. “The purpose of this job, which Jeff Landry is to perform, is to make Greenland American,” Barth Eide said.View image in fullscreenJeff Landry speaks as Donald Trump listens in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in March.Photograph: Samuel Corum/EPAThe vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark but have no wish to become part of the US,according to a poll in January. The territory has had the right to declare independence since 2009.Frederiksen said in a social media post that Denmark’s “ally of a lifetime” was putting it in “a difficult situation”. But she said the Nordic country would “not deviate from our democratic values”.Nielsen said in a separate post that the appointment “may sound big”, but “does not change anything for us at home. We have our own democracy, our own decisions and a strong community that stands firm. Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.”Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of the Danish parliament, said the appointment of a US envoy was not in itself a problem. “The problem is that he’s been given the task of taking over Greenland or making Greenland part of the US,” she said.“There’s no desire for that in Greenland. There is a desire to respect the future that a majority in Greenland wants, namely to remain their own country and develop their independence over time.”Strategically situated between North America and Europe at a time of increasing US, Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic, Greenland is also on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the US.Denmark summoned the US chargé d’affaires in August for an urgent meeting over an alleged influence campaign after at least three US men with ties to Trump and the White House were accused of trying to infiltrate Greenlandic society.Several high-profile American politicians and business people have travelled to Greenland since Trump’s election. Donald Trump Jrvisited the capital, Nuuk, in January and the vice-president,JD Vance, toured a US military basein March.Earlier this month, the Danish defence intelligence service said in its annual report that the US was using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But, skimming just below the surface, it was moving differently than a fish would.The creature surfaced and, amazed, the Victorian fisher reached for his phone. Swimming in front of him was a pink platypus.Stylianou regularly fishes in the Gippsland spot, which he is keeping secret to protect the rare animal. He thinks it could be the same one he saw years ago, just older and bigger.“The bill and feet are super obviously pink,” he says. “When he did go a bit further into sunlit areas, he was easy to follow underwater, which is how I got so many videos of him surfacing.”Stylianou had been on his first trout fishing trip of the season in September when he saw the platypus, which he has nicknamed “Pinky”. He watched it feed at the top of the tannin-stained river for about 15 minutes.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“I’ve seen other platypus in the same river system, just regular coloured ones,” he says. “Probably about five to eight of them over the years, from memory. Normally, they just pop up at the top of the water and then disappear once they see me.”After Stylinaou shared footage of the monotreme, commenters online speculated that it could have been a rare albino platypus. But the biologist Jeff Williams says it is just lighter in colour than what most would expect.Many people go their whole lives without seeing a platypus in the wild. We just saw four in one nightRead more“Platypus do vary a lot in colour,” the director of the Australian Platypus Conservancy says. “And this one’s at the extreme end of the light ones. It’s not one that we consider should be added to the list of albino and leucistic ones.”Just as humans have different coloured hair or skin pigment, platypus also come in different variations, Williams says. He said the platypus captured on video was “unusual but not exceptional”.“What I’ve seen and what every other leading platypus person has looked at, it says, is that it’s well within the sort of variation in colour that one would expect,” he says.“Let’s put it this way, it’s cute, but it’s not a breakthrough … We think this is just one of the extreme ends. Every so often, you will get a genetic anomaly that just throws up things, just as it does with some humans, who have more freckles and so on.“It’s somewhat unusual, but it’s nothing to get particularly excited about, we’re afraid.”1:03Sniffer dogs are being trained to track down threatened platypus populations – videoThe platypus is listed as near-threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There has also been adecline in Victorian populations, making them more vulnerable, Williams says.“Platypus were in significant decline up until about the 1990s when all the impact of European settlement on our waterways was becoming apparent,” he says.“We messed up pretty much the flow of every river we’ve got. We cleared native vegetation along most of our waterways, and, not surprisingly, that put a lot of pressure on the platypus population.”Replanting programs along the waterways, and consideration of environmental impacts near rivers, have started to help the population come back.“We’ve still got a way to go, and we can’t be complacent,” Williams says.“But the good news at the moment is most of the survey work that’s being done around the place is suggesting numbers that are coming back, certainly the number of sightings in some places where there was concern.”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaWildlifeFishingBiologyGeneticsAnimalsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Netflix slipped 0.8%.Paramount said it was attempting to tackle WBD’s “amorphous need” for financial flexibility, and bluntly denied the Netflix offer was superior.Unlike Netflix, which has agreed to buy only the movie studios, HBO and HBO Max from WBD, Paramount has bid for the entire company – which also includes CNN, Cartoon Network and the Discovery channel. But WBD’s board directors concluded its bid was “inadequate”, with “significant” risks and costs.David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, and son of Larry, said: “Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD. Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders.“Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice. We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”The Ellisons have faced questions over how they are funding the bid, after a regulatory filing revealed it was backed by outside funders including Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund; and the Qatar Investment Authority. Last week Kushner’s Affinity Partnersstepped back from the process.The financier Gerry Cardinale, whose RedBird Capital firm is an investor in Paramount and involved in its bid for WBD,told CNBCon Monday: “What we’ve done in this amended filing is we’ve cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer.”Cardinale tried to appeal directly to WBD’s investors, rather than its board of directors, which rejected Paramount’s offer last week – having already chosen Netflix after a private bidding process.“At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn’t own it. [WBD CEO] David Zaslav doesn’t own this company,” said Cardinale. “This should be a lot more simple than it is. It’s very simple.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessWarner BrosnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the average petrol pump price has fallen just two-thirds of a penny.”“This is classic ‘rocket and feather’ pricing at the pumps and the bane of UK drivers,” an AA spokesperson said, a reference to retailers putting up prices quickly when fuel markets rise but bring them down much more slowly when wholesale costs fall.The CMA said in September thatit was “deeply concerned”about overcharging by fuel retailers but that it had yet to perform a detailed assessment of how companies were being affected by changing operating costs.Monday’s CMA report found that fuel prices were falling, from an average of 135p per litre (ppl) for petrol and 142ppl for diesel, both down 8ppl from the previous year, due largely to lower crude oil prices, exchange rates and refining costs.But while prices have come down between November 2024 and October this year, the watchdog found that they had not declined by as much as they could have, as non-supermarket retailers have clung on to historically high fuel profit margins.The CMA will launch a“fuel finder” schemenext year, allowing drivers to compare pump prices in real time, including through navigation apps and price comparison websites.Turnbull said: “We know fuel costs are a big issue for drivers, especially at this time of year with millions making journeys across the country. This is why the fuel finder scheme is crucial – it will put power back in the hands of motorists and save households money.”The Guardian approached the Retail Motor Industry Federation for comment.Explore more on these topicsPetrol pricesMotoringCompetition and Markets AuthorityConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, as it did with pork, Beijing has reduced or limited the impact of its tariffs several times, including partly sparing the major cognac producers Pernod Ricard, LVMH and Rémy Cointreau after its brandy investigation.China’s ministry of commerce said negotiations over the bloc’s EV tariffs resumed this month. However, the talks were scheduled to end last week and there has been no announcement since.A senior European diplomat in Beijing said last week that major issues remained between the two sides.China imported $589m (£438m) of dairy products covered by the current investigation last year, similar to 2023 values.China’s ministry of commerce said in a statement it had found evidence that EU dairy imports were subsidised and hurting Chinese producers. About 60 companies, including Arla Foods, the owner of brands such as Lurpak and Castello, will pay tariffs between 28.6% and 29.7%.Italy’s Sterilgarda Alimenti SpA will pay the lowest rate of 21.9%, while FrieslandCampina Belgium NV and FrieslandCampina Nederland BV will pay the highest rate of 42.7%.Companies that did not participate in the investigation will pay the highest rate.The decision is likely to be welcomed by Chinese producers who are grappling with a glut of milk and falling prices as declining birthrates and more cost-conscious consumers weigh on demand.China, the world’s third-largest milk producer, urged producers last year to rein in output and reduce the number of older and less productive cows.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryChinaEuropean UnionInternational tradeAsia PacificEuropeTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ismail’s salary is also believed to have been increased by 30%, rising by about £70,000 to £300,000.Founded in 1878 by the City of London and a group of 16 livery companies, the original institute developed a national system of technical education, offeringqualifications and apprenticeshipsin fields ranging from manufacturing and mechanical engineering to hairdressing and horticulture. It was awarded a royal charter by Queen Victoria in 1900 and the body says that it helps about 1.1m people a year.View image in fullscreenThe TV chef Jamie Oliver has a City & Guilds qualification.Photograph: Ian West/PAIt has enjoyed a storied history with the body’s famous alumni including the chefsJamie Oliver, Marcus Wareing and Gordon Ramsey, the former England football manager Gareth Southgate, as well as the celebrity gardenerAlan Titchmarsh and the fashion designer Karen Millen.The institute’s business was owned under the umbrella of a charity, City & Guilds London Institute (CGLI), which announced in the autumn that it was selling its training and awards operation, City & Guilds (C&G),to PeopleCert.The sale gave the charity, whichprovides grants to people in need of vocational training, a cash windfall of between £180m and £200m, which was presented as ensuring the long-term future of the institution to pursue its charitable objectives, as well as providing increased opportunities and investment for the now-private training business.These ambitions appear to coincide with plans for a restructuring of the C&G training business. Earlier this month PeopleCert published a presentation aimed at its financial backers in which it said it had identified £22m of savings at C&G, of which £13m were “personnel cost synergies” that would largely be achieved by failing to replace staff leaving the institute with hires from the UK.The document implied that C&G, which has more than1,600 staff membersand 1,800 “associates” on short-term contracts, has a “churn” rate equivalent to about 300 people leaving a year and outlined how PeopleCert plans to relocate a third of those jobs toGreece“at a cost [of] up to 50% lower”. The same quantity of roles “are due to not be replaced due to overlapping functions”, the presentation added, while the remainder of leavers will be replaced with hires in the UK.The presentation appears to have been removed from the PeopleCert website after the Guardian published the cost-cutting plans.Under the terms of the sale, the privatised City & Guilds will continue to use the brand that it shares with its former charity owner.A spokesperson for City & Guilds said: “[The charity] CGLI will be publishing its accounts in January 2026 and details on pay and remuneration will be reported appropriately in those accounts as always. Bonuses for eligible employees reflecting performance in 2025 are payable in line with CGLI remuneration policy. No payments outside of CGLI’s existing bonus schemes have been made. The CGLI annual accounts will report on the long-term future that is now protected for the charity. At the same time, this transaction unlocks future investment for the commercial awarding and training businesses that continue to operate in a highly competitive marketplace.“The accounts for City & Guilds Ltd will be published at year end in 2026, as required for private limited companies. Any awards to employees are a matter for City & Guilds Ltd and are guided by standard commercial practice to ensure critical expertise and experience is retained.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessCharitiesApprenticeshipsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

First, she starred as an amoral model in John Schlesinger’s Darling, a snapshot of Swinging London that reflected the trendy, flashy, forward-thinking culture that had seduced young adults. Then she starred as an elusive Russian beauty in Doctor Zhivago, a three-hour-plus historical epic from David Lean that was as stodgy and old-fashioned as Darling was suggestive of the future. There was an appetite for both that year – credit Christie’s astonishing magnetism for that, at least in part – but a sense that one era was crashing into another and times were about to change.Julie Christie at 85: her 20 best films – ranked!Read moreIt seems fitting, then, that Doctor Zhivago is about what happens when history takes a turn and a band of insurgents make a once-stable and familiar place seem completely unrecognizable. It’s easy to imagine a master like Lean, who had just made Lawrence of Arabia a few years earlier, feeling a bit like his hero, Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), a celebrated poet whose work suddenly falls out of favor after the Russian Revolution. Though Doctor Zhivago was honored with a raft of Oscar nominations – and five wins, mostly in technical categories – many contemporary reviews had dismissed it as an ossified romance, disengaged with the harsh realities of early-to-mid-1900s Russia. Even 60 years later, it feels like a relic of an earlier era.And yet there’s still a kind of magic to the film, owed to Lean’s peerless sense of scale and how it elevates a love affair that survives the upheavals of war and fate, and a distance that stretches from Moscow to the Ural mountain range. While it’s true that Doctor Zhivago isn’t the most substantive treatment of Russian history, Lean cares more about individuals swept up in a current they have no power to bend, which is terrifying but also as deeply romantic as storytelling gets. That’s the trick of love stories set against tumultuous backdrops: there’s a plane-going-down urgency and passion to them that ordinary times cannot possibly replicate. Kisses detonate like bombs.The stakes were significantly lower for Lean’s Doctor Zhivago than for the original novel by Boris Pasternak, which had so rankled the Communist party that it had to be smuggled out of Soviet Union for publication in 1957. (Pasternak was also not allowed to accept the Nobel prize he’d win a year later. His son finally accepted it on his behalf in 1989.) Working again with the Lawrence of Arabia screenwriter Robert Bolt, Lean gives this historical moment the appropriate scope while retreating from its politics, displaying a lightness of touch that’s carried over from TE Lawrence’s adventures in the Arabian desert. In that, he’s not unlike Zhivago in an early sequence where his hero stands on his balcony and witnesses peaceful demonstrators slaughtered at the hands of tsarist dragoons. He sees everything but feels distinctly removed from the action.Flashing back from an affecting framing story where Zhivago’s half-brother (Alec Guinness) questions a young woman he believes to be Zhivago’s long-lost daughter, the film settles in 1913 Moscow, a city on the brink of the first world war and the Russian Revolution. The orphaned Zhivago lives comfortably as a doctor and celebrated poet, engaged to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), the daughter of the family friends who raised him. Meanwhile, the beautiful 17-year-old Lara (Christie) finds herself snared by the affections of Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a rich and connected brute who’s also involved with her mother. But Lara’s heart belongs to Pasha (Tom Courtenay), an idealistic young Bolshevik whose resolve hardens after encountering violent government resistance to his cause.The film deftly suggests the inevitability of Zhivago and Lara’s romance while keeping them apart for much of the first half, waiting until the first world war to unite them on the frontlines, where they tend to the wounded as doctor and nurse. While the two remain faithful to Tonya and Pasha, respectively, their feelings for each other are too overwhelming to suppress, especially as history itself seems to be playing matchmaker. Only behind the snow-frosted windows of an abandoned manse deep in the Urals can their love find a place to flourish, inspiring Zhivago’s most treasured book of poems.View image in fullscreenJulie Christie and Tom Courtenay on set.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyUnfolding over roughly 200 minutes, with space allotted for an overture and an entr’acte at intermission, Doctor Zhivago is a lumbering beast of a movie, with little of Lawrence of Arabia’s fleetness, much less the intimacy and wit of “smaller” Lean love stories like Brief Encounter. Yet the sheer scale of the production, along with his staging of conflicts like an attack on demonstrators or the chaotic early days of communist rule, feels persuasive as only a Lean epic can. Though Lean’s intrepid Zhivago sympathizes with the revolutionaries to a point, he’s like everyone else in this world, reacting and adapting to circumstances that are far beyond his control.As Pasha tells Zhivago late in the film, after the civil war is over, “The personal life is dead in Russia. History has killed it.” Pasha used to like Zhivago’s poetry, but the feelings and affection within them are not only rendered meaningless, but now stand out as anticommunist. Lean’s heroes tend not to be the hot-blooded type, and to that end, Zhivago seems resigned to the fact that he’s simply fallen out of favor by no fault of his own. He’s even unperturbed to discover that his home in Moscow has been splintered into residences for 13 different families, because it seems just and there’s nothing he can do about it anyway.Yet the famously bitter cold in Doctor Zhivago – the definitive curl-up-by-the-fire home video experience for a long winter afternoon – thaws whenever Zhivago and Lara steal some time together, away from the tumult in their country and within their families. Theirs is an us-against-the-world story that inevitably bends toward tragedy, but the film is a reminder that love perseveres through dark times, as does the art that spins out of it. By that token, Doctor Zhivago may seem like a relic, but it’s also enduring.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsJulie ChristieOmar SharifAlec GuinnessRomance filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Except, of course, it’s not. It’s about so much more than that. By the end, the sex scenes – many and varied though they may be – are just a bagatelle.Partly this is because there is no false hope offered here. None of the sexy set pieces are a full escape from reality. The series is based on a true story and the podcast made about Molly Kochan’s decision to cram years of sexual experience into the little time she was told she had left before metastasised breast cancer killed her. Whatever Molly does, whatever we see her do – enjoy or not enjoy – we know it will not change the ultimate outcome. This is the frame in which all the scenes of sex parties, age-gapped hookups, discovery of “pup play” and mastering the tricky latches on cock cages in Molly’s pursuit of her first partnered orgasm are set.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t want to die with him; I want to die with you’ … Jenny Slate and Michelle Williams in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXAnd partly it is because, thanks to a clever, tender – and blackly comic – script by Elizabeth Meriwether and Kim Rosenstock, and a deeply nuanced performance byMichelle Williamsas Molly, it increasingly becomes a meditation on what it means to live well and die well. It expands definitions as it goes on. First of sex itself. “You early millennials are so tragic,” says Sonya, a gen Z member of Molly’s care team. “You think sex is just penetration. Why? Because that’s what Samantha said?” You’ve gotta love a show that contains the casual slaughter of a sacred Sex and the City cow. Her perspective helps Molly move into a wider world of sex and gradually discover the answer to the question – asked by one of her early, young hookups, which stymies her at the time – what does she like? It is thanks to her neighbour – never named, but brilliantly played by Rob Delaney – that she learns what she really likes is kicking men in the dick.‘I’ve never masturbated on film before’: Michelle Williams’ orgasm odyssey in Dying for SexRead moreBut the definition that most interests everyone involved in the making of Dying for Sex is love. The marital kind – which has faded since Molly’s initial diagnosis of breast cancer, as her husband became unable to see beyond the patient. When they are in bed together, he says that her breasts remind him of death. The maternal kind – Sissy Spacek, on fantastic form, plays Molly’s mother. One of her boyfriends molested Molly when she was seven and it is this that makes her dissociate during sex, preventing the intimacy that breeds and is born of orgasm. “I think he knew he was taking joy from me,” she says. How much responsibility her mother bears and how much love is needed for forgiveness is a potent question. There is the love – or something – that grows between Molly and the neighbour. For that we may need a new word, but it is clear that it doesn’t need to be labelled to be worth having.Above all, there is the love between friends. Nikki (a magnificent Jenny Slate) is Molly’s best friend, her “beautiful flake” who takes over her care (as much an administrative as emotional burden – the US health system is a form-filled nightmare) and must fight her natural inclination towards chaos every step of the way, alongside the mounting fear and grief. “I don’t want to die with him,” says Molly of her husband. “I want to die with you.”Dying for Sex is about the courage of that decision, the laying aside of convention and the joy – that no abuser can remove – of truly knowing yourself and fulfilling not selfish desires but genuine needs. And if one of them is to kick in the dick a man who himself deeply desires to be kicked in the dick – well, that’s a delight all of its own.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVSexMichelle WilliamsDisney+featuresShareReuse this content"

Bitchin Bajas – Inland SeeChicago minimalist trio Bitchin Bajas are experts in crafting the ultimate slow burn, with a discography full of soundscapes that often stretch languorously around or beyond the 10-minute mark. Their latest record follows suit with four winding, blissed-out tracks over a 40-minute run time. But it’s not just overindulgent lounge music: the analogue loops quietly build to transcendental heights, nudged along by wandering sax solos, spritely keys and other cosmic flourishes. It’s a lush, often moving odyssey which, towards the end of the epic 18-minute closer, climaxes in an effervescent flurry.9. Trystero – Humming FuzzIn 2024, Trystero emerged seemingly out of nowhere with an album that sounded like it had been ripped straight from a lost 80s tape, marrying moody krautrock and downtempo dance music. The now-expanded group of Luxembourg musicians (who met through a residency on a barge in France) carry the same hypnotic formula to this year’s follow-up, but with an added stroke of lightness and a fun dancefloor kick. Here, there are also shades of acid house and big beat: playful percussion, euphoric synth stabs and baggy basslines energise the dense, swirling instrumentals.Tell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more8. Alpha Maid – Is This a QueueMuch like her collaborators in the Curl Recordings universe and their post-punk predecessors, south London musician Alpha Maid twists the guitar into janky, angular shapes on this battered but brilliant album. Across its nine tracks, simple hooky riffs and reverb-heavy meanderings coalesce with other DIY elements, including grimy, off-kilter loops and squawking sax flourishes from experimental composer Ben Vince. At points it’s pleasingly melodic (6-9, 2 Numbers), at others, things get out-of-hand, as in Why We Have to Move, which features the frenzied drums of percussionist Valentina Magaletti. Even at its most chaotic, Alpha Maid’s vocal delivery remains dry and effortlessly cool.Read the full review7. Saeko Killy – Dream in DreamView image in fullscreenDizzying effect … Saeko KillySaeko Killy has built a reputation in underground music circles for her swampy, downtempo productions, which sound suited to some otherworldly late-night dancefloor. On her second album, Killy offsets her signature dimly lit sound with a euphoric touch: dreamy Japanese and English vocals, arpeggiated synths and birdsong samples weave in and out of dubby basslines and swathes of echo. Alongside these chugging excursions, there are also references to 80s guitar music – tracks such as Next Time and Melancholic have a skippy post-punk vibe, complete with krautrock-y psychedelic spirals – and hints of functional dance music. But even the most club-adjacent tracks have a dizzying effect.6. Chris Imler – The Internet Will Break My HeartBerlin-based musician Chris Imler conjures all the dark, heady feelings of too much time spent on the internet on this record – and it’s just as moreish. Compounding elements of krautrock, post-punk and downtempo dance music, the tracks often sound as seedy and stuffy as their subject matter: he chants the miscellaneous contents of a late-night doomscroll over an eerie robotic loop on Liturgy of Litter, and jackknifes from war into sex in the chugging Let’s Not Talk About the War. Standout single Agoraphobie (featuring underground experimentalist Naomie Klaus) is also suitably, and brilliantly, claustrophobic.Read the full review5. Raisa K – AffectionatelyView image in fullscreenLow key … Raisa KAfter more than a decade in bands and various DIY projects (most notably Good Sad Happy Bad), south London musician Raisa K made her first big solo outing this year with her debut album Affectionately. Written between a busy work and parenting schedule, and produced entirely on her laptop, the record is as primitive and intimate as a diary entry. K’s lyrics are plain and her delivery is cool, almost deadpan, as she ruminates over the sweet sentiments and everyday dramas of relationships: on the title track, shemumbles “we never have anything to talk about” over and over, like an absent-minded mantra. Her woozy melodies, made from rickety drum loops and scuzzy electronics, are just as low key and charming.Read the full review4. Sacred Lodge – AmbamOne of the first things you’re struck by in Sacred Lodge’s second album is his growling, death-metal-pitched voice: sometimes it’s the centrepiece – dense and in your face – and at other times it’s just texture, stalking around his foreboding instrumentals through echo-laden yelps and cries. Inspired by the tradition of field hollers and ritual chants, the vocals are one of the Paris-based sound artist’s nods to his ethnological research, which focuses on ethnomusicology and his own Equatoguinean heritage. The sense of urgency is sustained elsewhere, too: through the turbulent drums, the steely, horrorcore-influenced electronics and the deep, murky low end. It’s a thrilling listen.Read the full review3. feeo – GoodnessView image in fullscreenShapeshifting … feeo.Photograph: Ciara ReddyThe 11-track debut album by south London-based experimentalist feeo is a great introduction to an exciting, shapeshifting artist. There are echoes of her improvisational project Grain Residency in these droning compositions, which fuzz and mutate, punctuated by spoken word features and field recordings. They also show off feeo’s talent as a vocalist. She has a gorgeous voice, which saunters between eerie, breathy whispers and full-on mellifluous croons. Parallels could be drawn to a generation of alt-electronic musicians such as Sampha and James Blake, but these warped tracks feel uniquely innovative.2. Dania – ListlessThe dreamy, downtempo sounds of trip-hop have been ubiquitous this year, in underground and commercial releases alike. Listless, the new album by Baghdad-born, Barcelona-based producer Dania, is one example, with slow, syncopated drum patterns and murky textures embedded throughout the synths and soft layered vocals. But it doesn’t feel like an opportune case of hopping on the bandwagon: the palette is perfectly matched to the album’s theme: written and recorded after midnight, and inspired by Dania’s experiences on night shifts as an emergency doctor, it is an atmospheric, occasionally brooding, musing on the nocturnal hours.Read the full review1. Joanne Robertson – BlurrrView image in fullscreenUnderstated … Joanne Robertson.Photograph: Nis BystedFor many years, Glasgow-based painter-musician Joanne Robertson has been making beautiful, understated songs using little more than her voice and acoustic guitar. It’s music that might sound straight-up pleasant if it wasn’t tinged with only the slightest streak of the uncanny (an element that makes her an ideal match for past collaborator Dean Blunt). Her new album is full of gorgeous, wandering tracks with a warm but ghostly atmosphere: stray guitar strums flicker beneath Robertson’s soft voice, which is sometimes shy, sometimes yearning. It’s a simple formula, but somehow it’s full of feeling. The fact that many of the tracks sound as if they were recorded at home, bookended with string squeaks and amp echoes, only adds to the intimacy.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicBest music of 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Share your thoughts in the comments belowThis article contains spoilers forAvatar: Fire and AshBen ChildMon 22 Dec 2025 08.05 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 08.07 ESTShareFor more than a decade now, James Cameron’s Avatar films have been built on the reassuring idea that the universe is alive, connected and spiritually pure. Part of the pleasure of making it to the end credits of one of them is the comforting feeling that we are nothing like all those evil humans who want to destroy Pandora’s gorgeous bioluminescent utopia of giant blue cat people and navel-gazing whale creatures. Cameron wants to remind us that if we only spent less time chasing profit and more listening to nature, everything would probably be fine.Fire and Ash is where that reassurance starts to curdle. It is still recognisably anAvatarmovie: the tech is absurd, the sincerity remains weaponised, and the creatures appear to have been designed by a benevolent god with a doctorate in marine biology. But something has shifted. Harmony is no longer guaranteed; nature does not reliably pick a side. What emerges is a threequel that feels oddly argumentative, sometimes with the audience, sometimes with itself. The saga that once promised balance now seems fascinated by fracture. Avatar has started asking much harder questions than it ever has before.The Na’vi who broke with the songThe volcano-dwelling Mangkwan clan, led by Oona Chaplin’s ferociously unimpressed Varang, demonstrate that not all Na’vi are peaceful hippies. The Mangkwan are a people who believe Eywa has ghosted them, who have unplugged entirely from Pandora’s deity-cum-neural-network, and who would rather spend their days torching sky-ships, looting the wreckage and enthusiastically murdering anything that still believes in harmony.What’s striking is the way the film treats their violence as coherent. The Mangkwan aren’t a corrupted offshoot or a temporary obstacle to be spiritually corrected; they are a culture shaped by abandonment. Their aggression isn’t presented as a moral error so much as a survival strategy; their violence a response to Eywa’s apparent failure.Suddenly the luscious forest moon has acquired sectarian conflict, resource raids and the unsettling realisation that spiritual abandonment can make even a bioluminescent paradise go full Mad Max. Cameron has waited three films to suggest this internal fracture and, when it arrives, it quietly detonates one of Avatar’s most comforting assumptions: that harmony is the default state and that conflict only ever arrives from outside.At least this is something new. Fire and Ash may still repeat a few familiar Cameron moves – megafauna rising up to swat human technology out of the sky via spiritual wifi – but few would have predicted Stephen Lang’s Colonel Miles Quaritch spending much of his second life forging a romantic attachment with a volcano witch.View image in fullscreenSigourney Weaver as Kiri.Photograph: Disney/PAIf Eywa is just a neural network, why does it behave like an Old Testament god?Earlier episodes of Avatar went all in on the idea that Pandora’s deity is not just a vague spiritual presence, but a fully functioning, physically connected defence system against destructive outsiders. Eywa was real. You could interface with it. You could appeal to it, and – if the narrative stakes were high enough – it would respond with overwhelming force.And yet Fire and Ash spends most of its three-hour running time hinting that even a god who can bring people back from the dead remains something of an enigma. Eywa doesn’t vanish, but it stops behaving predictably. As well as Varang’s Blakeian discontent, there are long stretches in which Sigourney Weaver’s Kiri is simply unable to convince the deity that now would be a really good time to stop messing about and unleash the megafauna on the human baddies.This is a crucial tonal shift. Intervention, when it comes, is late, blunt and indiscriminate. Prayers go unanswered. Connections fail. Eywa no longer behaves like a responsive system so much as a vast, ancient presence operating according to priorities nobody else can access. It turns out that the only thing more frustrating than having no physical proof that god exists is having absolute proof that they do – and still not being able to get them to respond.The moment humanity stops being temporaryEywa’s silence doesn’t mean nothing is happening. It’s just that whatever is happening no longer happens in ways anyone can read. When Spider’s oxygen fails, the planet doesn’t answer a prayer or send a sign. Instead, it edits him: Kiri enters a trance, the ground responds, and Spider is enveloped and invaded by living mycelia, his body quietly retrofitted for Pandora without explanation or consent.This is where the franchise’s moral clarity finally collapses. If Eywa is defending itself against invasion from beyond the stars, why demonstrate – in such explicitly biological fashion – how humans might live on the forest moon without masks, avatars or the pretence of becoming Na’vi? Spider isn’t assimilated spiritually; he’s upgraded. The intervention isn’t framed as blessing or punishment but as simple adaptation. This is a solution that sidesteps morality altogether.The consequences are obvious and chilling. The Resources Development Administration may not understand why Spider was altered, but they now know that adaptation is possible. Humanity’s problem has never been ethics, it’s been scalability. How long before someone works out how to repeat the trick without Eywa, without Kiri, and without asking permission at all?View image in fullscreenZoe Saldaña as Neytiri and Sam Worthington as Jake Sully.Photograph: 20th Century Studios/PAJake Sully and Neytiri nearly lose the moral high groundSam Worthington’s Jake Sully has always been Avatar’s stabilising central hero: the human who saw the light, switched sides and proved that moral clarity could survive first contact. But what happens when saving the planet from humanity starts to look like killing one of your own? When Jake seriously considers murdering Spider – not in anger, but with grim calculation – it is one of the most unsettling scenes Cameron has ever allowed into this universe. Spider isn’t a villain, but for a moment we’re invited to see him as little more than an inconvenient, defenceless proof of concept – a ticking time bomb that can be quietly defused.That Jake and Zoe Saldaña’s Neytiri ultimately decide this is a sacrifice they are not willing to make just about stops the saga sliding into seriously uncomfortable territory. But the damage is done: the decision to let Spider live doesn’t restore moral clarity, but instead exposes how fragile it has become. From this point on, righteousness no longer looks clean. Survival means living with unacceptable risks, compromised ideals and people who don’t fit neatly into anyone’s story of good and evil.Avatar: Fire and Ash review | Peter Bradshaw’s film of the weekRead moreQuaritch could be the ultimate survivorAll of which brings us to Lang’s former scourge of the Na’vi. The leader of humanity’s invasion forces has morphed into something much more complex by episode three, to the point where it’s hard to imagine where he’ll end up if he did survive that fall at the tail end of Fire and Ash. Whereas Jake and Spider are humans who have learned to live like natives in order to survive on Pandora, Quaritch continues to exploit the planet’s resources without ever really learning anything about the place he has made home. His alliance – and romance – with Varang is little more than a marriage of nihilistic convenience. He doesn’t believe in Eywa, harmony or belonging. He believes in leverage.In a saga that is increasingly about survival through adaptation, Quaritch represents the most dangerous species of all: a man who will never open his eyes to Pandora’s wonders because he is spiritually colourblind. We can only hope that parts four and five don’t lean into a continuing redemption story, because that would be a character arc to make Vader turning to the good side look like a gentle retcon by comparison.Explore more on these topicsFilmNow you've seen itAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Film-makers explain why Pasolini ‘was a saint to us’Sam MooreMon 22 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 03.28 ESTShareAbel Ferrara was there at the beginning. In his new memoir, Scene, the cult director describes his experience at the American premiere of Salò, the hugely controversial final film from Italian directorPier Paolo Pasolini. At the beginning of the film – at which Ferrara and company arrived with wine and cheese, given its length – there were 15 people in the audience. Once the credits rolled, there were eight. “I was standing with like six people,” Ferrara says now. “And you know, two or three of those people I still see.”When it comes to Salò, it seems that you never forget your first time. The film, which has reached its 50th anniversary in 2025, is known for its seemingly endless cavalcade of cruelty and violence, leaves a stark impact on those who come across it. “We had high expectations, but it went beyond that,” Ferrara says. “He had just died, so he was a saint to us.” But not everyone so readily embraces the film on first viewing. Film-maker Catherine Breillat says that at first, she didn’t like Salò, “regretted seeing it, [and] sort of wished that [I] hadn’t”. For Breillat, “you have to be ready to see Salò. Its like Arthur’s Round Table; it will come to you when you’re ready. There’s a moment where you can sit down with the knights of the Round Table, after following a dangerous path, and you don’t disappear into the abyss.”View image in fullscreenA 1975 poster for the film.Photograph: Album/AlamyIronically, production on Salò, which was shot in a number of locations in Italy in early 1975, appears to have been a contrast to the stark brutality of the film itself. In a documentary about the making of the film, Hélène Surgère (who played storyteller Signora Vaccari) described the mood of the shoot as “jovial and immature”, the cast full of teenagers who would make jokes during some of the film’s most brutal sequences. At the centre of it all was Pasolini himself, who wouldn’t rehearse the actors, and would only tell them what would happen a few minutes before calling action. In an interviewby Gideon Bachmann for Sight and Soundwhile shooting the film – and therefore only shortly before his death – Pasolini said he was aiming to create a “profoundly enigmatic” film, and that “not to be understood or even to be misunderstood is an intrinsic dimension of this work”.Pasolini and his films were never strangers to controversy, but Salò seemed to be at a level all its own. From its initial release, it was plagued by censorship and accusations of indecency. This began in Pasolini’s native Italy; the film was initially rejected by Italian film censors, but was approved in December 1975, a month after the film’s premiere at the 1975 Paris film festival (which itself was only three weeks after Pasolini’s death). The approval did not last long; Italian censors withdrew permissions for the film in January 1976. Eventually Salò was shown in Rome in March 1977, and even then in a truncated form, with four sequences omitted.Salò received a limited theatrical release in the US in 1977, but in the UK, it was rejected by the BBFC in 1976 and was first shown at the Compton Cinema Club a year later, uncut and without a certification but the screening was raided by the Metropolitan police. The film wouldn’t be released uncut in the UK until 2000, as a result of new BBFC guidelines, through which the board would only intervene over material for adults if it was illegal or harmful.View image in fullscreenA scene from the filmPhotograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyBut now, decades after these struggles with bans and censorship, Salò, and Pasolini’s work more broadly, seems to be in the midst of a revival. In 2014, Ferraradirected a biopic of Pasolini with Willem Dafoe in the lead role; for Ferrara, who describes Pasolini as being like “his teacher, even more [so] now”, the power of Pasolini’s films only strengthens with the passage of time. “Like all great work, you can reread them at different points in your life and more is revealed.” More recently, in 2024, Bruce LaBruce shot ahardcore remake of Pasolini’s Theorem, called The Visitor, in which the enigmatic stranger, who changes the lives of a middle-class family through a series of sexual encounters, is recast as an immigrant, taking on a new, politically live dimension in contemporary Britain.Politics is everywhere in Pasolini’s work, and especially in Salò; LaBruce says that its paralleling of De Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom to Italian fascism is “stupefying” , suggesting that Pasolini’s films and politics “transcend any simplistic notion of gay or queer identity”. This seems to manifest in the final scene of Salò, where two young men dance together in an empty room, the sounds of torture and violence just outside and out of reach. There’s a tension in Pasolini’s characters, the ways in which they shift between being victims and collaborators, between trying to save others and save themselves. But not all film-makers relate to the politics of Salò in the same way. For Breillat, Salò unlocked itself to her when she “defrocked it of the metaphor of fascism” and revealed something more universal and philosophical, the idea that, as she puts it, “we all share the same fears and desires”.View image in fullscreenA shift between being victims and collaborators … a scene from Salò.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyBut there also remains a sense that Pasolini’s work remains unfinished. Ferrara describes his approach to filming his 2014 biopic as being like a documentary. “We knew we were going to film his death,” Ferrara says. “That was a reality.” Pasolini died on 2 November 1975; he was beaten, run over with his own car, and had multiple bones broken. Ferrara said he and his crew did their own research into Pasolini’s last 36 hours; in his film, the film-maker is assaulted on a beach outside Rome in a homophobic attack, with Giuseppe Pelosi –who, at 17, confessed to the murder but retracted it in May 2005– fleeing the scene while Pasolini is run over. Over the course of more than five decades, Pasolini’s death remains mired in mystery and conspiracy; there have been suggestions of organised crime involvement, and political motivation. When he retracted his confession, Pelosi said that three men killed Pasolini, calling him a “queer” and a “dirty communist”.Looming over all of this is the sense of what it meant for Pasolini’s life to be cut short. “The guy died with two novels, a brilliant movie, he’d finished two incredible screenplays.” Ferrara shows Pasolini shooting his unfinished project: Porno-Teo-Kolossal, the story of a man and his servant following a star in search of a messiah.Pasolini, it would appear, seems to be a gift that keeps on giving; LaBruce says that he returns to Salò “every few years, and it’s always as if I’m seeing it for the first time. It’s just as profound, just as disturbing, just as relevant, if not more so every time.” It is a sentiment echoed by Ferrara, who says that Pasolini will be “always modern […] anybody who believes in the cinema and just gets it is going to give in.” While it is tempting to think that the lasting power of Salò lies simply in its ability to shock and disturb – although it is, of course, both shocking and disturbing – that does a disservice to both the film and its director. While there currently seems to some anxiety that the circumstances around his death might somehow overshadow his life and body of work, these are the things that will carry Pasolini forward into the next generation and beyond.Explore more on these topicsFilmPier Paolo PasoliniAbel FerraraItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

You don’t need to be a sports fan to be uplifted here.We begin with the American Samoa national soccer team’s worst ever day at the office: a world record 31-0 drubbing at the hands of Australia in 2001, still the worst loss in international soccer history. Goalkeeper Nicky Salapu is the only player that remains from that fateful day, and despite his upbeat persona, the scars remain. The cloud of defeat still follows the team everywhere.The cameras touch down on the island as the team is preparing for the South Pacific Games in New Caledonia. American Samoa have never won a competitive game and are rooted to the bottom of the Fifa rankings. Their facilities are modest, training sessions need to work around players’ multiple job and church commitments, and the island’s talent pool is limited by a small population and the inevitable exodus of young men leaving to join the US military. In training, shots fly comically wide and over as if the goal itself is repelling them, dribbling skills are no better as drills play out against the island’s idyllic background of lush, forest-covered mountains.The Football Federation of American Samoa reportedly rejected multiple approaches from TV and film crews before the filming of Next Goal Wins in fear of mockery. In contrast, directors Mike Brett and Steve Jamison tread carefully throughout the film, never patronising or belittling their subjects, while still capturing humour with a delicate and compassionate eye.The team do little to challenge their reputation at the South Pacific Games but coach Larry Mana’o still sprinkles the positives when he can. “They needed nine goals today – you gave them only eight. It’s a step. These are steps all going in the right direction.”Desperate times call for desperate measures, so the US Soccer Federation puts out a job posting for a coach. One person replies: Thomas Rongen, a former soccer player and coach, originally from the Netherlands and looking for a different kind of challenge. We later find out that the death of Rongen’s teenage daughter in a car accident is part of his motivation, and this adds to a simmering pot of emotion bubbling throughout the film, which finally spills over when the team later achieves the impossible. Scoring a goal, that is. A first ever win soon follows. Cue air punches and tears in the cinema the first time I watched the movie, from sports fans and phobics alike.Rongen starts as a strict, professional presence but soon softens up, embracing an island culture that is deeply religious, accepting and loyal. Everyone has a role to play, be it scouted addition to the squad Rawlston Masaniai, who qualifies to play through his paternal grandfather, or top scorer Ramin Ott, who is forever being mistaken for a Mexican on his army base.Despite Rongen suggesting early on that trans player Jaiyah Saelua is unlikely to feature in qualifying, Saelua goes on to become the first ever trans player to play in a World Cup qualifying game, supplying the movie’s most crunching tackles and crucial blocks.As a fa’afafine, the Samoan third gender, Jaiyah is not only supported and accepted by her team-mates, but openly celebrated as part of a wider masculinity exhibited in the film that struck me as inspiring. Get yourself a man who does a traditional Samoan war dance but also isn’t afraid to cry in public and who protects the dolls, both on and off the pitch.Needless to say, American Samoa never made it to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup, but they did manage to climb 18 places in the Fifa rankings to 186th, earning a 100% certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes along the way (the less said about the Taika Waititi remake, the better). As far as underdog stories go, you would struggle to write a better one from scratch, let alone scout such a special cast.Next Goal Wins is available to rent digitallyExplore more on these topicsFootballMy feelgood movieDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A curio.Updike tropesReligion, death11Seek My Face (2002)Over the course of a single day, 79-year-old painter Hope Chafetz endures the determined attention of Kathryn D’Angelo, a young, ambitious art journalist. Updike had by this point been on the receiving end of many such encounters and the novel, told almost entirely from Hope’s perspective, bristles with resentment at the presumptions and blind spots inherent in the situation.Updike tropesArt, religion10 S. (1988)An epistolary novel that draws on Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 19th-century story of adultery and hypocrisy, The Scarlet Letter, to ironise faith and fidelity in the 1980s. As revealed in her letters and tapes, Sarah Worth has abandoned her family to find herself in an Arizona ashram led by the guru Arhat Mindadali. The form allows for a fragmented narrative in which the facts Sarah conceals from her husband and daughter are as telling as the facts she details.Updike tropesSex, religion9 Gertrude and Claudius (2000)A prequel to Hamlet that focuses on the tangled love lives of the prince of Denmark’s father, mother and uncle stops short before Shakespeare’s bloody denouement. Gerutha (Gertrude) is married off in her teens to the coarse Horwendil (Hamlet senior) while harbouring a reciprocated passion for Feng (Claudius). The omens are not good. As with Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, the deeper your knowledge of Hamlet, the more you will enjoy Updike’s embellishments.Updike tropesSex, family8Memories of the Ford Administration(1992)The reader will learn very little about Gerald Ford, the 38th president of the United States, from this novel. James Buchanan, the 15th president and something of a minor obsession for both Updike and his narrator Alfred L Clayton, is given slightly more room but what concerns Clayton most is his overboiled erotic memories. Clayton is a history professor well aware that there is no correct interpretation of the past. Clayton’s account of his infidelity and the failure of his marriage is appropriately partial, misleading and self-regarding.Updike tropesSex, family7The Centaur(1963)Chiron, the wise centaur with a fatal wound, stands as an allegory in this novel for the teacher George Caldwell. His son, Peter, recognising his father’s suffering and frustration, determines to escape a similar fate through art. Updike himself achieved the escape that Peter dreams of but, as this early novel demonstrates, he would mine the memory of small-town life for the rest of his career.Updike tropesReligion, family6The Witches of Eastwick(1984)Adapted into both a film with a stellar cast (Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jack Nicholson) and a successful musical, the novel is strong enough to stand apart from those glitzy distractions. The arrival of Darryl Van Horne in a tight-knit New England enclave stirs diabolical feelings in Alexandra, Jane and Sukie, the eponymous sorceresses. Fatal mayhem naturally ensues. With its gossipy tone, the story doesn’t take itself too seriously and neither should the reader.Updike tropesSex, death5Of the Farm (1965)The publication of Updike’s immaculately crafted fourth novel served notice that a once-in-a-generation talent had arrived. Joey Robinson brings his new wife and her child from a previous marriage to the Pennsylvania farm where he grew up to meet the matriarch who struggles to manage the place alone. Through a painstaking accumulation of telling details Updike reveals the tensions between the three adults and the inexorable reality of change.Updike tropesSex, family4The Complete Henry Bech(1993)This edition gathers together short stories – Bech: A Book (1970), Bech Is Back (1982) and Bech in Czech (1987) – featuring peripatetic Henry Bech in a fictional mashup of Jewish writers Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Isaac Bashevis Singer (with a dash of Waspish JD Salinger). Our antihero lives in the shadow of his own celebrity, gives speeches behind the iron curtain, accepts awards at prestigious universities, and spreads the message on the “Cultural Situation of the American Writer” to readers in Ghana, Korea, Venezuela and elsewhere. The irony is that such far-flung adventures are inimical to the writer’s creative process, generating existential anxiety. Updike carries off the satire with a light touch, affectionately sending up literary squabbles and personal rivalries.Updike tropesReligion, sex, death3Couples(1968)This is the novel that made Updike rich and famous and put him on the cover of Time. Readers who look into it hoping to find graphic depictions of middle-class adultery will not be disappointed, but they will also get beautifully wrought accounts of religious doubt, vivid descriptions of commonplace life and sharp observations of social mores in early-60s America. The plot involves the tortuous romantic machinations of 10 couples. At the heart of the action is Piet Hanema, whose need for extramarital sex is matched by his desire for communion with the divine. His life will be shattered by both.Updike tropesSex, religion2Roger’s Version (1986)When this novel was published, its premise that the existence of God could be proven through a computer programme seemed cutting edge. If that now strikes the reader as quaint, the author’s virtuoso upending of his reputation for social realism remains enthralling. We are trapped in the head of Roger Lambert as he obsessively conjures an affair between his wife and a young student, describes his own scandalous relationship with his half-sister’s daughter, and proudly displays his familiarity with the Latin scholarship of the early Christian theologian Tertullian. How much is real and how much can we rely on the omniscient voice of Roger?Updike tropesSex, religion, adulteryView image in fullscreen1Rabbit Angstrom: the four novels (1995)The author’s supreme achievement – if you have never read any of these novels, jump right in at the start and work your way through to the heartbreaking finale. To rank each work in turn, they go: Rabbit at Rest (1990), Rabbit Is Rich (1981), Rabbit, Run (1960) and Rabbit Redux (1971). A separately published novella, Rabbit Remembered (2001) , is a disappointing misfire. Taken as a whole, the tetralogy offers an unforgettable portrait of the life of the white middle-class American male in the last century. Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom is priapic, patriotic and prone to bouts of religious introspection. When we first meet him, he feels trapped in a stale marriage, his days as a feted high-school basketball player behind him, long years of existential emptiness ahead. Those years will cover the counterculture explosion of the 1960s, the monied excess of the early 1980s and the bitter realisation by the close of that decade that unbridled materialism has poisoned the body corporeal and politic. Updike’s gifts for vivid description and apt metaphor have never been surpassed.Updike tropesSex, religion, deathThis article was amended on 22 December 2025.

Hello Chris.Ghost in a time-ripped landscapewhere a low solstice sun spills whiskedthrough a metallic staircase.With joy, the man’s smile haunts me for miles —a long blasted path, where a dead rat’s belly festoonsits purple crinoline Christmas hat.In canal-light, in time-light, in Cratchit-light,in ripped-light, in rat-light, in Solstice-light,in metallic-light, in frost-light, in grief-light,in Christmas-lightfrom the smile of a strangerI remake my father.This week’s poem is fromHedonism, Chris McCabe’s latest, sixth poetry collection. It confirms a prodigious talent for the assimilation of ideas, and for letting them loose in forms that are variously experimental, and use the full muscle and gristle of lived language. Hedonism, at its simplest, isthe philosophy that prioritises pleasure. McCabe’s interpretation uncovers all kinds of delightful and surprising stories: they are antidotes to melancholia, but capable of a sustaining emotional realism.Connective tributaries weave in and out of the collection: the loss of a father, associated with Christmas Day, is one of them. In this week’s poem, it appears that McCabe’s adult persona is back home in his native Liverpool for some festivities. But the remaking of the past seems to begin with the impulse to take Christmas out of doors, into a local but larger-than-family setting.The unidentified man who meets the speaker by the canal emerges out of “water-light”, not water. If a reader thinks about identifying the figure as Christ, there’s a quick corrective: Cratchit, Scrooge’s clerk and foil in A Christmas Carol, is the word. It’s a scratchy name, like the cheap scarf the shivering figure in the story needed to wear indoors. This dream-Cratchit recognises the poet-speaker with a friendly surprise and names him instantly: “I know you. Hello Chris.”Plainly audible end-rhyme marks the mutual recognition, and the power of a particularly haunted “Day” to speak and to “say”. Internal rhyme and alliteration complicate the textures. We then step abruptly into the difficulty of seeing how past and future connect. The soundscape is alive with whispers and clicks: “Cratchit-wrapped”, “time-ripped”, “solstice”, “spills”, “whisked”, “metallic staircase”. The images call up fissures of neglect and redevelopment, and the inconvenient ways memory and imagination muddle the smooth with the rough.Roughness is interrupted by the “smile” that “haunts me for miles” but rediscovered and heightened by the presence of the rat, brutally dead in the fancy clothes and colouring of decay. Decomposition is not necessarily a negative image: the poem leaves us room to accept it without revulsion – perhaps invites us to do so.“Rat-light” is among the forms of light the poem gathers together, a spectrum that constitutes one big “ripped-light”. The rip produces clarity as well as complication, especially in the unequivocal presentation of the quietly enlightened hero-father: he’s the breathing ghost of a morality that suspends relativism or cynicism. McCabe’s sense of moral value, and what it might mean politically, is essential to much of his insight as a thinker and writer, and helps inform the joy of Hedonism.Shifts of “light” are necessary to the poem’s vision, but they are to some degree the backdrop, as the syntax of the last six lines makes clear. Now the ordinariness underlying the miracle is revealed: “from the smile of a stranger / I remake my father”. It’s a non-cryptic clue for making the future from the hauntings of the past (and, just maybe, for turning a stranger into one of the family).Another poem in McCabe’s new collection led me to a discovery – the remarkable work and ideas of the writer, music critic and philosopherMark Fisher. The idea of “haunting” and its more complex form of “hauntology” add a special edge to the current poem, and to the collection.Chris McCabe himself givesa rewarding short interview here.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over time, and possibly coloured by the historical context of Portuguese colonists’ rampages across the globe, “palaver” came to refer to a complex debate or negotiation between two culturally distinct parties.Culture clashes, conflicted conversations, oppositions and exchanges are principal interests for Washington. His debut novel, 2020’sMemorial, was a sobering but sensitive consideration of a fracturing interracial gay relationship set between Houston and Osaka. This was followed in 2023 byFamily Meal, again taking place in Houston, with its pithy observations of a combustible queer love triangle. Palaver centres on the tense relationship between protagonists “the son” and “the mother”. Guarded and prickly, the son is an American who has lived in Tokyo for the best part of a decade, teaching English as a foreign language. Throughout this period, he’s been estranged from his Jamaican-American mother back home in Texas. The novel opens with the equally crabby mother unexpectedly turning up on her son’s doorstep, and mostly covers the week and a half they spend together, moving between their two perspectives. Illuminated by Tokyo’s harsh neon, mother and son edge around reckonings with their bitter past of familial dysfunction, and make their way towards something resembling rapprochement.Conversation between the two often seems impossible. The son reverts to the body language of adolescent discontent: he is endlessly groaning, grimacing or rolling his eyes. While these gestures might signal a metaphorical evasion of connection, he avoids his mother more literally too. Instead of showing her the delights of his adopted home town, he continues his usual routine of drinking a little too much with his rather fabulous crew of extremely funny and silly gay pals, going on questionable Grindr hookups and coasting through relationships with unavailable men.I am itching for Washington to turn his sharp eye to new material and questionsMeanwhile, the mother – an inquisitive and self-sufficient character – becomes a flaneuse. She wanders through Tokyo from the son’s apartment to the shops, “past the hot pot diners, and then the cluster of tiny alleys where teens flipped skateboards, filming TikToks, and then the trio of shawarma stalls whose lines spilled into the intersections; past the bundled buildings advertising hostess bars and international phone plans, toward the tunnel covering huddles of men smoking cigarettes, drinking from Sapporo cans on the overpass alongside Ōkubo Station”. Her confidence at navigating the city’s spaces develops in tandem with her boldness in persuading her son to share more of his life with her and to see her humanity.Alongside this present-day narrative, there are flashbacks to the mother’s childhood in the Caribbean, where we discover that her hostility and homophobia have a complex and affecting genesis concerning her charismatic brother, Stefan. Then there are recollections of the mother’s emigration to Toronto. There is also a storyline about the son’s brother, Chris, who has spent time in prison. Interspersed amid all this are photos that capture Tokyo’s streetlife, nightlife and Japanese domesticity. All this variety can make proceedings feel as wandering as one of the mother’s undirected strolls. The structure reflects the theme of powerlessness: “the mother couldn’t help but wonder how little control she had over her life, and how little say everyone has in where they end up”. In the same way both mother and son believe they have been thrown off course by often cruel winds of circumstance, so the novel cannot follow a straightforwardly linear path.The determined sparsity and downbeat mode of the narration – signatures of Washington’s oeuvre now – mean that, largely, these scattered fragments come together to form a sensible whole. The narrative is glued together by the themes of alienation, exile and the challenges of creating and sustaining a sense of home.Arguably, there is something colourless and trite about the novel’s ultimate – and seemingly inevitable – move towards mutual understanding between the two lead characters. And throughout, as in Family Meal, there is a tendency towards a kind of faux-insightful Insta-therapy speak in the dialogue that does a disservice to the alluring strangeness and open-endedness of characterisation elsewhere. At one point, an elder mentor figure gives the son the weighty life advice that he needs to “show up for himself”.But fans of Washington’s work will have much to enjoy here. All the staples of his style are on show: the mumblecore prose, the interest in Asian culture and particularly cuisine, messy gay bars, a chosen family of smart aleck and ludic queer sidekicks, frank presentations of sex and sexuality, unwanted guests and unlikely alliances, tricky mothers and harrumphing sons. This, however, was the principal problem for me: I felt that, in Palaver, I was reading a remix of Washington’s greatest hits. Undoubtedly Washington is a fine, stylish and very talented writer. But I am itching for him to turn his sharp eye to new material and questions. In the middle of the novel, the mother remembers her brother nudging her to leave Jamaica, to spread her wings. “You know what life is here … go see what it is elsewhere.” Pertinent advice indeed.Explore more on these topicsFictionBook of the dayreviewsShareReuse this content"

The winner of the most dazzling political campaign of the past year, New York City mayor-electZohran Mamdani made “freeze the rent” his central pledge. On the right, a revolt against property taxes is gathering pace. Journalist Mike Bird’s history of the most basic asset arrives, then, at an opportune moment.Land ownership has, of course, been critically important for most of history, tied up with financial independence and social status. But its role changed dramatically with the Industrial Revolution and the growth of cities.The most valuable companies in the world now design chips, develop software or extract oil. The wealthiest escape high taxes by relocating to the Gulf, and some dream of “network states”, virtual countries that organise and govern themselves online. Henry George, the journalist and economic thinker who called for a single tax – on land – was widely read in the 19th century but is now largely forgotten. George saw monopolies of land ownership as the source of economic inefficiency and the root of inequality, since the gains from land increasing in value went to landlords and speculators rather than productive businesses.But since the early 20th century, politics on the left has been organised around class, and on the right around questions of identity and personal liberty. The rise of widespread property ownership seemed, for a time, to have taken the sting out of land as a political issue. George’s only substantial legacy was the board game invented to spread his ideas, The Landlord’s Game, better known to most children in its later incarnation: Monopoly.Bird charts the return of land as a central economic and political force. Real estate was used as collateral for loans which enabled the creation and expansion of businesses, and it became a source of revenue for companies too: McDonald’s, which is built on a franchise model and owns the land where many of its franchises are located, makes more money from rent than it does from royalties on Big Macs and the rest of its menu.For decades, property has been central to China’s economic growth, with local governments relying on land sales for revenue and citizens investing their life savings in the sector. The real estate boom has weakened dynamism in other sectors. Bird suggests the country now faces a painful choice: allow prices to crash and wipe out middle-class wealth, let prices stay high and sap the rest of the economy, or resign itself to gradual stagnation. This is the “land trap” of the title.There are a few important absences in Bird’s narrative. There’s little on the role of engineering and technology, for example. “Buy land, they’re not making it any more” is the famous saying, but in fact that’s false: steel frames and elevators allowed Chicago to become a city in the sky, while the Hoover Dam’s water raised Las Vegas from the Mojave Desert. Surprisingly, there’s nothing on how floods and wildfires intensified by climate change can destroy the value of land, though that’s an increasing prospect everywhere from the Gulf coast of the US to the Mediterranean, with ownership structures amplifying the unfairness. When fields flood, tenant farmers with the least resources suffer most and find it hardest to rebuild.The central puzzle of land is arguably its failure to keep pace with improvements in other aspects of life: the devices people scroll on may be vastly more sophisticated than the dumbphones of the 1990s, but the quality of the homes they live in has improved little in the past century. This book is a masterly introduction to the economics of land ownership, though it has less to say about the social consequences.Private landlords have little incentive to invest when they can easily fill the homes they let out, while states increasingly lack the funds for repair and renovation. The combination of a shabby private rental sector (its expansion fuelled in Britain by the buy-to-let mortgages created 29 years ago) and shrinking public provision, stripped away by right-to-buy, is one of the main reasons land has become a salient issue once again. The system we created has failed to give people the shelter they need, and instead facilitated the return of slums.The Land Trap: A New History of the World’s Oldest Asset by Mike Bird is published by Hodder (£25).

One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.There is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.When I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winningClair Obscur: Expedition 33, andHollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many peoplereallycontribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.View image in fullscreenSmaller-scale wins … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Kepler InteractiveTheNintendo Switch 2was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.But the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios,including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology.AI-generated artwork and voiceovershave made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.All this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be foundprotesting outside the Game Awardsearlier this month.) In the UK, thefiring of 30 stafffrom Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Rockstar Games office in Edinburgh in November.Photograph: Lesley Martin/PAAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: whenMicrosoft acquired Activisionin 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudisalso bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’sinterview with Human Rights Watchfrom earlier this year is an essential read.)What we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he wasdiscovered to be a fake gamerin January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images ofthe president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue tofeed culture war spatsover a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?View image in fullscreenElon Musk boasted about being an elite gamer online – and turned out to be faking itPhotograph: Evan Vucci/API don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after Iwrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.Why the enormous Saudi-led deal to acquire EA matters, whether you play games or notRead morePlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this,this year’s Summer Game Fest– a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.It matters, who has power.Gamesfeel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.Explore more on these topicsGamesDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That should surely now be unconditional. Cutting has risen, almost to the top, and 2025 has been astellar year. This enthusiastically performed and received recital, a world away from the general run of pre-Christmas concerts or countertenor recitals, and accompanied by the eclectically matched eight-strong Refound Ensemble, showed why.Themed recitals are common, but Cutting’s programme of songs and music, all connected to the theme of night, was built on levels of thought and performative imagination that few such programmes would even attempt, much less bring off. The pieces ranged from the baroque to the brand new, via Schubert, folk song and Don McLean. Few familiar pieces on the programme were played as written, with Cutting preferring arrangements mostly by members of the ensemble. It was compelling from first to last, more cabaret than concert.View image in fullscreenHugh Cutting with clarinettist Magdalenna Krstevska at the Wigmore Hall, London.Photograph: Sisi BurnThe calms and charms of night came first. Even here, though, there was instant originality in a lilting Auden setting by Geoffrey Burgon, once famous for the Nunc Dimittis from the BBC’s 1970s Le Carré adaptations. Then, without a break, as was most of the programme, we had Endymion’s soulful song to the moon from Cavalli’s La Calisto and Purcell’s Fairy Queen aria hymning the pleasures of the night, to which Cutting’s lustrous countertenor was ideally suited.Of the two premieres, Piers Connor Kennedy’s Morpheus, a dark and expressive Rupert Brooke setting, was particularly successful, crisply scored and sung with nice subtlety. Elena Langer’s Fabulous Beasts, settings of medieval lyrics about birds and beasts, linked by virtuosic clarinet playing by Magdalenna Krstevska, was odder and quirkier, but too disjointed.Oberon’s “Welcome, wanderer!” from Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream was done in a brilliant arrangement that captured all the transgressive eeriness of the score. Then a darker and more dramatic turn, with Schubert’s Erlkönig and Richard Rodney Bennett’s Baby, Baby, Naughty Baby each unleashing alarming nocturnal demons. Don McLean’s gentle 1970 song Vincent, sung by Cutting in baritone, trod the same knife-edge in a different way. The black humour of William Bolcom’s ghoulish Black Max was terrifically done, and Weill’s Speak Low was a seductive reminder at the end that the night is also made for love.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Coming up is the panto. On other days, it may be anything from language lessons to arts and crafts. Today in this multipurpose venue, it is the turn of the annual Christmas fair, with its bric-a-brac stalls, grotto and tree. Sitting on four sides of the elegant ballroom in Chadderton town hall, a refuge forOldham Coliseum during renovations, we require no leap of the imagination to picture ourselves at a genuine local fundraiser.That gives Jim Cartwright’s 2012 play a built-in sense of community. Director Jimmy Fairhurst keeps the house lights up, save for the most poignant speeches, and expects us to clap along to the Christmas hits and cheer the young carol singers as if they were children of our own. Blurring the fact/fiction divide, the interval is less a break in the action than a chance to buy the scented candles and prints by Oldham artists that are otherwise part of the set.View image in fullscreenPleasing materiality … Gordon-Harrison as Lucy with Paddy Stafford as Johnny, staffing the bric-a-brac stall.Photograph: Patch DolanThe site-specific hall has its disadvantages. The acoustics are poor and the focus bounces unpredictably around the space, sucking the life out of Cartwright’s jokes. Surprisingly for Fairhurst, whose Not Too Tame company specialises in boisterous entertainment and direct address, there is little audience interaction.But there is a chaotic appeal in the playwright’s structural conceit. The show opens with the caretaker (Lee Toomes) sweeping up an empty space which, with the arrival of bossy Veronica (Samantha Robinson), enthusiast Lucy (Kelise Gordon-Harrison), the vicar (Dickon Tyrrell) and lefty writer Johnny (Paddy Stafford), gradually fills with tables laden with trinkets, toys and teddy bears. Before the night is through, it will all be cleared away again. It is not exactlyWorks and Days, the wordless Belgian show that built a whole house on stage, but it has a pleasing materiality.A breezy first half contrasts with a weightier second, in which the characters take turns to reveal their demons in aria-like soliloquies. The speeches are dramatically inert, back-story reflections instead of present-tense action, but heartfelt for all that. Bathed in goodwill-to-all-men sentiment and acted with charm, it amounts to a slight but wholesome seasonal alternative.AtChadderton Town Hall, Oldham, until 2 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is not certain exactly what Wizzard earn because streaming revenues are undisclosed.“There’s something mildly aggrieving about this song’s annual success overshadowing the rest of Wood’s rich oeuvre,” according to Petridis, the Guardian’s head rock and pop critic. However, in his rundown of Wood’s best tracks, he adds that “equally, writing something that becomes part of the fabric of national life is quite an achievement”.Andrew Mitchell, the head of digital PR forDark Horse, said the Wizzard stats were part of a much larger trend toward classic Christmas music dominating charts via streaming platforms.He said: “In the early 2000s, there were hardly any Christmas songs in the Top 40 of the week that the Christmas No 1 is crowned. That has steadily risen over the years, and now Christmas songs dominate the charts – and usually the same ones each year. Over the past few years, at least half of the Top 40 each Christmas has been the same as the previous year.”Wizzard’s top 10 tracks on Spotify have amassed 215m streams. I Wish It Could be Christmas Everyday alone has 208m streams, which makes up about 97% of that 215m total.Wood had several musical lives before forming the band. He founded psychedelic rockers The Move and then started Electric Light Orchestra in 1970 with Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan.The Move formally split in 1972, the same year Wood formed the glam rockers Wizzard.I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday from 1973 is Wizzard’s best-known track but they had several other hits, including Ball Park Incident and See My Baby Jive.This year’s Christmas No 1 was Kylie Minogue with Xmas, which was helped by a viral dance. She saw off competition from Wham!’sLast Christmas, which held the top spot for the past two years.Also in the race was Lullaby from the charity campaign Together for Palestine.

The two books account for close to 500,000 sales this year.“So many people have fallen for these beautiful colouring books because they provide people with a place to relax, unwind and get creative, away from screens,” said Fenella Bates, non-fiction publisher at Penguin Random House Children. “We’re encouraged to put down our phones and escape into the pages of these books, which have become a little pocket of calm in our hectic world.”The rise of colouring as an adult hobbymade headlines in 2015. That year, the Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford’s colouring bookstopped the Amazon bestsellers listin the US.Bates has taken up colouring herself and said she has become “hooked on the books”, describing them as “a great way to destress and find a moment for yourself at the end of the day.”Coming in at 20th overall was Nicholls’s You Are Here, a romance following the blossoming of a relationship between two divorcees on a hiking trip through the Lake District.Federico Andornino, Nicholls’s editor and executive publisher at Spectre, attributes the book’s success to readers’ cravings for escapism and connection. “No one does that better than David: he’s got the very rare gift of making people think, laugh out loud and cry – often in the same chapter,” he said.View image in fullscreenDavid Nicholls’s latest novel, You Are Here, came in 20th overall.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverThe top 20 bestsellers of 2025The Impossible Fortune by Richard Osman (Viking, hardback) – 391,429 copiesThe Housemaid by Freida McFadden (Little, Brown, paperback) – 342,899 copiesSunrise on the Reaping by Suzanne Collins (Scholastic, hardback) – 333,340 copiesWe Solve Murders by Richard Osman (Penguin, paperback) – 323,293 copiesOnyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros (Piatkus, hardback) – 304,728 copiesAlways Remember by Charlie Mackesy (Ebury Press, hardback) – 286,090 copiesCozy Corner by Coco Wyo (Penguin, paperback) – 255,682 copiesThe Secret of Secrets by Dan Brown (Bantam, hardback) – 245,318 copiesFourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros (Piatkus, paperback) – 241,532 copiesA Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J Maas (Bloomsbury, paperback) – 224,535 copiesThe Women by Kristin Hannah (Pan, paperback) – 220,629 copiesThe Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins and Sawyer Robbins (Hay House, hardback) – 218,919 copiesEat Yourself Healthy by Jamie Oliver (Michael Joseph, hardback) – 217,520 copiesThe Hotel Avocado by Bob Mortimer (Gallery, paperback) – 210,116 copiesCozy Cuties by Coco Wyo (Penguin, paperback) – 205,619 copiesIn Too Deep by Lee Child and Andrew Child (Penguin, paperback) – 204,538 copiesIron Flame by Rebecca Yarros (Piatkus, paperback) – 201,474 copiesThere Are Rivers in the Sky by Elif Shafak (Penguin, paperback) – 193,640 copiesThe Housemaid’s Secret by Freida McFadden (Little, Brown, paperback) – 191,804 copiesYou Are Here byDavid Nicholls(Hodder & Stoughton, paperback) – 187,010 copiesExplore more on these topicsBooksRichard OsmanSuzanne CollinsDavid NichollsBob MortimerHunger GamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereLucy PaviaMon 22 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 14.02 ESTShareTen years ago and newly married, I was invited to spendChristmaswith my husband’s extended family. “We’re not doing gifts this year, there are too many of us,” my husband told me in early December when I queried who to buy for.So, I showed up with a roll of novelty Christmas pudding bin bags and wine for the hosts. Imagine my embarrassment later that day when his aunt, uncle and cousins all handed me gifts so beautiful and thoughtful I still use them today. I resolved then to never enter the festive period without an arsenal of last-minute gift ideas in my back pocket – and also not to take everything my husband says as read.The Christmas delivery window might be closing faster than that big stone door in Indiana Jones, but ourlast-minute Christmas gift guideshould help you avoid similar embarrassment over that aunt/godchild/husband you’ve forgotten to buy for. We have ideas from tickets for next year’s cultural highlights to monthly food subscriptions (olive oil, coffee, brownies) that will be the gift that keeps on giving well into 2026. If you do still want a physical gift, we’ve also included retailers who will take orders right down to the wire.You also can’t go wrong with a stash of spare homemade presents. My sister-in-law makes little tins of her delicious brownies; I make my family “chocolate crunch” recipe (a spin on tiffin) wrapped in brown paper and tied with a velvet ribbon. An artist friend paints tapered candles: surprisingly simple to do with cream supermarket candles and non-toxic acrylic paint; stick to dots or stripes if you’re a beginner.Discover instant Christmas kitschView image in fullscreenKeep them busy in the holidays – and save money – by making your own paper snowflakes.Photograph: Kostikova/Getty ImagesIf you’re not the sort of person who gets their decorations up by 1 December, you may also want to give your home a last-minute Christmas zhoosh. According to interiors brand Ruggable, Google searches for “nostalgic Christmas decorations” are up 200% this year; I grew up in a household decorated with my grandfather’s 1960s crepe paper streamers each Christmas, so I’m all for a classic homemade paper chain. It’s a good use for awkward leftover strips of wrapping paper, too. Paper snowflakes are another lovely thing to do with kids for a bit of instant Christmas kitsch: fold a circle of white paper three times to make a triangle, cut out a pattern of your choice from the edges and unfold.A few years ago, when I didn’t have room for a tree, I filled a tall vase with bare winter branches and hung glass bird decorations on them (these are similar) – you can also add twinklybattery-powered lightsor ribbons. Nini Torres, co-founder of Bimba Floral Studio, suggests baking thin slices of orange in the oven until they’re dry, then stringing them together to make a fragrant garland for your mantelpiece or table: “Each slice will dry differently from the others, which makes it feel really organic.”She also suggests making a tree-shaped centrepiece from clementines (there are lots of tutorials online), using sticks to secure them to a foam base and filling the gaps with rosemary. Otherwise, she says an arrangement of pine stems in a vase can be mixed “with berries or cascades of ivy” for an instant Christmassy look. (Read our guide tohosting the ultimate Christmas dinnerfor more table-decorating ideas.)And what about last-minute guests? Chef Ben Slater says a good corner shop blini alternative is toasted wedges of crumpet: “Load them up with something creamy, something smoked and something herby to make the ultimate last-minute canape.” On The Table co-founder Lucy Mee suggests cocktail sausages with a dip of chilli jam or squares of puff pastry baked with honey, charcuterie and cheese(full instructions here).

What you choose to put on your feet in your own home is a window into what you value most. As such, buying the perfect pair for yourself is an act of self-nurture.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If that all feels too hyperbolic, it feels safe to say that they’re at least a reflection of your favourite mode of relaxation and how high you like to turn up the heating.I’ve been hooked on slippers ever since my best friend bought me a hot-pink pair with monsters on when I was 10. Today, I write about style for a living, and have a healthy obsession with not letting my feet get cold – I have swallowed whole the idea that cold feet mean you can’t sleep. I also strongly believe that the right slipper can truly make time at home feel 110% more cosy, productive, sociable or fun; whatever you need it to be on any given day.I’ve narrowed down the perfect pairs. Whether you’re after the best slippers for winter, a pair that will stand up to a hotel breakfast, or a practical design for the occasional trip to the bins, read on.The 8 best electric blankets and heated throws – tried and tested to keep you toasty for less this winterRead moreThe best slippers for men and women in 2025For warm feet on cold daysView image in fullscreenSolace slippers£15 at Regatta£15 at DebenhamsI’m a big fan of a mule slipper you can wear at the same time as your chunkiest sock, especially in the depths of winter. If you are too, then these mules may be just what you’re after. Cosy and ready for an alpine chalet in the brown, they’re much less appealing in the cold grey. Wear with a red, green or even – bonus points! – tartan sock for theHome Alone festive vibe that’s making this winter a maximalist, Ralph Lauren-adjacent90s fest.View image in fullscreenNatural grey slipper£42.95 at Egos Copenhagen£43 at Wolf & BadgerThese cosy wool slip-ons from Danish brand Egos are on my feet right now. They may not be the prettiest slippers, but they’re among the best I’ve ever had the pleasure to own. I bought them two years ago and have worn them daily every winter since, yet they still seem as if they have years left in them.I like a slipper you can slip on and off with ease – with a bit of a sole, but still feeling soft and supple. They also need to be neutral enough to suit even the most colour-clashing outfit you wear behind closed doors. These ones, designed in Copenhagen and handmade in Nepal, offer all of that. Plus, presumably designed with Danish winter in mind, they would keep feet warm well into the Arctic Circle.If the somewhat sombre grey doesn’t do it for you, they also come inrusty red,light blueandlime green.View image in fullscreenSalt Plains sheepskin slipper mules£70 at the Small Home“Ethically minded small business” the Small Home makes these slippers out of British sheepskin. They come in a trio of understated colours, each with a different pattern embroidered on the upper. All feature a fluffy inside layer that will make feet feel loved.They’re handmade on a small scale, and the company says it sources its sheepskin from a supplier with the highest animal welfare standards, using either byproducts from the meat industry or off-cuts from Rolls-Royce car interiors. They look like something Sienna Miller may have slipped into at home in Primrose Hill during the 00s.View image in fullscreenSuede cow print clog slippers£33 at M&SThis pair of cow-print slippers from Marks & Spencer is perfect if you like to have warm feet without totally abandoning lookingau courant.With a chunky grip that would – aptly but perhaps not very usefully – stand you in good stead in a muddy field, they’ll be as great for at-home parties as for days spent chewing the fat with your family. If the cow print is sold out in your size, you could try the more classicleopard-print ones.For at-home entertainingView image in fullscreenDansoft leather ballet shoes£22 at BlochFrom £22.81 at AmazonThe slippers you receive guests in are a good indicator of the kind of host you are. When my ever-immaculate colleague Jess Cartner-Morleysuggested these ballet shoesas the “world’s most elegant slipper”, she gave a strong hint that dinner at her house is an elegant affair. A shoe designed for ballet will also prove an excellent choice if dinner escalates into dancing in the kitchen. But for all of the highbrow associations, these ballet shoes cost a very reasonable £22.Koritsi Hydra slippersView image in fullscreen£59 at Give a PonIf you’re more likely to have friends round for pizza on the sofa – or wine on the floor – then perhaps these will be more your speed. Handmade in a workshop in Greece, these slippers lasted me for years, despite the pom-pom proving a tempting target for my cat. The inside might be wool, but be warned, I found them surprisingly chilly without a sock. They come in various stitched designs and colours and have a practical leather sole.For taking the bins outView image in fullscreenLined slippers£35 at Crew ClothingIf you’re looking for glamour in a slipper, then look away now. Thesemules, available in workhorse dark green and navy, come in hard-wearing nyloncord. Reasonable, at £35,they’re a donkey of a slipper. Treat them well, and they’ll work hard around the home while also carrying you steadfastly down to the bins. The good grips should stop you slipping on a frosty morning, while the fluffy lining will keep toes toasty.View image in fullscreenHowser III Slide£80 at Keen£52.76 at AmazonThese slippers from the outdoorsy US brand Keen are another pair unafraid of a bit of hard work. Again, nobody said they were elegant, but they would stand up well to excursions outside. Their bungees tighten for a cosier fit and the soles give some traction on a frosty garden path. The black nylon model will wipe down particularly well, should any bin juice come their way.You’re not a slipper person, but don’t want cold feetView image in fullscreenIwata bed socks£75 at TokyobikeThis is not a serious slipper; this is a non-slipper for the person who, for whatever reason, doesn’t like slippers. Technically bed socks, these carefree beauties are made in Japan by sleep specialist Iwata out of all-natural materials. For all their frivolity, they do make a concession to practicality and can be gently hand-washed. Perhaps best of all, looking down at these is bound to elicit a smile. Rarely will your feet have been so cosy, or looked so joyously daft.Currently only available in medium, large and extra-large, so it looks like, for the moment at least, the larger-footed among us are going to be the ones with the most supremely cosy feet.For taking away with youView image in fullscreenMerippa slippers£59 at Couverture & the Garbstore£64 at Made In JapanReversible with collapsable heels, these look like a slipper worn by someone who knows their way around Adobe Illustrator. Hailing from Japan, they pack down tightly and are lightweight. They may be a slouch of a slipper, but they’re also chic in the kind of IYKYK (“if-you-know-you-know”) way. Knitted and hand-finished, they’re available in various patchworks of seasonal fabrics.View image in fullscreenMim felt slipper£75 at VivobarefootWhile these are a bit more substantial, they’re the work of minimalist shoe company Vivobarefoot. The brand specialises in barely there shoes, and this pair can curl up tight like a cinnamon bun for fitting into a crammed suitcase. They won’t show you up if you’re a houseguest for the weekend, and they’re muted enough to go with anything you’ve packed. They’re made in partnership with Mongolian craftswomen using 100% wool felt, have an easy-to-clean leather sole. But if this is the slipper of choice for you, you’re very much not alone– they’re only available in a few remaining sizes.For working from homeView image in fullscreenMahabis classic slippers£99 at Mahabis£99 at AmazonThe pandemic convinced me and many others that wearing shoes to work from home increases productivity. Enter this more-professional-than-your-average slipper, weighted with corporate greatness – the brand is popular with the Silicon Valley crowd, and the price is certainly more in line with corporate budgets. Wool, washable and with a neoprene heel to lock in your foot, they certainly help me feel more switched on, even while I’m on the sofa.View image in fullscreenWabi One slippers£90 at CamperSleek in design, these well-built slippers should last long after Q4 is over. They’re available in a pleasingly wide range of professional tones, as well as very fun hot pinks and highlighter yellows. Perhaps most intriguing of all is the chance to print your own message across the design. Whether you go for a motivational mantra or something a bit more NSFW is up to you.Keep the rest of your home office toasty with our guide to thebest electric heatersFor cool feet on warm daysView image in fullscreenHavaianas flip-flops£13.80 at HavaianasSome prefer to go barefoot in the summer months, but for those like me who still like some sole, a pair of Havaianas is perfect. While most other flip-flops I’ve tried have earned their “toe killer” nickname, Havaianas caress the toe joint with a little more tenderness. And they come in a rainbow of fun colours.The company says that 40% of the sole is made from rubber scraps recycled from the production process, but I still like to find them secondhand – well, almost. If you don’t like the thought of someone else’s feet, look on Vinted or similar for new ones, either with or without tags. Plenty of people seem to buy the wrong pair and off-load them untouched.View image in fullscreenBirkenstock Madrid sandals£40 at BirkenstockAnother ideal house shoe for warmer months or climes, these sleek Birkenstocks are easy to slip on and off. They’ll work for popping outside for a spot of watering – helpfully, they’re waterproof – and they’re comfy enough to wear around the house. They come in regular and narrow fit.For more:The best women’s pyjamasThe best men’s pyjamasThe best electric blankets, testedEllie Bramley is the Guardian’s fashion and lifestyle editor one day a week, and spends theother days working from home wearing an assortment of slippers to fit her mood and the task at hand.

The reality was a disappointment only Home Alone could assuageAmrou Al-KadhiMon 22 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 09.21 ESTShareWhen I was eight years old, I was living in Dubai and desperate to experience a westernChristmas. My family are Muslim, and Christmas was something we’d never celebrated – but after consuming countless festive Hallmark movies, I was hooked on the dream of having turkey, tinsel and, most importantly, presents. I also had an enormous crush on Macaulay Culkin, and thought if I could experience Christmas for myself it would somehow bring me closer to him.After months of badgering my parents about why my twin brother and I deserved Christmas, they relented. My beautiful Iraqi-Egyptian mother took on the task with gumption, finding the largest, tackiest tree you can imagine.In the weeks preceding Christmas Day, I watched the tree take on more and more ornaments, each more shiny and outrageous than the last. My mother was, and still is, the most glamorous woman I know; going to shopping malls with her was heaven, as she would delight shop assistants by catwalking in various ensembles. The tree fell victim to her charm, as it accumulated ornament after ornament, each as opulent as the ensembles she would wear to her upmarket luncheons.Better still, the tree was surrounded by a climbing mountain of gifts, in pristine wrapping. Day by day, it grew in scale, my own Everest of delights to be explored on Christmas morning. The pile grew seriously large, encroaching on the living room like a tsunami of privilege. I felt like the luckiest boy in the world. Mama said my brother and I were not to touch any of the gifts, as it would disrupt the gorgeous display she had so meticulously crafted. She used to say the same about her outfits.Every day after school I gawped at – but never touched – the joy that awaited me. When Christmas Day came, I was awake at 5am and brimming with excitement. I started to tear open the never-ending pile of presents. I ripped open the first one – and found an empty tissue box. I was utterly confused. Maybe it was a joke? My family were obsessed with pranks, so I moved on to the next parcel: again, an empty tissue box. As I rummaged through what I had hoped would be a lifetime’s supply of toys, I found only more of the same. With tears in my eyes, I looked up at my mother.“Where are my presents? It’s Christmas.”“Yes, habibi. Look. Our living room looks like Christmas.”She was right: our home had been transformed into a shiny performance of western commerciality. Ever the glamorous queen, she had prioritised how it looked, and it was picture-perfect; but the substance – by which I mean my gifts – remained absent.“We don’t celebrate Christmas,” she said, sympathetically. “What did you expect?”I felt consumed by the kind of grief only a spoilt child can know; my brother, too, was in mourning. Our mother had wanted to give us the Christmas we had asked for – and, as always, the aesthetics were spot on. But we were distraught.I lay surrounded by a hundred empty tissue boxes. Eventually, my parents relented and bought me a Game Boy; it was the only thing that would remedy my despondence. That, and watching Home Alone on repeat.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasDubaifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside, salted cabbage soaks in large metal vats in the first stage of a process that Kim has followed for more than 30 years.But watching over the production line has become increasingly fraught.South Koreaimports more kimchi than it exports, and the gap has widened as cheaper Chinese-made products take hold in the domestic market.“Kimchi has become aworld food from Korea, but this makes no sense at all,” Kim says, describing how local restaurants have abandoned his products in favour of lower-priced imports. “This market has been taken away from us.”‘Without time, there is no flavour’: a South Korean grand master on the art of the perfect soy sauceRead moreKimchi fromChinasells to restaurants for about 1,700 won ($1.15) per kilogram, while Korean-made versions average about 3,600 won ($2.45), more than double the price.In the first 10 months of this year,South Koreaimported $159m worth of kimchi, almost entirely from China, while exporting $137m.Kimchi, a fermented vegetable dish served with almost every Korean meal, is a cornerstone of food culture on the Korean peninsula. The term covers far more than the spicy cabbage most familiar to international diners.There are more than 150 recognised types, made with radish, cucumber, spring onions and other vegetables, seasoned with blends of chilli powder, garlic, ginger and fermented seafood paste, shaped by local climates and tastes.The fermentation process produces beneficial lactic acid bacteria that contribute to kimchi’s reputation as a health food.Families traditionally prepared large quantities together during kimjang, the annual winter preparation ritual recognised by Unesco as intangible cultural heritage. But how Koreans consume kimchi is changing.Single-person households have more than tripled since 2000, now accounting for more than 36% of all households, and fewer people make kimchi at home.View image in fullscreenKim Chieun overseas kimchi production at his Incheon factory, Dec 2025.Photograph: Raphael RashidInstead, it is increasingly consumed ready-made or while eating out, where kimchi is served free of charge with every Korean meal. Charging for such a staple would be unthinkable.As a result, while overall kimchi consumption has declined, demand for commercially produced kimchi has grown, with producers becoming increasingly dependent on restaurants and large buyers.“If you avoid losses and don’t go bankrupt, that’s already fortunate,” says Kim. “For many of us over the past decade, we haven’t been able to invest in facilities.”‘A food that contains our soul’Market forces mean that price, rather than origin or method, are now the decisive factor.Jeon Eun-hee, who has run a kimchi factory in Hwaseong, 47km from Seoul, for 29 years, abandoned plans for a second facility eight years ago as Chinese imports gained ground, and says he has contemplated closing the business if sales continue to decline.“Should we really be using imported kimchi when this is a food that contains our people’s soul?” he says. “It’s truly heartbreaking.”The pressures have been compounded bythe climate crisis, which is disrupting cabbage farming, the single most important input in kimchi production. Summer cultivation has become increasingly difficult in traditional highland growing areas, with wholesale cabbage prices during peak seasons sometimes more than doubling from one year to the next.Government agencies and producers are developing climate-resistant varieties and improved storage systems, but industry groups question whether such measures can offset the pressures.Around three-quarters of South Korea’s kimchi manufacturers are micro-businesses with four or fewer employees. Most rely on labour-intensive methods that struggle to compete with industrial-scale production inChina.Kim, who also heads the Kimchi Association of Korea, says the industry is trying to respond, albeit with limited tools.The association has introduced a voucher scheme, funded by industry contributions, offering selected restaurants 1,280 won (87c) per kilogram to switch back to Korean-made kimchi.The group has petitioned for kimchi to be subject to advance tariff assessment, a measure that would increase scrutiny of declared import prices.South Korea’s agriculture ministry told the Guardian it aims to “strengthen both domestic and export foundations to build a sustainable growth base for the entire kimchi industry”.Measures include voluntary labelling schemes that let restaurants signal they use Korean kimchi, agricultural support such as weather forecasting and pest control for cabbage growers, and research to extend kimchi’s shelf life for export.For his part, Kim believes quality remains South Korea’s strongest defence.“Korean kimchi has a unique taste,” he says. “That cannot be replicated.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaFoodChinaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was another hour before security opened in the terminal, by which time our flight had departed empty to maintain the airline’s schedules. We were rebooked for the following day.We had to take the train home and pay for a taxi to take us to the airport for a second time early the next morning.We arethus more than £100 out of pocket. The airport tells us it’s notits fault. The airline says the (empty) flight left on time, so it is notits responsibility.Our insurerssay we would be covered for an unforeseen delay in arriving at the airport, such as disruption to our journeythere, but the small print doesn’t allow for thecircumstances we actually found ourselves in.JF,LondonThe previous month,FNand her husband found themselves in a similar predicament at Heathrow. They missed their flight to Istanbul after a botched software upgrade to traffic lights closed the road tunnel to Terminals 2 and 3, causing severe congestion.“We were prevented from using escalators from the tube, then kettled on the packed station forecourt for more than an hour,” she writes.“All this time, the lifts from the platform continued to bring up more passengers, increasing the overcrowding. The public address system was not working, no explanations were given and staff seemed not to have had any relevant training. It was an extremely unpleasant, stressful and somewhat scary experience.”The couple was unable to find a suitable alternative flight so aborted their Turkish mini-break. “Heathrow has rejected our claim for compensation. The dispute resolution service CEDR referred us to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), who told us there is no provision for a case like this,” she says. “We cannot understand how Heathrow can get away with it.”Airlines are subject to strict compensation rules when they are responsible for cancelled or delayed flights – but airports, it seems, are not held to account when technical or service failures ground passengers.Regulation UK261,which entitles travellers to fixed sums, depending on the distance of their flight and the length of a delay, only applies if the airline is responsible directly or indirectly for the disruption.Airlines also take a hit if there is a problem within the airport, since the same rules require them to feed and accommodate stranded passengers and rebook them for free on to a new flight. The CAA confirmed to me that passengers cannot claim costs or compensation from an airport if they are prevented from reaching their departure gate on time. According to Coby Benson, a consumer rights solicitor at Bott and Co, there is a gap in the law. “Unfortunately, these passengers have no recourse against either the airline or the airport,” he says. “Travel insurance can sometimes help, but the terms of those policies are often very restrictive.”A spokesperson for Stansted said affected passengers should claim from their airline or insurer: “While we understand the frustration felt by affected passengers, the incident was beyond our control. Airlines were informed promptly, but decisions on flight departures rest solely with them.”Heathrow was dismissive of FN’s ordeal, despitewidespread media reportsof the chaos andcomplaints by airlinesof management failures. “There was a temporary closure of the tunnel, but this was quickly resolved by our teams,” said a spokesperson. “We had contingencies in place to ensure passenger flow continued, so passengers wouldn’t have been in that area for an hour.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The liver is designed to process the toxins in alcohol and either break them down into usable units or get rid of them. The waste products are then filtered from the blood and excreted in urine or stools.Going for a run or sitting in a sauna after a night of drinking won’t reduce the toxins produced by metabolising alcoholIs it true that … a glass of wine a day is good for your heart?Read moreSweat, on the other hand, has a very different job. Although it can contain extremely small amounts of some metabolic byproducts, its purpose is temperature regulation (and, in some situations, to signal stress or fear). “Sweating is not the means to remove toxins,” says Taylor. “Going for a run or sitting in a sauna after a night of drinking won’t reduce the toxins produced by metabolising alcohol, and it won’t lower your blood alcohol level.”In fact, there is no way to speed up alcohol detoxification. Each person metabolises it at a fairly fixed rate.So why does hitting the gym or sitting in a sauna feel good when you’re hungover? Both activities are known to boost endorphins – the body’s natural “feelgood” chemicals – and to reduce cortisol, which can leave us feeling anxious or on edge. They also improve circulation, relax tight muscles and stimulate the “rest and digest” part of the nervous system, all of which can make recovery feel easier. But this is about managing symptoms, not accelerating detoxification.If you choose to do something to make you sweat when you’re hungover, make hydration a priority, says Taylor. “Alcohol depletes water from the body, and sweating increases fluid loss, raising the risk of dehydration and tissue inflammation.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingIs it true that …FitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A white dome floats in the gloaming above a plain black doorway outlined with red light, like a portal to another dimension.

There are sessions on astrophotography and, on moonless nights, dark sky astronomy with the chance to see “a glittering tapestry of stars, galaxies, nebulae and star clusters”. Its director, Gary Fildes, is a veteran in the field, having founded and led three UK observatories over two decades. The goal at Grizedale, he says, is to create “an immersive, year-round astronomy and science destination that brings the beauty of the Lake District skies to visitors”.View image in fullscreenThe observatory’s regular evenings form part ofCumbria’s annual dark skies festivalin late October and November. The festival offers owl- and bat-spotting walks and chances to swim orcanoe after dark. But the observatory does more than dip a toe in the cosmic lake – it’s a permanent centre for studying the stars. A group of 60 schoolkids is arriving in the morning.I’m here for an Aurora Night, timed to coincide with a period of high solar activity, but the heavens are stubbornly blanketed with cloud. The first drops of rain are falling as we head into Mission Control, with its little cafe tables,hand-painted otherworldly mural, inflatable alien and row of model rockets, built to scale by the observatory’s manager, Ben Marshall, a spaceflight obsessive.View image in fullscreenRobert Bryce Muir’s warrior sculpture in Grizedale Forest.Photograph: Stan Pritchard/AlamyA couple of hours later, we’re all staring up in wonder at a bejewelled night sky with shooting stars – thanks to the centre’s planetarium. An illustrated talk about auroras in the Stargazers’ Lounge combines detailed explanations with a sense of cosmic wonder. In the Meteorite Lab next door, there are microscopes and little space rocks – including actual pieces of the moon and Mars.After hot drinks in Mission Control, Gary leads us through torrential rain to the new cedar-smelling observatory he helped build. He shows us extraordinary photos of the spiralling Andromeda galaxy and the dark Horsehead nebula, silhouetted against a glowing red dust and gas cloud, all taken by the robotic telescope in the retractable custom-built dome. For nights when the weather won’t cooperate, Grizedale gives out a free clear-sky pass so visitors can come back and stargaze another time.For me, astronomy isn’t just about science and telescopes. It’s about people, and realising that we’re all part of something far biggerThe observatory’s team are clearly enthusiasts. Gary has been fascinated by the night sky “ever since I was a kid growing up in Sunderland, standing in the back garden and looking up, wondering what all those stars were”. His life story is remarkable. He tells me: “I was a bricklayer for years, but that curiosity about the universe never really went away. Eventually, I decided to take a massive leap and follow that passion properly – and it changed my life. I builtKielder Observatoryin Northumberland from scratch, thenGrassholme Observatoryin Teesdale, and now I’m working in Saudi Arabia developing the Al-Ula Manara Space Observatory, one of the most exciting astronomy projects in the world.”Gary describes how one observatory visitor wept when she first saw Saturn through a telescope, explaining that her father used to draw planets in a wartime air raid shelter and ringed Saturn was her favourite. “For me, astronomy isn’t just about science and telescopes,” says Gary. “It’s about people. It’s about perspective, wonder, and realising that we’re all part of something far bigger.”View image in fullscreenThe Hawkshead valley looking towards the Old Man of Coniston and Tarn Hows.Photograph: Martin Bache/AlamyNo buses run to Grizedale Forest, but getting here without a car has been surprisingly easy. After an early start from Essex into London, the train up to Oxenholme takes less than three hours, racing past the Chilterns woods and Midlands canals to the cloud-capped Cumbrian fells. The branch line to Windermere is a 20-minute ride through tussocky fields of Herdwick sheep and slate-roofed, whitewashed villages. Finally, bus 505 from outside Windermere station loops round the lake and winds through hilly beech woods to reach the village of Hawkshead by lunchtime.On a nocturnal trip to the loo, up a leaf-covered slope, I see a handful of stars finally winking through a gap in the cloudsThere are various ways of getting from Hawkshead to the observatory, about 3 miles south:by bike,taxior on foot. I decide towalk there over the fells near Esthwaite Waterand back via Hawkshead Moor. There are streams to hop and boggy hills to climb, but the views are worth it. Home to the UK’s firstforest sculpture park, Grizedale has a huge collection of site-specific art. With amap of the walking trails, I follow one waterlogged path to see Andy Goldsworthy’s sinuous dry-stone wall,Taking a Wall for a Walk. Created in 1990, it’s dressed in thick moss and hidden among dense fir trees. There’s no sound other than rushing water and the calls of tiny, pine-loving goldcrests.Forestry England lets out a little cabinnext door to the observatory, and I’m sleeping there tonight. It’s a real log cabin, immaculately clean, with walls of thick pine trunks, tartan wool curtains and furry blankets. Umbrellas stand by the cabin door, on hand for the changeable Cumbrian weather. On a nocturnal trip to the loo, up a leaf-covered slope, I see a handful of stars finally winking through a gap in the clouds.Heading back towards Hawkshead the next day, I find one of Grizedale’s newer works of art.

My room, with its gnarled oak beams and cushioned bay window overlooking the village square, is all dusky rose and moss green, with elegant watercolours and floral fabrics. Downstairs, there’s a log-burner and local real ales in the slate-floored bar, and elegant plates in the dining room (the jalapeño jam alongside my onion bhaji is garnished with a purple pansy).With its choice of pubs and cafes, picnic-ready delis, a well-stocked outdoor shop and a cake-filled honesty stall, fell-ringed Hawkshead is a walkers’ paradise.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Anything I can do to help?” If ever a line was guaranteed to incense the person in charge of cooking for a crowd, it is this one: uttered in seeming innocence by a guest roused by the sound of clattering pans, and who wants to seem polite but in reality hopes the answer is: “No, thank you.” This was drilled out of us from a young age by a mother who firmly believed that those who are serious about helping need not look far to find vegetables to chop or pots to wash up. But for guests who can’t “read” kitchens – or minds, for that matter – there are some principles that might prove helpful at this time of year. And, for hosts who hate delegating, there are a few ways to share the load (and increase the fun) without losing your sanity.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The easiest and perhaps most obvious job at Christmas is to pour drinks: for the principal cook first, and then for others. Not only does popping a cork or shaking a cocktail make a cook feel less like a caterer and more like part of the party, the sound has the effect of drawing in other helpers. “If you make a cocktail and divvy out jobs, even peeling vegetables is fun,” says Wahaca founder andGuardian regular Thomasina Miers, who enlists everyone in preparing for festivities.View image in fullscreenCheers … a glass of wine always helps things go more smoothly.Photograph: Astarot/Getty/iStockphoto“Glass of wine, some music playing – it’s lovely,” saysPassione Vino’sLuca Dusiof hand-making pasta with family and friends. “So long as they get out of the kitchen when I come to make my ragu. Then I donotwant helpers.”Of course, some tasks lend themselves more to communal prep than others, and pasta dough is a great example: anyone can lend a hand in the rolling and stretching stage. For the same reason, the Henderson family often make dumplings on Christmas Eve. “The kids sit around filling the dumplings and making the broth, and they love that,” saysMargot HendersonofRochelle Canteen. “But there are many things about Christmas dinner that lend themselves to group preparation.” As a cook, she shares my mum’s views on the anything-I-can-do? brigade. “It should be obvious!” she says, but experience has taught her that it’s worth “having a big plan in your head, so you have a job to delegate when someone inevitably asks you”. For all the noise that surrounds it, Christmas dinner is a simple meal. “It’s just a big roast,” saysEd Smith, author of several cookbooks including his bestseller on side dishes,On the Side. “And that means the trickiest thing is that the prep is time-consuming.”Peeling and chopping parsnips, potatoes and sprouts, for example: these are easy jobs, but they take time “and should absolutely be delegated, preferably the night before”, Smith says. One of the most foolproof ways to work out what needs to be done and how is to envisage your dinner onChristmasDay – specifically, whether you’re leading or following. “Can I peel those vegetables? Can I lay the table? Suggest a menial task that demonstrates you mean your offer of help, as opposed to platitudes,” my mum says. Likewise, for the lead cook, specificity is key. “Particularly if, like me, you’re a control freak,” Smith says. “Put out all the right tools, cut the first piece at the size you want, and let that be a guide. That way, you’ll spare yourself the horror of discovering that your sister-in-law cuts parsnips into rounds and prefers skin-on roast potatoes.View image in fullscreenShared rituals … involving children in food preparation helps make Christmas a collective effort.Photograph: svetikd/Getty“The assumption is that you can’t delegateandbe a perfectionist,” Miers says. “But I would argue that many Michelin-starred chefs are perfectionists, and that they get there by delegating. You have to delegate with care: show people how you want things done, rather than just saying ‘chop this’, ‘cook that’,” she adds. Yes, it’s more time-consuming at first, but doing so pays dividends in the long term (particularly with young kids). “It’s not just teaching them how to fend for themselves, it’s showing them that the whole family makes Christmas, not just the parents or, in most cases, mum.” It gives young and old alike some ownership over the meal, and it avoids conjuring up that most unwelcome of Christmas spirits, the kitchen martyr, who insists on doing everything only to be exhausted and irritable by dinner.“No one wants a martyr at the table,” Miers agrees – and no one wants kids who think the festival is “just about the presents: the ripping and grabbing”. Involving them in festive preparations is a heartwarming way to counter this tendency, and indeed some of my fondest memories of Christmas as a child are centred on food preparation. I loved making (and sampling) brandy butter with my brothers, decorating the cake on Christmas Eve and even preparing the sprouts, peeling away what I always thought of as their little green bomber jackets. Age-appropriate tasks are key, of course – I was, on reflection, a little young to be “testing” brandy, and handling knives afterwards. “But if you don’t take part in the buildup to Christmas, it’s all over so quickly,” Miers says. “The shared rituals that make Christmas come with decorating and cooking.”To this end, there is merit in giving your helpers some scope for creativity, even if you are something of an autocrat in an apron. Henderson runs a tight ship at home as well as at Rochelle Canteen, but she has also learned that “people aren’t machines. If they don’t feel able to express themselves, they will be miserable.” Just how much leash you allow will depend on the nature of your regime, such as Dusi allowing his kids near his pasta dough, but drawing a firm line at his ragu or broth. It could be as small as letting a kid judge the amount of bacon “blanket” per sausage “pig” – a job that means Miers’ middle daughter is entitled to extra helpings every year – or as big as delegating an entire dish.View image in fullscreenKnives out … the vegetables need prepping.Photograph: David Davies/PA“Most things that are delicious in Christmas dinner are best cooked in the moment,” Smith says. “But there are a few things that can be done in advance.” Cranberry sauce, bread sauce, stuffing, even a slightly fancier vegetable side, though purists will tell you that Christmas dinner has enough going on without the need for such extravagance. “If you’ve room for a side that’s a bit more interesting, a sprout gratin is very good and can be done in advance,” says Smith,who shares such a recipe on his Substack. Another idea, which could stand in for multiple sides, involvespotatoes, chestnuts and parsnips. “It’s a delicious dish that someone can easily do, and it’s just as good the following day,” he says, should leftovers be on the Boxing Day menu.The biggest condition of any offer of help, large or small, however, is that you finish the job. “If you’re washing dishes, put them away,” Henderson says wearily. Ditto dirty dishes in the dishwasher and vegetable peelings in the compost bin. “Cooking is fun, but it’s not just about the end product,” she says. “It’s all the little boring jobs, which are enjoyable when done together, but if they’re not done, it’s just one person cleaning up the mess.” And that, of course, makes for the dreaded martyr.That said, there should be only one person in charge, Dusi insists. Some may resent it, but years of working in restaurants have taught him: “there cannot be too many voices in a kitchen. You may disagree violently with the person leading, but there has to be someone directing the traffic. If you disagree with them when things are stressful, things will go south.” The proverb “too many cooks spoil the broth” is true of professional kitchens and those at home alike. The time to discuss leadership style is after Christmas, when everyone has calmed down, Dusi adds. “The middle of service is not the time to suggest a change of direction.”Inevitably, there will be some cooks who cannot tolerate help; who will combust if someone so much as picks up a spoon, let alone stirs with it. If this is you – or the person whose Christmas you’re at – remember that help does not have to be confined to food. Though chefsItamar SrulovichandSarit Packerare married and the co-founders of a small Middle Eastern restaurant group,Honey & Co, they can’t be in the kitchen together either at home or in any of their restaurants. “All we would do is instruct each other,” Srulovich says. “And that would mess up our business and ruin our marriage as well. So, if Sarit is cooking dinner for friends, she does the whole thing from peeling the carrots to loading the dishwasher. And vice versa.”That doesn’t mean the other half sits on their bum. Srulovich says: “They help with shopping, the cleaning, getting flowers, laying the table – these are not insignificant things. If every time you cook with your partner it ends in a passionate lovemaking session, then go with it. If it ends in friction, avoid. Know thyself and thy relationships, and do whatever works for you. And remember: there are jobs outside the kitchen as well as in it.”If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive Feast in your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFoodFeastChristmas food and drinkChristmasVegetarian food and drinkDessertnewslettersShareReuse this content"

It was just so craven, rolling out the red carpet for Trump. Their next art-activist event unfolded like clockwork.Led By Donkeys made a nine-minute film about Trump’s relationship withJeffrey Epsteinwhich ended: “The president of the United States was a long-time close friend of America’s most notorious child sex trafficker. He’s alleged to be mentioned, numerous times, in the files arising from the investigation into that child sex trafficker … Now that president, Donald Trump, is sleeping here, in Windsor Castle.” (Trump says that he fell out with Epstein years before Epstein was first arrested, andhas consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.)The group had booked rooms in the Harte and Garter hotel, which handily tags them “castle view” and “even more helpfully”, says Ben Stewart, aLed By Donkeysfounder, “castle view superior”. They had a massive 32,000-lumen projector and, for the soundtrack, Stewart went outside and put a Bluetooth speaker, hidden in a box of Kellogg’s Fruit ’n Fibre, on top of a rubbish bin.The world’s media were amassed, staring at the castle, but they were bored because Trump hadn’t yet arrived.This film went everywhere. “Although the still pictures of Epstein and Trump went crazy online,” Stewart says, “I’m not sure that persuades anyone of anything – it just makes Trump uncomfortable. The film we made gives people a social object to share, saying: ‘There’s something really serious to look at here.’ We took a piece of guerrilla journalism about Trump and Epstein, and it was viewed 20m times.”The film started with the Windsor Castle logo. “It requires a little bit of mapping to project on to a cylindrical building,” Stewart says. “So there’s this royal crest of arms. The police are thinking: ‘Ah, that’s nice – the royal family,’ and suddenly a great big picture of Jeffrey Epstein comes up. This electric jolt goes through the fluoro [fluorescent jackets of the police] around me, and the police all pile into the hotel.”It wasn’t the group’s first rodeo, of course; it wasn’t even their first action against Trump. Back in 2018, while working for Greenpeace, Stewartflew a paragliderover the hotel where the president was staying when he visited Turnberry, in South Ayrshire; the next year, Stewart got a visit from the police, who told him that if he tried that again, they couldn’t be responsible for what would happen.But none of the Led By Donkeys creators were especially worried about getting arrested. “All my anxiety is channelled into wanting the action to succeed,” says Oliver Knowles, another co-founder of the group. “By the time the police make the intervention, the die is cast.” Well, sort of – the police moved fast and were in the lobby within three minutes, “really pumped up”, Knowles remembers. “They were in jumpsuits and baseball caps. They’d finally found some protesters. They came roaring up the stairs; they were briefed; they were on a mission to protect the president. Thankfully, no guns. But they were very adrenalised when they came into the room. I had to say to them: ‘Let’s keep this really calm.’”Six minutes is a long time to stall a large number of police officers. They didn’t know what law they were planning to make any arrests under, so that helped. When the police finally got into the room, “one officer started reading a section of the Town and Country Planning Act, which another officer asked him to stop reading because it wasn’t right.” Knowles and three other team members were then arrested for malicious communication, which is a stalking law, “and it’s very specific: it’s designed to deal with a really concerning offence. To throw it at a piece of journalism, projected on to a wall, to protect the reputation of the president, seemed against the spirit of the legislation,” Stewart says archly. While the others were getting arrested, he was melting into the crowd, then soon after was on the train out of Windsor, calling lawyers.Led By Donkeys attacks ‘Orwellian’ arrests after Trump Windsor projectionsRead moreSome time in the middle of the night, when the activists were in the cells of Maidenhead police station, officers came in and arrested them again, this time for public nuisance, having decided that was more likely to succeed in court. When they came to be questioned, the only officers available were from the child protection squad – and the irony of child protection officers questioning Led By Donkeys over the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein because all the regular police were busy protectingDonald Trump… well, it was striking. Knowles and his associates just answered every question: “No comment.” A few minutes into the interview, the officers slid over a photograph: “‘Mr Knowles, did you remove the drawer from this bedside table?’ ‘No comment.’ ‘Mr Knowles, do you know anybody else who may have had reason to remove the drawer?’ ‘No comment.’ I knew what was coming: a picture of a giant projector, ratchet-strapped to four drawers. At that point the detectives were finding it hard to keep a straight face.”Just over a month later, all charges were dropped.Explore more on these topicsLed By Donkeys2025: what happened next?Donald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Witty, unsentimental – and not one to say no to another brandy. At family parties, he’s the one gossiping about the latest scandal to catch up with a local MP, or regaling us with tales of the outrageous philandering of various Sheffield Wednesday players over the past 40 years. He could make anything – a jacket potato, a broken relationship – funny, somehow.We would often spendChristmasmorning with him and his family, before going our separate ways. But, one Christmas, about 10 years ago, when he was supposed to be meeting family abroad, he fell down the stairs, whisky in one hand, suitcase in the other, and broke his ribs. The hospital had patched him up and told him not to fly. So, here he was back with us in Sheffield, making the best of it, but looking increasingly peaky.The morning rolled on but the anecdotes weren’t flowing as they usually were. He was convinced he was OK but he didn’t look it. He tried to make it upstairs for a nap but couldn’t; he tried, gingerly, to eat Christmas lunch, and failed. So, before I’d so much as placed a party hat on my head, my mum and I decided to take him to A&E. We thought about calling an ambulance, but how long would that take on Christmas Day?By the time we got there, he’d gone from peaky to barely responsive. Other outpatients helped us get him to a ward, where the generic smell of hospital food and wind filled the air. It reminded me of previous hospital visits, when my grandad was ill.Different though, was the spirit. There were heroic attempts at festive gaiety everywhere you looked, despite the underlying sterile and miserable mood; tinsel hung from drip stands and bowls of Christmas pudding congealed on bedside tables. Cheerful nurses, who no doubt would far rather have been at home, were bustling about and using that great term of endearment so peculiar to Sheffield: “duck”.When visiting hours were over, we headed home to cold bread sauce and Christmas telly. We watched something daft on television, probably Agatha Christie, and played something even dafter, such as Sheffield’s take on Monopoly, Sheffield Shares. It was already late, and snowing, and I remember feeling deflated – had we missed Christmas?Although our friend eventually recovered, he had actually punctured a lung and went on to get deep vein thrombosis. And, while that Christmas isn’t a personal favourite, it has gone down in family lore as “the Christmas I saved a life”. Whether that’s strictly true, or a little bit of dramatic licence, I couldn’t possibly comment, but its annual retelling certainly hasn’t hurt my ego. And, as our friend always says, “don’t let the truth get in the way of a good story”.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then he physically assaulted both parents.The incident, which happened in the city of Szczecin in north-west Poland, reflects an increasingly hostile atmosphere for Ukrainians in the country, a dramatic turnaround from the mood in 2022. Then, in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion, hundreds of thousands of Polesput on a show of support and hospitality for their neighbours, volunteering at the border and offering up their homes to refugees.Now, that outpouring of goodwill is wearing thin, as the war approaches its fourth anniversary, and surveys show an increasingly negative perception of Ukrainians inPoland, stoked by a political debate that has moved further to the right on migration and the resurfacing of historical grievances.View image in fullscreenA sports hall of Hrubieszow, Poland, that was transformed into an accommodation facility for refugees fleeing Russia’s invasion Ukraine, in March 2022.Photograph: Jakub Orzechowski/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/ReutersThere are about a million Ukrainian refugees in Poland, according to UNHCR statistics from September. Kholkina is not one of them; she is one of nearly half a million Ukrainians in the country who arrived prior to 2022, and has lived in Poland for more than a decade. “I’m more Polish than Ukrainian now … but I never thought someone would lecture me on how to talk to my own family,” she said. Since the assault, she has panic attacks, and has told her daughter to never speak Ukrainian in public.Her experience was extreme – and the attacker ended up being sentenced to 14 months in prison – but the experience of receiving abuse for speaking Ukrainian in public has become widespread.“Things feel more tense now,” said Aliona, a 39-year-old entrepreneur who lives in a small town in western Poland. “Nowadays, when we go out, the kids whisper: ‘Mum, let’s speak Polish now.’ It wasn’t like this before. No one used to comment. Even if they heard my accent, they’d just smile,” she said.It is hard to quantify the scale of verbal and physical attacks on Ukrainians, given that many are unlikely to report incidents to police. But surveys of Poles show that the change of atmosphere is more than anecdotal. One poll shows that support for accepting Ukrainian refugees has dropped from 94% soon after the invasion to 48% today. Another survey shows Polish support forUkrainejoining the EU is down to 35%, from 85% in 2022.“There is an attitude in society that we don’t owe anything to the Ukrainians any more,” said Piotr Buras, of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Warsaw.Many things have combined to bring about this change of feeling. Resentment has been stoked by disinformation and viral videos online. Moreover, the election of rightwing populist Karol Nawrocki as president in June 2025 followed an acrimonious campaign which shifted the whole political debate further to the right. Ukrainians are more often portrayed as ungrateful and hungry for benefits, despite economic data showing they are net contributors to the Polish economy.There have been similar shifts in other European countries. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said he has spoken to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the increase in young Ukrainian men travelling to Germany. “I asked the Ukrainian president to ensure that young men in particular from Ukraine do not come to Germany in large numbers — in increasing numbers — but that they serve their country,” he said. His government is working on a bill that would tighten access to benefits for Ukrainian refugees.In Poland,Nawrocki vetoed a government billin August that would have extended financial support for Ukrainian refugees, and instead proposed his own legislation that made benefits contingent on being in employment. In the end, a compromise bill was adopted.View image in fullscreenThe Polish president, Karol Nawrocki, giving a speech in Warsaw on 11 November.Photograph: Rafał Guz/EPAOleksandr Pestrykov, of the Ukrainian House in Warsaw, said anti-Ukrainian sentiment first appeared online in 2023, with any news article relating to Ukraine on Polish media immediately swamped with negative comments. Some have accused Russian bots of stoking prejudice online, and for a while the online hatred did not seem to make its way into the real world. That, he said, is now changing.“Until summer this year, this negativity rarely left the bounds of the internet; the complaints we would get from Ukrainians would be sporadic, and similar to the situation before the full-scale war. But starting from summer we’ve had a pretty large number of people reporting attacks to us, thankfully so far mostly verbal attacks,” he said.The complicated history between Poland and Ukraine also plays a role, withthe massacre of over 100,000 Polesbetween 1943 and 1945 by Ukrainian nationalists attempting to ensure the Volhynia region did not become part of Poland a frequent talking point. Ukraine has now allowed Poland to exhume the bodies of victims, but work is moving slowly and the topic is an emotive one for many in Poland.“The level of support for Ukraine in 2022 was an anomaly; now we are kind of returning to normal,” said Buras. This historical context is what allows much of Polish society to turn against Ukrainians while still claiming to be firmly anti-Russian. “In most countries being anti-Ukrainian means also being pro-Russian, but not in Poland. Because our relations with Ukraine are laden with history, resentments and disagreements,” he added.A flashpoint came when footage of people waving a wartime nationalist Ukrainian flag during the concert of a Belarusian rapper at a Warsaw stadium went viral. The sighting of the red-and-black flag, which is widespread in Ukraine but considered offensive in Poland, led to clashes in the stadium, and ended up with Poland deporting 63 people, 57 of them Ukrainians. Increasingly, right-wing discourse about the evils of migration has begun to include Ukrainians, whereas in 2022 and 2023 they were usually positively contrasted withnon-European refugees trying to cross into the countryfrom Belarus.Not all Ukrainians in Poland have negative experiences. In asurveyreleased late last year, 58% of Ukrainians said they expected their children to reside in Poland “for many years”. And discrimination is not universally felt, particularly among those who live in bigger cities.Anastasiia Zhelezniak, 39, a child psychologist from the city of Kryvyi Rih, moved to Warsaw with her two children in the summer of 2023, after deciding that her home city, which is subjected to regular Russian attacks, was becoming too scary a place to raise her children. She chose Warsaw because her niece had already moved there.Since then, she has learned Polish through government-sponsored language courses, retrained as a massage therapist and recently opened her own salon in central Warsaw. “Personally, I’ve had nothing but good experiences in Poland,” she said. When her children, now 10 and 15, started school in Warsaw, the teachers and other parents went out of their way to be helpful, she said. “At one parents’ evening, everyone was asking how they could help. It almost brought me to tears,” she said.The only negativity she has experienced has been online. Whenever she opens Facebook or other social media she is bombarded with negative comments about Ukrainians. “I’ve just started not to look any more,” she said.Zhelezniak said that while many of her Ukrainian friends have started to leave, citing the changed atmosphere and increasing cost of living, she now hopes to make a future in Poland. “I think it would be better for my children and give them more opportunities than going back home,” she said.Explore more on these topicsPolandUkraineThe far rightEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other details also remain unclear.Kidnap-for-ransom abductions represent one angle of Nigeria’s multifaceted security crises. Gangs of armed bandits roam the vast countryside in the north, while jihadists operate with external support from surrounding areas in the Sahel. The abundance of non-state actors has left rural areas particularly vulnerable, and Nigeria’s under-equipped security agencies continue to be stretched.The Papiri incident was the second mass abduction in the west African country in a week, and the second in Niger state in four years, after aMay 2021 abductionof 135 pupils from an Islamic seminary. The most high-profile mass abduction remains the infamous 2014 kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in north-east Nigeria, which spurred a global campaign supported by dozens of celebrities including Michelle Obama and Elton John.According to the Lagos-based geopolitical advisory SBM Intelligence, there were at least 4,722 victims of kidnappings across Nigeria between July 2024 and June 2025, with at least 762 people killed and about $1.66m paid as ransom in total.The deteriorating security situation has led to the US president, Donald Trump, to threaten military action in Nigeria. The Trump administration has designated Nigeria as a country of particular concern,citing a “Christian genocide” – a framing that Abuja has repeatedly rejected as being an oversimplification of a complex crisis.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, in an “editor’s note”posted on Xlate that afternoon, the broadcaster’s official account announced that “the lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot’ will air in a future broadcast.”Outrage followed, including from the key correspondent on the planned segment, Sharyn Alfonsi. She had interviewed some of those recently released about the “brutal and torturous” prison conditions. The Paramount Plus website had said on Sunday the segment was scheduled to air at 7.30pm ET that evening.Bari Weiss, controversially appointed editor-in-chief of CBS Newsin Octoberdespite a lack of experience and fears of politicization at the storied TV network, after owner Paramount acquired her conservative startup the Free Press, addressed the issue on Monday morning.She spoke at the company’s morning staff call amid reports that journalists at the news channel werethreateningto quit and as parent company Paramount Skydancetweaked elementsof its offer in the corporate battle to gain control ofWarner BrosDiscovery, which owns news rival CNN alongside its movie and streaming assets.Weiss said: “I held that story and I held it because it wasn’t ready.” She said the story presented “very powerful testimony” of abuse at Cecot but the issues had already been reported and it needed more. However she then said: “We need to be able to make every effort to get the principals on the record and on camera.”This expanded on points made by aCBSNews spokesperson on Sunday that the segment “needed additional reporting” and onreportingby the New York Times that the piece should include interviews with relevant leaders from the Trump administration. Alfonsi had previously said the administration did not provide comment despite multiple requests and invitations from 60 Minutes.Weiss said the public was already aware of what happened at the prison, after theTrump administrationaccused more than 200 Venezuelan migrants in the US of being gang members and sent them to El Salvador without legal due process and on questionable evidence, in a deal with the authorities there to hold them in a notorious prison for terrorism suspects.Weiss’s address to staff on Monday echoed points made by aCBSNews spokesperson on Sunday that the segment “needed additional reporting” and the reporting on pressure to include White House voices.Alfonsi said in a private note to herCBScolleagues on Sunday that the episode “was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”Elsewhere in the note, Alfonsi said her team had requested comment from the White House, the state department, and the Department of Homeland Security. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she said. “We have been promoting this story on social media for days.” She had directed those seeking further comment from her to approach Weiss.Backlash from outside CBS was also swift. Weiss’s appointment had already prompted concern that she would push news coverage to the right. But also that there was corporate politics at work asthe mergerof Paramount with Skydance in July had neededregulatory approvaland now Paramount Skydance’s rival bidto Neflix’sfor Warner Bros Discovery is a deal that also needs approval from Trump administration regulators.“What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson,” the Hawaii US senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, wrote on X, with oblique reference to Donald Trump’s increasingly autocratic agenda andrelated opposition. Schatz added: “This is still America and we don’t enjoy bullshit like this.”Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts saw the shadow of corporate dealmaking.Hesaid in an X postthat it’s a “sad day for 60 Minutes and journalism”, and added that the Trump administration’s involvement in approving Skydance’s $8bn deal to buy Paramount had previewed the decision.The media commentator Kara Swisherpostedon Threads that: “This is entirely to please Trump, who has voiced criticism of 60 Minutes under the new owners, who are the definition of rank amateurs, emphasis on rank.” And she added a reference to Weiss’s push as reported by the New York Times for CBS to interview White House deputy chief of staff and anti-immigration adviser Stephen Miller as part of revising the segment.“This Stephen Miller interview suggestion is idiotic in the context of this story – doing another piece with him later is fine, but to add him here after the administration declines to officially have comment is a suck up gimme,” Swisher wrote.Weiss appealed for newsroom cooperation in her editorial conference comments on Monday.“The only newsroom that I’m interested in running is one where we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters and do so with respect and crucially where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. And anything else is absolutely unacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to you,” she said, according to audiotape from the call.In a highly diffused media environment, 60 Minutes remains a highly watched news program averaging over 8 million viewers weekly in this, its 57th season, and so remains a prized media vehicle for political forces to seek to influence.Accusations of political favor-seeking at Paramount-Skydance, and corresponding staff anxiety at the arrival of Weiss at CBS News, come as accusations of bias in the media have become commonplace.Bob Thompson, media professor at Syracuse University, said many are formed from an older, and perhaps always illusory, aspirational idea of journalistic independence.“So much of what comes in, whether it’s from social media feeds, or from Fox News, CNN, MS Now, is not from that old-school idea of just-the-facts,” he said. “But before we get too nostalgic for the days of Edward R Murrow we should remember that a lot of his best work was in fact advocacy journalism with a heavy dosage of opinion in it.”But the idea that political interests seek spots of high ground in a flooded media plain should hardly come as a surprise.“It’s disturbing and contrary to what we think of as a healthy journalistic establishment – a fourth estate within a Republic – but it’s also such common sense,” Thompson added. “So of course, that’s what those folks are doing. Each one of those power nexuses is trying to secure a significant piece of the action.”Additional reporting by Jeremy BarrExplore more on these topicsCBSTelevision industryUS television industryTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Five others, who confessed and cooperated with the investigation, received reduced sentences of two years and six months, and one was acquitted.“The cruelty with which the four minors were victimised has been proven,” said the presiding judge, Jovanny Suárez, who was joined by two other judges.It remains unclear who exactly killed the boys. The trial focused on the crime of forced disappearance, and the public prosecutor’s office is still pursuing a separate investigation into kidnapping resulting in death.On 8 December last year, Steven Medina, 11, Nehemías Saúl Arboleda, 14, and brothers Josué and Ismael Arroyo, aged 14 and 15, were returning from a football match in Las Malvinas, an impoverished neighbourhood in southern Guayaquil, when they were stopped by air force personnel – who have been deployed on street patrols since Noboa declared a state of “internal armed conflict” two years ago.For more than two weeks, their families hadno news of them, until charred bodies were found on Christmas Eve about 25 miles away.Noboa’s defence minister, Gian Carlo Loffredo, repeatedly denied the involvement of the military and said instead that the youths had been victims of “criminal groups”.‘We are shattered’: Afro-Ecuadorians mourn four boys found dead after encounter with militaryRead moreBut CCTV footage later emerged, capturing the moment the boys were assaulted and forced into vehicles.The case has also been seen as an example of howAfro-Ecuadoriansare particularly vulnerable to human rights violations: after their abduction, the boys were taunted with racist insults and beaten with punches, kicks, and blows from belts and gun barrels.They were stripped naked and abandoned far from home, at a location where one of them managed to call his father to ask for help.By the time the father arrived, however, the boys were no longer there. Their bodies were eventually discovered on Christmas Eve.Forensic examinations concluded that all four had been killed by gunshots at close range to the head and back. Their bodies were then burned and dismembered.The defence teams for the servicemen, including those who confessed to taking part in the abduction and torture, deny that they were responsible for the killings.One of those who confessed, Christian Eduardo A. Q., said during the trial that troops were being sent to patrol the streets without any training to do so.“I never received any training in human rights or operational procedures. I worked in the control towers in Quito as a weather observer and air traffic technician. I should never have been sent out on to the streets. They took untrained personnel, because of staff shortages, and sent us to patrol,” said the soldier.One possible line of investigation is that, after being tortured and abandoned naked miles from home in an unfamiliar area with high crime rates, the four were killed by local criminals.Suárez, the presiding judge ruled: “The abandonment of the minors in a dangerous and desolate place was the cause of the victims’ deaths.”Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

However, in an “editor’s note”posted on X, the broadcaster’s official account announced that “the lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot’ will air in a future broadcast.”ACBSNews spokesperson said in an email that the segment “needed additional reporting”.‘Cemetery of the living dead’: Venezuelans recall 125 days in notorious El Salvador prisonRead moreThe terrorism confinement centre, known as Cecot, is Latin America’s largest prison, with capacity for 40,000 inmates. In March, the Trump administrationstruck a dealwith El Salvador to send there more than 250 Venezuelan migrants that it accused of terrorism and gang membership.Horror stories have since emerged about abuse the migrants are alleged to have endured, with lawyers for some of the men who were later released describing the conditions as“state-sanctioned torture”.On Sunday, CBS removed a link to the “Inside Cecot” segment page. The page, which previously featured a trailer, now displays the message: “The page cannot be found.” A description on its Paramount Plus website earlier said the segment was scheduled to air at 7.30pm ET on Sunday.It was slated to feature correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking to recently released deportees about the “brutal and torturous” conditions they had endured in the prison.An intro to apreview of the episodebegan: “The deportees thought they were headed from the US back to Venezuela, but instead they were shackled, paraded in front of cameras, and delivered to Cecot … where they told 60 Minutes they endured four months of hell.”Alfonsi said in a private note to her CBS colleagues on Sunday that the episode “was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”Elsewhere in the note, Alfonsi said her team had requested comment from the White House, the state department and the Department of Homeland Security. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she said.“We have been promoting this story on social media for days. Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of ‘gold standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet.“I care too much about this broadcast to watch it be dismantled without a fight,” she wrote.CBS News is now under the leadership of Bari Weiss, who was appointed as editor-in-chief of the storied US news networkin Octoberafter its parent company, Paramount, acquired her startup the Free Press.Weiss had seen the segment on Thursday and raised questions about it to its producers, asked for new material to be added, and suggested a new interview with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the rightwing architect of Trump’s anti-immigration policy, the New York Timesreported.The outlet also reported that Weiss questioned the use of the term “migrants” to describe the approximately 252 Venezuelan men who were deported on flights to El Salvador’s Cecot in March and April this year.Weiss’s appointment sparked controversy among some CBS journalists who feared its owners were taking the network in a more conservative direction. Weiss had carved out a name for herself as a heterodox columnist and held no previous experience in broadcasting.Weiss said in a statement: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”The delayed transmission of the segment comes as the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, whose son David runs CBS’s parent company, Paramount Skydance Corp, has launched a hostile bid for Warners-Discovery – a deal that would require regulatory approval from Trump administration regulators.Last week, Trump said that any impression of favorable treatment from the CBS news division was false. “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called “takeover,” than they have ever treated me before,”he posted to Truth Social.“If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”The cancellation of the Cecot investigation segment drew swift criticism and accusations of censorship on social media.“What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson,”the Hawaii senator Brian Schatz wrote on X.“This is still America and we don’t enjoy bullshit like this.”Senator Ed Markey of Massachusettssaid in an X postthat it was a “sad day for 60 Minutes and journalism”, and said that the Trump administration’s involvement in approving Skydance’s $8bn deal to buy Paramount had previewed the decision.“This is entirely to please Trump, who has voiced criticism of 60 Minutes under the new owners, who are the definition of rank amateurs, emphasis on rank,”wrote the media maven Kara Swisher on Threads.“This Stephen Miller interview suggestion is idiotic in the context of this story — doing another piece with him later is fine, but to add him here after the administration declines to officially have comment is a suck up …”Political commentator Krystal Ballwrote: “Bari’s CBS pulled their Cecot report which included interviews with immigrants who were tortured in this concentration camp.

However, as it did with pork, Beijing has reduced or limited the impact of its tariffs several times, including partly sparing the major cognac producers Pernod Ricard, LVMH and Rémy Cointreau after its brandy investigation.China’s ministry of commerce said negotiations over the bloc’s EV tariffs resumed this month. However, the talks were scheduled to end last week and there has been no announcement since.A senior European diplomat in Beijing said last week that major issues remained between the two sides.China imported $589m (£438m) of dairy products covered by the current investigation last year, similar to 2023 values.China’s ministry of commerce said in a statement it had found evidence that EU dairy imports were subsidised and hurting Chinese producers. About 60 companies, including Arla Foods, the owner of brands such as Lurpak and Castello, will pay tariffs between 28.6% and 29.7%.Italy’s Sterilgarda Alimenti SpA will pay the lowest rate of 21.9%, while FrieslandCampina Belgium NV and FrieslandCampina Nederland BV will pay the highest rate of 42.7%.Companies that did not participate in the investigation will pay the highest rate.The decision is likely to be welcomed by Chinese producers who are grappling with a glut of milk and falling prices as declining birthrates and more cost-conscious consumers weigh on demand.China, the world’s third-largest milk producer, urged producers last year to rein in output and reduce the number of older and less productive cows.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryChinaEuropean UnionInternational tradeAsia PacificEuropeTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will have powers to summon officials from the transport ministry, Korea Airports Corporation, Jeju Air and other agencies for hearings and document submission.Police arealready investigatingmultiple current and former transport ministry officials in connection with the disaster.Araibpostponed public hearingsscheduled for 4-5 December. The hearings were meant to present interim findings, but the families calling the planned proceedings a “self-investigation” designed to “downplay and cover up the disaster”.Bird remains found in both engines of crashed Jeju Air jet, report saysRead moreAn interim statement must be released by 29 December underinternational aviation regulationsif a final report is not possible.The investigation has been marked by repeated transparency battles.In July,families disrupteda planned press briefing, claiming they had been briefed that investigators blamed pilot error for mistakenly shutting down a functioning engine following the bird strike.Last month, a planned re-examination of aircraft wreckagewas cancelledafter investigators refused to let families photograph the process.The controversy reflects broader tensions and distrust over how South Korea handles responses to major disasters, including the2022 Itaewon crowd crushand the2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, both marked by families’ struggles for accountability.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In the middle of a busy shopping strip, pedestrians are warned to keep to a 2.83km/h walking speed. In another part of Christchurch, one piece of signage declares simply “don’t”.The baffling boards are not an overzealous new council initiative, but a piece of art designed to “play with the way we take authority and signage so seriously”.Despite resembling official Christchurch city council signs, the “Christchurch city confusion” warnings are the work of artist Cameron Hunt.See you in March? Debate in New Zealand over extremely long summer breakRead more“The idea was to make signs that look official, but with completely absurd messages, therefore creating moments of confusion, followed by little bursts of joy,” Hunt told the Guardian.Hunt erected six signs around the city centre, as part of the Little Street art festival early this month. Each was conceived with a specific location in mind.“Watching people interact with the signs has been awesome,” Hunt said. “There have also been a few grumpy people who’ve joked about writing to the council about these ‘ridiculous signs’.”The council, however, is thrilled.“Hunt’s signs are truly delightful,” said Kiri Jarden, the council’s principal adviser for community arts. “We totally support artists using humour to gently interrupt and engage passersby.”People have been taking photos, sharing them online, and turning the signs into a treasure hunt, Hunt said. In some instances, people have posted their confusion to social media, only to be promptly informed the signs are tongue-in-cheek.One Reddit user posted an image to the site asking if the walking speed limit sign was “for real?”. “I’m naturally a fast walker so a bit concerned,” they wrote, prompting a wave of replies.“Just because it’s a confusing prank how does that constitute art?” one wrote.Another said: “To the person who made and installed this sign: well done, one of the greatest pieces of guerrilla art I’ve ever seen. The fact that somebody even fell for it just makes it so much better.”Hunt hopes his work challenges people stop and notice their surroundings.“Each piece is a small, interactive moment for people, sparking curiosity and conversation in a way that murals or graffiti cannot.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

My anger burns white hot | Jonathan SeidlerRead moreThe 7.30 host asked Frydenberg about hisspeech at the Bondi Pavilion that day, in which he accused Anthony Albanese of allowing Australia “to be radicalised on his watch” and told him to “accept personal responsibility for the death of 15 innocent people, including a 10-year-old child”.Ferguson asked whether the comments amounted to a “personal case against the prime minister” before Frydenberg’s “inevitable” return to politics.“I’m deeply offended by what you’ve just said,” Frydenberg responded. “I’m deeply offended. That is an insult to say that there is any political motivation in this.”Marks said Frydenberg had “previously made comments which sought to lay blame for the horrific attacks directly on the prime minister”.“Sarah’s interview included a question on his potential return to politics which was a legitimate question for a journalist to put to him,” he said.Liberal senator Sarah Henderson said both Ferguson’s question to Frydenberg, and Tingle’s earlier analysis, was “deeply offensive”.“These remarks are absolutely appalling,” Henderson said of Tingle’s comments, as she called on the ABC to “unequivocally apologise”.“The ABC from my perspective has completely lost the plot; it’s unacceptable.”Former ABC board member Joe Gershtold the Australianthat Tingle’s remarks displayed a “profound knowledge gap” unacceptable for a senior journalist.Gersh, who is Jewish, said his community was “generally very proud” of Frydenberg’s “clarity” on anti-semitism.“Sarah Ferguson’s questioning of his motivation was at best insensitive and at worst malicious because she was trying to attribute a motive to what it was that he was saying other than his genuine concern,” he said.Gersh also accused the ABC of being “insensitive to the anti-semitic firestorm which has engulfed Australia.”The Australian reporter James Maddenwrote a separate opinion pieceurging Marks to “step up” and enforce more editorial responsibility, citing “horrendously uninformed and ill-judged commentary from the ABC’s two most senior political journalists.”Marks said it was “understandable at times such as these for the community to search for answers”.“Questions about the role of the media, including the central role of the ABC, in sustaining a cohesive and inclusive society in a responsible manner are vitally important.

But, skimming just below the surface, it was moving differently than a fish would.The creature surfaced and, amazed, the Victorian fisher reached for his phone. Swimming in front of him was a pink platypus.Stylianou regularly fishes in the Gippsland spot, which he is keeping secret to protect the rare animal. He thinks it could be the same one he saw years ago, just older and bigger.“The bill and feet are super obviously pink,” he says. “When he did go a bit further into sunlit areas, he was easy to follow underwater, which is how I got so many videos of him surfacing.”Stylianou had been on his first trout fishing trip of the season in September when he saw the platypus, which he has nicknamed “Pinky”. He watched it feed at the top of the tannin-stained river for about 15 minutes.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“I’ve seen other platypus in the same river system, just regular coloured ones,” he says. “Probably about five to eight of them over the years, from memory. Normally, they just pop up at the top of the water and then disappear once they see me.”After Stylinaou shared footage of the monotreme, commenters online speculated that it could have been a rare albino platypus. But the biologist Jeff Williams says it is just lighter in colour than what most would expect.Many people go their whole lives without seeing a platypus in the wild. We just saw four in one nightRead more“Platypus do vary a lot in colour,” the director of the Australian Platypus Conservancy says. “And this one’s at the extreme end of the light ones. It’s not one that we consider should be added to the list of albino and leucistic ones.”Just as humans have different coloured hair or skin pigment, platypus also come in different variations, Williams says. He said the platypus captured on video was “unusual but not exceptional”.“What I’ve seen and what every other leading platypus person has looked at, it says, is that it’s well within the sort of variation in colour that one would expect,” he says.“Let’s put it this way, it’s cute, but it’s not a breakthrough … We think this is just one of the extreme ends. Every so often, you will get a genetic anomaly that just throws up things, just as it does with some humans, who have more freckles and so on.“It’s somewhat unusual, but it’s nothing to get particularly excited about, we’re afraid.”1:03Sniffer dogs are being trained to track down threatened platypus populations – videoThe platypus is listed as near-threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There has also been adecline in Victorian populations, making them more vulnerable, Williams says.“Platypus were in significant decline up until about the 1990s when all the impact of European settlement on our waterways was becoming apparent,” he says.“We messed up pretty much the flow of every river we’ve got. We cleared native vegetation along most of our waterways, and, not surprisingly, that put a lot of pressure on the platypus population.”Replanting programs along the waterways, and consideration of environmental impacts near rivers, have started to help the population come back.“We’ve still got a way to go, and we can’t be complacent,” Williams says.“But the good news at the moment is most of the survey work that’s being done around the place is suggesting numbers that are coming back, certainly the number of sightings in some places where there was concern.”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaWildlifeFishingBiologyGeneticsAnimalsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Starmer has alsopreviously insistedhe could not see any circumstances where the UK rejoined within his lifetime.However, several pro-European ministers – including Streeting, David Lammy, Peter Kyle, Liz Kendall, Bridget Phillipson – are believed to be among those who would like to see the government go further.It comes as ministers position efforts to “reset” EU relations – after a landmark summit with Brussels earlier this year – among the government’s top priorities for 2026. Last week Labour announced it had agreed terms for theUK to join the Erasmus+EU student exchange programme in 2027.In a report setting out a “business manifesto for the EU reset”, the BCC said the government needed to prioritise its efforts to minimise trade friction for exporters to help boost the UK economy.Quoting frustrated survey respondents, it said firms were finding it increasingly difficult to navigate changes to EU and UK laws since the first post-Brexit trade deal was introduced in 2020.“Since Brexit our export sales have virtually stopped. The TCA has had no impact in recovering any sales into the EU,” said one small manufacturing firm in Greater Manchester.Drawing a link to Labour’s tax-raising budgets, a small retailer in Hampshire said: “Work has stopped coming to [the] UK due to high taxes and no longer being part of the EU. As a result, lots of companies have shut down and thousands of people have lost their jobs and been out of work for over two years.”The BCC said it had made five key proposals for talks with Brussels in 2026. This includes a deal to cut border checks on animal and plant products, finalising linkages between the UK and EU’s emissions trading schemes, establishing a youth mobility scheme, securing full UK participation to SAFE – the EU’s defence fund – and enhancing cooperation on VAT and customs simplification.A government spokesperson said: “This government is removing red tape and trade barriers to support jobs, business, and growth. That’s exactly why we reset our relationship with the EU and are making strong progress in negotiations.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyEuropean UnionEuropeBrexitKeir StarmerForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” the spokesperson said.Russian Telegram channels with links to the security services reported that Sarvarov’s car exploded while driving along Yaseneva Street in Moscow at about 7am on Monday, killing the driver inside. According to reports, the vehicle had travelled several metres before the blast went off.Sarvarov, who oversees combat training and readiness for Russia’s armed forces in the war inUkraine, has extensive experience in the Kremlin’s post-Soviet wars. He took part in both Chechen wars and later played a role in organising Russia’s 2015–16 military intervention in Syria.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, described Sarvarov’s death as a “terrible murder”. Other officials and prominent pro-war voices have called for swift retribution for the attack – the third bombing in Moscow in the past year to claim the life of a senior Russian officer linked to the invasion.“We need to identify and eliminate the entire chain of those who carried out the operation. I don’t think they should be taken prisoner at all – they should simply be destroyed on the spot, as is done with terrorists,” Andrey Kolesnik, a member of the Duma’s defence committee, was quoted as saying by the news site Lenta.ru.Starshe Eddy, a popular pro-war blogger, called for Moscow to assassinate Ukrainian officials inside the country.“Only the destruction of targets on the enemy’s territory can first disrupt the wave of terrorism and then significantly reduce it, giving our security services breathing space and making their work easier. These targets, of course, include the enemy’s military and political figures,” he wrote on Telegram.Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack.Ukrainian intelligence agencies have targeted dozens of Russian military officers and Russian-installed officials since the start of the war, accusing them of involvement in war crimes. Little is known about the clandestine Ukrainian resistance cells believed to be behind assassinations and attacks on military infrastructure inside Russia and in Russian-controlled territories.Last December, Kyiv claimed responsibility for theassassination of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, the head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, who was killed by a bomb concealed in an electric scooter outside his apartment building, a day after Ukraine levelled criminal charges against him. His assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the attack.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appeared in September to signal that further attacks on senior Russian military figures could follow, warning that they “have to know where their bomb shelters are”, and adding: “If they do not stop the war, they will need it in any case.”Ukraine’s continued targeting of senior Russian military figures has underscored failures within Russia’s security services. Vladimir Putin last year described the killing of Kirillov as a “major blunder” by the country’s security agencies, saying they should learn from it and improve their effectiveness.It is unclear whether the high-profile killing of Sarvarov will have any impact on the peace talks, as Ukrainian and US officials are holding discussions in Florida aimed at ending the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.Late on Monday, Zelenskyy told reporters that initial drafts of US proposals for a peace deal met many of Kyiv’s demands, saying: “Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage. There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either.”Russia is holding separate talks with the US in Florida, which are expected to continue on Monday.Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump’s appointed special representative for Ukraine and Russia, criticised Ukraine’s killing of Russian generals last year, saying such actions could violate the rules of warfare.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In an interview over the weekend, the health secretary strayed from the official government line to call for “a deeper trading relationship” with the EU.Speaking to the Observer, Streeting implied that joining a customs union with Europe would give Labour a distinctive message with which to take onNigel Farageat the next general election.To many Westminster observers, the obvious point is that, like Starmer’s intervention in 2018, Streeting’s remarks align him with the Labour members and voters who overwhelmingly support stronger ties withEurope.Polling by YouGov published this weekend suggested that 80% of those who backedLabourin 2024 support negotiating a customs union deal with the EU. Seventy-three per cent backed talks to rejoin the EU entirely.Most intriguingly, however, Streeting’s remarks speak to a growing section of Labour MPs – including some senior cabinet ministers – who lament the government’s promised “reset” of EU relations as decidedly unambitious and who believe that going further could be a gamechanger for economic growth.What MPs and ministers have been telling journalists privately for months is increasingly said openly. Before Streeting, David Lammy, the deputy prime minister,suggested that rejoining a customs union with Europe would be desirableand had been beneficial to countries such as Turkey.No 10 has repeatedly ruled this out on the basis that it would rip up the UK’s independently negotiated free trade deals. During theirdisastrous attempt to flush out a Streeting-led couplast month, Starmer’s allies briefed journalists that anyone who replaced him would take a more pro-EU approach and jeopardise international relationships, including with Donald Trump.But recent developments in Britain’s trading relationship with the US, which is unarguably the highest-profile benefit of having an independent trading policy, call the advantages into question. The US hassuspended a much-vaunted “tech prosperity deal”over wider disagreements. And as for a deal to avoid threatened US tariffs on pharma,only the headline termshave been agreed so far.Most importantly, the free trade deal the UK agreed with the US in May – which puts 10% baseline tariffs on British exports, lower than the 15% on European exports – as well as deals with India and other powers may be a publicity win, but they have been deemed to have a negligible impact on economic growth. One senior business figure called them “performative”.All this means that the political imperatives and the economic realities point to one thing. As the parliament slowly trundles on towards the next election and Starmer’s critics circle, the pull of promising to rejoin the customs union will become harder and harder to resist.Prospective leadership contenders, backbench MPs across different factions and Labour’s core voters are all calling for more. Starmer’s No 10 is clear that its manifesto “red lines” ruling out a return to the customs union, single market or freedom of movement – language that already seems hopelessly outdated to some Labour MPs – only apply until the next election.“Hopefully we’ll be in a position to go into the next election saying, look, we have done all we can within the confines of what we inherited,” one minister told the Guardian. “But if we want to push on, then some sort of commercial union with our neighbours may be the next place to go.”Perhaps the biggest practical obstacle, and one that government figures point to in private, is the difficulty of negotiating with Brussels and the high prices it seeks to exact for any concessions.Talks for UK defence companies to play a larger role in the EU’s Safe fundcollapsed over money last month, after strong resistance from France. Negotiations in other areas of the UK-EU relationship including a food standards dealonly began weeks ago, a full six months after Starmer’s summit with Ursula von der Leyen, because of delays in the EU obtaining its mandate. And the two sides remain far apart inyouth mobility talks, with Brussels demanding an uncapped scheme and lower fees for European students studying at British universities.The bottom line is, amid the growing clamour to go further and faster, the government faces an uphill battle just to secure the limited things it has already promised.Explore more on these topicsBrexitLabourKeir StarmerWes StreetingTrade policyEuropean UnionForeign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Customer data was safe, it said, but mail distribution, including parcels, had been slowed.French media reported that customers wanting to send last-minute parcels or collect items from post offices were being turned away. The postal service sorts and delivers more than 2m items in the immediate run-up to Christmas.The group’s banking service, La Banque Postale, said on social media that the incident was “affecting access to online banking and to the mobile app”. Card payments at in-store point-of-sale terminals were still functioning, as were ATMs, it said.Online payments also remained possible but had to be authenticated via text message, it said. “Our teams are mobilised to resolve the situation quickly,” the bank said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the suspected attack.The BPCE group, which includes the Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne banks, also experienced an IT malfunction on Monday morning but it was resolved by midday, the company said.The incident came a week after the French government was targeted by a cyber-attack that disrupted the interior ministry, which is responsible for national security. A 22-year-old suspect had been detained in relation to that incident, French media said.The interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, said the suspected hacker had extracted several dozen sensitive files and obtained access to data relating to police records and wanted persons. He blamed “imprudence” at the ministry for the incident.Anonymous hackers boasted of having gained access to nearly 70m confidential data records from various police files in a data breach that they claimed affected 16.4 million French citizens whose details were recorded in numerous state databases.Denmark says Russia was behind two ‘destructive and disruptive’ cyber-attacksRead morePrivate companies including the mobile operator SFR and DIY chain Leroy Merlin have also been the victims of attacks in recent weeks.Prosecutors said last week that France’s counterespionage agency was investigating a suspected cyber-attack plot involving software that would have allowed remote users to control the computer systems of an international passenger ferry.A Latvian crew member is in custody facing charges of having acted for an unidentified foreign power, officials said. France and other European allies of Ukraine allege that Russia is waging “hybrid warfare” against them, including cyber-attacks.Explore more on these topicsFranceHackingInternetEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A Chega spokesperson said Ventura would respond later.Ricardo Sá Fernandes, the lawyer representing the Roma associations that filed the complaint, said the decision would help make Portugal “more just and decent”, calling it “a victory for the resistance” of the Roma.In May, Portuguese prosecutors opened an investigation into discriminatory remarks against Roma made by Ventura.Recent opinion polls place Ventura, who is campaigning mostly on a promise to fight corruption, among the frontrunners in the first round of the presidential election on 18 January.Polls also indicate he would lose to any of his three main rivals in a runoff vote.Explore more on these topicsPortugalRoma, Gypsies and TravellersRaceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He can say something and he can do something about this and meet with the solicitors or family members of the hunger strikers and he can show a bit of humanity.”I’m on hunger strike in a British prison. This is why | Amu GibRead moreReferring to the Irish republican hunger strike during the Troubles that culminated in the death of Bobby Sands and nine others, she added: “We should not repeat the hunger strike of 1981, and we should not have to look at things in retrospect and wonder how things went so wrong when we have an opportunity to fix it now.”Alam, 33, a pharmacist, said that the family were told on Monday that Ahmed was discharged late on Sunday night “but we haven’t received any phone call from him, so we don’t know how he’s doing or why he went in the first place”.A repeated complaint of relatives and friends has been that they have not received updates when the prisoners are hospitalised.Zuhrah is believed to still be in hospital afteran ambulance arrived at HMP Bronzefield on Wednesday afternoon. Protesters gathered overnight on Tuesday accusing prison staff of refusing to allow her transfer to emergency care.Her designated next of kin, her friend Ella Moulsdale, 21, said last week: “Imagine … someone you love and not knowing if they’re alive … I have no confirmation that she was inside that ambulance, that she is being treated in the hospital.”View image in fullscreenAmu Gib.Composite: Prisoners for PalestineFrancesca Nadin, of Prisoners forPalestine, said: “Unlike the British government, the hunger strikers cannot take a Christmas holiday, as they continue to be locked up in prison cells, suffering immensely away from their families. Their lives are in grave danger and they may die at any moment. We have been forced to threaten the government with legal action to get justice for the prisoners, and will not stop until we achieve that.”The legal letter, sent by Imran Khan and Partners, said the claimants had a “legitimate expectation” from official policy documents “that the proposed defendant would convene a review meeting of individuals ‘most likely to bring about the resolution of the situation’, including ‘those suggested by the individual’ refusing food, to ‘address the reasons for their refusal’”.It called for a reply by 2pm on Tuesday “given the urgency of the situation in respect of our clients’ deteriorating health”.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said on Monday: “We strongly refute these claims. We want these prisoners to accept support and get better, and we will not create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes.”All the hunger strikers are in prison awaiting trial charged with offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage during protest actions.The Guardian view on the Palestine Action hunger strikers: the government is trying to ignore this protest | EditorialRead moreThey will have served more than a year in jail before standing trial. The other current hunger strikers are Heba Muraisi, 31, who is on day 50,Teuta Hoxha, 29, who is on day 44, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day, because he has diabetes, and is on day 16.Alam said: “I can’t really get the words together to [describe] how I feel because how do you put into words what it means when your baby brother is on a knife’s edge?”There is understood to be concern in government about the condition of the prisoners, but also extreme caution about setting a precedent even to facilitate a meeting with Lammy, given the number of prisoners who are forced to spend lengthy periods on remand because of the court backlog.Officials have been told to give regular updates, including on how the prisoners can be persuaded to change their minds and be given support to do so.But sources at the Ministry of Justice said there were very limited powers for the department to do more in terms of legal recourse or medical help that was not already being offered. Deaths in custody from hunger strikes were very rare, officials said, and most ended their strikes voluntarily.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionProtestPrisons and probationPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDavid LammyUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Once built on, they are gone forever, and Sport England’s statutory consultee role is an important line of defence. Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher.”The letter adds: “This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer.”About 10,000 playing fields were sold off in the 80s and 90s before protections were introduced in 1996 and 2001. Sport England’s figures also show it protected more than 1,000 playing fields in 2021-2022.However that looks set to change, unless a public consultation that runs to 13 January is able to persuade the government to change its mind.Fields in Trust, which put together the letter, has found that almost half of Britain already lives more than a 10-minute walk from a playing field, with the poorest areas continuing to lose most green spaces to development or closure.Scott, the Fields in Trust president, urged the government to listen to the warnings from across sport.“Too many communities risk losing these very spaces,” she said. “The playing fields where children first learn to play, the parks where families spend Sunday afternoons, the pitches for weekend kickabouts between friends. I wouldn’t be where I am today without that green space in Sunderland, where I spent countless hours as a kid, and every child deserves that same chance.“I urge the government to listen carefully. We’re not asking for the impossible. We’re asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.”The government has been approached for comment. This month a spokesperson said: “There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.Sport England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSport EnglandSport politicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The contract between the Post Office and Horizon, which was marked “Commercial in Confidence”, saidFujitsuwas liable for penalty payments of £100-£150 per faulty transaction with the Horizon IT system.There have been more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal, which involved operators being wrongfully prosecuted due to the faulty Horizon computer system. The system showed erroneous shortfalls on accounts, which the Post Office then demanded operators cover on penalty of suspension and prosecution.The contract, which was found on the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry’s website, says: “If the reconciliation service identifies that any transaction data held on the ‘central database’ located at the data centre is found to be inconsistent when compared to the records of the transaction that was completed at the branch … the reconciliation service shall obtain authorisation from the Post Office prior to amending the centrally held transaction data.”Paul Marshall, a senior barrister for post office operators, told the BBC: “The Post Office conducted both the criminal trials of postmasters and the group litigation of 2019 on the basis that it knew of no substantial problems with the Horizon system.“Yet this shows that in 2006 there was a very big, recognised problem with Horizon maintaining data integrity between Post Office branch offices and Fujitsu.“The Post Office, for 20 years, was saying the only explanation for shortfalls in branch accounts was postmaster incompetence or dishonesty.”Lee Castleton, a post office operator who was wrongly accused of false accounting and went to court in 2006, told Channel 4 News the revelation made his “physically sick”.He said: “Really, you’ve got a group of people in two companies that wrote a contract for something that they’ve said repeatedly was never required. And it’s just sickening for all the distress and victimisation of the group, of all of our group. They’ve had this document in their possession that they’ve never revealed.”When asked whether it would have made a difference to his case if it had been disclosed at the opening of the legal action against him, he said: “Of course, absolutely, because this makes it a completely different question. We’re now talking about accounts that can be adjusted remotely, but also a contract in place for how that should be done.”He added: “You know, 13 people potentially have taken their lives because of the treatment at the hands of these companies. It’s disgusting to think that even now, two decades on, we’re finding new documents, new documents that are intrinsic to what was going on. You know, it’s absolutely abhorrent. It’s disgusting.”A Post Office spokesperson said: “We apologise unequivocally for the hurt and suffering which Post Office caused to so many people during the Horizon IT scandal.“Today, our organisation is focused on working transparently with the ongoing public inquiry, paying full and fair financial redress to those impacted, and establishing a meaningful restorative justice programme, all of which are important elements of the ongoing transformation of Post Office.”A Fujitsu spokesperson said: “These matters are the subject of forensic investigation by the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry and it’s not appropriate for us to comment while that process is ongoing.”Explore more on these topicsPost Office Horizon scandalPost OfficeFujitsuSoftwarenewsShareReuse this content"

There was the sound of a lot of water.“I opened the back door to see why we were tilting and realised it was not raining at all and it was the water running away under the boat. I jumped on the back and stepped off, and that bit was going down at that second. The back went eight foot in the air and I landed on my front.”Wood moored his boat, which he has lived on for eight years, on Sunday night. He said he watched it go down nose-first on Monday morning, and that his neighbour got out just in time before his craft went down backwards.Other people in the vicinity thought they were caught up in an earthquake when the collapse began, and there were fears that water would flood into the nearby town of Whitchurch inShropshire.There are no reported casualties and people were being assisted by the fire service, according to West Mercia police.View image in fullscreenThe scene near Whitchurch, Shropshire.Photograph: Andy Kelvin/PAShropshire fire and rescue service said it had received reports of a canal bank collapse at about 4.22am, with large volumes of water escaping into surrounding land. “Three boats had been caught in a developing sinkhole approximately 50 metres by 50 metres in size and crews helped more than 10 members of the public to safety,” it said in a statement.“Firefighters have been working in challenging conditions with unstable ground and rapidly moving water. Crews immediately established upstream and downstream safety sectors and began mitigating water flow using barge boards and water gate systems.”Scott Hurford, the fire service area manager, said about 12 residents from boats moored nearby were being supported and relocated to a welfare centre at the former Whitchurch police station.He added: “A major incident was declared at 5.17am. However, as of 8.30am, the situation was stable with water flow reduced and there is no ongoing search and rescue activity.”The breach took place on the Llangollen canal near New Mills Lift Bridge in Whitchurch. The canal was among those flagged this year by the Inland Waterways Association as being an “amber risk”.The independent charity has mapped Britain’s network of canals and rivers, which are under strain from funding shortfalls and growing climate pressures, and flaggedthose at particular financial and environmental risk.Areas of concern included the Midlands, where higher-ground reservoirs feed several canal systems and where droughts are expected to worsen.The Canal and River Trust, a charity that maintains 2,000 miles of historic canals and rivers in England and Wales, said it was investigating the cause of Monday’s incident and working with agencies to restore water levels on either side of the breach as soon as possible.At the scene, Sho Abdul, a member of the Shropshire county council cabinet, told theShropshire Starnewspaper: “There are three or four canal boats that have been impacted by the sinkhole, which rapidly happened. The lack of casualties is an absolute miracle.“We were so shocked when we saw it. It’s an absolute crater, it’s devastating, especially for the people who use this area often.”Explore more on these topicsShropshireRiversEnglandWater transportnewsShareReuse this content"

What do we know about the activists and their demands?Who are the activists on hunger strike?Qesser Zuhrah, 20, andAmu Gib, 30, who are being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, were the first two prisoners to go on hunger strike on 2 November. They were joined the following day by Heba Muraisi, 31, who is at HMP New Hall. The group also includesTeuta Hoxha, 29, Kamran Ahmed, 28, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day because he has diabetes.Earlier in December, Jon Cink and Umer Khalid ended their 41-day and 13-day hunger strikes for health reasons, Prisoners For Palestine said. The pair were admitted to hospital and have since been discharged back to prison.Cink, Khalid, Chiaramello and Gib are accused of breaking into RAF Brize Norton in June, where it is alleged that two military jets were damaged. They are not due to stand trial until 2027.Zuhrah, Muraisi, Hoxha and Ahmed are accused of playing roles in the break-in at the Israeli-linked defence firm Elbit systems in 2024. They are due to go on trial in May next year at the earliest.They deny the charges.What are their demands?They include immediate bail, ending the ban on Palestine Action and stopping restrictions on their communications. The activists have also called for Elbit to be shut down.Lawyers representing the group havecriticised David Lammy, the deputy prime minister and justice secretary, for refusing to meet them, claiming he had failed to comply with the Ministry of Justice’s own policy on handling hunger strikes.How has the government responded?Keir Starmer has previously said “rules and procedures” were being followed after he faced questions in the Commons about why his ministers had refused to meet with representatives of those striking.The prisons minister, James Timpson, said the service was “very experienced” at dealing with hunger strikes and has “robust and working” systems in place. He added that the Prison Service would “not be meeting” any prisoners or their representatives.The Commons leader, Alan Campbell, has said the government was“not trying to break the bodies”of the protesters.How are they being treated by the prison service?The Prison Service cannot force feed a prisoner who refuses food or fluids.But the representatives of some of the hunger strikers have alleged a lack of, or late, medical observations or treatment in some instances. It was claimed that an ambulance was called for Zuhrah only after she spent a night asking to be taken to the hospital. It was also alleged that her vital signs had been taken only intermittently and she had received inadequate electrolytes since returning from hospital, reportedly because of HMP Bronzefield running out.In response to the claims, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson previously said: “Prisoners’ wellbeing is continually assessed, and appropriate action is taken, including hospital treatment where required. His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has assured ministers that all cases of prisoner food refusal are being managed in accordance with the relevant policy, and with appropriate medical assessment and support – consistent with prisoner rights.”A HMP Bronzefield spokesperson added: “Any prisoner refusing food receives regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, as well as being offered mental health support.”How serious are the health risks?Seven prisoners have been taken to hospital since starting their hunger strikes. Five have been admitted more than once.Dr James Smith, an emergency physician and lecturer at University College London, who is in contact with some of the activists and their families, told a press conference on Thursday that some of the hunger strikers were slowly dying.“After approximately three weeks, the body has exhausted fat stores and begins to break down muscle and organ tissue in order to generate enough energy simply to maintain essential bodily functions,” he said. “Thereafter, there is a risk that grows with every passing day of sudden, severe and unpredictable bodily dysfunction.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump, a Republican, has sought to dismantle the CFPB since returning to office in January and has installed Russell Vought, his budget director, as the acting head of the agency. While efforts to fire most of its employees are tied up in litigation, Vought has effectively halted most CFPB activities.The agency, which is tasked with protecting consumers in the financial sector, began operations in 2011 under Barack Obama after the 2008 financial crisis. It has since returned more than $21bn improperly taken from consumers, its supporters say.It receives its funding directly from the Fed, unlike federal agencies for which Congress appropriates money annually. Last month, the CFPB under Vought’s leadership said it could not request more money from the Fed because the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 requires that funding come from the central bank’s “combined earnings”.Since the Fed had been operating at a loss since 2022, theTrump administrationsaid no earnings were available. The CFPB in a 10 November court filing said it expected its funds would run out in early 2026. States led by California, Colorado, New Jersey, New York and Oregon said in Monday’s lawsuit that denying funding would prevent the CFPB from meeting a legal obligation to provide them with consumer complaints.They said the administration’s actions also violate the constitution’s principle of separation of powers, since Congress created the agency and the process by which it is funded. A federal employees’ union and several non-profits are seeking in two separate lawsuits in Washington DC and California to similarly force the CFPB to resume requesting funding.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpFederal ReserveDemocratsConsumer rightsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Redding police went into the water, broke the car windows, pulled the victim out and gave them CPR, but they did not survive.Weather tracker: Further flood watches issued across CaliforniaRead more“[The] city is very concerned about rain Tuesday to Friday having bigger impacts [than] what we experienced last night … Today is a good day to prepare, as we know more rain is coming,” Littauwrote on Facebook.Meanwhile, thePineapple Express– a nickname for a strong atmospheric river that originates in the tropical Pacific – is forecast to drive storms up and down the state this week, bringing with it drenching rains, high winds and the risk of more flooding.Southern California could faceits biggest Christmas stormin years, with heavy rainfall due to hit the region beginning on Tuesday. Between then and Saturday, forecasters expect 4 to 8 inches (10cm to 20cm) along coastal areas and between eight and 12 inches in the foothills, KTLAreportedon Monday.It has already been a wet winter for states in the western US. An unusually strong atmospheric river system in December has broughtdeadly flooding,breached leveesand power outages across Oregon and Washington.And this week’s storms come a month afteran autumn stormin late November dumped 5.5 inches of rain on Los Angeles, making it the wettest November in decades. Top of mind for many, back in November and now, is the risk of mudslides and heavy debris flow in the burn-scarred areas where the Eaton and Palisades fires ravaged neighborhoods and hillsides at the beginning of the year.Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles announced a flash flood warning for the region beginning on Tuesday and is urging people to use caution while traveling for the upcoming holiday. The city is also deploying staff with the Los Angeles homeless services authority (Lahsa) to get supplies and hotel vouchers to those living outside.“Los Angeles City personnel are preparing for the storm this holiday week. First responders, public works crews, and utility personnel are ready to respond to potential impacts due to the weather,” Bass said in a statement on Monday. “Angelenos planning to travel to spend time with family and loved ones this holiday week should use caution on the roads, plan ahead, and stay informed.Atmospheric rivers generally form in tropical regions, where warm temperatures can cause water vapor to rise into the atmosphere, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Powerful atmospheric rivers can transport extraordinary amounts of moisture.

Netflix slipped 0.8%.Paramount said it was attempting to tackle WBD’s “amorphous need” for financial flexibility, and bluntly denied the Netflix offer was superior.Unlike Netflix, which has agreed to buy only the movie studios, HBO and HBO Max from WBD, Paramount has bid for the entire company – which also includes CNN, Cartoon Network and the Discovery channel. But WBD’s board directors concluded its bid was “inadequate”, with “significant” risks and costs.David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, and son of Larry, said: “Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD. Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders.“Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice. We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”The Ellisons have faced questions over how they are funding the bid, after a regulatory filing revealed it was backed by outside funders including Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund; and the Qatar Investment Authority. Last week Kushner’s Affinity Partnersstepped back from the process.The financier Gerry Cardinale, whose RedBird Capital firm is an investor in Paramount and involved in its bid for WBD,told CNBCon Monday: “What we’ve done in this amended filing is we’ve cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer.”Cardinale tried to appeal directly to WBD’s investors, rather than its board of directors, which rejected Paramount’s offer last week – having already chosen Netflix after a private bidding process.“At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn’t own it. [WBD CEO] David Zaslav doesn’t own this company,” said Cardinale. “This should be a lot more simple than it is. It’s very simple.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessWarner BrosnewsShareReuse this content"

Industry leaders say thousands of farms will still go bust this year.While the US president has vowed to increase domestic farm production, and even claimed this formed a “big part” of his plan to lower grocery prices for Americans, many US farmers are grappling with mounting financial issues – compounded by Trump’s agenda.Grain farmers, in particular, have been hit by trade disruptions caused by tariff hikes, and $11bn of the US Department of Agriculture’sFarmer Bridge Assistance Programwill go to row-crop farmers. Trump’s trade war with China has hit soya bean farmers the hardest, as China bought 54% of US soya bean exports last year, according to the American Soybean Association.Table of US soybean exportsBut the one-time payments do little to assuage the financial stressors that row-crop farmers have faced for the past three years because of rising input costs and lower crop prices. This year alone, US crop farmers have lost $34.6bn, before crop insurance and other government support, according tothe American Farm Bureau. Neither row-crop, nor specialty producers, who raise fruits and vegetables, made money in 2025, and the 2026 outlooks are bleak.While federal aid was welcomed, Dan Wright, president of the Arkansas Farm Bureau, said it fell short of what is needed. He said: “A program that provides roughly $50 an acre will not save the thousands of family farms that will go bankrupt before the end of the year.”The US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, framed the package as short-term support, as the Trump administration works on creating trade and farm safety nets.Tariffsmonies will fund bridge-loan program.Farmers have been hit by Trump’s trade war with China in both of his presidential terms. According toReuters, the first time Trump was in the White House, the administration paid out $23bn to help farmers affected by simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing. In 2025, farmers are expected to receive $40bn in economic and disaster aid.Farmers are not the only ones under pressure. The tractor makerJohn Deere saidit expects a pre-tax tariff hit of about $1.2bn in fiscal 2026, compared with nearly $600m in 2025.Earlier this year the US and China found their way to a tentative trade truce, with China agreeing to buy at least 12m metric tons of US soya beans. Whether it fully complies with the pledge remains to be seen.Over the next several weeks, farmers will meet with their bankers for loans to buy seed, fertilizer and other inputs for spring planting. Many are likely to carry over debt from operating loans taken out last year. Agricultural credit conditions have fallen for crop farmers, according to theKansas City Federal Reserve Bank, and weaker farm income has reduced farmer liquidity, and increased financing demand.Jeff Rutledge has raised corn, soya beans and rice in north-east Arkansas for 30 years, with his father and grandfather. Farmers try to rotate between crops, but futures prices – agreed rates for assets to be bought at a later date – will also influence his spring planting decisions. Currently, corn and rice prices are down compared with last year, and soya bean prices are up slightly.Next year will be the second straight year that Rutledge will look to plant the crops that will lose him the least amount of money. “It’s just almost a repeat of last year, only with worse conditions,” he said. His farm hasn’t been profitable since 2021’s harvest.Farmers may seek to plant more soya beans in 2026, even though export demand for that crop is lower, and it’s less profitable than corn, according to Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at StoneX. Soya beans are cheaper to plant, require fewer inputs, and generally require less care than corn.For those carrying over debt from previous years, planting soya beans is “something that banks might pressure farmers to do in some areas of the country”, said Suderman.Farm bankruptcies are likely to top 1,000 this year, with Arkansas hit harder than any other state: well above 2019’s peak of 599 filings, but below the peak during the 1980s farm crisis of almost 6,000 in 1987. While farmers are under financial stress, Suderman doesn’t expect a repeat of the 1980s farm crisis.Chart of family farm bankruptiesAlthough China has been a big importer of US agriculture goods, for the past 20 years the country has sought to reduce its dependence on the US for soya beans by sourcing the legume from Brazil and other countries, Suderman said. “President Trump may have sped up the end of that cycle, but they were on that move anyway.”Part of the new safety net promised by the administration may be an increase in biofuels under the Renewable Fuels Standard. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce an increase in the total renewable fuel requirements for 2026 and 2027.The key piece to the new rules will be biomass-based diesel production blending requirements. Farmers are expecting a significant increase in production under the new guidelines, which could help offset some of the export market losses.The farm economy outlook is pessimistic going into 2026, but Suderman suggested that it could change dramatically if China turns back to US agricultural exports – and the EPA pushes for more domestic biofuel production.If those two events happen, “then I think that we could start healing the ag economy and move [in] a positive direction toward recovery”, he said.Explore more on these topicsBusinessFarmingTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

AstraZeneca, Shell and Unilever were least likely to post about Pride at all from 2023 to 2025.“A tally of social media posts does not reflect the breadth of our approach,” HSBC said in a statement.View image in fullscreenHSBC says it is ‘committed to inclusion for all our colleagues and customers’.Photograph: Chris Helgren/ReutersOur analysis of the top 10 US companies – as of 1 December – revealed a similar trend. A total of 39 “Pride” posts could be found on the main customer-facing Facebook, Instagram and X accounts belonging to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Eli Lilly, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla in 2023. In 2024, the total fell 46% to 21 posts. In 2025, the number came in at 18, representing a 54% decline.The most likely US brand to post about Pride was Apple. It was the only company to buck the declining trend, with its post count rising by 22% between 2023 and 2025.The least likely companies to post about Pride included Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom and Tesla.Simon Blake, chief executive of LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, said “in a world in which LGBT people are feeling less safe and less welcome in lots of places” it was in the best interest of companies to send “clear signals” of support. However, he added how businesses were “showing up on a day-to-day basis” was a better indicator of commitment to inclusion than social media trends.“I absolutely want to ensure that it’s about walking the walk every single day of the year, rather than making a logo rainbow coloured during Pride month,” Blake said. “However, I do also think it’s important that we make sure we reflect flags and other things because it does send the signal.”He added that such messaging tells LGBTQ+ people “you’re welcome here, we want you to thrive, we want you to have all of the opportunities everybody else has”.Blake said he was optimistic about companies’ commitment to inclusion, with corporations continuing to sponsor Pride events and “a refocused energy” within company Pride networks. “I am in meetings every single week where you have very senior people being very clear that they are continuing to invest and to support LGBT inclusion in the workplace,” he said.But speaking of the political climate, he said: “Is the environment more hostile for people? Yes. Is there a global rollback of LGBT rights which we’re seeing in all sorts of places? Yes. Is the UK immune to it? Absolutely not.”View image in fullscreenPosts about Pride among the UK’s 10 biggest companies fell 92% from 2023 to 2025.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesPaul Sesay, the founder of the Inclusive Top 50 UK Employers, National Diversity Awards andElevate 1000, set up to link young people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with employers, said his research indicated that if companies reduced diversity budgets, it had an outsize effect on corporate LGBTQ+ networks because their data showed they had been the most numerous and best funded.“We hold roundtables and speak to our members all the time, and some DEI budgets have been significantly reduced in recent months,” he said.“However lots of people in companies tell me they feel DEI needed a reset to a certain degree, to simplify it and go back to basics – that it got too politicised, rather than concentrating on what it actually means: equality for everybody within an organisation.”Podcaster and workplace culture expert Bruce Daisley, a former vice-president of Twitter EMEA and YouTube UK, said: “Some organisations have maintained initiatives, but they’re just trying to do them in a lower-key way. All of it is in a context whereTrump has created fear about organisations endorsing these things.“For the groups who are nominally meant to be the beneficiaries of these things it could demonstrate the old adage – ‘a principle is only a principle if it costs you money’. A lot of people within the LGBTQ+ community, like the trans community, are finding it a difficult time.”Daisley said that the visibility of “toxic replies” and “extreme rightwing” views on X, formerly Twitter, since Elon Musk bought the platform could also deter companies from being vocal on social media.The Guardian approached all of the companies featured in the analysis for comment. Arm Holdings said “inclusion has always been at the heart of our culture and values” and that its social media presence reflected a “broad set of conversations”. Rio Tinto said diversity was “very important” to its business, and it supported staff in participating in Pride events in Brisbane, Perth, Montreal and London.A GSK spokesperson: said:“We are committed to building an inclusive culture that values different perspectives and experiences. This includes our continuing support for Pride in the UK and in many countries where we operate through social media, partnership initiatives and at Pride events.”A HSBC UK spokesperson said: “We are committed to inclusion for all our colleagues and customers and celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ community in many ways, including through an active Pride network, ambassador and mentoring programmes and as a signatory of Conduct for Business.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Its visitor centre in Kentucky will also stay open.Jim Beam is owned by the Japanese drinks group Suntory GlobalSpirits, which employs more than 6,000 people around the world, with more than 1,000 people across its sites in Kentucky.Known for itscelebrated single malt whiskies, Suntory’s brands also include Haku vodka and Sipsmith gin, as well as soft drinks Orangina and Lucozade. It acquired the US maker of Jim Beam in 2014 for $16bn, securing its status as one of the world’s biggest spirits makers.In September, itschief executive, Takeshi Niinami, resigned from the companyafter police raided his home as part of an investigation into suspected illegal supplements.Niinami, who has denied any wrongdoing, had joined Suntory in 2014, becoming the first executive from outside the founding family, after 12 years as chief executive of theconvenience storechain Lawson.Trump’s tariffs have cast a shadow of uncertainty across the spirits industry this year. In March, some Canadian provinces pulled American spirits from stores as a retaliatory move against US tariffs on Canadian goods. Since then some provinces have resumed buying American alcohol.In the UK, whisky distillers are subject to a 10% tariff on goods exported to the US. The ScotchWhiskyAssociation has estimated that it costs the sector £4m a week.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industrySpiritsTrump tariffsWhiskyKentuckyTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The kind that could light up a quarter and then spend the next three undoing it. Now, they’re a wagon.After beating the Broncos on Sunday, the Jaguars have ripped off six straight wins. They’ve won 11 regular-season games for the first time since 2007. And with two winnable games to close the season, they have a solid path to the No 1 seed, with the AFC potentially running through Jacksonville.NFL round-up: Steelers outlast Lions as late penalty negates Goff’s winning TDRead moreIt’s some turnaround. It was only a couple of months back that Jacksonville contrived to gag away a commanding lead in Houston, sliding to 5-4 and losing four of five. In most Jaguars seasons, that’s the moment where the floor drops out. The murmuring starts. Then the leaking, the in-fighting, the familiar sense of drift. You know how this goes. If there is one unifying thread of Jaguars Football, it’s that their best teams find fresh ways to disappoint.But this is not an ordinary Jaguars season. Instead of folding, they hardened. A shrewd trade and a well-timed bye week gave the Jags a chance to pause. After adding receiver Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline, Liam Coen, the first-year head coach, was able to recalibrate his offense. He doubled down on the team’s power-run game, leaned into Meyers’ reliability, and allowed Trevor Lawrence to play his more natural style – tossing the ball downfield and taking off with his legs.With a re-worked offense and stifling defense, the Jags dismantled the Chargers, albeit while seeing a healthy dose of Trey Lance at quarterback. Then they settled down and hammered the league’s dregs: the Cardinals, Titans, Riley Leonard-led Colts and tanktastic Jets.Notching wins against the AFC’s lower-half is one thing. But Sunday was different. Behind a poised performance from Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars walked into Denver and dismantled one of the league’s best teams, emerging with a 34-20 win that rattled the Broncos and the wider playoff picture.Lawrence was the constant. He completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards, threw three touchdowns, ran for another and rarely looked erratic against a defense built to make quarterbacks uncomfortable. A week earlier, he had shredded the Jets with the best performance of his career. But lighting up the hapless Jets is easy to dismiss. Doing it in Denver, on this stage, is more telling about where Lawrence and the Jags are at.This was not a blowout from the outset. Denver matched Jacksonville punch for punch through the first half and into the third quarter, tying the game at 17-17.The pivot came on the Jaguars’ opening drive after halftime. Two penalties did the damage. First, a roughing-the-passer call for bodyweight on Lawrence flipped the field position. Then, in the end zone, Jahdae Barron was flagged for pass interference while trying to recover against Parker Washington. The noise rose. Lawrence quieted it by jogging untouched into the end zone for a 24-17 lead.From there, the Broncos never regained their footing. There was no second-half sorcery from Bo Nix, no late surge to rescue the afternoon. Denver went three-and-out. Jacksonville scored again. A botched handoff between Nix and Jaleel McLaughlin produced the Broncos’ first turnover, which the Jaguars converted into a field goal. When Nix forced a sideline throw late in the fourth quarter, Jarrian Jones intercepted it and effectively closed the game.Coen was brought to Jacksonville to unlock Lawrence’s potential. He was the prince that was promised, the No 1 overall pick with oodles of potential. The early returns for the pairing were rough. There was an obvious tension. Coen’s choreographed, stick-to-the-bleeping-scheme style did not mesh with Lawrence’s freewheelin’ ways. The Jaguars struggled to get lined up. They struggled to get snaps off. They committed more penalties than any other offense in the league. Once the ball was in play, the passing game was hamstrung by drops, Brian Thomas Jr’s regression and an inability to figure out what to do with Travis Hunter. Despite the big-name firepower, Coen had built his unit around a run-oriented offensive line and tight end Brenton Strange. It wasn’t the flame-thrower attack envisaged when one of the league’s top offensive minds was partnered with Lawrence’s untapped potentialNow, those early teething issues are gone. Meyers has brought a sense of reliability. He does all the dirty work of a receiver: blocking, attacking the middle of the field, creating space for others and making tough, combat catches. Since acquiring Meyers, theJags are 8th in EPA/Playand fifth in dropback success rate. Sometimes, having a receiver who knows where to be and catch the ball is all that’s needed.And Lawrence has gone supernova. In his last four games, he has 13 touchdowns to zero turnovers. He’s been encouraged to use his legs more and is making impossible-looking throws with regularity.Trevor Lawrence: Good at football.#JAXvsDENon FOXpic.twitter.com/OxryY1Nr4r— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars)December 21, 2025There is something else, too. There is order to his game – control. Even at his best, Lawrence has always played with a degree of chaos. He makes the difficult stuff look easy, and the easy stuff look hard. But in a tight system with reliable pass-catchers, he’s discovered his mojo. He’s peppering the intermediate area of the field, a place he has struggled throughout his career, and rarely putting the ball in harm’s way.Pair the remade offense with a defense that feasts on turnovers, and the Jaguars suddenly have the look of a legitimate contender.The win moves Jacksonville to 11-4, with games still to come against the Philip Rivers-led Colts and the Titans. The idea of the conference’s playoff road running through Jacksonville is no longer a punchline.MVP of the weekJustin Herbert, QB, Chargers.Sunday offered a nice reminder of what Herbert looks like when he’s not under constant siege. Despite rolling out their 12th offensive line variation of the season, the Chargers limited the Cowboys to a 39% pressure rate, which says as much about the Cowboys’ pass-rush as anything else. But for a quarterback who has routinely been pressured on well over half of his dropbacks, it must have felt like an easy day’s work for Herbert. It certainly looked so. Even with a fractured right hand, Herbert torched Dallas, completing 23 of 29 pass attempts for 300 yards and two touchdowns in a 34-17 win. He added another 42 yards and a score with his feet.Video of the week“Chaos.” That’s how Aaron Rodgers described the bonkers end of Steelers-Lions, which resulted in Pittsburgh pulling out a 29-24 win on the road.A wild way to end Week 16's late slatepic.twitter.com/UiDrdxYhzp— NFL (@NFL)December 22, 2025Driving to win the game, the Lions moved the ball down to the Steelers’ goalline. They scored a sure-to-be walk-off touchdown with 25 seconds remaining before it was pulled back for an Offensive Pass Interference call. Then Detroit missed three shots at the endzone, leaving a fourth down for the game – and potentially their season. Jared Goff hit Amon Ra St Brown short of the end zone, who was pushed backwards before pitching the ball back to his quarterback at the eight-yard line. Goff scooped up the pitch and dove across the plane for the game-winning score. But the play wasagaincalled back for OPI, wiping off the touchdown and ending the game, though not before the head official offered his best WWE impression,teasing the Detroit crowd that they had won. “I was a part of a game 13 years ago that had this kind of chaos,” Rodgers said post-game. “There were some replacement referees, though.”Stat of the weekAnd now for the throw of the year:CALEB WILLIAMS TO DJ MOOREBEARS WINpic.twitter.com/3ShtuowNYm— NFL (@NFL)December 21, 202559.6 yards.That’s how far Caleb Williams’ walk-off touchdown strike to DJ Moore travelled in the air. Saturday night’s finale was a classic. The Bears again stared down a late deficit and again found a way, outlasting the Green Bay Packersto win 22-16 in overtime. Six times now they have trailed inside the final two minutes of regulation, and six times they have walked away with a win, more than any team has managed in a single season since the merger. This time, they needed to recover an onside kick (only the second recovery this season), a blown Packers coverage, and a laser from Williams to get the job done.Football is better when the Packers v Bears rivalry is alive and healthy. And there is a good chance that we will see a third matchup in the Wildcard Round.Elsewhere around the leagueThe playoffs are taking shape. Five teams have now clinched: the Seahawks, Bears, Eagles, Rams and 49ers. In the AFC, only the Broncos and Patriots have clinched, with seven spots still up for grabs.After Thursday’s disappointing collapse to the Seahawks, the Rams fired special teams coach Chase Blackburn. Special teams have played a part in three of the Rams’ four losses this season, with consistent breakdowns in the kicking game and on returns. It’s the first in-season coaching change Sean McVay has made in his career. “We’ve been focused on that left return, field return, all week,” Seahawks returner Rashard Shaheed said after his touchdown that sparked Seattle’s comeback. “We knew that they had a weak point with their special teams and we were able to circle the punt team and make a big play.” The Rams are first in offensive and defensive DVOA through 16 weeks, but sit 30th in special teams DVOA. You cannot ignore one phase of the game and expect to win close playoff games.The streak, stubborn as ever, rolls on. The Steelers won their ninth game of the season in Detroit, meaning Mike Tomlin has secured his 19th successive winning season as a coach. With questions about Tomlin’s future growing louder – even “Fire Tomlin” chants at home – he continues to answer the only way he ever has: by winning.The NFL willinvestigate a confrontationbetween Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf and a Detroit fan. Metcalf appeared to punch a Lions fan after exchanging words near the endzone. Metcalf told former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson that the fancalled Metcalf a racial slurand abused his mother. “My words don’t matter because it was on camera,” the fan told theDetroit Free Press. When asked his name, the fan said, “My name is ‘BiggestDetroit LionsFan Ever that got attacked by DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf. “What, my full name isn’t is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf,” he said. “He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt.”If you wanted a reminder about the greatness of Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs served one up in a blowout defeat to the Titans. With Mahomes lost for the season, the Chiefs looked unprepared and disorganized, losing 26-9 to one of the worst teams in the league. The Chiefs lost backup quarterback Gardner Minshew to an ACL injury in the first quarter, forcing former undrafted quarterback Chris Oladokun into action. But despite Oladokun minimizing errors, the Chiefs looked lifeless on offense. Next up, a Christmas Day game against the Broncos. Gather the family around!The Buccaneers’ season is on the brink. After losing to the Panthers 23-20, Carolina now has sole possession of the division lead in the NFC South. The two will face each other again in a couple of weeks in a game that could decide the division and their playoff hopes. But the Bucs are in freefall. They’ve lost six of their last seven and look devoid of ideas about how to turn the season around.Explore more on these topicsNFLJacksonville JaguarsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hearing will be held by the commissioner or his designee.Earlier Monday, the fan denied allegations he used a racial slur in a statement released by his lawyers.A law firm representing Ryan Kennedy said in a statement released to the Associated Press on Monday that Kennedy “categorically denies” using a slur or any other derogatory statement during the exchange with Metcalf that ended with the two-time Pro Bowler taking a swing at Kennedy with his right arm.DK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fanpic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS)December 21, 2025CBS cameras caught Metcalf and Kennedy – wearing a blue wig and a blue and black shirt – in a heated back-and-forth along the rail in the second quarter of Pittsburgh’s 29-24 victory.Kennedy leaned over the railing and appeared to shout at the receiver as he walked over, and Metcalf reached up and grabbed him with his right arm. The interaction ended with Metcalf jabbing toward the fan’s head with that arm, though he didn’t appear to make much, if any, contact.Metcalf remained in the game, finishing with four catches for 42 yards.Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said on Sunday that he “heard about” the exchange but didn’t see it and at that point hadn’t had an opportunity to discuss it with Metcalf, who was unavailable to reporters afterward and did not appear at his locker on Monday during the club’s 45-minute media availability.FormerNFLwide receiver Chad Ochocinco said during a podcast he co-hosts with Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe that Metcalf told him the fan used a racial slur and disparaged Metcalf’s mother.The statement released by Shawn Head and Sean Murphy of Head Murphy Law Firm called the allegations “completely false”.“At no point before, during or after the incident did Mr. Kennedy use racial slurs or hate speech of any kind,” the statement read. “The claims suggesting otherwise are untrue and not supported by video evidence, eyewitness accounts or any contemporaneous reporting.”The statement said Kennedy would have no further comment because “this matter will now likely be the subject of formal legal proceedings”.The statement added that Kennedy, who told the Detroit Free Press he is from Pinckney, Michigan, about an hour west of Ford Field, has been subjected to “harassment, threats and messages advocating violence” in the aftermath.Kennedy told the newspaper that Metcalf ripped his shirt during the incident. Kennedy also told the Free Press that he was calling Metcalf by his given name, DeKaylin.The incident is hardly the first between a professional athlete and a fan during a live sporting event.The exchange between Metcalf and the fan came five months after Pittsburgh Pirates relief pitcher Dennis Santana was suspended and fined by Major League Baseball following a confrontation with a fan at a game between the Pirates and the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, which is a block down from Ford Field.The most notorious incident between players and fans came in 2004 when several members of the Indiana Pacers – including guard Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace) – fought fans inside the now-demolished Palace in a game between the Pacers and the Detroit Pistons in what is known universally as “The Malice at the Palace”.Explore more on these topicsNFLDetroit LionsPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old was helped off in considerable pain and MRI scans confirmed Liverpool’s initial fears of a serious problem.The club have not placed a timescale on Isak’s recovery but the £125m striker had an operation on Monday and will be out for several months.The extent of the injury is a devastating blow for Isak, who has endured a difficult start to his Liverpool career beset by fitness issues. He had to play catch-up at the start of the season for Arne Slot’s team after missing the majority of pre-season at Newcastle having effectively downed tools to force through an eventual British record transfer to Anfield. The Sweden international was then ruled out for almost a month with a groin injury suffered against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League.Isak’s goal against Spurs was only his second in the Premier League for Liverpool and his third in total and his first courtesy of an assist from Florian Wirtz, a combination Slot had hoped would elevate the reigning champions this season. There is surprise at Liverpool that Van de Ven’s challenge went unpunished by the referee, John Brooks, and the video assistant referee, Stuart Attwell, in a game in which Spurs had Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero sent off.With Mohamed Salah away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt and Cody Gakpo also out injured, Slot’s attacking options are stretched as a consequence of Isak’s injury. The forward is the second of Liverpool’s summer recruits to suffer a serious injury and long-term layoff. Young defender Giovanni Leoni is out for the remainder of the season having sustained an ACL injury on his debut against Southampton in the Carabao Cup in September.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Clubs in Fiba-affiliated domestic leagues around Europe could qualify for the new league through theBasketballChampions League or an end-of-year tournament.The league calendar would avoid conflicting with domestic and international schedules to permit players to fulfill all their commitments over the course of a season, the NBA noted in a news release.Valuations for the permanent franchises could exceed $1bn, according to CNBC, which reported that bankers from JPMorgan and the Raine Group have met with at least 70 potential investors.“Our conversations with various stakeholders in Europe have reinforced our belief that an enormous opportunity exists around the creation of a new league on the continent,” commissioner Adam Silver said in the NBA’s release.“Together with Fiba, we look forward to engaging prospective clubs and ownership groups that share our vision for the game’s potential in Europe.“The NBA and Fiba publicized in March their plan to jointly explore creating the league. Monday’s announcement included a promise to fund the development of European basketball at the pro, academy and grassroots levels.“Advancing further this joint NBA-Fiba project is great news for the European basketball community,” Fiba secretary general Andreas Zagklis said.“The format of the league respects European sport model principles by offering any ambitious club in the continent a fair pathway to the top. The project is conceived in a way that will improve the sustainability of the entire European basketball ecosystem, including players, clubs, leagues and national federations, by generating a knock-on effect that will strongly benefit basketball fans throughout Europe.”The NBA said more updates are expected to follow in the coming months. The league intends to receive nonbinding ownership bids in January and hold a vote to green-light the league at the board of governors meeting in March, according to CNBC.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It looked as if Paul was trying to say “Wow!” as the severity of impact registered in his scrambled brain.Pinned in a corner of the ring midway through the sixth round, Paul could no longer run or cling to Joshua’s legs like a forlorn little boy as the gravity of boxing enveloped him. Instead, as he tried to absorb the punch that broke his jaw in two separate places, Paul was lost in his utterly stunned moment.Jake Paul’s artless spectacle robbed boxing of its democratic dream | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreSo this is how it feels, and looks, to be hit hard by a real boxer, an Olympic gold medallist and former world heavyweight champion. Wow is the word.It was the fourth time that the former YouTuber had been knocked down but the consequences of a proper punch meant Paul would not be able to rise to his feet and waggle his tongue defiantly at Joshua before the referee waved the charade over. As blood began to leak from his mouth, and a numbing throb spread through his jawbone, Paul finally understood how hard, exhausting and dangerous boxing is at a decent level of professionalism.Joshua, it should be stressed, was not impressive amid the bedlam. After his hollow victory he made a throat-slitting gesture that hinted at a clinical and deadly execution when, in reality, Joshua had cut a frustrated figure for most of the contest. Rather than glowering with menace, or exhibiting an iron certainty, Joshua had seemed tentative and crude for nearly five rounds. He struggled to catch Paul and landed under a third of his blows – missing 98 of the 146 punches he threw.Paul’s lack of conditioning, which is a basic essential in elite boxing, shaped the outcome. Without the gas to flee any longer, and reduced to slipping to the canvas as often as he could for a breather, Paul was rendered helpless by fatigue. Joshua applied the brutal finish but, until then, he had seemed a mournful shadow of the fighter he had been in 2017 when, in a great fight, hewithstood the ferocity of Wladimir Klitschkoto force a memorable stoppage.View image in fullscreenJake Paul goads Anthony Joshua during their bout.Photograph: JC Ruiz/PA“It wasn’t the best performance,” Joshua admitted on Friday night. “The end goal was to get Jake Paul, pin him down and hurt him. That has been the request, and that’s what was on my mind. It took a bit longer than expected, but the right hand finally found the destination.”Jake Paul v Anthony Joshua: boxing, influencers and spectacle collide in Miami – in picturesRead moreJoshua praised Paul’s courage but he added an excuse for his own stilted showing. “He came up against a real fighter tonight that’s had a 15-month layoff,” Joshua said as he referenced how he had beencrushed by Daniel Duboisin his previous fight, in September 2024. “We shook off the cobwebs, and I can’t wait to roll into 2026.”In the press conference afterwards a jovial Joshuatried out a woeful imitation of Tyson Furyas he called for a scrap against his currently retired domestic rival. Joshua will get his wish and he and Fury will share the ring next year; but that bout comes far too late in their careers. Both Joshua and Fury are on the far side of the hill and, in contrast, the most interesting heavyweights in the world are Oleksandr Usyk and Moses Itauma.Usyk remainsthe undoubted king of the division, having beaten both Joshua and Fury twice,while Itauma is a rising force. The young British heavyweight, who turns 21 later this month, would probably have needed fewer than half the number of rounds that Joshua required to knock Paul into a suitably wowed stupor.The sorry spectacle was summed up far more effectively by the man closest to the farce. Christopher Young, the referee, brought Joshua and Paul together near the end of an abject fourth round. “The fans didn’t pay to see this crap,” Young snapped at both men.View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua celebrates but his performance was far from impressive.Photograph: Leonardo Fernandez/Getty ImagesBut the public gets what the public wants and that certainly means more pitiful celebrity contests. Paul seemed genuinely proud and cocky to have had his jaw broken by a sledgehammer right. In the early hours of Saturday morninghe posted an X-ray, with the two fractures highlighted in red, and wrote: “Double broken jaw. Give me Canelo in 10 days.”That jokey reference to Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez, a far greater fighter than Joshua but a similarly faded force, showed that Paul’s comic chutzpah remains undented. It might not be Canelo but Paul will soon find someone else with whom he can make north of $50m, as he and Joshua both did in Miami.While he was being interviewed in the ring, before leaving for hospital, Paul spat a tracer of blood on to the canvas. It was another bleak summary of the night as Paul mangled blunt truth with blood-flecked bullshit and said: “I think my jaw is broken. It’s definitely broke. A nice little ass-whipping from one of the best to ever do it. I love this shit and I’m going to come back and keep on winning.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was a battle of wits but there was only going to be one winner. Jiménez stuttered, moved towards the ball at a leisurely pace, waited for Nottingham Forest’s goalkeeper to move left and then set Fulham on the path to a vital victory by sending a clinical penalty into the opposite corner.This was Jiménez in his element. The Mexican is not the quickest striker around but the 34-year-old is still one of the game’s sharpest thinkers. Few, after all, can match Jiménez for accuracy from the spot. He is calmness personified in those situations and, remarkably, is now joint top with Yaya Touré when it comes to players with a 100% conversion rate from penalty kicks in the history of thePremier League.Fulham 1-0 Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreThis was Jiménez’s 11th conversion out of 11 – Dimitar Berbatov, the former Manchester United and Fulham striker, is next best on nine from nine – and it was enough to pull Fulham10 points clear of the bottom three. “In that moment he was cold,” Fulham’s manager, Marco Silva, said. “He’s a great penalty taker. He is not at his best but the last four games at home he scored twice and both goals gave us wins.”Silva was honest enough to admit that his side were not exactly flowing with confidence on the ball. ForFulham, though, it was one of those occasions when the result mattered far more than treating Craven Cottage to an evening of thrilling football. Silva’s options were limited by the absence of several key players and he was entitled to be pleased with how Fulham battled to their second consecutive win, nullifying Forest and denying Sean Dyche’s side the chance to increase their five-point lead over 18th placed West Ham.There was plenty of huff and puff from Forest but they did not play with enough attacking intent and never looked like scoring. Their passing was pedestrian and they did not do enough to disturb Fulham’s outstanding centre-backs, Joachim Andersen and Jorge Cuenca.“It was a low-level game quality wise,” Dyche said. “We started well and had a couple of decent chances. Second half we had more control but didn’t really penetrate. It’s hard to break teams down when they camp in. We shouldn’t be losing that game.”Dyche did not bother complaining about a poor game being decided by Anthony Taylor, the referee, penalising Douglas Luiz for tripping Kevin just before half-time. Forest deserved nothing. Their creative players all disappointed and they fizzled out after a couple of early efforts from Igor Jesus raised false hope.View image in fullscreenDouglas Luiz fouls Kevin to concede the penalty which proved decisive.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersFulham, whose small squad has been stretched by Calvin Bassey, Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze participating in the Africa Cup of Nations, shaded it. Kevin was lively on the left, running at Nicolò Savona and delivering dangerous crosses. Sasa Lukic shot narrowly wide. Jiménez also went close, meeting Antonee Robinson’s cross with a header that flew into the side netting.Fulham were pressing as half-time approached. Five minutes were added on, partly because of Kevin needing treatment on an earlier head injury, and the winger took advantage. The 22-year-old darted into the area from the left, drawing defenders towards him, and was sent tumbling when Douglas Luiz caught him. It was a foolish tackle from a player of his experience. The Brazilian pleaded innocence but it was a clear foul and Jiménez punished him by sending John Victor the wrong way.Forest had to wake up. They had a chance at the start of the second half, Igor Jesus lobbing over. Neco Williams threatened next, recording Forest’s first shot on target when he tested Bernd Leno from 20 yards.Fulham, sinking back, invited pressure. Unable to keep the ball, they asked for trouble. Forest, though, could not create anything clear. Murillo and Morgan Gibbs-White were overly optimistic when trying to score from improbable distances. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Omari Hutchinson were ineffective on the flanks. Kenny Tete bullied Hudson-Odoi.Alexander Isak set to miss several months of season after Liverpool confirm fractured ankleRead moreForest were blunt. Yet Fulham were passive. Silva sensed the shift. It was not a surprise when he altered the flow by introducing Tom Cairney’s perceptive passing in midfield. Cairney gave Fulham more balance with the ball. Driving forward, he almost made it 2-0 in the 72nd minute. It took a fine save from John Victor to push the midfielder’s shot wide.Forest slipped away. Dyche responded – Taiwo Awoniyi, Nicolás Domínguez and James McAtee coming on – but Fulham held firm and were the more threatening side during the closing stages.It was a night to forget for Forest. They remain in peril and know their away form must improve if they are to stay up. They had no answer for Jiménez’s cool.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That is the question. Aston Villa’s winning streak continued against Manchester United, but so did the nagging doubts. They were the lesser team by several measures – fewer shots (12-15), less possession (43-57), fewer big chances (2-3). As usual, the victory was a slender one. But games are not won by stats. They are won by solid teamwork, shrewd management and individual talent – and Villa have all three. Morgan Rogers may be their only star, but he’s delivering like Father Christmas. Unai Emery is wily, battle-hardened, five years ahead of Ruben Amorim. If Rogers profited from Leny Yoro’s naivety, that was probably because Emery had spotted that Yoro is not a right-back, and told Rogers to start wide, cut in and torment him. Talent and management, working together.Tim de LisleMatch report:Aston Villa 2-1 Manchester United2Amorim continues to fall shortWhen Manchester United beat Brighton 4-2 on 25 October, their fans began to believe again. They had won three league games in a row for the first time under Ruben Amorim. They had risen to fourth. And the wins were all good ones – over Brighton (one of their many bogey teams), Liverpool (away!) and Sunderland (at home, against a promoted club, but still – a comfortable clean sheet). Senne Lammens was reassuring, Bryan Mbeumo was exciting andFrank Ilettwas looking forward to a haircut. But then United went back to black. Eight games, two wins, six missed opportunities. At Villa Park they were the better team without ever looking like winning. Yes, Matheus Cunha scored a good goal, but he also missed a sitter. Yes, United were unlucky with injuries (to Kobbie Mainoo, then Bruno Fernandes), but they conceded soft goals. After 13 months in England, Amorim still hasn’t worked out how to win.TdL3Below-par Gunners get on their grindIt was an 8pm kick-off on the Saturday before Christmas but a distinct lack of quality in the final third made fora sobering evening at Hill Dickinson Stadium. For Everton, the issue came as no surprise with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye absent, and Jack Grealish unable to spark an entire team on his own. In many respects it is remarkable that David Moyes’s side sat fifth in the table two weeks earlier given they have played the entire season without a decent striker. For Arsenal and Mikel Arteta, while he savoured a deserved win and a return to the top of the table, the flaw should be equally concerning given their designs on the Premier League title. Arteta insisted that winning margins will inevitably become bigger with hard work and perseverance. But it is a little early in the season for a team that can start with Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard, while leaving Eberechi Eze, Ethan Nwaneri and Noni Madueke on the bench, to be relying on grinding out wins.Andy HunterMatch report:Everton 0-1 Arsenal4Guardiola’s festive City investigationsOn Christmas Day Pep Guardiola will monitor the scales to ensure his Manchester City players have not overdone the festive fare. After Saturday’s win against West Ham, he said: “Tomorrow training – the players asked to take a day off and I said: ‘No, because you didn’t play good enough.’ So recovery, train the guys that didn’t play, and after three days off, then two days to prepare for Nottingham Forest. Yesterday they were weighed and every player made their best weight. They come back on the 25th and I will be [monitoring] how many kilos come up – if they come [back] fatty. Imagine one player arrives with three kilos more. He will [stay] in Manchester, not travel to Nottingham.” Guardiola clarified how the side can improve. “I’m good at reading what happens in the game, where are the spaces – if the players were in these positions, we could create more.” Guardiola will also enjoy a rest: “I have holidays with the family and champagne. Sunday I’m going to Barcelona – I recommend it, the food is top.”Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester City 3-0 West HamView image in fullscreenPep Guardiola said his Manchester City team did not play well enough in their 3-0 win against West Ham.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters5Isak’s injury overshadows big momentAlexander Isak’s goal at Tottenham felt, for a glorious few seconds,like an arrival. This was exactly what Liverpool paid all that money for him to do, to break tight games with his movement and range of finishing, and the confidence with which he clipped in from Florian Wirtz’s neat pass boded superbly. So the sight of him departing immediately, the victim of a rash Micky van de Ven attempt to retain parity, was a huge concern for Arne Slot and a shame for any neutral who would like to see an extraordinary talent hit full tilt again.Liverpool fear Isak has sustained a fractured legand he likely faces a lengthy period on the sidelines. It would be a major blow with Slot’s team having snuck up on the top four, putting together a six-game unbeaten run bookended by Isak’s first Premier League goals in their colours. Their fortunes this season appear tied up with those of their £125m investment.Nick AmesMatch report:Tottenham 1-2 Liverpool6Did Chelsea get away with one?Managers often moan about contentious refereeing decisions as a means of deflecting media attention from matters they would prefer were not talked about. The 13 points Newcastle have dropped from winning positions this season seems a case in point. Eddie Howe certainly did not seem overly keen to mention that unfortunate habit following his side’sfailure to protect a 2-0 lead against Chelseain a game they ended up drawing. Yet Newcastle’s manager was surely justified in criticising a decision made by the referee, Andy Madley, and endorsed by VAR not to award his team a penalty following Trevoh Chalobah’s blatant body check on Anthony Gordon. With the score then 2-1, a spot-kick could have changed the narrative. Was the decision to offer the Chelsea defender the benefit of considerable doubt informed by Gordon’s reputation for being very clever at winning penalties and sometimes going down too easily? The former England striker Peter Crouch was on analysis duty for TNT Sports and his take was interesting. “Gordon’s waiting,” said Crouch. “He knows the challenge is coming and he’s waiting for it. I think he’s ready to go down. But the force and aggression there … that’s not shielding the ball.”Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 2-2 Chelsea7A 99.17% certaintyBrentford’s second Premier Leagueaway win this seasonspelled relief for Keith Andrews. Rather than celebrate, Andrews sympathised with Wolves, the club he joined at 16. “I spent nine years here, 20% of my life,” he said. Wolves’ situation is beyond dire; Opta state – perhaps generously – their chances of relegation at 99.17%, leaving nothing to play for beyond pride. Andrews’ fellow Irishman Matt Doherty brutally spelled out the legacy that awaits Wolves players: “Do we want to be remembered for fighting all the way to the end of season, or do we want to be remembered for being cowards and taking the easy option, maybe trying to leave in January or not fighting and training, and letting other people take your position?” Jørgen Strand Larsen’s poor late penalty added insult to injury, the Norwegian already in fans’ bad books for wishing to leave in the summer. Any bond between supporters and players is close to as broken as that with the owners.John BrewinMatch report:Wolves 0-2 Brentford8Palace paying for lack of squad depthOliver Glasner was unable to find almost any positivesafter being thumped at Leedson Saturday night, but the club as a whole will have taken pleasure in the academy graduate Joél Drakes-Thomas coming off the bench in the 85th minute to become Crystal Palace’s youngest-ever Premier League player at 16 years and 194 days, surpassing David Ozoh (17 years and 260 days). Drakes-Thomas is so young he required a sponsorless shirt because under-18s can’t promote betting companies. The No 10 played 90 minutes on Thursday in the Conference League and did not look out of place, taking advantage of Palace’s hectic schedule to show he is ready for the challenge of first-team football. Drakes-Thomas’s promotion is also an indication of the lack of senior depth within the Palace squad caused by poor recruitment last summer, injuries and Ismaïla Sarr’s Afcon departure, leaving Glasner frustrated and looking to January to help improve the situation.Will UnwinMatch report:Leeds 4-1 Crystal PalaceView image in fullscreenOliver Glasner gave a debut to 16-year-old Joél Drakes-Thomas (left, without a shirt sponsor) during Crystal Palace’s defeat at Leeds.Photograph: Lee Keuneke/Every Second Media/Shutterstock9Can Kostoulas be Brighton’s goal key?As Fabian Hürzeler pointed out afterthe stalemate with Sunderland, Brighton are going through a “phase” of not being able to score goals that has meant they have only picked up two points from their last four matches. The continued absence of Danny Welbeck due to a persistent back injury has certainly not helped, but Georginio Rutter has struggled since being pressed into a more advanced role, having scored only once so far this season. After the sale of João Pedro to Chelsea in the summer, Brighton spent big on Charalampos Kostoulas and the Greek teenager looked lively when he came on for the last 19 minutes against Sunderland. Kostoulas is still waiting for his first Premier League start, but with Kaoru Mitoma back from injury to provide the chances, could the trip to face the leaders, Arsenal, on Saturday be the 18-year-old’s moment to show what he is capable of?Ed AaronsMatch report:Brighton 0-0 Sunderland10Sour note for frustrated CherriesThere is a sense that Bournemouth are underachieving this season. Only Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool have scored more goals than Andoni Iraola’s side so far this season, so why has this not translated into points? While 26 goals is a decent tally, they have been spread across 12 of Bournemouth’s 17 games; that’s five blanks, and in six of the nine games where they have scored two more goals only three have resulted in wins. To some degree that is misfortune, but if you’re scoring in clusters then you need defensive resolve to earn you points because there will be days – such as Saturday’sfrustrating 1-1 draw with Burnley– when Evanilson and David Brooks waste chances. There is no harsher reminder of the difficulty of competing in the Premier League than conceding to Burnley’s only shot on target.Tom BassamMatch report:Bournemouth 1-1 BurnleyPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1721392Man City1725373Aston Villa179364Chelsea1712295Liverpool173296Sunderland172277Man Utd173268Crystal Palace172269Brighton1722410Everton17-22411Newcastle1712312Brentford17-12313Tottenham Hotspur1732214AFC Bournemouth17-32215Fulham16-32016Leeds17-71917Nottm Forest16-81818West Ham17-161319Burnley17-151120Wolverhampton17-282Explore more on these topicsFootballTen talking points from the weekend footballPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

While many may have noticed the addition of five new sports in baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, a mini-revolution is happening on the water within a sport that will no longer have a lightweight category but will have five coastal rowing events in 2028.Coastal beach sprints shake up this most traditional and predictable of sports by taking the core elements of rowing – a need for extreme levels of fitness and psychological toughness – and adding new layers of jeopardy and a beach-party vibe. The discipline involves a head-to-head format and begins on land with athletes running down the beach and jumping into their boats at the water’s edge, then racing out around a buoy before hurtling back to dry land, leaping out of their boats and sprinting up the beach. With frequent close finishes, their final move is to hurl themselves through the air to hit the finish line buzzer first and land, usually, with a face full of sand.In a world where people have greater choice over which sports to watch and participate in, and minor sports’ world federations are considering how to stay popular and relevant, coastal rowing offers a less predictable and more entertaining format, while simultaneously reconnecting with a historic activity that dates back to around 1900BC in ancient Egypt where it was a significant mode of transport.We might be a footballing nation first but this is a great addition for Team GB as we also excel at sitting-down sports and boats are part of our national island identity. We also gain a new impetus to revitalise sport and activity around the coastline in areas that have become some of the most socially and economically challenged parts of each of the home nations. The Welsh government identified that its major sports event funding was going into big cities and realised the importance of reaching and engaging a different part of the population by hosting the coastal rowing world championships in Saundersfoot and developing the Wales international coastal centre there.Scotland has embraced the sport with St Andrews University investing in the wider flat boats used to row on the rougher waves and stepping up to become one of Britain’s 11 coastal sculling academies at East Sands Beach. Meanwhile, Glenarm in County Antrim hosted the All-Ireland CoastalRowingChampionships this summer for both beach sprint and endurance coastal rowing events. England’s coastal academies include clubs in Tynemouth, Scarborough, Whitby and Lowestoft, alongside many south coast clubs with a strong heritage in the activity. Sandbanks in Dorset was the venue for the first Commonwealth Beach Sprint Championships in 2018, followed by Namibia in 2022, and Barbados next weekend.Britain’s Guin Batten, a member of the silver-medal quadruple sculls crew from Sydney 2000 and one of the first British female rowers to stand on a podium, has been masterminding the logistical and political course to get to this point. As chair of the World Rowing coastal commission in her spare time (and deputy chief executive of Volleyball England the rest of the time), Batten describes the two disciplines of coastal and classic rowing as the “yin and yang of the sport”, different yet beautifully complementary, both at their core about brilliant boat skills and athletic prowess and yet each providing such a contrasting spectacle to watch or participate in.View image in fullscreenFormer New Zealand Olympic rower Emma Twigg competes in the women’s open coastal single sculls race during the 2025 Rowing NZ Beach Sprint Championships.Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty ImagesBoat costs and accessibility issues have been cleverly reduced – the wider boats are suitable for beginners and those racing at the highest level, unlike the incredibly narrow hulls that require significant expertise to master in still-water rowing. Countries don’t have to fly their equipment over as a pool of boats is provided, adding another unpredictable factor as participants won’t try out the actual boat they’ll race in until two days before they compete. At that point, they’ll need to study the boats and in particular the fin positions on the hull, which will be key to working out the optimal “buoy-rounding” techniques, all the time knowing they’ll need to judge everything again on the day once they see the size of the waves that Mother Nature chooses to throw at them.New Zealand’s Emma Twigg, the 2020 Olympic champion in single sculls and five-time Olympian, has reinvigorated her love for being in a boat by taking up the coastal discipline and won at the recent world championships in Turkey. Twigg told me she had fallen in love with beach sprints because of the “closeness of the racing”, “the beach volleyball vibes”, plus the benefit that you can watch the entire race from start to finish in the mini-stadium area, avoiding one of the insurmountable challenges of Olympic still-water rowing where you cannot ever see the whole 2km distance from one vantage point.Like their classic still-water cousins, coastal rowers will still need to develop a formidable physiology that can both sprint and endure to compete in up to three races in a day. Each race is a lung-busting, all-out effort with an arm-wrenching, shoulder-shuddering effort to make a 180-degree turn round the buoy mid-race. New Zealand’s Olympian Finn Hamill missed the buoy by centimetres to get knocked out at the recent world championships, while Moritz Wolff, the leading favourite from Germany, stumbled in the semi-final in the beach sprint allowing Spain’s Ander Martin to come through in the closing seconds to face the reigning American champion, Chris Bak, in the final who held on to retain his title. There’s a mix of existing rowers transitioning to this new discipline and others coming in from coastal clubs, while sports scientists and performance directors work out what future coastal Olympians will look like.The world’s best coastal rowers will share the Long Beach LA venue alongside open-water swimmers, windsurfers, foil and kitesurfing champions over the fortnight of the Games and show a different side to this otherwise seemingly strait-laced sport. Rowing’s answer to snowcross, BMX and beach volleyball is coming to LA, but if you live near the coast, then it may be coming to a beach near you soon too.Explore more on these topicsRowingOlympic GamesUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for aPremier Leagueseason set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement.How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a 10th of that? The drop-off is extraordinary.Wolves’ winless run continues as Keane Lewis-Potter doubles up for BrentfordRead moreThere were departures in the summer, with Matheus Cunha joining Manchester United, Rayan Aït-Nouri going to Manchester City, Fábio Silva sold to Borussia Dortmund, Gonçalo Guedes gone to Real Sociedad and Pablo Sarabia and Nelson Semedo – 115 league starts between them last season – leaving on frees. But that in itself shouldn’t have been enough to send Wolves into freefall.Last summer, though, was not a one-off. Wolves have been selling off talent and not really replacing it for a couple of years now. Pedro Neto, Maximilian Kilman and Mario Lemina left the previous season. Matheus Nunes, Rúben Neves and Nathan Collins went the season before that. A team can endure a certain level of downgrade for a while, but there comes a point at which a critical mass is reached. It’s less to do with the quality of the squad per se, although that clearly plays a role, than with the perception of decline.Matt Doherty, seeming distraught after Saturday’s game, made the point that it was time for players to decide whether history would regard them as cowards. The implication was clear. At least some of his team-mates are considering a January exit. Others perhaps have just mentally given up. Far easier to accept what now appears an inevitable relegation if a player can tell himself he wasn’t really trying by the end and neither was anybody else. It’s a way of deflecting blame: how could we perform in that environment? Doherty doesn’t have to be wrong for those players to have a point. Wolves has become an impossible place to play.It never starts out too badly. They caused Manchester City some problems on the opening day before losing 4-0. They lost the following three league games by a single goal. A 3-1 home defeat to Leeds perhaps began to raise serious concerns, but Wolves followed that up by beating Everton in the League Cup and then drawing against Tottenham and Brighton in the league. With two of the promoted clubs in the following two games there seemed a realistic possibility they could drag themselves towards respectability. But they were physically overwhelmed at Sunderland, losing 2-0, and then let in a 95th-minute winner after coming from 2-0 down to level against Bournemouth. And with that, Wolves’ season fell apart. They’ve scored just twice in eight league games since. No side has really outplayed them, but the fight has left them, something embodied by Jørgen Strand Larsen’s limp penalty miss on Saturday.After Pereira left, Rob Edwards came in, having walked out on a Middlesbrough side who looked well-placed for promotion from the Championship. Although he had done something similar in leaving Forest Green to take over at Watford earlier in his career, this move seemed motivated by a desire to try to save Wolves, the club he supports and for whom he played 100 league games. He may have been born on Christmas Day, but so far it seems unlikely he will enact a miracle. Having taken Luton down, his reputation may never recover.The chairman, Jeff Shi, unexpectedly stood down on Saturday after almost a decade in the role, although he remans as chairman and CEO of Fosun, which owns Wolves. His reasons for quitting are unclear, although there had been consistent fan protests against his reign. He has been replaced, pending a full-time appointment, by Nathan Shi, who is no relation. Whoever comes in will face a fanbase furious with how the club has been run over the past three years.Perhaps Wolves thought that even after weakening their squad with sales they would still be good enough to finish above the three promoted sides. Certainly the struggles of the three teams coming up helped them over the previous two seasons. But with Sunderland and Leeds both starting the season well, Wolves have been cast adrift. They are 16 points from safety. Survival already seems a forlorn hope. All that remains is to try to surpass Derby’s record low.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Along with the practical reasons, Serie A saw the game in Australia as an opportunity to promote its product abroad and believes football should follow the example of other sports such as cycling, NFL and NBA.The plans hit a stumbling block when the AFC imposed conditions including that it be responsible for appointing match officials, although on 18 December Serie A said the situation had been resolved.The Serie A cancellation comes two months after La Liga called off plans to play a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami after criticism and opposition within Spain.Explore more on these topicsSerie AMilanComoEuropean club footballFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Germany striker has toiled since moving to the London Stadiumfrom Borussia Dortmund for £27.5min the summer of 2024 and it is hoped that his exit will free up funds for Nuno Espírito Santo to boost his side’s fight against relegation by bringing in a new forward during next month’s transfer window.West Ham are interested in Wolves’s Jørgen Strand Larsen but are reluctant to meet his valuation. It is believed that the Premier League’s bottom-placed side want £40m for the Norwegian. West Ham’s budget is limited and they feel that the package for Strand Larsen, who has scored once in the league this season, is too expensive.Glasner hopes to gee up jaded Palace as he eyes Carabao Cup revenge over ArsenalRead moreWest Ham, who are 18th after six games without a win, are scouring the market for forwards. Nuno wants a player with experience of English football. Callum Wilson is the only senior striker at the manager’s disposal. Nuno has had limited success using Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville through the middle in recent games.The former Nottingham Forest manager is short of options before vital home games against Fulham and Brighton. However, that has not stopped him from discarding Füllkrug, who has not started a match since 4 October. The deal for the former Dortmund striker is regarded by West Ham as one of the worst mistakes made by their former technical director Tim Steidten.West Ham were keen to get Füllkrug off the books last summer but his wages put off potential buyers.Milanhave come forward with a loan proposal and will cover the German’s wages, but they could not be convinced to include an obligation in the deal. Füllkrug has had a string of injury problems during his time in England and has not adapted to the Premier League. He has managed only three goals and 11 league starts for West Ham.Nuno also wants to sign a new centre-back and could revive interest in Toulouse’s Charlie Cresswell. West Ham could increase their transfer budget by offloading James Ward-Prowse and Luis Guilherme, who is another failed Steidten signing. There could also be offers from Brazil for Lucas Paquetá.Explore more on these topicsMilanWest Ham UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

He flew past the substitutes and staff, skidded left, and sprinted up the line all wide-eyed and excited, shaking his fists and beaming. He had gone 15 or 20 metres, maybe 25, when he realised – just a fraction later than everyone else – that something had gone wrong again. So Villarreal’s manager put the brakes on and his head down, and turned back towards the bench feeling almost as silly as this was getting. This, he already suspected, was going to be one of those days.They had been playing 16 minutes and the goal Villarreal had scored, the goal Jules Koundé scored for them, wasn’t a goal at all. Just as the chance they made after 80 seconds wasn’t, Nicolas Pépé putting wide from a yard out. Just as Ayoze Pérez’s opportunity on six minutes wasn’t a goal, Tajon Buchanan’s effort on 13 wasn’t, and Raphinha’s on nine minuteswas. One moment – a dash, a tumble and a penalty – and from nowhere Villarreal trailedBarcelona. Now they were level again only for a raised flag to halt the manager’s run as suddenly, theohneatly summing up the afternoon when La Liga’s best teams met on the Mediterranean, not in Miami, and Barcelona beat Villarreal 2-0.Juventus creep into title race while Ferguson struggles to convince GasperiniRead moreMarcelino sat back down, but soon he was on his feet again. Buchanan put another wide on 24 minutes. Pépé ran clear, the move ending with an Albert Moleiro shot on 32. Three minutes later Buchanan was in again but the ball hit Joan García, hit Buchanan, bounced back towards the line and didn’t hit the net. Somehow, no one really knew how, it had squeezed past the far post instead. Marcelino now put his head in his hands. The next time, he just stood there, arms wide, looking into space, barely able to believe it. A bit before the break Villarreal were broken, a man down after Renato Veiga was sent off for going through Lamine Yamal.“Just when the game was so nice, such a lovely spectacle,” Marcelino said afterwards, which might not be the most convincing reason not to give a red, but you could understand how he felt, maybe even feel the same way. Down to 10 men, the game was done; an enjoyable one, on edge, had come to an early end. Whistled for the terrible crime of being taken out, early in the second half Lamine Yamal scored a smart toe poke with a hint of Ronaldinho about it, the finish morefutsalthan full size, and celebrated by whistling back. There was an appeal for a penalty – Marcelino claimed Barça’s García took down Rafa Marín while also admitting “other opinions” are available – but no more goals. Villarreal’s challenge had lasted 38 minutes.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal toe-pokes the ball into the Villarreal net to make it 2-0 to Barcelona.Photograph: Biel Aliño/EPAIt had been short but it had been some challenge. Which is the way it was supposed to be, if not where it was supposed to be. This was first against third, and if Villarreal’s manager has kept saying that they couldn’t win the league lately, that was because people kept asking if they could. Although he insisted the actual championship was out of their reach, the winter championship – an honorary, trophy-less title “given” to the team that’s top at halfway – still wasn’t. Barcelona had won seven in a row, Villarreal six. They hadn’t been beaten at home; the run in fact stretched into last season, all the way back to March.In short, this was exactly the kind of game you would take to the States if you wanted to promote La Liga and exactly the kind of scenario that supported the argument that you shouldn’t: how could you take a home game off one team competing for the league and give it to another? In the end, the league’s president, Javier Tebas, was beaten by his own blustering bullishness,victim of his very Tebasness. With plans incomplete, the players he had refused to listen to stood up to be heard and with Real Madrid manoeuvring against them, Tebas hadfailed for a fourth time to take La Liga to the US. Never mind Crockett and Tubbs, the Hard Rock Stadium and flying to Florida, Barcelona instead caught a plane 250km south to Castellón, installing themselves in a hotel opposite the station and travelling 10km up to Vila-real where instead of Miami’s pastel pinks it was all yellow – even the Father Christmas sitting outside the ground.Ousmane Dembélé quietly becomes the main man after long journey to the topRead moreTo start with, most of the attacks were too. The game began at 4.15pm local time, 10.15am eastern standard; by 4.17pm at the ceramic stadium, Villarreal had already had their first chance. The chances kept coming too, racking up half a dozen of them by the time Veiga was sent off: 38 really good minutes in which Barcelona struggled to get out and Villarreal repeatedly got through, robbing and running relentlessly – even after Raphinha scored the penalty and then smashed an outrageous shot off the bar.“We saw a really great Villarreal, an enormous Villarreal,” Marcelino said afterwards. He also said that Veiga’s red could have been orange and suggested Raphinha’s penalty was a bit soft. But he knew this was an opportunity lost. “To beat Barcelona, you have to take your chances,” Marcelino offered.View image in fullscreenMarcelino holds his head in his hands as he watches Villarreal’s first home defeat in 14 league matches.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesUsually, they do just that. With athleticism and assuredness, Villarreal have the best shot conversion rate inLa Liga. Pérez had scored two from two shots on target and Buchanan had five goals from an xG of less than one. But against Barça, it was different. “At half-time we should have been a goal up, or two. Apart from the penalty and the shot against the bar they didn’t do anything, and we had infinite chances,” captain Dani Parejo insisted. Marcelino said: “In the first 15 or 20 minutes, we did enough to be in the lead and by more than one goal, but this is football. They score a goal. And their second goal comes after five rebounds. Even with 10 men, we competed with dignity. We made their goalkeeper their best player. What more can I ask for? Nothing really. I am very satisfied, but it’s a pity.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowValencia 1-1 MallorcaReal Madrid 2-0 SevillaOsasuna 3-0 AlavésLevante 1-1 Real SociedadReal Oviedo 0-0 Celta VigoReal Betis 4-0 GetafeElche 4-0 Rayo VallecanoVillarreal 0-2 BarcelonaGirona 0-3 Atlético MadridWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With nine players missing, Villarreal had shown why some might see them as candidates, completing what their coach rightly called an “extraordinary” 2025 in which, with 75, only Madrid and Barcelona collected more points. A club where there is a stability, financially and institutionally, and relatively little pressure, they have a manager who has been successful everywhere with a clear idea and structure, a team of transitions that don’t always need much of the ball to do damage. They also have the strongest squad of all the “other” clubs in Spain, greater resources than the rest: a fast, efficient side. Yet, it is tempting to conclude, perhaps they also showed why they might not be. They don’t have a Lamine, a Raphinha – described in El Periódico as the Pantocrator – nor a Garcia. There was something familiar, possibly even predictable about this, even while it unfolded as it did.They had tried everything, except move to Miami. Maybe they should have done: Villarreal have won three or their last four at Barcelona but none at home against them since 2007. There is also a certain logic about their results, at least in La Liga (how bad Villarreal have been in Europe baffles and hints wider concerns about the level domestically). They have beaten the rest but their three defeats have come against Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid, and now Barcelona, like there is still some ceiling there, something that separates them still.The 100 best male footballers in the world 2025Read more“They counter fast and we have to manage that better, but I always had the feeling we were a little bit better,” Frenkie de Jong said. That might have been pushing it but Barcelona found a way through again, taking them to eight consecutive winssince the clasico, putting them four points clear at the top and making them winter champions. That may not mean much but isn’t quite as empty as the Fifa Peace Prize: they will be top at half way, having played everyone, winning at Villarreal, where no one else had in 14 league matches, not since Madrid were there in March.“Villarreal are a fantastic team and I’m very happy about these three points: you can see that my team is a little tired but the mentality and the attitude is unbelievable. Now we rest and celebrate Christmas with our families which is important too,” Hansi Flick said, offering a‘Feliz Navidad’ before heading off for a mercifully short flight home.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona1831462Real Madrid1820423Atletico Madrid1817374Villarreal1616355Espanyol164306Real Betis1710287Celta Vigo171238Athletic Bilbao17-7239Elche1732210Sevilla17-22011Getafe17-92012Osasuna17-31813Mallorca17-51814Alaves17-61815Rayo Vallecano17-71816Real Sociedad17-41717Valencia17-101618Girona17-181519Oviedo17-191120Levante16-1210Explore more on these topicsLa LigaVillarrealBarcelonaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her first game in charge will be the trip to the champions Chelsea on 11 January, following the WSL’s winter break. The 54-year-old former Juventus head coach takes charge with her new side 11th in the table.Guarino won four consecutive Serie A titles while in charge of Juventus, before a spell with Inter. This will be her first job in England. “I’m so happy to be joining West Ham United. It is a club with a big history and strong values that align with my own,” said the former striker, who won 99 caps for her country. “I’ve spoken with the board and I’m really excited by the project here. There is a lot of talent and experience in the team, and I want to support the girls to develop as individuals but also as a collective.“I want to build a team that is organised, aggressive with the ball and that tries to recognise and use space. The mentality of the team – the togetherness and hard work – is the most important thing.” West Ham’s assistant manager, Steve Kirby, who oversaw Sunday’s League Cup quarter-final loss to Manchester City, will stay on as Guarino’s assistant.West Ham have won one and drawn two of their 11 league games this season to sit two points above bottom-placed Liverpool at the halfway stage of the campaign.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham United WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

It had already been a worthy showpiece to draw the curtains on pre-Christmas Bundesliga but the end result – achieved not without a smidgeon of controversy – left us with a satisfying tale to tell by an open fire over holiday season.Bayer Leverkusen can enjoy their brief break with a rosy glow of satisfaction with their win against a direct competitor a clear measure of how far they have come; or, if you like, a measure of how far Kasper Hjulmand has taken them. Leverkusen sit third over the bridge to the new year which, if we were to return to the closure of the summer transfer window, looked a long way off.Juventus creep into title race while Ferguson struggles to convince GasperiniRead moreAt RB Leipzig, Erik ten Hag’s era seemed like aeons ago as they reacted with certainty, even to difficult moments like going a goal down to Xaver Schlager’s smart finish from the edge of the area. That occurred 10 minutes before half-time – yet at the interval Leverkusen led, courtesy of a looping header from the resurgent Martin Terrier and a Bergkamp-esque slalom and smash into the roof of the net by Patrik Schick.The debate came later, when the 18-year-old debutant Montrell Culbreath iced the win by breaking clear and – after briefly considering squaring to his teammate Christian Kofane – driving his finish high past Peter Gulacsi. Leipzig were still calling for a penalty at the other end after the Leverkusen captain, Robert Andrich, handled the ball while tumbling over Willi Orbán, before the cleared ball broke to Culbreath on the halfway line. Around two-and-a-half minutes later (mercifully short by modern standards given the officials had to judge the position of Andrich’s hand, whether it was actually in the box and a possible foul by Orbán) the referee Benjamin Brand pointed to the centre circle; goal given, all over.It was a frantic, scruffy end to what had been a high-quality game, showcasing what has been a better league so far this season than the gap from Bayern Munich to the rest would have its detractors claim. The chasing pack have had their inconsistencies but Leipzig and Leverkusen, both rebuilding in their different ways, turned up here. Leverkusen’s climb, though, has been the steeper one over the last few months. Hjulmand, whose only previous Bundesliga experience was a mixed spell at Mainz, had a thankless task ahead of him when he arrived at the BayArena in September.View image in fullscreenKasper Hjulmand talks to his captain, Robert Andrich, on the touchline.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersTen Hag’s legacy was of two league games, one point and performances that looked like what they were – a host of almost total strangers yet to form any sort of team. Hjulmand has had little time in the calendar to remedy this on the training pitch, which makes his record of 28 points from 13 Bundesliga games since even more remarkable. Progress in the Champions League (wherethe win at Manchester Citymight be considered a turning point in creating a collective) and to the DfB Pokal last eight, beating Dortmund along the way, is also highly impressive.If there is one lingering element of the Xabi Alonso reign under Hjulmand it is of the refusal to complain about setbacks or misfortune. Leverkusen were missing a host of names here, with Edmond Tapsoba, Ibrahim Maza and Eliesse Ben Seghir at the Africa Cup of Nations, Álex Grimaldo injured and Jarell Quansah suspended. But Leverkusen found a way, and did so in style.That Culbreath brought 2025 to an end was quite an irony, the teenager having scored the first goal of the Ten Hag era during a 5-1 humiliation in a friendly against Flamengo’s under-20 side, a result which first sparked misgivings over the former Manchester United coach. That is the last mention Hjulmand and Leverkusen will want of the past, because the future looks very bright.Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowBorussia Dortmund 2-0 Borussia Mönchengladbach, RB Leipzig 1-3 Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg 3-4 Freiburg, Stuttgart 0-0 Hoffenheim, Cologne 0-1 Union Berlin, Hamburg 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt, Augsburg 0-0 Werder Bremen, Heidenheim 0-4 Bayern Munich, Mainz 0-0 St PauliWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsThere is occasionally some confusion about the unofficial title ofHerbstmeister(autumn champion), with some believing its recipient is the team which is top at Christmas, rather than the halfway point, as is actually the case. Helpfully Bayern Munich are going to cover both angles, as they are now nine points clear after 15 games (with two to go until halfway) after their 4-0 win at Heidenheim in the last Bundesliga game of 2025. It was largely as routine as it looks on paper, despite a minor flurry from the home team in the second half with the score at 2-0, which was of great satisfaction to Vincent Kompany with illness snaking through his squad to the extent that the injured Joshua Kimmich made the two-hour trip west just in case more went down. That relentlessness has seen Bayern back to their best, as Max Eberl and Harry Kane – who scored his 19th Bundesliga goal of the season at the death – pointed out, with the much-maligned Club World Cup cited by both as a bonding experience. “We developed a great energy and team spirit that’s hard to break,” said Kane, “and we’ve carried that into this season.”Dortmund ended 2025 by overcoming their own cluster of defensive injuries to defeat an improved Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-0 on Friday night. Nothing is ever straightforward in Dortmund, though, with more discussion about Karim Adeyemi’s future viability after Niko Kovac was forced to substitute him in the second half to nip a back-and-forth with the referee Sven Jablonski in the bud. Niklas Süle, on the other hand, received praise all round for his performance, stepping in to shine – and to set up Julian Brandt’s opener – after a week in which it has been widely reported that BVB will not seek to extend his hefty contract when it expires at season’s end. “Respect for that performance, Niki,” said the sporting director, Sebastian Kehl. “That’s something truly remarkable … when you consider what’s been thrown at him in recent days.”View image in fullscreenNiklas Süle (left) shone against Borussia Mönchengladbach.Photograph: Ralf Ibing/firo sportphoto/Getty ImagesThe real fun was in Wolfsburg, where a seven-goal thriller was won by visitors Freiburg, getting a touch of the fortune that lacked in last week’s draw with Dortmund as they recovered from 3-2 down after Dzenan Pejcinovic had bagged a hat-trick for the home side. Having been confirmed as the permanent head coach before kick-off, Wolfsburg’s Daniel Bauer will have less frivolity in 2026 as he works towards his Uefa pro licence between training and matches (though he did pledge a “culinary or liquid” commemoration of his appointment).Mainz’s goalless draw with St Pauli, the game that nobody dared to lose, was less jolly on Sunday afternoon, but perhaps gives Urs Fischer a platform to lift his side off the bottom in the new year. The Mainz coach is unbeaten in three so far after the midweek Conference League win against Samsunspor, which also secured a top eight league finish – and a couple of valuable midweeks off in February.PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich1544412Borussia Dortmund1514323Bayer Leverkusen1513294RB Leipzig1511295Hoffenheim159276Stuttgart153267Eintracht Frankfurt150258Union Berlin15-3219Freiburg15-12010Werder Bremen15-101711Cologne15-21612Borussia M'gladbach15-61613Hamburg15-91614Wolfsburg15-51515Augsburg15-111416St Pauli15-131217Heidenheim15-211118Mainz15-138Explore more on these topicsBundesligaBayer LeverkusenEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, any suggestion that Palace may have to prioritise given they remain in four competitions was unsurprisingly dismissed.“No, I don’t think so,” said Glasner after his team’s4-1 hammering by Leedson Saturday. “If somebody tells me that we lose on purpose, the next day I’m not the manager any more.”Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThere has been a stark contrast in Glasner’s approach to cup competitions compared to his predecessor, Roy Hodgson, something that first became clear in Palace’s run to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup in his first full season in charge. They had been eliminated in that competition as well as the FA Cup by the time hetook over at Selhurst Park in February 2024and picked his strongest team for Palace’s wins over Norwich, QPR and away at Aston Villa – the first of three victories over Unai Emery’s side that season, including the FA Cup semi-final – which set up their meeting with Arsenal in the last-eight. That ended in a3-2 defeat at the Emirates Stadiumin December 2024 thanks to a somewhat controversial hat-trickfrom Gabriel Jesus after Palace had led at half-time.Almost exactly 12 months on, Glasner must now try to figure out how to gain revenge against the Premier League leaders in a fixture they were forced toreschedule to this weekdue to their European commitments.Glasner has been a victim of his own success after leading Palace to their first major trophy viavictory over Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final. The demands of playing in Europe for the first time are catching up with some exhausted players, several of whom have barely had a rest all season. Palace fielded an entirely different side featuring four teenagers in the2-2 draw with KuPSin their final Conference League fixture last week. Glasner admitted he will have no option but to select the majority of his first-choice team that looked extremely jaded as they uncharacteristically conceded four goals from set-pieces at Elland Road. “Have to. Yes, have to,” he said.View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner was unable to rally his tired side to victory over Leeds but admits he will pick a side of mainly first-teamers on Tuesday.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThere are no such issues for Mikel Arteta, although the Arsenal manager must balance his desire to win only a second major trophy in six years at the helm with extreme pragmatism. Last year, ahamstring injury suffered by Bukayo Sakain the first half of Arsenal’s Premier League win at Selhurst Park a few days after their comeback in the Carabao Cup went a long way to ending their hopes of catching Liverpool in the title race. Arteta had made several changes to his starting line-up for the first game but was forced to bring on his big-hitters after the break with Palace leading. Saka came off the bench to set up Jesus for the crucial second goal, even if Glasner was furious that he appeared to be offside in the buildup and there was no video assistant referee to call on, as will be the case again on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus has been out for most of 2025 but is back to try to haunt Palace after he scored a hat-trick against them in the League Cup last season.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesArsenal have not lost to Palace since a3-0 Premier League defeatto a side managed by Patrick Vieira in April 2022 – a run of eight matches that includes seven wins. Jesus, who scored twice in the5-1 league win over Palacebefore suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury against Manchester United three weeks later, looks set to start for the first time since then in what will be his 100th appearance since joining from Manchester City in 2022. Arteta revealed that the Brazil striker wrote a letter to his teammates explaining what football means to him and how it affects his life. “It was something beautiful,” said the Arsenal manager, who is also expected to hand starts to Ethan Nwaneri and Noni Madueke as he shuffles his pack in attack.“We are used to it,” said Arteta of the congested schedule. “I think this week was the only full week we had to prepare. The rest until February at least is going to be like this. We have a beautiful opportunity to go into the semi-final of a competition so we will be ready.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupCrystal PalaceArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Once built on, they are gone forever, and Sport England’s statutory consultee role is an important line of defence. Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher.”The letter adds: “This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer.”About 10,000 playing fields were sold off in the 80s and 90s before protections were introduced in 1996 and 2001. Sport England’s figures also show it protected more than 1,000 playing fields in 2021-2022.However that looks set to change, unless a public consultation that runs to 13 January is able to persuade the government to change its mind.Fields in Trust, which put together the letter, has found that almost half of Britain already lives more than a 10-minute walk from a playing field, with the poorest areas continuing to lose most green spaces to development or closure.Scott, the Fields in Trust president, urged the government to listen to the warnings from across sport.“Too many communities risk losing these very spaces,” she said. “The playing fields where children first learn to play, the parks where families spend Sunday afternoons, the pitches for weekend kickabouts between friends. I wouldn’t be where I am today without that green space in Sunderland, where I spent countless hours as a kid, and every child deserves that same chance.“I urge the government to listen carefully. We’re not asking for the impossible. We’re asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.”The government has been approached for comment. This month a spokesperson said: “There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.Sport England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSport EnglandSport politicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It means that after five years of legal arguments a large number of the claimants in both codes face the risk of having their cases struck out before they come to trial.The appeal judge, Lord Justice Dias, ruled that the judge presiding over the management of the case, Senior Master Jeremy Cook, had been right to find that the claimants’ firm, Rylands Garth, had failed to fulfil its obligations to disclose necessary medical material to the defendants, World Rugby, the Wales Rugby Union, and the Rugby Football Union in one case, and the Rugby Football League in the other.Five years on: rugby’s brain damaged players wait and wait for the help they needRead moreThe issues are procedural, and the appeal ruling does not reflect the strength of the actual cases that will eventually proceed to trial, butthe case in rugby league in particular has been hugely undermined by this judgment. Altogether 180 of the 321 claimants in rugby league now face having their claims struck off. The number involved in rugby union is smaller, and so is the risk of strike outs, but about 20% of the total of 773 union players could be affected.Rylands Garth had been ordered to comply with their disclosure obligations by late October 2025, using what is known as an unless order. That date passed without their having done it, and Rylands Garth launched an appeal. They argued that Senior Master Cook had “erred in law and misdirected himself” and that the unless orders had been “disproportionate and oppressive, irrational and perverse”. Dias rejected the appeals on all grounds.Dias criticised the Rylands Garth solicitor Richard Boardman, ruling that given “the repeated extensions, the strong indications by the judge from early in proceedings of the need for active progression of the litigation, the gross misunderstandings of Mr Boardman about his disclosure duties and the associated puzzling nature of these fundamental misconceptions with his unconvincing explanations, it was entirely reasonable in my judgment for the judge to lack confidence in the adequacy or legal accuracy of the approach to disclosure.”Rylands Garth had provided medical material which was in their possession and that they had relied upon, but had failed to provide a quantity of other medical information that had been requested by the defendants, including GP records and medical histories. Rylands Garth argued that the size of the task made this an impossible job.Dias pointed out that “if solicitors take on substantial litigation such as this, they are duty-bound professionally, both to their lay clients and to the court in their capacity of officers of it, to ensure they have made appropriate and effective logistical and administrative arrangements to comply with the lawful orders of the court”.A spokesperson for Rylands Garth said: “We are grateful to the judge for providing greater clarity regarding the required level of disclosure of claimants’ medical records. We will continue to comply with the court’s orders as we work to fast-track the case and deliver justice for the former players we represent. To date, we have already disclosed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in support of the case against World Rugby, the RFU and WRU, as well as the rugby league defendants. Many of these documents were disclosed several years ago. The defendants have never formally responded to the claims and continue to attempt to hold up the case’s progress through the court.“The former players we represent and their families continue to suffer every day with the devastating impact of the negligence of sports authorities,” the spokesperson continued. “We reaffirm our commitment to accountability, meaningful change, and safeguarding the next generation of players.”The next case hearings are scheduled for March, but it is likely the defendants will now move to have all the affected cases struck off, which may cause more delays to the proceedings.In a joint statement following the ruling, World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU said: “We note that the claimants’ appeal has been dismissed. The judgment expressed concern that there has been a serious erosion of the court’s confidence in the way the disclosure process has been conducted, and noted that effective and fair disclosure of the relevant documents was ‘indispensable’ in the context of the case.“As such many players in the case are at risk of having their claims struck out. Player welfare remains a central priority for rugby and we shall not stand still in this space.”Explore more on these topicsSportConcussion in sportRugby leagueRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not really up to me, is it? I will just keep trying to do the job, try to learn the lessons that I haven’t quite got right here and make adjustments. Those questions are for someone else, not for me.“It’s a pretty good gig. It’s good fun. You travel the world with the lads and try to play some exciting cricket and try to achieve some things. For me, it’s a matter of trying to just get the very best out of the people and try to achieve what you can with them. Those other decisions are up to other people. I think we’ve made some progress from when I took over to where we are.”With Key having extended ­McCullum’s deal in 2024 and expanded his brief to include the white-ball teams, their fates may well be intertwined and not helped by 21 defeats in 39 games across all formats this calendar year.Among the questions swirling after the82-run defeat at Adelaide Ovalis whether McCullum and the captain, Ben Stokes, remain on the same page. At 2-0 down, Stokes suddenly ordered his players to show “fight” and a flat pitch on which England would usually have looked to attack was met with caution: 286 all out in 87.2 overs represented their slowest first innings under the current regime.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes (right) wanted the England players to show ‘fight’ in Adelaide.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesAsked if the players still believed in his methods, McCullum replied: “I hope so. You’ll have to ask them. For the last few years, we’ve had a team which has understood how we’re going about this style and we put this team together based on the skill level and the talent [required]. That’s not going to change during the time that I’m still in the job.“I will always have the back of my players, always support them and I’ll always make sure that I’m protective of them as well in a public forum. That doesn’t mean you don’t challenge them privately.“The style has never been about the scoring rates. We have never said we are going to try to score at 5.5/6 an over. It’s about allowing us to get in the head space where we are clear, transparent and immersed in the situation and the moment so we can identify risk, where the game is at and what is required.“For the first nine days [of the series] I felt we were incredibly tight, tense and desperate to perform and succeed. That desperation is great, but not if it puts the handbrake on your ability to let your talent and game come out.”As a head coach who has always maintained his methods relate to the “top two inches” – ie mindset – rather than technical coaching, this “desperation” does fall on McCullum.

Both took on their roles after Key and McCullum were appointed in 2022 but there is still time to change perceptions in the final two Tests of this Ashes tour and, if given the chance, the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year.McCullum said: “If we can just play, again, just find that beautiful state you can get in where you’re not restricted by the pressures and the expectations of everything ... acknowledge all of that and accept that it’s going to be there ... but then just go out and when you cross the line, go out and just play the game ... then we give ourselves a better chance.“This [defeat] is going to sting, no doubt. But we know we’ve got a job to do in Melbourne and in Sydney. If we can salvage something out of the next two Test matches, then that’s something.”England were due to resume training at the MCG on Tuesday morning with Jacob Bethell and Gus Atkinson, two of the unused players in Adelaide, now in contention to play in the Boxing Day Test.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamAshes 2025-26Brendon McCullumECBThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Our fans will still be the loudest in theNFL, our games will still be the best place in the world to tailgate, and our players and coaches will be ready to compete for championships, because on the field or off the field, we are big dreamers, and we’re ready for the next chapter.”The Chiefs intend their $3bn stadium project to be built in Kansas City, Kansas, near the Kansas Speedway and a retail district known as The Legends. The area is home to Children’s Mercy Park, the home of MLS clubSporting Kansas City, and Legends Field, the home of the Kansas City Monarchs minor league baseball team.The Chiefs also plan to build a $300m practice facility in the Kansas City-metro suburb of Olathe, Kansas.“Today’s announcement is truly historic. Actually, it’s a little surreal,” Kansas governor Laura Kelly said. “Today’s announcement will touch the lives of Kansans for generations to come. Today’s announcement is a total game-changer for our state.“We have always been Chiefs fans,” Kelly said. “Now we are Chiefs family.”Kansas lieutenant governor David Toland, the state’s commerce secretary, said it had committed to issuing $2.4bn in bonds to cover 60% of the project’s roughly $4bn cost. State officials also foresee more than 20,000 new construction jobs to be created.While the final location for the stadium has not been decided, Chiefs president Mark Donovan said it would seat about 65,000, or about 10,000 fewer fans than Arrowhead Stadium. That follows a trend across professional sports of building stadiums and arenas that have fewer overall seats but more amenities, luxury seating and premium spaces.“We have a lot of work to do. We’re still early in the process,” Hunt said. “In the months ahead, we will hire an architect and contractor and get to work on the five-plus-year timeline to build a new stadium.”The move by the Chiefs is a massive blow toMissourilawmakers and governor Mike Kehoe, who had been working on their own funding package to prevent a third NFL franchise and the second in a decade from leaving their borders; the Rams left St Louis for Los Angeles in part due to their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.Kehoe had backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50m of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.“They thought new and shiny was better than old and reliable,” Kehoe said after the Chiefs’ announcement, adding that the club was in discussions with Missouri officials about staying at a renovated or rebuilt Arrowhead Stadium as late as last week.“We won’t give up. We’ll look for cracks in the armor and find out if there’s a Missouri Show-Me solution through our sports act.”The Chiefs originally planned an $800m renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium. The facilities sit a couple hundred yards apart, across a parking lot, and both teams have leases with Jackson County, Missouri, that expire in January 2031.Last year, Jackson County voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension which would have helped to pay for those renovations to the football stadium while helping to fund a new ballpark for the Royals in downtown Kansas City, Missouri.The Royals were not discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.Chiefs heir Gracie Hunt backs rival Super Bowl half-time show over Bad BunnyRead more“While the Chiefs aren’t going far away and aren’t gone yet, today is a setback as a Kansas Citian, a former Chiefs season ticket-holder and lifelong Chiefs fan,” said Quinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri. “Business decisions are a reality and we all understand that, but Arrowhead Stadium is more – it’s family, tradition and a part of Kansas City we will never leave.”Hunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.This summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarter-finals.Lamar Hunt established the Chiefs on 14 August 1959. The team was originally based in Dallas and known as the Texans, but Hunt was convinced by then-Kansas City mayor H Roe Bartle to relocate the team to Missouri with promises of tripling the team’s season-ticket sales and expanding the seating capacity of Municipal Stadium.In 1972, the team moved into Arrowhead Stadium at the Truman Sports Complex just east of downtown Kansas City.The stadium has undergone numerous renovations through the years, allowing it to stay relevant in a changing sports landscape. But there has been little economic development around the stadium, the facility itself is starting to show wear and tear, and there is a limit to the number of luxury suites and amenities that the franchise can utilize to help drive revenue.While the Hunt family has long loved Arrowhead Stadium, it has warmed in recent years to the idea of a replacement.Not only would it solve many of the shortcomings of the Chiefs’ longtime home, a new facility with a fixed or retractable roof would allow them to use it year-round. That would mean the potential for hosting more concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and perhaps one of Lamar Hunt’s long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.“Chiefs fans on both sides of the state line can tell you that the success we’ve enjoyed together has elevated the profile of the entire region,” Clark Hunt said. “Sports are woven into the fabric of this community. If you travel and go to New York or Los Angeles or Europe or South America, you don’t have to tell people which side of the state line you’re from. You tell them you’re from Kansas City, and there’s a pretty good chance their response might have something to do with the Chiefs.”Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsUS sportsNFLKansasMissouriSporting Kansas CityShareReuse this content"

Those loans helped keep the company afloat long enough for Trump to take it public last year, when he netted an additional paper fortune of about $4.6bn. After publication, Trump Media sued the Guardian for defamation and $250m in damages. Last month, the judge threw out the case, pointing out that Trump Media was required to show that “the [Guardian] either knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth” – but he found no such evidence. Though Trump Media has until 2 January to refile a case against the Guardian, this was a victory not only for us, but for journalists everywhere.Make your year-end gift to the Guardian here.We welcome anything you can spare.

It also provides artificial intelligence-enabled military targeting systems.The investigation cites an expert report, internal to the Swiss army, that assessed Palantir’s status as a US company meant there was a possibility sensitive data shared with it could be accessed by the US government and intelligence services.British MPs have voiced concerns over the US data company in light of the report.“Palantir … is an organisation that the British government, in terms of theNHS, in terms of contracts, should stay very far away from … I think the Swiss army is right to be suspicious,” said the Labour MP Clive Lewis.The government “needs to undertake transparent due diligence” on the conduct of Palantir and other big tech companies, said Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central.“I know there were certainly questions in the NHS about Palantir’s capabilities. It’s clearly been handed a lot of money to do the federated data platform. I, as a politician, want to know that these companies are making ethical choices. And if they’re not – whether around weaponry, minerals or the climate – I think we as parliament should be given greater transparency around this.”View image in fullscreenThe UK prime minister, Keir Starmer (third from left), tours the Palantir headquarters in New York in February.Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty ImagesThe year-long investigation is based on freedom of information requests to Swiss government departments. It details how Palantir went on a seven-year “shopping trip” trying to convince Swiss authorities to use its products and was rejected at least nine times by different agencies.In response to a query from the Guardian, a Palantir spokesperson said: “There is no basis to the claim in the report by the Swiss army about potential access to sensitive data and no truth to it whatsoever.“We run a business that is predicated on the trust of our customers, which means we also do everything possible – from contractual, procedural, to technical controls – to ensure that our customers are in full control of their data, their operations and their decisions when using Palantir software.”In 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, Palantir pitched its services to Swiss health authorities – while touting its work with the NHS, which had just begun to use its tools to manage Covid-19 data.“We are already doing this in other countries, such as Great Britain, but we feel a special obligation to Switzerland and the federal chancellor,” it wrote.Switzerland’s Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) ultimately chose not to work with Palantir in managing the pandemic. The exact reasons for this were redacted: it hired a competitor instead. In meeting minutes obtained by the journalists, the office stated: “Problem: Communications. FOPH demands that Palantir be questioned.”At the same time, Palantir was trying to win contracts with the Swiss army. These meetings began in 2018. In 2020, it submitted a bid for the “IT system of the army’s intelligence service” and was rejected for unspecified reasons.Johnson and Cummings’ secret meeting with Palantir founder revealedRead moreIn 2024, it tried again. By this time, the UK’s Ministry of Defence hadsignedits first £75m contract with Palantir for data tools. After a meeting between Palantir’s European head and a Swiss army commander, the army commissioned an internal report to evaluate the products Palantir was offering.That report, authored by army experts, concluded that it remained unclear – based on their information about Palantir’s products – whether or not US intelligence would be able to access data shared with Palantir as it was a US company, despite Palantir’s official reassurances otherwise.The finding is “explosive”, wrote the journalists. “Firstly, because it comes from a high-ranking body of the army and, secondly, because the Swiss Federal Department of Defence (VBS) employs certified cryptologists.”Experts in the Swiss army also found other issues with Palantir’s offerings to the military, both in terms of its cost and the fact that using Palantir’s technologies might require Palantir specialists to be permanently onsite, which could “limit the army’s ability to act in crisis situations”.The Swiss army decided not to contract Palantir. Less than a year after it commissioned the report, the UK military would sign a £750m deal with Palantir to “boost military AI and innovation”.WAV and Republik’s findings havegenerateddebateacross Europe, especially in Germany. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service, Sinan Selen,warnedEuropean security services to be cautious in any use of US software in public comments last week without naming Palantir specifically.View image in fullscreenAn activist dressed as the US president, Donald Trump, takes part in a protest against Palantir in Berlin in September.Photograph: Omer Messinger/Getty ImagesSeveral German states including Bavaria, Hesse and Baden-Württemberg in recent months have chosen Palantir analysis software for their police forces or, as is the case with North Rhine-Westphalia, paved a legal path toward using it or comparable services.The MP Konstantin von Notz, an intelligence expert with the opposition Greens and former head of Germany’s parliamentary oversight committee for the secret services, has been vocal in his opposition to Palantir.In an emailed statement to the Guardian after the Swiss revelations, Von Notz underlined his view that the German interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, who has said he is reviewing whether to allow police across the country to use the US software, “must finally say goodbye to Palantir”.Von Notz welcomed the Swiss decision to do without the “highly controversial US company which has close ties to Donald Trump”.Explore more on these topicsPalantirMinistry of DefenceSwitzerlandEuropeNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.There is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.When I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winningClair Obscur: Expedition 33, andHollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many peoplereallycontribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.View image in fullscreenSmaller-scale wins … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Kepler InteractiveTheNintendo Switch 2was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.But the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios,including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology.AI-generated artwork and voiceovershave made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.All this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be foundprotesting outside the Game Awardsearlier this month.) In the UK, thefiring of 30 stafffrom Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Rockstar Games office in Edinburgh in November.Photograph: Lesley Martin/PAAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: whenMicrosoft acquired Activisionin 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudisalso bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’sinterview with Human Rights Watchfrom earlier this year is an essential read.)What we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he wasdiscovered to be a fake gamerin January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images ofthe president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue tofeed culture war spatsover a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?View image in fullscreenElon Musk boasted about being an elite gamer online – and turned out to be faking itPhotograph: Evan Vucci/API don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after Iwrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.Why the enormous Saudi-led deal to acquire EA matters, whether you play games or notRead morePlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this,this year’s Summer Game Fest– a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.It matters, who has power.Gamesfeel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.Explore more on these topicsGamesDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they seem largely to reflect information that has already been made publicMon 22 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 13.22 ESTShareAfter months of public outcry and pressure from within the Maga coalition,Donald Trump’s justice department released what it called The Epstein Files, with the Trump world’s typical fanfare. A media frenzy ensued. But the “files” that were released byPam Bondi’s Department of Justice left many observers frustrated and confused. The release was partial and heavily redacted; much of the information had already been made public. Media figures were incensed, and members of Congress pledged to push the Trump administration for more. The episode left Washington watchers frustrated. It fueled speculation that Trump, who had long opposed the release of the documents, had something to hide.That was on 27 February, when agroup of 15 rightwing media figureswho had taken a special interest in the Epstein case were summoned to the White House and given white binders labeled “The Epstein Files”. The release was meant to allay pressure from the president’s conspiracy-minded base and neutralize the Epstein issue, which has dogged Trump since the financier, sex offender and former close friend of the president died in prison during his first term in 2019. But those who received the binders said that there was little new information in them. The episode only further inflamed tensions and increased the salience of the Epstein issue.The Trump administration is trying to legislate trans people out of existence | Judith LevineRead moreSomething similar seems to have happened on Friday, when the Trump administration, facing a deadline set byCongressto release the totality of the Epstein files,published about 13,000of the reportedly hundreds of thousands of documents in their possession relating toJeffrey Epsteinand the various law enforcement investigations into his trafficking and sexual abuse of underage girls. Once again, the documents seemed to largely reflect information that had already been made public; they also appeared to be selectively redacted in ways tailored to preserve the president’s interests and disparage or embarrass his enemies. Once again, the highly partial release from the Trump administration raises questions much more readily than it supplies answers.The partial release of the documents represents a political defeat for Donald Trump. Long opposed to releasing the files, Trump came under fire from within his own party last month when congressional Republicans includingThomas Massey, Majorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Macesided with Democrats in demanding the release of the Epstein files. Trump’s concentrated effort to delay or prevent the release, which reportedly includedheavy pressure on the congressmembers, proved futile; he reversed course and signed the bill passed by Congress on 19 November that mandated that all the documents be released by the justice department. The partial release came late in the afternoon on the Friday before Christmas, with much of the nation’s attention away from politics and toward the upcoming holiday. Still, congressmembers argued that the Department of Justiceviolated the law, which demanded a full release of the Epstein files within 30 days of passage: Thomas Masseywrotethat the release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law”.This is not to say that nothing in the files is disturbing. Photographs, in particular, paint a disturbing image of the financier. In his Manhattan townhouse, a room that seems to have been dedicated to Epstein’s abuse contains amassage table, various lotions and oils, and largeartworks depicting nude womenon the walls. Most of Epstein’s homes in Manhattan and the Virgin Islands appear to be decorated with artwork depicting nude female figures and spotted with framed photographs of adolescent girls,whose faces are redactedin the released images. (Epstein had no children.)Many of the documents pertain to the two major investigations of Epstein’s abuse: the first, which began with the Palm Beach police in 2005 and culminated in Epstein serving a markedly lenient sentencebrokered by the then US attorney and later Trump labor secretary Alexander Acosta, and the second investigation, begun by federal authorities in 2019, which was curtailed by Epstein’s death in jail that year.There is also evidence of the government’s failures to investigate Epstein or to take the reports of his sexual predation seriously. Included in the documents is a report of a1996 complaintabout Epstein’s interest in child abuse images made to the FBI by Maria Farmer, a young artist whoonce worked for Epstein, who told authorities that the financier had stolen nude photographs and negatives that she had made of her younger sisters, then aged 12 and 16, and had asked her to photograph girls at swimming pools for him. “EPSTEIN is now threatening that if she tells anyone about the photos he will burn her house down,” the complaint reads. The FBI took no action on Farmer’s complaint; she says she was sexually assaulted around that time by Epstein and his girlfriend and procuress, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a prison sentence for sex trafficking. It would be almost another decade before law enforcement bothered to look into what Epstein was doing to girls.Other images show how routinized or banal Epstein’s abuse of girls had become. Notes taken from aNovember 2004 voicemailread, “I have a female for him.” One particularly disturbingimage, a Post-it, reads in a bubbly, childlike handwriting: “Cannot come at 7PM tomorrow b/c of soccer.” Some of the redactions appear to have been made to protect the identities of Epstein’s victims. One law enforcement list –labeled “Masseuses” – is completely blacked out, except for the numbers enumerating the names. They goup to 254.Trump does not appear often in the files that were released on Friday, but there are marks of his friendship with Epstein. He appears in photos in a drawer, in animage which was briefly removedfrom the public files over the weekend before being restored after a public outcry. In alegal complaintfiled in a Manhattan court, a woman who says she was recruited by Maxwell as a 13-year-old at summer camp claimed that Epstein took her, then 14, to meet Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. “Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J Trump, Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, ‘This is a good one, right?’” the complaint says. The claims echorecent reportingfrom the New York Times, in which one teenager’s mother says that as a 14-year-old model, her daughter was told to “dress sexy” for a party at Mar-a-Lago, where she was repeatedly offered alcohol.We’re pastors. The fight against Maga Christianity starts locally | Doug Pagitt and Lori WalkeRead moreBut if the files released on Friday offer little information about Donald Trump, theyheavily feature Bill Clinton, the former president who was a longtime associate of Epstein’s. In images, Clinton is pictured repeatedly socializing with Epstein. In one photo, taken onboard a private plane, Clinton poses with a very young woman perched on the arm of his chair, her face redacted.Perhaps the Department of Justice released these images of Clinton hoping to shift the political consequences of the Epstein scandal on to Democrats. But anyone pictured in the Epstein documents, or who can be reasonably suspected of having known about Epstein’s activities and associated with him any way, is someone the Democratic party is better off without. Clinton, in particular, is a man with numerous credible allegations of sexual misconduct that should havedisqualified himfrom good standing within his party long ago; if that was not enough, his discredited style of politics should have been. His will be no great loss.The Epstein scandal is not going away, and neither is the public outrage over Trump’s association with the dead pedophile. At its core, the Epstein saga is a metaphor for the corruption of the American elite: their amorality, their immunity from consequence, their densely incestuous relationships of mutual protection. A decade ago, Trump swept into power by wielding anger at that elite to his own advantage. But the Epstein story has revealed to everyone that he was part of that rotten core all along.

While Trump has not gone as far as Stalin, his administration’s persecution of climate researchers could ultimately lead to many millions of deaths from increases in extreme weather and sea level rise in the United States and across the world.Six years ago, we warned inan op-ed for the Guardianof the dangers of climate Lysenkoism during Trump’s first presidential term. Little did we know that there would be a second term and an even more extreme war against scientific reality.The closure of NCAR wasannounced on X, the Trump administration’s preferred propaganda platform, byRussell Vought, the director of the office of management and budget.He laughably described NCAR as “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country”, but it is transparently part of the Trump administration’s promotion of wilful ignorance about climate change.We both have direct experience of the deep expertise and careful methodology of the many generations of scientists who have worked at NCAR, a stark contrast with the blatant mischaracterisation offered by Vought.He is the architect of climate Lysenkoism during Trump’s second term, and Vought laid out his plans to eliminate all governmental knowledge and understanding of climate change in hisProject 2025manifesto during the presidential campaign.Vought was also behindthe Trump budget proposalearlier this year that proposed to end funding for most government laboratories and institutions that carry out any work related to climate change.Fortunately, Congress rejected most of the funding cuts in the administration’s budget, but Vought will no doubt try again next year as part of the administration’s promotion of climate Lysenkoism.While it is difficult to understand the workings of Donald Trump’s mind, his administration’s pretence that climate change does not exist is in line with his ambition to make the United States and the rest of the world more dependent on American oil, gas and coal.Trump’s presidential campaign received at least $75m from oil and gas interests,according to media reports, and he promised to repay their investments through his administration’s support for more exploration and production.The administration’s war on climate researchers helps to shield oil and gas executives from criticism of the damage that their industry is causing.We are both seeing first-hand the impact of this at theannual meeting of the American Geophysical Unionin New Orleans, where scientists usually gather to discuss the latest advancements in climate research.This year, there are far fewer climate scientists taking part, with many federally funded researchers having lost their jobs or had their budgets slashed.However, there are signs that the administration’s attempt to promote a bogus version of climate science is not advancing quite as smoothly as they had hoped.In July, the Department of Energy published a ludicrous report that attempted to present a revisionist account of established climate science.The report, calledA Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the US Climate, was commissioned by Chris Wright, the former head of the oil and gas company Liberty Energy, whom Donald Trump selected to be energy secretary and chief propagandist.The report was written by five scientists who were obviously selected to produce a version of climate science that was aligned with the administration’s political agenda.It was clearly intended tosupport an attempt by the Environmental Protection Agency, launched on the same day, to overturn the supreme court’s so-calledendangerment finding, which requires the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.However, a group of more than 85 climate scientistscomprehensively debunkedWright’s report in September, exposing numerous fundamental errors and falsehoods. They showed that the Department of Energy report was a blatant example of policy-based evidence-making.In addition, the highly respected and authoritative National Academy of Sciences publishedits own assessmentin September that concluded “the evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs [greenhouse gases] is beyond scientific dispute”.It is now widely expected that the comprehensive demolition of Wright’s report means the Environmental Protection Agency will drop references to the science when it publishes in the new year its updated case for overturning the endangerment finding.Sadly, this setback is unlikely to stop the Trump administration’s assault on researchers, and its Soviet-style campaign to prevent Americans and the rest of the world from knowing the truth about climate change.The Trump administration continues to act as if the story of the ransacking of the library of Alexandria is a playbook instead of a cautionary tale.Professor Michael Mann is the presidential distinguished professor and director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania, and co-author with Peter Hotez ofScience Under Siege; Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political ScienceExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionClimate crisisDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Marked on the surface by protests, political pendulum swings and spectacular scandals, most of the region has, since the democratisation of the 1980s and 1990s, remained firmly democratic and free of war between states. Though scarred by the violence of armed groups and increasingly powerful criminal organisations, it has, by and large, lived up to its self-assumed moniker of a “zone of peace”.Which is why this year has felt so jarring. Throughout 2025, the first year of Donald Trump’s second term, analysts have obsessively parsed potential US military incursions into a hemisphere once defined by its unified defence of national sovereignty. But the fixation on whether Washington’sescalating pressureon Nicolás Maduro presages a physical military invasion of Venezuela has distracted from the real story: the largershift towards direct intervention has already happened, and it has faced remarkably little resistance. More than 100 people have been killed in US maritime strikes that experts characterise asextrajudicial executions, and the loudest objections have come not from Latin American presidents or regional organisations, but from the US Congress.Washington doesn’t need an invasion to upend the hemispheric order; Trump is already its new centre of gravity. He has redefined US power with an imperial restoration that no longer bothers with the “greater good” narratives Washington once used to justify its actions. The so-calledDonroe doctrineoperates openly as a disciplinary regime – transactional, punitive, unadorned – which is perfectly aligned with the hemisphere’s political shifts.Trump’s influence is now so dominant that elections themselves are won or lost by him, or rather by his chosen candidates. In Honduras’s presidential contest, hisendorsement of Nasry Asfuraand threats to cut assistance if voters chose differently became central to the race, echoing his October meddling in Argentina’s midterms. Moves that once would have sparked uproar now pass as routine, save for a small circle of outraged experts.This landscape is held together by a governing method that fuses volatility, exception and reward. Trump’s approach is more flexible, and more calculated, than the rhetoric suggests. The 28 lethal maritime strikes coexist with abrupt concessions, such as lifting tariffs on Brazil after it failed to sway the courts handling Jair Bolsonaro’s cases. Inconsistency is the strategy: it fractures coordination, generates dependency and forces governments into solitary, reactive decision-making.One of the administration’s most powerful tools has been the expansion of exceptions, zones where ordinary rules no longer apply. Migrants were the first category, stripped of legal protections. Then came deportees dispatched to third countries through improvised agreements; alleged narco-traffickers killed in extraterritorial operations; and now Venezuela, where illegalmaritime strikestarget an internationally isolated regime. With few willing to defend Maduro, the muted response to dozens of deaths has effectively redrawn the limits of what norms Washington can violate without consequence. Every exception carves a new normal.Under Trump, the region has developed a stark dichotomy: obedient allies and ideological enemies. Leaders such asNayib Bukeleof El Salvador,Javier Mileiof Argentina andDaniel Noboaof Ecuador have aligned tightly with Washington and been rewarded with financing, security cooperation and diplomatic favour. Paraguay and Bolivia are angling to rapidly follow suit. Caribbean and Central American nations have bartered migration enforcement, military staging grounds or security concessions simply to stay in Washington’s good graces.In this context, the most effective resistance to Trump’s policies has been national and diplomatic rather than regional. In fact, the only countries that have managed a partly successful pushback are Brazil andMexico. Their leaders, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Claudia Sheinbaum – ideological adversaries of Trump – practise a form of pragmatic resistance: no open rupture, but no alignment either.After months of failing to bend Brazil’s judiciary in his efforts to free Bolsonaro, Trump was forced to sit down with Lula to negotiate, and has backtracked on tariffs andsanctions againsta supreme court judge. Sheinbaum has cultivated the role of “Trump whisperer”: she pairs cooperation on migration and trade with symbolic gestures on drug policy and a firm discursive rejection of any interference in Mexican sovereignty, all while avoiding the ad-hominem attacks that shut down diplomatic channels. These functional strategies stand in sharp contrast to the sterile confrontation pursued by Colombia’s Gustavo Petro.Petro illustrates the opposite dynamic. Byconfronting Trumphead on, he exposed his government to punitive measures without altering Washington’s behaviour – a risky gambit aimed at shoring up domestic support but one that underscores a new regional axiom: loud resistance without collective backing is now a losing strategy. Trump has even singled out Colombia as anew potential frontin his war against “narcoterrorism”, a malleable, disciplinary label that could be invoked to justify US military action on other countries’ territory across the region.Meanwhile, the institutions that once scaffolded regional diplomacy have been hollowed out. Efforts to negotiate a transition in Venezuela have collapsed repeatedly, most recently after the 2024 elections, though Sheinbaum and Lula have recently offered to mediate. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) summit with the EU in November avoided condemning the US strikes. The Summit of the Americas, scheduled for this month, was cancelled altogether. Sheinbaum’sappeal for UN actionlast week had the air of a formality – the right thing to say in a moment of tension, but with little prospect of practical impact. If anything, it underscored how weak multilateral bodies have become in the current diplomatic climate.Trump’s approach to Venezuela repeats the mistakes of the past | Austin SaratRead moreThe left, once the hemisphere’s moral counterweight to US power, has lost its bearings. Thepink tideoffered a shared language that fused nationalism, social inclusion and anti-imperialism into a coherent political project. Today that vocabulary is fractured; the political energy that sustained it has evaporated at both national and regional levels. Trumpist foreign policy has a similar tone to the far right’s winning message in the region’s national politics. It feeds on disillusionment with corruption, insecurity and institutional stagnation, offering a repertoire – order, authority, action – that feels more plausible to large sectors of society than calls for inclusion or solidarity.The contrast with 20 years ago is striking. In 2005, pink tide governments, electorally strong and ideologically confident, gathered in Mar del Plata in Argentina to defeat George W Bush’s Free Trade of the Americas Agreement. Anti-imperialism once formed the common political grammar of the Latin American left. That consensus has evaporated. In a recentBloomberg/Atlas poll, 53% of Latin American respondents said they would support US military intervention to remove Maduro. It is only one data point, but it captures a broader transformation: the region no longer believes in the collective narrative that once constrained Washington.Trump’s revived imperial posture is succeeding not only because of US coercive power, but because Latin America’s left no longer persuades. His influence draws as much from the left’s ideological exhaustion as from Washington’s strength. The region’s politics has drifted in ways that both accompany Trump’s advance and open space for it – and he has been quick to consolidate that new terrain.Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires.

There’s the ongoing concern about national security, and questions about how something like this could have happened. But to me, as a public health expert and Jewish Australian, perhaps the most important conversation we are finally having is the one about guns.Public health experts have beenwarning about gunsfor at least a decade. In the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, Australians came together and implemented a suite of measures to curb gun violence across the country. And it worked. Prior to 1996, we saw about one mass shooting a year. In the decades since, we have seen vanishingly few major events, and none with a death toll anywhere close to the shootings of the 80s and 90s.Even during the Bondi tragedy, our gun laws were not entirely useless.It’s been reportedthat the two shooters might have been armed with bolt-action rifles and at least one straight-pull shotgun. These are firearms that can only fire a single bullet at a time and require the shooter to perform a physical action to ready the next round. While these guns can be fired quite quickly, to devastating effect, they are still far slower and more cumbersome than the high-capacity, semi-automatic rifles used in US mass shootings. There would’ve been far more deaths at Bondi if the shooters had been able to get the guns that are available overseas.Gun crackdown and controversial protest laws to be passed in NSW despite Coalition split over firearmsRead moreBut the terrible toll of the attack shows us that our gun laws are failing. They were built in the late 90s with the best of intentions, but the decades have worn away their efficacy. There arenow more guns in Australiathan there were before the Port Arthur shooting, with some individuals living in our cities holding collections into the hundreds of firearms.We have been complacent and it has cost us terribly.Since the Bondi attack, there have been many announcements about new gun laws being enacted.New South Wales in particularwill shortly introduce a suite of measures to reduce the risk that we all face from guns. The federal government has announced anew gun buyback, and we may finally see a national firearms registry despite the challenges of coordinating state and federal governments across Australia.All of this is only possible if we work together. AsAnthony Albanese said, we are only as strong as our weakest link when it comes to gun laws. It’s the very nature of Australian federation – laws in one state are much less meaningful if you can circumvent them with a drive across the border.Preventing another Bondi requires national cohesion. And unfortunately, we have already seen cracks in the facade. The inevitable response that “guns don’t kill people, people kill people”. This is true in the same sense that planes don’t transport people, pilots do. Yes, planes can’t fly themselves, but it would be quite challenging for a Qantas captain to get 500 people to Singapore without the A380. The mass slaughter that we saw in Bondi would be all but impossible without firearms, and would’ve been far less damaging if the alleged terrorists had not had access to the guns that they did.There are legitimate reasons that Australians need guns. It is incredibly hard to manage livestock or cull pests without firearms in many places. We cannot simply remove guns from our country entirely, because in some cases they are indispensable.What we can do – what we must do – is ensure that gun laws are updated to better match the world we live in today. Our legislation has long been the envy of the world, but time and distance has done its work and we are no longer as safe as we once were. It is vital that we take the lessons of Bondi to heart, and ensure that future generations of Australians are as protected as we have been for decades.As one friend said after the Bondi attack “things like this just don’t happen here”. They don’t, but only because we as a country have worked to keep ourselves safe. As nightmarish as the attack was, hopefully we can at least ensure that it is the last one we ever see.Dr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist and science communicator and a senior research fellow at the University of Wollongong.

What a shame Labour wavers about saying soMon 22 Dec 2025 12.06 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 13.18 ESTShareWarning. This column contains good news, when it is an (un)truth widely acknowledged that only grim stories attract public attention. News must be something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed, says the old maxim. Well, battalions of interests want to suppress good news: the overwhelmingly Tory or Reform UK press and antisocial media sites don’t want any stories to surface that might do credit to aLabourgovernment.Among this deluge of disinformation and malevolence, when asked, a sour and disengaged electorate struggles to think of anything good this government has done. True, the prime minister and his cabinet are partly to blame for failing to tell their story, paint their picture, draw us a map of where they are going and why. They too often do good by stealth, afraid of what the right and business might say if they dare trumpet the strong social justice themes that drive most of what they do. But lay out what the government has done and there it is, plain as a pikestaff. There have been blunders, missteps, bad timing and wrongheaded manifesto pledges, but follow the money to define its identity. What has Labour raised from whom and how was it spent? That’s what historians will look for.Labour inherited destitute, austerity-stricken public services that voters expected to be healed overnight by a “change” government, despite a stagnant economy, deep debt, unfunded policies and an empty Treasury. Forget Harold Wilson’s verity that a week can be a long time in politics – a year and a half is not very long for the radical changes the government has made already.The list has to begin with Labour’s forever priority: children come first – this time with free breakfasts, cheaper uniforms and 500,000 more qualifying for free school meals in England, and 550,000 due to be lifted out of poverty across the UK with the abolition of thepernicious two-child limit. Nurseries for all is a liberation for families – and crucially a great educational boost, so let’s welcome 1,000 newBest Startfamily hubs in England, resurrecting the Blair-Brown flagship Sure Start policy. Many may not notice, but unsurprisingly I’m told Labour’s own polling finds that families with young children certainly do, when free childcare makes some half a million English families as much as£7,500 a year per child better off. It may take time to percolate, but these policies are monumental. Also in England you can add to that the restoration of arts to the school curriculum, and the start of a revived youth service with250 youth centres, newFE colleges, extraconstruction coursesandapprenticeships. This is familiar Labour turf: children come first.Other forever Labour beliefs are becoming visible, too: the railways are being renationalised, with rail and bus fares frozen in England, and pay-per-mileroad pricingfor all electric cars by 2028, to help promote public transport. The Employment Rights Act is a founding Labour principle, vastly improving working conditions in England, Scotland and Wales: how were zero-hours contracts ever permitted where people get no notice of their hours or wages each week, unions are barred from workplaces and workforces fired and rehired on worse pay? A new chapter has begun for millions of workers.Of course, business and its press protest – as they do about aUK minimum wage raisedby 6.7% in year one, plus another 4.1% in April. That’s a shift in power towards the workforce, after decades of money and muscle transferred to employers, causing soaring inequality. The government braved tidal waves of industry anger when employers, not workers, were made to pay an extra £25bn in national insurance. Yet the message of a pro-worker government fails to reach its target. Instead, a belligerent head of Unite is now joined by an even more anti-government new Unison leader, making a threat to Labour that, “never again will weprop up politicians hostile to unions”, despite this being the most pro-union government since 1979.The NHS staggers on – but with more than 2,000 extra GPs and 170 newcommunity diagnostic centres, waiting times havestarted to fall. Net migration has fallen steeply bytwo-thirds(which maynot be good news), but small boat arrivals rising is bad news. Wages have risen bymore than prices, but people don’t feel it yet. The Renters’ Rights Act protects 11 million private tenants in England from no-fault evictions. On spending,the largest sumshave gone to the NHS, towards the building of 1.5m new homes in England, and on green energy investment (£63bn). Animal welfare always gets a boost under Labour, who have now pickeda useful fightwith pro-hunting Reform and the Tories.The right to die bill will pass for England and Wales, thanks to government efforts. Theturn towards Europe accelerates, including rejoining Erasmus – the EU’s education and training programme –last week. Recognising the state of Palestine took too long, but no other UK government did it. For all Donald Trump’s extreme racist abuse of mayor Sadiq Khan, London’s air quality has reachedlegal clean limits for nitrogen oxidefor the first time, crime in the capitalkeeps falling(except for phone theft), and in recent years Khan has surpassed his own targets forbuilding council homes.For flavour, Wandsworth, once Margaret Thatcher’s flagship borough, now has its first Labour council since 1978,its mayor declaring: “As a borough of sanctuary and a safe haven for people who have fled war and persecution, let’s show these youngsters some warmth and love,” as he topped up donations to give every refugee child a £50 Christmas gift, unafraid of Reform-spread refugee hate.There’s plenty more, but what’s the use when this is the most unpopular government led by themost unpopular prime ministerever? (Note that the last four PMs have all been the most unpopular during their tenure). Loathing of leaders and politicians is widespread across Europe, opening the gates to demagogues. Blame the near stagnation since the financial crash all those years ago – but there are glimmers of better times from the Guardian’s economics editor,Heather Stewart, and the Financial Times economics writerChris Giles, who says: “The UK economy is not nearly as bad as you’ve been told”. The doom is overdone.What’s missing, as cabinet ministers now say more loudly, is that red thread signalling the nature of this government. Wavering and wobbling, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were never sure about daring to tell that story, peppering it with Reform-wooing distractions. Late, as ever, Labour seems to be shunningthe Maurice Glasman/Morgan McSweeney formulaof tacking right on some social policies, realising thattwice as many votersare fleeing leftwards as right.Too much is still left undone. Where is electoral reform to protect the democratic future? More than 4 million children are poor, the young are losing hope of owning a home, public services are struggling and everything needs money that isn’t there. This often feels like an unhappy country – angry, grudging, cynical. But don’t underestimate a government that’s doing far more than it gets credit for.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerWorkers' rightsChildrenMinimum wageYoung peopleRenting propertycommentShareReuse this content"

I’ll never complain again. It’sChristmasDay. I just want my old life back.”I hadn’t suffered a severe medical episode. I was just … a bit too high.This is a cautionary tale for anyone contemplating softening the sharp edges of a family Christmas withedible cannabis products. You may instead slice them clean off landing face-first on your bedroom floor.It wasn’t my aim in accepting the gift of a large python lolly to physically remove myself from Christmas lunch. I love Christmas, and Ireallyloveroast potatoes, gravy and pudding, but the family gathered round the table can be tricky. My partner’s parents would sooner crawl inside the rear end of an unstuffed turkey than talk about money. Their sociopolitical views are closely aligned with those of the current US administration. By contrast, my dad is an unnervingly unfiltered, foul-mouthed refugee – a hyper-polyglot peasant-savant. His favourite thing to talk about is money.Who had the trickiest job this year? The makers of joyful, uplifting Christmas ads | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAdding to this mix is my mum, who cannot bear confrontation of any sort; my 12-year-old daughter, whose favourite topic is politics and favourite pastime is arguing and my 17-year-old daughter, whose interest in the family is as strong at Christmas as it is the rest of the year.That edible was not a want – it was a need. I don’t drink and, while sobriety has some upsides, it offers no good answer to the question, “how can I withstand a sermon on the healing benefits of a parasite cleanse, while next to me there is a vigorous conversation regarding the perils of wokeism?”I cooked up my edible plan in mid-November, cheerfully informing anyone who inquired after my festive plans thatthisChristmas I would not be succumbing to rage or despair. I would be “justa little bit” high. On hearing the plan, my neighbour offered me an edible lolly from her stash. The ones I had were a bit “blah”, I’d explained, perhaps not quite up to the task. She reassured me hers would be just the ticket. “They’re nice and mellow,” she said. Her mum was around for a visit and she concurred: “Very nice and gentle.”It’s worth noting that, while I’m no stranger to edibles, I’m not a regular consumer. The side-effects I’d previously experienced amounted to nothing more than an increased appreciation for barbecue sausages and cushioned sun loungers – I had no reason to expect Christmas Day would be any different.On Christmas Eve I stayed up late wrapping presents before being prematurely awoken the next morning by children old enough to know better. My exhaustion was compounded by having spent December working in a bookshop, where customers descended in vast numbers and formed thick knotted lines that never seemed to thin. As I sat on the sofa waiting for the lunch guests to arrive, heavy-lidded and almost drunk with fatigue, a thought passed through my head: “You are too fragile for substances. This will not go well.”And I kept that thought in my head, right up to the moment family began to arrive. I stuffed half a python into my mouth, checked on the potatoes and waited for the mellow feeling to kick in. Then – because I’m rubbish at waiting – I gobbled the remaining half of it, recalling as I swallowed the tail that I’d been advised to stick to a quarter.At lunch, with barely a parsnip in my belly, my plate began to warp. The outlines of my chicken breast blurred. Soon I could no longer hold my knife and fork.Seated next to my in-laws, their voices alternately sharpening and fading, my heart began to pound. I made a beeline for the stairs, grabbing a daughter . “Tell your dad that he needs to come upstairs right away,” I hissed. I made it as far as my youngest’s room before collapsing. My partner, on learning what I’d done, dragged me into my bedroom where I arranged myself face-down on the floor. It was here I would remain for the next five hours, while the rest of the family politely chewed their wings and thighs and tried to ignore the spectre of the hallucinating matriarch upstairs.A hidden life in the era of social media can still change history, as the story of Jesus shows | Justine TohRead moreI had occasional visitors. My sister-in-law, an earthy Floridian who once lived in the Peruvian jungle with a shaman, sat on the floor and held my hand as I insisted I needed to go to hospital. Carefully – the way you would tell a toddler that putting a fork in a power point is dangerous – she explained that this was not a good idea The bright lights would make things worse.My daughters came upstairs to see if my “migraine” was getting better. I said: “I need to be very quiet and still.” This was all the encouragement they needed to begin furiously arguing. If there’s anything worse than children yelling in your ear as you wonder if you’ll ever regain the capacity to distinguish a door from a window, I haven’t experienced it.Then, suddenly, at the precise moment the guests began to leave, I dropped back into reality. The euphoria of being able to see again almost made the horror of the preceding hours worth it.

Their outcomes will affect all our futuresMon 22 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 12.21 ESTShareIn Spain, two cities face the same crisis, but are responding in fundamentally different ways. Over the past decade, the cost of housing in Madrid and Barcelona has soared – with rents rising by about60%and sale prices by90%– leaving young people, working families and retired peoplestruggling to stayin their homes or even find one.Yet, while one city is betting everything on construction and giving free rein to big investors, the other is cautiously trying to steer the housing market towards the public good, despite political and institutional constraints.This is more than a national contrast. It’s a story of two cities and two competing visions now taking root acrossEurope.The great housing grabWhile Spain’s economycontinues to growon paper, the reality on the ground tells a different story – one of worsening inequality and housing exclusion. In the past decade, more than half of all homes have been boughtwithout a mortgage, a sign that many are being acquired not by those in need of housing but by those who already own property. The number of people who own at least 10 homes has jumped by 20%.This is what I call thegreat housing grab. Since the mortgage crisis of 2008, more than1.3m unitshave entered Spain’s rental market. They weren’t newly built, but homes lost by working-class families and scooped up by investors, including large private equity firms. The conservative government in power between 2011 and 2018 not only handed out tax breaks and public money through a massive bailout of the banks, but also rewrote tenancy laws to turn tenants themselves into profitable assets for those institutions.The ideal of a middle-class society of homeowners is collapsing. Those already asset rich are buying up more homes and outcompeting working families. And those families, if lucky, now rent those same homes back at inflated prices, enriching the wealthy. For many, the only hope is to inherit, assuming their parents don’t have to sell their home to live out their later years with dignity.The current crisis didn’t appear overnight. It’s the product of decades of government intervention designed to turn housing into a financial asset. Since the 1980s, Spain has followed a familiar playbook:dismantling social housing(now barely 2-3% of all homes), removingrent controlsfor new contracts, offeringtax breaks to ownersand fuelling massivemortgage debt.This model triggered successive construction booms that were accompanied by steep price increases. As long as everyone seemed to benefit from ever-rising asset values, few questioned the model. But it eventually proved unsustainable, pushing younger and poorer households out of the market. The 2008 crisis became a stark reminder that the neoliberal recipe had ultimately failed.Since the great meltdown, those left behind have fought back in successive waves. After years of tenant mobilisation, the Spanish government – led by a progressive coalition – finally passed anew housing lawin 2023. For the first time, it gave regional and local authorities the power to cap rents, raise taxes on vacant homes and ban agencies from charging tenants fees. Additional measures in 2024 and 2025 have marked a shift away from neoliberal orthodoxy, such as extending the social housing system, ordering the removal ofunlicensed Airbnb listings, or openingproceedings againstreal-estate companies that charge unlawful fees.Despite the new law, loopholes and tax rules that encourage speculative investment are still in place, undermining efforts to reshape the housing market in the public interest. And, while the central government partly sets the framework, it is in the regions and cities where the real battle is fought – and their responses could not be more different.Madrid: a red carpet for the wealthyMadrid, long governed by the conservative People’s party, has openly boycotted the new law. Its leaders present the whole urban region as a haven where developers and funds face “no limits, no intervention”. The regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has personallycourted global investorsat events organised by the Blackrock investment company, assuring them, “You are in the best place, at the best moment, to invest.”These words are not empty rhetoric. Madrid hassold off public housingto private equity funds, opposed rental regulation and is promotingmass construction. Under the mantra of “build, build, build”, it hopes supply alone will solve the crisis, easing land-use rules and fast tracking permits, claiming that red tape is to blame. Yet this approach has a track record of failure in Spain and beyond. Recent studies show thatsupply constraintsdo not explain house prices, and that simplybuilding moredoes not guarantee affordability.Barcelona: a city fighting back, but struggling to winSome 400 miles to the northeast, in Catalonia, the approach couldn’t be more different. The Catalan government quickly adopted the new rules and the first results suggest they are having an effect: average rents for new contracts in Barcelonahave fallen by 6.4%, whereas in Madrid they have continued to rise.However, the law contained aloophole: mid-term contracts (up to 11 months) and room rentals were left unregulated. Asanticipated, many landlords and brokershave exploitedthis gap, converting standard leases into temporary ones, quadrupling rents and charging exorbitant fees. Despite repeated announcements, no new legislation or effective sanctions have followed.At the same time, the Catalan government has recently approved new measures to curb speculation and strengthen social housing. These include aban on tourist rentalsin 140 municipalities – a move Barcelona has alsocommitted to, to be implemented by 2028;tax reformsthat deter large-scale speculation and help first-time buyers, provided the homes they purchaseremain price-cappedin the future; and the public acquisition of private homes through theright of first refusal. A growing share ofnew developmentsare also being designated as permanently protected housing, ensuring long-term affordability for both public and private housing.Two cities, one choiceBarcelona and Madrid represent not just different policies, but different futures.Across Europe, the financial sector has pushed up house prices. It’s a political timebomb | Tim WhiteRead moreOne builds under public-interest rules, requiring part of new developments to remain permanently affordable, and combines this with rent controls and tax measures that aim to curb speculation. The other builds under the banner of “abundance” and increasing supply, loosening land regulations, speeding up permits and cutting taxes for developers.It’s too early to say which model will prevail, but experience and research show that simply building more and leaving housing to the market does not bring prices down.Barcelona’s story shows that regulation matters, but it is not enough. Without strong enforcement, and without tackling the incentives that reward the use of housing as a financial asset, even the most well intentioned reforms fall short.These two cities offer a choice between two paths: one where housing remains a source of unlimited profit, and another that tries – though so far inconsistently – to rebuild it as a social good.Because, at its core, this is not just about housing. It is about whether we stop the spiral of inequality that enriches the few while eroding the living standards of a growing majority, and the future of the cities we live in.Jaime Palomera is a researcher on housing and inequality, author of The Hijacking of Housing, and co-founder of the Barcelona Urban Research Institute (IDRA) and the Tenants’ UnionExplore more on these topicsSpainThe housing crisis in EuropeEuropeBarcelonaCataloniacommentShareReuse this content"

But make no mistake – the bloodshed won’t end while the Russian president believes he can still winMon 22 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 16.24 ESTShareVladimir Putin’s marathonpress conferenceon 19 December, an annual year-end event, offered no evidence that Russia may abandon the goals the president set for his “special military operation” against Ukraine in February 2022: conquering Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. True to form, Putin seemed unperturbed that nearly four years into the war his army had managed to fully occupy only Luhansk, despite having already taken control of more than a third of that region, as well as Donetsk, by 2015.Putin’s unyielding stance shouldn’t be a surprise. Soon after the invasion, Russia’s State Dumaadopted legislationincorporating these four Ukrainian regions into Russia – and this month the foreign minister,Sergey Lavrov, and the deputy foreign minister,Sergei Ryabkov, reiterated Putin’s territorial claims.Russia’s inflexibility clashes with Donald Trump’s desperate efforts to achieve a political settlement by Christmas. To meet his self-imposed deadline, Trump even tried to pressure Volodymyr Zelenskyyinto surrenderingthe parts of Donetsk that Ukraine still holds. Though Zelenskyy refused, he was willing to end Ukraine’s years-longquest for Nato membershipand adopt neutrality, in exchange for solid western security guarantees.Zelenskyy’s shift won’t mollify Putin. Russia’s longstanding – and understandable – anxiety about Nato’s expansion predates him. But Putin’s 2022 war stems from something deeper, because there’s no evidence that Ukraine was any closer to formal membership in the alliance on the eve of Russia’s 2022 invasion than it had been in 2008, when,at its Bucharest summit, Nato declared that Ukraine would join its ranks at some future, but unspecified, date.Just as they had been in 2008, Nato countries have been divided on Ukraine candidacy, indeed even more so. That matters: article 10 of Nato’s 1949 founding treaty requires unanimity to admit new members. When Nato truly wants to increase its membership, it can act with speed: note the rapid induction ofFinland (April 2023)andSweden (March 2024), both of whom applied for membership in May 2022. To explain Putin’s motivation to invade Ukraine, we must take of account of grievances rooted in history.He has stated, repeatedly andat length, that Ukrainians and Russians have been one people for centuries; that their separation into two states after the USSR disintegrated was a tragedy; that Ukraine’s south and east, home to large numbers of ethnic Russians or Ukrainians whose native language is Russian, rightly belong to Russia. In short, Putin believes Russia was robbed.Still, at his press conference, Putin applauded Trump for being “absolutely sincere” in launching negotiations to end the war, adding thatRussiaremained committed to them and would end its military offensive, providing its interests are taken seriously.Putin’s flattery has a purpose, not to mention a susceptible target. Trump haspraised Putin’s “genius”. He, like Putin, hasblamed Ukrainefor starting the war. He wants a rapprochement with Russia that includes multibillion-dollarjoint investments. He hasbacked Putin’s demandthat Zelenskyy must hold elections, despite the war, to demonstrate his democratic legitimacy. He, like Putin, disdains Europe and would prefer to cut a deal that leaves the Europeans (and Ukrainians) on the sidelines. These are all reasons for Putin to court Trump and deepen the divide between the US and Europe.Despite their convergent views and Trump’s sympathy for Russia, he hasn’t produced a deal that suits Putin. Unless he does, the bloodshed will continue. It has already taken a terrible toll on Ukraine, which is no surprise: it’s the weaker side by far. The real surprise is the Russian army’s massive losses – incasualtiesandequipment. Russia’s economy is also underincreasing stressandbarely growing, though it hardly faces collapse. But Russians’ hardships, to say nothing of Ukrainians’, won’t matter as long as Putin believes his objectives remain achievable – whether at the bargaining table, by persuading Trump to keep coercing Zelenskyy, or on the battlefield.Meanwhile, the EU has taken a major step that will reduce the chances of Russia succeeding quickly on either front by ensuring that Kyiv’s coffers won’t run dry. The bloc’s leadership had hoped to use the interest earned from the €210bn (£185bn) in frozen Russian assets to bolster Ukraine. Although that plan failed because of outright opposition from a few EU members and reservations expressed by others, the EU managed to find a different solution. It willborrow €90bn(£79bn) to support Ukraine for two years – and with no repayment obligation unless Russia pays reparations, it is something no one expects.The press coverage highlighted the EU’s disunity over the frozen Russian assets, but what is really significant is that a bloc of 27 unruly sovereign states managed to come up with the money to ensureUkrainewouldn’t collapse. Just as Putin’s words ensure the war will continue, so do the EU’s deeds. The EU’s decision is also important because it shows Europe’s willingness to act independently on the war, even if it means putting distance between itself and the US.Putin thinks democracy is the west’s weakness. We have to prove him wrong | Rafael BehrRead moreIn August, Trump remarked that Americans have no stake in Ukraine’s war because they are separated from it by a “big, beautiful ocean”. Europe lacks this geographical luxury. That, along with Trump’s newNational Security Strategy, which depicts the continent as a place drowning in problems and therefore of diminishing importance to the US, may have convinced European leaders to start acting independently.GivenTrump’s suspensionof all direct military aid to Kyiv in March, Europe’s assistance alone may not be enough to ensure that Ukrainians obtain a peace that they deem just. Then again, this has been a war of surprises, the greatest of which is that Ukraine’s army remains unvanquished.Europe has thrown Ukraine a lifeline, but we should be under no illusions. Ukraine will continue to fight with its back to the wall against an adversary that has vastly more of every war-relevant resource – and whose leader’s idea of compromise is indistinguishable from his adversary’s capitulation. Barring a sudden change in Russia’s position on the territorial question, Trump will be denied the Christmas gift he yearns for. Albeit each in their own way, Putin’s press conference and the EU’s loan package for Ukraine make it all but certain that the war will extend into the coming year.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies.

No thanks: just give me dinnerMon 22 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 16.25 ESTShareIt’s lovely going out for dinner in London. It’s a gastro capital with cuisines from all around the world. One night, Indian, French the next, Peruvian, Ethiopian. You can travel the globe without leaving Hackney.This time of year, I’m super busy planning the un-Royal Variety show – a punk pastiche of the royal version – and so I can’t be bothered with meal prep and washing up, and find myself eating out an awful lot. Most food trends I can get behind (with the exception of truffle – yuck!). But one pernicious dining trend that refuses to go away and which I detest is “small plates”.My heart sinks and I become inwardly furious when I sit down and the waiter asks: “Have you been here before?” “No, it’s our first time.” “Well, we do ‘small plates’ and we suggest you order between three and 20 per person.”It’s even more annoying than QR code menus. The last thing you want to do when you sit down with an old friend for a catch-up is immediately get your phone out and start loading internet pages and inputting your bank details – it’s a leftover from Covid that should be abolished.But back to small plates. People think I’m a hipster, being an east London drag queen, but I’ve got nothing on the purveyors of “caulifower bites”. Suddenly you’re handing out a tenner here, a tenner there, for tiny saucers of pomegranate seeds, things sprinkled in petals and a random blow-torched lettuce leaf. Just give me a bloody dinner!And then your friend inevitably says: “Let’s just get lots of things and share.” NOOO!!! Don’t make me share my dinner with you as if we’re a pack of wild cats. I will gladly share a lot of things with strangers in a Berlin dungeon, but I absolutely refuse to share a piece of pig’s cheek in Haggerston.I’m 53. I grew up in Kent in the 1970s in a perfectly normal working-class, borderline lower-middle-class household, the kind so wonderfully explored in Mike Leigh movies. It was the kind of home where the food was dished from the pan on to the plate. And then the whole plate was plopped in front of you and you were told to eat it all up – or you couldn’t go and watch Grange Hill.In small-plates hell, you end up trying to reconstruct a normal meal and paying twice the price for it. Death to small plates – that’s the hill I will die on. Unless you’re in Spain, of course; I love a spot of tapas, but that’s different. Andalucia: do your thing, honey. But Dalston: oh, grow up, and give me a pie.Jonny Woo is a performer, drag artist, writer, and co-owner of The Divine, he will be hosting his Un-Royal Variety atSoho Theatre Walthamstow26-28 November 2026.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe hill I will die onRestaurantscommentShareReuse this content"

This summer, the Palestinian journalistbroke downwhile reporting on starvation in his home town that is now a war zone. Abystander told him: “Persist, Anas, you are our voice”.But al-Sharif’s popularity in Gaza made him a target. In July, international agencieswarned of the dangerhe was in as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks, falsely labelling him a Hamas terrorist. His employer, Al Jazeera, insisted he restrict his reporting to the more protected al-Shifa hospital after his father and many colleagues were killed. In August, a few months short of his 29th birthday, al-Sharif and six others were killed in a direct attack on a media tent next to the hospital.In a posthumous posthe said: “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice.”Anas al-Sharif is just one of 67 media professionals who were killed in 2025 while doing their jobs, identified by press freedom advocates Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in itsannual report on journalists’ safety. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) goes even further – theyfound 111 journalistshave been killed in 2025, nearly half in Gaza.Each one of these deaths is a tragedy, an abuse of the right of journalists to bear witness. Yet it is worth remembering the story of al-Sharif, not least because he became one of the highest profile examples of the tactic of discrediting journalists by accusing them of bias.TheIsraeli military confirmedthat it targeted al-Sharif, claiming he led a Hamas terrorist cell and was “responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians” – somehow doing all of that while spending so much time on air. He had denied these accusations many times and none of the main press freedom advocacy groups – the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), IFJ and RSF, nor the UN special agencies – have found any evidence that the allegations were true.Irene Khan, theUN special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, said: “On the one hand, Israel refuses to allow any international journalists to enter Gaza, and on the other, it ruthlessly smears, threatens, obstructs, targets and kills the few local journalists remaining as the only eyes of the outside world on the ongoing genocide.” In August 2024, the CPJcalled on Israelto stop making unsubstantiated terrorism allegations to justify its killing and mistreatment of Palestinian journalists.Fiona O’Brien, UK director of RSF, told me the young journalist’s story was a “very strong example of the way the Israelis are trying to discredit journalists without producing any credible evidence. It’s a very deliberate tactic.”It is a tactic that is working. Under an international press ban that Israel is refusing to lift – an appeal was due back in an Israeli court on 21 December – international journalists are barred fromGazaexcept on escorted military trips. The ban makes telling the sort of human stories that engage the public and lead to direct political action much harder.O’Brien tells me that not only has the ban made it harder for press freedom organisations such as RSF to provide support and safety equipment for journalists under fire, the lack of eyewitness accounts also makes it easier to discredit local journalists. In a confused world in which claim and counterclaim are spread on social media, allegations are sometimes all it takes to sow seeds of doubt. And this at a time when trust in journalism worldwide is already receding at an alarming rate.More than 240 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the Hamas attack on 7 October that started the war. Many of them, including the prominent Palestinian-American Shireen Abu Akleh, were killed by Israeli snipers while wearing a press vest. Jon Williams, executive director ofthe Rory Peck Trust, which supports independent journalism, said: “Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been the world’s eyes and ears and they have paid a terrible price. Many of them were not journalists at the start of the war but, as one has fallen, the other has picked up their camera and continued their work.”Abdullah Ali, head of international communications for the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera, told me that the network had been able to replace all of the journalists killed in Gaza this year with other Palestinian journalists. In early December, the media group moved al-Sharif’s wife and two very young children to Doha.Not long after the attack on journalists outside the al-Shifa hospital this August, the RSF filed itsfifth complaintagainst Israel at the international criminal court, alleging war crimes for its treatment of Palestinian journalists. Yet they continue to be killed with impunity. And there are signs that things are getting worse.Just four years after two journalists – Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov – were awarded the Nobel peace prize for holding the powerful to account, the world’s most powerful nation is led by someone who has made no secret of his antagonism towards his critics in the media. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has sued media organisations,including the BBC, for billions of dollars. He has banned reporters from less favoured organisations from White House briefings and cut funding for public service media. He has recently restricted visas for foreign journalists.As he welcomed Mohammed bin Salman into the Oval Office he shrugged off the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by saying “things happen”.Things do happen, including the very worst atrocities and unlawful attacks on civilians and those protected by the law. With all apologies for a miserable year end message, unless journalists continue to be able to report on such terrible things, 2026 will be no better than 2025 – and it could be much worse.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

But is saying ‘sorry’ enough?Fatma AydemirIn Germany, the neo-Nazi terrorist Beate Zschäpe has made a public display of her remorse – but remains silent on key aspects of her crimesMon 22 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 04.07 ESTShareIt’s a strange season to talk about forgiveness. While streets glow with fairy lights and shop windows promise that compassion is only a gift-box away,Germanyis once again confronted with the unresolved wounds of its recent past. The trap of the season is this: believing that every gesture of regret must be met with mercy. As if forgiveness was a resource available to anyone who is reasonable enough to move on, no matter how atrociously they have been treated.It is certainly not that simple for the families of the victims of theNational Socialist Underground(NSU). During the 2000s, the neo-Nazi terror organisation killed 10 people, nine of them immigrants, mostly small business owners, and one policewoman. Because investigators focused on probing the victims’ families and communities rather than on Nazis, the NSU was able to continue murdering without interference. German media reported on the atrocities asdie Dönermordethekebab murders, as if it was some exotic true-crime phenomenon.In 2011, when the NSU outed itself in avideoin which it claimed responsibility for the murders and several nailbomb attacks, it also exposed profound structural failures in the German state’s approach to rightwing terrorism.Subsequent inquiries revealed thatsecurity agencies had informantsin close proximity to the perpetrators, overlooked relevant intelligence, and in some casesdestroyed filesafter the group wasuncovered. As a result, the NSU case has come to be understood not only as a sequence of racist murders but as an indictment of the state’s inability – or unwillingness – to adequately recognise and confront far-right violence.Now, in ongoing proceedings surrounding the NSU, Beate Zschäpe –sentenced to lifein 2018 for her role within the NSU core cell responsible for 10 murders – recently appeared in court as a witness in arelated trial. But this time, Zschäpe took on a markedly different tone than she had before – one of remorse, or at least something that resembled it. She spoke of shame, of reconsideration, of recognition of her own guilt, which she claims only started during her own trial, ending in 2018.Back then, Zschäpedenied any involvementin the murders, and her cooperation with authorities was extremely limited. A full investigation of the murders would only have been possible with Zschäpe’s truthful testimony, since her two co-members,Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Börnhardt, had killed themselves in 2011 to evade arrest.Zschäpe had gone into hiding with the two men and had lived with them under false identities in various German cities for more than a decade. In court, she stayed silent for years. Then, in written testimony running to 53 pages, she managed to not answer any of the 300 questions asked by the victims’ relatives, who appeared in courtas co-plaintiffs. Instead, Zschäpe claimed never to have been informed in advance about the murders and bomb attacks committed by her two partners, saying she had found out about them only afterwards.Now, the 50-year-old Zschäpe has appeared in court and spoken of how “ashamed” she is. Inevitably, one has to wonder whether this shift is really a moral transformation or a more pragmatic pivot made in the hope of improving her situation in prison. Last summer, she was admitted to a neo-Nazi exit programme, promptingalarm amongthe victims’ relatives, since this could increase the chances of her early release. In 2026, Zschäpe will have served 15 years in prison, which is the minimum for a life sentence. Because of the gravity of the crimes, she will not be released next year, but the court must set a so-called minimum for her remaining term of imprisonment. Her participation in the exit programme and her public display of contrition may have an impact on the court’s decision.“There is no excuse for the murders. I will never be able to make it right,” Zschäpe said in court earlier this month. Gamze Kubasik, whose father Mehmet Kubasik was shot in the head by the NSU in 2006 in his own kiosk, was also in court that day andshouted: “Then tell us the truth!” Zschäpe responded with a silent look at Kubasik.And this silence gives more answers than all the vague words of remorse and guilt Zschäpe is now using in court. For the performance of remorse has a tradition in Germany. It fits a country that has confronted its crimes historically – or at least likes to tell itself that story. As a nation it has learned that a good mix of contrition and silence can pave the way back to social acceptance. The desire for atonement is not inherently wrong. But it becomes problematic when it is treated as a shortcut: when forgiveness is expected, although no believable effort has been made to earn it.If Zschäpe’s efforts to distance herself from the neo-Nazi ideology were sincere, she would have helped to clarify the circumstances of the murders. She can still share information, which many families are begging for, in order to understand what happened to their loved ones. But Zschäpe chooses silence. She doesn’t show by her actions that she has become a different person, she just tries to sound like one. And maybe that’s the thing with forgiveness: you don’t have to forgive somebody just because they ask for it – they have to earn it as well.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s digital platform inquiry, which was completed in mid-2019, recommended what became the news media bargaining code (NMBC). The logic was that Google and Facebook, in particular, were benefiting significantly from news content without paying for it.The ACCC recommended that a voluntary scheme of negotiation for a fair payment be tried first but this failed as it could not overcome the huge bargaining power advantage that the platforms had over the publishers.No business can keep producing without being paid for what they produce. Journalists hold power to account, they provide a journal of record as to what is going on and they allow debate based on fact. Journalism is fundamental to our democracy. Getting the NMBC right was vital and the same necessity applies to the NBI.Let’s deal with the issues.The original bargaining code was extremely successful. Three- and five-year deals were entered into by Google and Facebook with virtually all publishers, large and small, and about $1bn has been paid since its inception.But the three-year deals have expired,Facebook, or Meta, has said it will not do further dealsand the remaining deals expire in early to mid-2026.It is important to understand that the NMBC only applies to platforms that carry news; Meta has apparently said it will take news off Facebook if it were to be designated under the NMBC. Thus the need for a new approach, which has resulted in the NBI.Under the processes envisaged by the NBI consultation paper it is easy to see 18-24 months pass before new deals are in place, yet by then all NMBC deals will be ancient history. Media companies will have to contemplate laying off the staff funded by the payments. Some expired deals have been rolled over in this interim period, sometimes with much-reduced money, most have not been.Another problem is that the NBI would only apply to search and social media services. This would have been appropriate two years ago but the long delay has seen the rise of AI. ChatGPT and Anthropic are not search engines; they are now “answer engines” which often draw on news articles but with no links to them. Google’s Gemini does have links but how long will it be before it replaces Goole search?Then we have the complexity.Meta could face millions in fines for not signing content deals in AustraliaRead moreThe NBI seeks to provide an incentive for commercial deals between search and social media companies and publishers. It does this by legislating that tech companies caught by the scheme pay a charge to the government which can be reduced by the value of the deals they do with publishers – plus a further deduction percentage. So, if the further deduction is 50% you could pay 50% more by not doing deals versus what you would pay if deals were done.But how do you set the charge payment? The consultation paper talks of a percentage of revenue but revenue can fluctuate and can be subject to manipulation via transfer pricing. And setting the percentage of revenue that constitutes the charge must be done by predetermining what revenue the government thinks the deals will realise. Then how do you determine what mark-up penalty there should be for not doing deals?Most importantly, how do you ensure a balanced distribution of support among news businesses? Rather than requiring good faith bargaining and deals to be done with all eligible publishers, as the NMBC does, the NBI seeks to cap the size of the larger deals so that the bargaining obligation cannot be met by simply doing deals with a few large players. Setting this cap is extremely difficult but worse it will see many publishers of public interest journalism miss out on a deal.This goes against a central tenet of the NMBC and it leaves too much of the bargaining power with the platforms if they can pick and choose who they deal with.Finally, the NBI leads to one of two outcomes; commercial deals are done, or they are not and the incentive payment is made to the government which must then decide how to allocate it back to media companies. No one wants to see the government in this position.What to do? There are three options.First, resolve the complexity so that all this is operational in early 2026, not 12-18 months later. To assist with this the government should simply name now the obvious entities to be caught under the legislation and include criteria to add others later.Second, the NBI “is intended to apply to large digital platforms … irrespective of whether they carry news content”. We could just change the NMBC in the same way; search, social media and AI companies must bargain with publishers, and face potential arbitration, whether or not they carry news.Third, immediately activate Google’s involvement in the already legislated NMBC while working on other later solutions. Google’s payments were about 70% of the $250m paid each year. Google cannot run a search engine without news and so is still caught under the NMBC.Whatever option is chosen,getting this right is urgent - and vital if we value public interest journalism.Rod Sims is enterprise professor at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne.

It’s not big enough, really, for you to hit the road anddrive. And if you try, you may just end up stuck in traffic on the A1, where the late Chris Rea found himself inChristmas1978, his wife behind the wheel of her Mini, he beside her as they tried to get from Abbey Road Studios in London to their home in Middlesbrough, 220 miles away.He wrote the song on a whim, scribbling down the lyrics whenever passing headlights illuminated the car interior (as he told this paper’s Dave Simpson in 2016), then put it away with his other unfinished scraps when he got home. Eight years later, he paired his lyric with some jazzy chords he’d written and a song was born. At first, he shoved it on a B-side, but in 1988 he rerecorded it for a compilation, put it out as a single, and … it was not an instant hit. Instead it was a slow burner that went from radio playlists and department store PA systems into people’s hearts over many years.It was a slow burner because it’s not grand. Christmas songs tend to wallop the listener over the head with emotion – often joy, usually signified by copying the sound of A Christmas Gift to You by Phil Spector down to the last sleigh bell. Sometimes it’s a particularly overwrought love, as on The Power of Love, or Stay Another Day, or almost all X Factor winners. They insist on a hugeness of emotion to match the symbolism of the season.Driving Home for Christmas didn’t do any of that. Sonically, it was a pre-Spector record, pre-rock’n’roll in fact – with twinkling pianos and Sinatra-grade strings over a gentle beat – so it’s not packed with the signifiers of contemporary Christmas hits. Lyrically, well, nothing much happens, very much like driving up the A1. He’s not even longing for home, or craving his baby’s love, or fighting the traffic to get there as quick as he can. He’s just sitting in traffic, looking forward to getting home.Christmas 1988 was not a vintage season for festive records. Mistletoe and Wine by Cliff Richard was the Christmas No 1, but there was no other Christmas song until Alexander O’Neal’s Christmas Song at No 30. Mary’s Boy Child (Megamix) was at 52, with Driving Home for Christmas at 53.But Driving Home for Christmas, precisely because it doesn’t impose itself, didn’t wear out its welcome in the way some Christmas songs do. Its refusal to don the sonic bells and whistles of the second half of the 80s means it hasn’t dated: it was designed to sound nostalgic, and with so many ideas of the perfect Christmas crystallised from the pop culture of the 1950s and 60s, its particular nostalgia has never aged.Rea couldn’t go the whole hog and namecheck the A1 and the landmarks on the way to Teesside, because you can’t do road songs in Britain. Instead, when he’s “top to toe in tailbacks”, he knows there’ll “soon be a freeway”. Not in Lincolnshire, there won’t.Chris Rea: how we made Driving Home for ChristmasRead moreNevertheless, its emotional restraint captures a truth for most of us – that Christmas is rarely a time of incredible drama, but one of smaller pleasures and simple joys. Most of us will never hear sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling either. Nor, if we have any sense, do we wish it could be Christmas every day. But almost all of us have sat in an unmoving car, surrounding by the grey drear of winter, and wished we were at the other end of the journey. “I take a look at the driver next to me, he’s just the same” is perhaps the most affecting line.Driving Home for Christmas was first released as a B-side because Rea thought Christmas songs were novelties, and he didn’t want to draw attention to it. It may be an atypical song for him, but it’s not a novelty. It’s a perfect cardigan in which to envelop yourself.Explore more on these topicsChris ReaPop and rockChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

Except, of course, it’s not. It’s about so much more than that. By the end, the sex scenes – many and varied though they may be – are just a bagatelle.Partly this is because there is no false hope offered here. None of the sexy set pieces are a full escape from reality. The series is based on a true story and the podcast made about Molly Kochan’s decision to cram years of sexual experience into the little time she was told she had left before metastasised breast cancer killed her. Whatever Molly does, whatever we see her do – enjoy or not enjoy – we know it will not change the ultimate outcome. This is the frame in which all the scenes of sex parties, age-gapped hookups, discovery of “pup play” and mastering the tricky latches on cock cages in Molly’s pursuit of her first partnered orgasm are set.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t want to die with him; I want to die with you’ … Jenny Slate and Michelle Williams in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FXAnd partly it is because, thanks to a clever, tender – and blackly comic – script by Elizabeth Meriwether and Kim Rosenstock, and a deeply nuanced performance byMichelle Williamsas Molly, it increasingly becomes a meditation on what it means to live well and die well. It expands definitions as it goes on. First of sex itself. “You early millennials are so tragic,” says Sonya, a gen Z member of Molly’s care team. “You think sex is just penetration. Why? Because that’s what Samantha said?” You’ve gotta love a show that contains the casual slaughter of a sacred Sex and the City cow. Her perspective helps Molly move into a wider world of sex and gradually discover the answer to the question – asked by one of her early, young hookups, which stymies her at the time – what does she like? It is thanks to her neighbour – never named, but brilliantly played by Rob Delaney – that she learns what she really likes is kicking men in the dick.‘I’ve never masturbated on film before’: Michelle Williams’ orgasm odyssey in Dying for SexRead moreBut the definition that most interests everyone involved in the making of Dying for Sex is love. The marital kind – which has faded since Molly’s initial diagnosis of breast cancer, as her husband became unable to see beyond the patient. When they are in bed together, he says that her breasts remind him of death. The maternal kind – Sissy Spacek, on fantastic form, plays Molly’s mother. One of her boyfriends molested Molly when she was seven and it is this that makes her dissociate during sex, preventing the intimacy that breeds and is born of orgasm. “I think he knew he was taking joy from me,” she says. How much responsibility her mother bears and how much love is needed for forgiveness is a potent question. There is the love – or something – that grows between Molly and the neighbour. For that we may need a new word, but it is clear that it doesn’t need to be labelled to be worth having.Above all, there is the love between friends. Nikki (a magnificent Jenny Slate) is Molly’s best friend, her “beautiful flake” who takes over her care (as much an administrative as emotional burden – the US health system is a form-filled nightmare) and must fight her natural inclination towards chaos every step of the way, alongside the mounting fear and grief. “I don’t want to die with him,” says Molly of her husband. “I want to die with you.”Dying for Sex is about the courage of that decision, the laying aside of convention and the joy – that no abuser can remove – of truly knowing yourself and fulfilling not selfish desires but genuine needs. And if one of them is to kick in the dick a man who himself deeply desires to be kicked in the dick – well, that’s a delight all of its own.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVSexMichelle WilliamsDisney+featuresShareReuse this content"

Caravaggio’s CupidWallace Collection, London, until 12 AprilJust one painting but it is one of the world’s very greatest, and most dangerous. The shock of the old hits you in front of a naked Cupid who has clearly been portrayed from life, his raw, laughing features apparently coming straight from the mean streets into the gallery. This young love god is an anarchist, and Caravaggio paints like the antichrist, mocking civilisation, symbolised by the musical instruments at Cupid’s feet. Love doesn’t so much conquer all as destroy everything. See it, then try to forget it.2.Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of PaintingView image in fullscreenBacon reborn … Drift, 2020-2022, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates/Jenny Saville/DACS/GagosianNational Portrait Gallery, LondonGiant wounded faces have haunted me since I saw this formidable, almost surgical examination of Saville’s paintings. She emerges as the bloodstained, meaty successor to Freud and Bacon, a painter of modern flesh whose eye-popping variations of scale and searching human compassion make for a mighty artist. Yet Saville can be gentle as well as scary. Her intimate studies of motherhood and Degas-like pastels of lovers draw you in deeply. An artist in full, who can awe you or melt your heart as she looks openly at life.3.Theatre PicassoTate Modern, London, until 12 AprilThe surreal staging of this exhibition in a mockup of a proscenium arch theatre – playing with the very tradition of perspective that Picasso abolished, with a vista of his paintings dramatically lit on stage flats – is like something the surrealists might have come up with. Picture it as Marcel Duchamp curating Picasso. It beautifully returns his masterpieces to their avant garde origins. Free from reverence, the savage dream of The Three Dancers – and The Acrobat’s impossible yet human, all-too-human body – explode with all their original revolutionary power. A liberation, a joy and the kind of show that puts Tate Modern back up where it belongs.4.Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty YearsView image in fullscreenOak Passage and Dock Drawing, both 2025, by Andy Goldsworthy at the Royal Scottish Academy.Photograph: Stuart ArmittRoyal Scottish Academy, EdinburghFrom the rug of shorn fleeces on the gallery steps, past a barbed-wire screen and into an eerie room laid with stones from a cemetery that made it feel as cold as death, this exhibition was uncannily gripping. Goldsworthy has been making his environmental art for five decades and yet this show stressed his brilliant new works. It proved the power of art to bring the country into the city, to take you into lonely places of the imagination with installations of Romantic solitude. He should be invited to work in the Tate Turbine Hall next.5.Hamad Butt: ApprehensionsWhitechapelArtGallery, LondonThe infra-thin barrier between life and death – as fragile as a glass bulb full of poison gas – haunted this exhibition that resurrected a lost genius. Butt was part of the Goldsmiths-educated generation of Young British Artists in the early 1990s, but his premature death led to him being forgotten. The marvellously morbid installations here included live flies in a work he created before Damien Hirst used them, and a piece that endangered your eyesight. In his most sublime masterpiece, beautiful but deadly alchemical bottles are suspended in a giant executive toy.6.Siena: The Rise of PaintingView image in fullscreenThe Wedding at Cana, about 1308-11, by Duccio.Photograph: Museo dell’Opera della Metropolitana, Siena/© Foto Studio Lensini SienaNational Gallery, LondonThis exhibition glowed with gold and pulsed with feeling. It made you understand why the medieval poet Petrarch asked Simone Martini of Siena to portray his beloved Laura, for this great artist stood out here as a true poet in paint. It was in 14th-century Siena that the Renaissance truly began as Martini, Duccio and the Lorenzetti brothers brought subtle, sensitive expression to the human face and body. This acute, even profound show made you see their genius for infusing sharply observed reality with mysticism.7.Ancient IndiaBritish Museum, LondonPicasso would have loved this exhibition that showed how limited and closed the western sense of form has often been. Why limit statues to four limbs and reserve sculptural empathy for human faces? Elephant-headed figures and snake goddesses abounded in this ecstatic journey to the beginnings of Indian art and its relationship with Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Stunning masterpieces like the Great Shrine of Amaravati made for a thrilling and illuminating magical mystery tour.8.Peter Doig: House of MusicView image in fullscreenPeter Doig: House of Music at the Serpentine  Gallery.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates/Peter Doig/ SerpentineSerpentine, London, until 8 FebruaryA painter whose art has often echoed music – from titles evoking country rock and scenes that look like eerie 1970s album covers to the depictions of fantastical sound systems and solitary guitarists in this show – finally does what you suspect he always dreamed of doing and turns an exhibition into a gig, or club, or festival. Giant sound systems cannibalised from old cinemas pump out his record collection as you mistily dream into his paintings. Even if you bring earplugs, the paintings alone will make you want to dance.9.Diane Arbus: Sanctum SanctorumDavid Zwirner, LondonWhat were they thinking? Why did nudists in 1960s New Jersey let the unforgiving eye of Arbus into their world? Come to think of it why did anyone pose for her? She’s Diane Arbus! She’s going to make you look like a freak! But this exhibition revealed how many people did trust her and let her into their private bedrooms and camping huts. It proved her a great modern artist in the league of Warhol and Bacon. She is one of the few photographers ever to produce such a personal, expressive, tragicomic vision.10.Mat Collishaw: Move 37View image in fullscreenPost-human … Aftermaths by Mat Collishaw.Photograph: Mat CollishawSeed 130, LondonIn Collishaw’s film, Move 37, human civilisation has finally destroyed itself. In the flooded ruins of our world, something is stirring: translucent filaments of artificial life wriggle in the green waters and evolve before your eyes into creatures at once fishlike and instectoid but also inorganic. This vision of post-human, even post-animal life has itself been “evolved” using artificial intelligence tools. Collishaw is one of the few artists engaging deeply (rather than glibly) with AI as he tries to puzzle out if it will save or destroy us.Adrian Searle’s best art shows of the year1.Peter Hujar: Eyes Open in the DarkView image in fullscreenVulnerabilities and vanities … Untitled, 1984, by Peter Hujar.Photograph: Chicago Albumen Works/Peter Hujar Archive/ARS, New York/Pace GalleryRaven Row, LondonOne of the great photographers of the late 20th century, and now the subject of Ira Sachs’s 2025 movie Peter Hujar’s Day starring Ben Whishaw, Peter Hujar’s relentless, beautifully shot black-and-white photographs filled Raven Row early this year. This revelatory show brought out Hujar’s curiosity and his unerring eye, his darkroom skills and his utter seriousness. Rolleiflex camera always in hand, Hujar captured human vulnerabilities and vanities, including his own, a prickly artist, shunning fame. New York wreathed in fog, light on the river, life and death: his subjects had no end. My show of the year.2.Ed AtkinsTate Britain, LondonLife, hilarious and hapless and interrupted, was all there in this wildly inventive exhibition that took us from scenes starring the artist’s avatar to the grim daily rounds of medieval life. At every turn there was something new: one minute Atkins at the piano, then in intimate conversation with his mother, then his entire life collapsing down a sinkhole. Jokes and intimacies abounded, with drawings of feet, Post-it cartoon notes sent to his daughter, and a long film in which actor Toby Jones reads the diaries of Atkins’s dying father. Throughout, real life came crashing in.3.Kerry James Marshall: The HistoriesRoyal Academy, London, until18 JanuaryA revelation. In this fascinating retrospective we chart Marshall’s development from quasi-conceptualist to the pre-eminent painter of Black American life and aspiration. He leads us back to imagined images of enslavement in Africa, to elegaic scenes in the housing projects and to gaggles of black schoolkids in the museum. Shuttling between uneasy nights in stuffy rooms, Afrofuturist fantasies of space travel, parlours filled with mementos of JFK and Martin Luther King and visions of imperious, imaginary female black painters at their easels.4.Gerhard RichterFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, until2 MarchNow 93, Richter can appear conservative and radical at the same time. His works could be at one moment laden with pictorial and cultural references, the next revelling in abstractions. His is an art filled with calculation and unreason, making this an exhilarating and sometimes moving show. Culminating in a room dedicated to his attempts, in 2014, to capture the horrors of Birkenau, this is more than another run-through of Richter’s long career. With his deep ambivalence about images and an equally enduring belief in art’s capacity to endure, this profound exhibition is unmissable.5.Bridget Riley: Learning to SeeView image in fullscreenProliferating complexities … Streak 3, 1980, by Bridget Riley.Photograph: John Webb/Bridget RileyTurner Contemporary, Margate, until4 MayThe vertical and horizontal stripes, the dance of coloured circles on the walls, the shimmering and the undulating, the ordering and reordering, the sneaky angles and the tones too close to call: you think you know Bridget Riley’s art and then, when you give yourself to it, all the certainties fall away. This show is just the right size to keep you grounded and alert to its proliferating complexities. You just might want to stay all day.6.Claire Fontaine: Show LessMimosa House, LondonHeartfelt pleas, smuggled messages from a Yemeni prison and painted, neon obscenities ricochet in Claire Fontaine’s Show Less. In this complex exhibition, filled with tumbling references and bringing together the surging news cycle, Marcel Duchamp’s casual sexism and multiple, adulterated copies of Courbet’s salacious 1866 painting L’Origine du Monde, Claire Fontaine (Fulvia Carnevale and James Thornhill) fill the gallery with anger, erudition, humour and hope.Charlotte Jansen’s best UK photography shows of the year1.Lee MillerTate Britain, London,until 15 FebuaryMiller is most famous for her war photographs and her fashion pictures, but the sheer, staggering scope of this retrospective at Tate Britain – the most extensive Miller show to date – proved there is to see and understand about her surrealist art, and how important her inventions and contributions to history were. Being a good photographer to Miller meant “getting out on a damn limb and sawing it off behind you.” The images are always audacious and never anodyne – you won’t walk away unscathed.2.The Face Magazine: Culture ShiftView image in fullscreenKylie Minogue by Norbert Schoerner.Photograph: Norbert SchoernerNational Portrait Gallery, LondonFilled with room after room of colour, frivolity and neoliberal fun this tribute to the photographic legacy of the Face was an irresistible, riotous romp through two decades of the groundbreaking, experimental magazine’s halcyon days with lacquered lips, bright-white youthful smiles, and cerulean skies – with a bit of medieval fantasy and the odd Tesco bag thrown in.3.Peter Hujar: Eyes Open in the DarkRaven Row, LondonPutrid, petrifying, and vertiginously beautiful, this museum-quality exhibition threw you into the decaying, dank urban streets of downtown New York, but also lifted you to moments of dizzying euphoria and perfect grace. A sharp, feeling, and sublime account of one of the 20th century’s greatest artists. Unforgettable.4.Mahtab Hussain: What Did You Want to See?View image in fullscreenDaddy Shaf by Mahtab Hussain.Photograph: Mahtab HussainIkon, BirminghamFew artists have addressed what it meant for a generation of young Muslim men to grow up in Britain in the aftermath of 9/11 and 7/11 with the caustic, confidence-eroding impact of society’s suspicion and surveillance. Hussain’s thoughtful, inventive and inquiring exhibition reclaims the camera to bring power to a community.5.As We Rise: Photography from the Black AtlanticSaatchi Gallery, LondonCarrie Mae Weems’ skin through a hole torn in her shirt, Afonso Pimenta’s finely dressed families in the favela, Jamel Shabazz’s best friends on the subway, dressed in identical outfits and mirroring each other’s pose. There were so many electric moments in this scintillating show, forging connections through shared geographies and histories, but ultimately evoking something that can’t be contained or imitated, of style, pride and panache.6.Phil PolglazeView image in fullscreenCottaging … from Bog Jobs by Phil Polglaze.Photograph: Phil PolglazeJolly Farmers, OxfordPolglaze didn’t take pictures of public lavatories for 20 years as art – they were used by criminal defence barristers in Section 28 court cases to aid the release of men accused of cottaging. He unwittingly created an important archive that, with the alchemy of time, reveals much about our society’s changing values, attitudes and laws on sex, liberty and truth. You can almost smell the urinals.7. Merry Alpern: Dirty WindowsTramps, LondonArtist Peter Doig and his partner Parinaz Mogadassi bought a derelict boozer near Kings Cross, London, where they put on this scorcher of a show with the Parisian journal Magma: works from Merry Alpern’s controversial 1990s series, shot in secret from her friend Norman’s apartment, looking into the bathroom window of an illegal den of drugs and prostitution frequented by Wall Street workers. The pictures take no prisoners and leave you wondering which is worse: the dirty deeds in the bathroom, or our compulsive voyeuristic tendencies?8. Jennie Baptiste: Rhythm and RootsSomerset House, London,until 4 JanuaryAnother show capturing 1990s nostalgia, Baptiste’s feverishly cool portraits of the stars of dancehall, hip-hop and R&B posture, pose, and jostle for attention in this banger of a show. Baptiste grew up in the era of MTV and HMV, and began taking these pictures in the early 90s. Her pictures have that unique power – her subjects look iconic and untouchable yet they feel easy and familiar, like a glossy poster you had Blu-Tacked to the wall in your teenage bedroom.9.Joy Gregory: Catching Flies With HoneyView image in fullscreenLove of the darkroom … Blonde Contact Sheet by Joy Gregory.Photograph: Joy GregoryWhitechapel Gallery, Londonuntil 1 MarchGregory’s love of the darkroom began as a schoolgirl, and it instilled a lifelong passion for photography. Everything at her gorgeous retrospective at the Whitechapel attests to her fascination with beauty and precarity. It’s rich in experimentation, with her striking adaptation of Victorian techniques such as cyanotype and salt printing, self-portraiture and film, illustrating her resourcefulness and rigour. Gregory’s work is a national treasure.10. Harley Weir: The GardenHannah Barry Gallery, LondonLife is messy and often cruel. Weir gets this and evoked it so perfectly in this head-spinning, deeply touching show which grappled with ageing, loss, and grief, with new and old pictures, including some smirched with the egg-freezing treatment letrozole, and intimate pictures of the artist’s dad, who was diagnosed with Benson’s disease, a degenerative disorder affecting visual recognition. Weir is a brilliant, provocative photographer of the sensual, the sexual and the bodily but is always asking profound questions about life and what we give our attention to. I walked out in a daze.Eddy Frankel’s best art shows of 20251. Peter Doig: House of MusicSerpentine Gallery, London, until 8 FebruaryPutting some massive speakers in an exhibition so visitors can listen to jazz while looking at your paintings should be a recipe for a gallery covered in spew. The idea is gross. But this isn’t just any painter, and these aren’t just any speakers. The brilliant Doig refurbished a giant old cinema soundsystem for this show at the Serpentine, invited guest DJs to play a bunch of crackly old records, and created a hugely atmospheric love letter to music in the process, filled with some of the darkest and most amazing paintings he’s done in years.2. Wayne Thiebaud: American Still LifeView image in fullscreenGetting viewers salivating … Pie Rows, 1961.Photograph: Wayne Thiebaud/Wayne Thiebaud FoundationCourtauld Gallery, LondonThiebaud knew how to get viewers salivating. The pioneering American pop painter created a world full of delectable cakes, sweets and gumball machines, a universe of treats and candies laid out in American diners and on deli counters. He died in 2021 at 101 years old, and had a huge influence on the development of American art, but this was his first UK institutional exhibition – it’s staggering it took this long. Not only is his work a smart, conceptual takedown of consumerism, capitalism and the American dream, it’s pretty damn beautiful too.3. Arthur Jafa: Glas Negus SupremeSadie Coles HQ, LondonIn 75 years, when future critics start compiling a list of the best artworks of the 21st century, Jafa will be all over it. He’s part-archivist, part-historian, part-DJ, he’s a sampler of visual culture and his show at Sadie Coles HQ was incredible. Combining found imagery of Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and crime scene photos with looped videos of Prince funking out, the whole thing was an ultra-affecting, groovily hypnotic, confrontational paean to black culture’s beauty and endurance.4. Merry Alpern’s Dirty WindowsMcGlynn’s Staff Accommodation, LondonUp in the damp, squalid former staff quarters of this once iconic King’s Cross pub, American artist Alpern delivered a squalid lesson in voyeuristic, shocking photography. The show was based on a series of photos from the 1990s, when Alpern pointed her camera at the back window of a New York gentleman’s club and captured cropped, uncomfortable views of all the sordid activity that takes place in those sorts of private places. Excellently tense photographs, presented in an awesome, unusual gallery space.5. Ed AtkinsView image in fullscreenDisquieting … Hisser by Ed Atkins.Photograph: Markus Tretter/Ed AtkinsTate Britain, LondonLife, what’s it all about? Well, birth, death and a lot of post-it notes, according to British artist Atkins. His big solo exhibition at Tate Britain was as devastating as it was disarming, disconsolate as it was disquieting. He played with CGI, explored painful themes and doodled on thousands of sticky notes. The result was a very contemporary look at mortality, boredom and technology that felt miles away from the staid, conservative painting shows that have dominated UK institutions post-pandemic.6. Anselm Kiefer: Early WorksAshmolean Museum, OxfordThis brilliant show of the German art megastar Kiefer’s first steps, from early photographs to heartwrenching landscape paintings, was proof that he’s dedicated his whole career, right from the start, to confronting the horrors of his nation’s past. Whether referencing German mythology, the music of Wagner or just painting the countryside, everything in this show was tainted by the war and the enduring legacy of Nazism. Not as big or overwhelming as his later, more famous work, but just as powerful.7. Kerry James Marshall: The HistoriesView image in fullscreenWall-to-wall five-star reviews … Untitled (Blanket Couple) by Kerry James Marshall.Photograph: David Zwirner, London/Kerry James MarshallRoyal Academy, LondonThe American painter’s enormous retrospective at the Royal Academy got wall-to-wall five-star reviews. And for good reason. For over 50 years he’s been placing black figures at the centre of his huge canvases, elevating scenes of everyday black life to the level of grand, epic historical painting. Marshall treats his subjects with such heft, such importance, that it’s like seeing the art history canon being rewritten right in front of you. This show was full of contentious ideas, loads of violence, tons of glitter, and a whole bunch of brilliant painting.8. RIP Germain: Anti-Blackness Is Bad, Even the Parts That We LikeCabinet, LondonAs a mild claustrophobe I didn’t love being locked in the police van-shaped coffin at the heart of this powerful, acerbic, polemical exhibition. But young Luton-based artist RIP Germain’s exploration of how pretty much everyone in the UK drill scene has been locked up – via 101 hours of banned rap videos – was so clever, powerful and intense that it was almost worth it. The work wasn’t just about rap and prison, it was about the complicity of western audiences with their thirst for violence, gore, and true crime.9. Santiago Yahuarcani: The Beginning of KnowledgeThe Whitworth, ManchesterYahuarcani – of the Uitoto-Aimeni people of Peru – paints a world of mythical dolphin-human hybrids, rocks with eyes and shamanistic rituals. His show at the Whitworth was an ayahuasca-fuelled exercise in communing with the ancients, a diary of colonial injustices and a warning about imminent ecological collapse, all captured in swirls of psychedelic paint. Indigenous art was one of the big trends of 2025 – there were shows by indigenous artists from all over the world at almost every major UK institution, and Yahuarcani’s was probably the best of the lot.10. I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih: Feels Strangely Good, Ya?View image in fullscreenNo holds barred … Mataku Memandang by I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih Murniasih.Photograph: Danysswara/Gajah Gallery/Estate of I Gusti Ayu Kadek MurniasihNottingham ContemporaryThese days, you can only get away with horny art if it’s about exploring ideas of gender, sexuality or wider identity. But Balinese artist I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih – or Murni to her friends – dealt in pure, balls to the wall, tits out, no holds barred erotic painting. Sure, it was all combined with traditional Balinese aesthetics and spirituality, and a good bit of morbidity to boot (she died in 2006 aged just 39), but at its heart, the show was just about how life is short, so you might as well spend it shagging.Explore more on these topicsArt and design2025 in cultureArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He set up the glam rock group after spells with The Move and Electric Light Orchestra.Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty ImagesPop and rockTimeless Christmas hit is the gift that keeps on giving for WizzardResearch shows 97% of band’s streaming revenue comes from 1973 single I Wish It Could Be Christmas EverydayLanre BakareArts and culture correspondentMon 22 Dec 2025 08.03 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 12.58 ESTShareIf you listen closely to the start of Wizzard’s yuletide standard I Wish It Could BeChristmasEveryday, you’ll hear the kerching of a cash register.The sound might have been “a winning speck of cynicism in the tinselly facade” of 70s consumerism, according to the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis, but five decades on it has proved prophetic – the song accounts for nearly all of the band’s streams on Spotify.Research shows that Wizzard top the “Christmas reliance” chart with 97% of their Spotify streams coming from holiday music.Dark Horse, the SEO company behind the analysis, estimates this is worth about £430,000 to the band, which was formed by Roy Wood in the early 1970s. It is not certain exactly what Wizzard earn because streaming revenues are undisclosed.“There’s something mildly aggrieving about this song’s annual success overshadowing the rest of Wood’s rich oeuvre,” according to Petridis, the Guardian’s head rock and pop critic. However, in his rundown of Wood’s best tracks, he adds that “equally, writing something that becomes part of the fabric of national life is quite an achievement”.Andrew Mitchell, the head of digital PR forDark Horse, said the Wizzard stats were part of a much larger trend toward classic Christmas music dominating charts via streaming platforms.He said: “In the early 2000s, there were hardly any Christmas songs in the Top 40 of the week that the Christmas No 1 is crowned. That has steadily risen over the years, and now Christmas songs dominate the charts – and usually the same ones each year. Over the past few years, at least half of the Top 40 each Christmas has been the same as the previous year.”Wizzard’s top 10 tracks on Spotify have amassed 215m streams. I Wish It Could be Christmas Everyday alone has 208m streams, which makes up about 97% of that 215m total.Wood had several musical lives before forming the band. He founded psychedelic rockers The Move and then started Electric Light Orchestra in 1970 with Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan.The Move formally split in 1972, the same year Wood formed the glam rockers Wizzard.I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday from 1973 is Wizzard’s best-known track but they had several other hits, including Ball Park Incident and See My Baby Jive.This year’s Christmas No 1 was Kylie Minogue with Xmas, which was helped by a viral dance. She saw off competition from Wham!’sLast Christmas, which held the top spot for the past two years.Also in the race was Lullaby from the charity campaign Together for Palestine. It reached No 5.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

Elegantly shoehorned into the gargantuan hangar that was originally the broadcasting centre for the 2012 Olympics, it’s an Amazon warehouse crammed with global treasures, setting visitors off on an odyssey of “curated transgression” through an immersive cabinet of curiosities.View image in fullscreenElegantly shoehorned … V&A East Storehouse by Diller Scofidio + Renfro.Photograph: © Hufton+Crow2.Ismaili Centre by Farshid Moussavi, Houston, USSubtly abstracting Islamic architectural precepts for the current age, a new social and cultural centre for Houston’s Ismaili community, which will also be enjoyed by the wider public, evokes an experiential serenity that recalls the laconic simplicity of minimalist art. Beautifully built and characterised by an inviting sense of openness, it’s “a renewal rather than a reproduction”, says its architect Farshid Moussavi; a nuanced distillation of geometric and spatial possibilities set within a luxuriant garden landscape.3.Hans Hollein Transforms, Pompidou Centre, ParisAs the Pompidou Centre bids adieu fora five-year long renovation, its final architecture show was devoted to the work of Austrian architectHans Hollein, a postmodernist provocateur who navigated the currents of the avant garde for five decades while designing everything from exquisite jewellery shops to pneumatic structures. Infamously, he proposed reducing architecture to a series of pills contrived to conjure spatial and sensorial experiences without going to the bother of actually constructing a building.4.Space House: Squire & Partners, LondonSomething of an architectural bogeyman in his day,Richard “Colonel” Seifertspecialised in monumental office developments, such as London’s Centre Point and Tower 42 in the City, once the UK’s tallest building. But he is now coming in from the cold, with renewed interest in his unapologetically modernist oeuvre. The remodelling of Space House in Kingsway breathes bold new life into one of his distinctive “corncob” towers, with 90% of the original structure retained and restored.5.The Craft of Carpentry,Japan House, LondonView image in fullscreenExacting, beautiful .. Craft of Carpentry exhibition at Japan House, London.Photograph: Jeremie Souteyrat/Japan House LondonThe tools and techniques of the exacting and beautiful craft of Japanese carpentry temporarily transformed the basement gallery of London’s Japan House into a woody wonderland of chisels and saws, mortises and tenons, and brackets of infinite intricacy. Jointing techniques rejoice in esoteric appellations, such as ant’s head, shell mouth and scarfed gooseneck. Celebrating master carpenters with the reverence of a high priesthood, it was a dazzling exposition of the skills behind centuries of timber architecture and joinery.6.Gradel Quadrangles, New College, Oxford, by David KohnLove it or hate it (and apparently the students love it), David Kohn’s gorgeously eclectic housing for venerable New College channels Tolkien, Gaudí and the Teletubbies in a fruity melange of rhubarb-and-custard coloured stonework, a serpentine roof clad in polygonal scales, and a chubby tower embellished with carvings of pangolins, moles and moths. Not merely picturesque decoration, it calls attention to their plight as endangered species while pepping up the Oxford skyline.View image in fullscreenExuberant assemblage … Design and Disability at the V&A.Photograph: Peter Kelleher7.Design and Disability atthe V&A, LondonV&A, London, until 15 FebruaryIn asserting that disability-led culture and design is much more than just ramps, this exuberant assemblage features self-tightening shoes and a hands-free vibrator, among other ingenious and pleasure-seeking devices. Designing for disabled people tends to be treated as a monolithic, tick-box exercise, but this thoughtful show explores its multifaceted expansiveness, with a welcome and overdue focus on design by disabled people, who could teach us all a thing or two.8.Kharkiv Architectural Guide by Ievgeniia GubkinaFrom Cossack military fortress to legendary modernist city, Kharkiv is now in Russia’s firing line in its attritional war against Ukraine, with 8,000 of its buildings damaged or destroyed in the last three years. Completed two months before the invasion and combining poignant personal reflection with analytic rigour, this “anti-guide book” keeps Kharkiv’s architectural riches, including the constructivist gem of the Derzhprom building, intact and alive in people’s minds as a model for the city’s postwar future.View image in fullscreenIntact and alive … the Ukrainian cinema and concert hall, Kharkiv.Photograph: Pavlo Dorohoi9.Khudi Bari prototype housing, Bangladesh, by Marina TabassumIn response to climate-driven displacement in Bangladesh, Marina Tabassum worked with affected communities to devise a practical and affordable modular housing system. A rigid and highly resilient frame of bamboo with steel connectors is designed to withstand the impact of wind and water, while corrugated sheet metal roofs simplify transport and maintenance. Facades can be made from any locally sourced material and the entire module can be rapidly assembled and dismantled by three people using basic tools.10.Intelligens: 19th Architecture BiennaleAlways a curate’s egg, this iteration of the Venice Architecture Biennale was curated by Italian architect and aspiring tech bro Carlo Ratti, better known for hisrobotic bartending experiments. Amid an incoherent cacophony of ideas and installations – 3D printing with bacteria, the future of space suits – highlights were hard to discern. Nonetheless, Estonia’s naff cladding exposé, Poland’s take on superstition and buildings, and Bahrain’s proposition that climate comfort is a form of social equity all stood out.Catherine SlessorThe best design of the year, as chosen by designersKusheda Mensah x Hem: Palma poufChosen byShawn Adams, co-founder of POoR CollectiveView image in fullscreenThoughtful … Kusheda Mensa’s Palma pouf in Copenhagen.Photograph: Emily ColeDuring the 3daysofdesign festival in Copenhagen, Hem debuted a highly anticipated pouf created by designerKusheda Mensah, marking an important milestone for the Swedish furniture brand. The launch is Hem’s first partnership with a Black designer, underscoring both Mensah’s growing influence and the brand’s commitment to broader representation in contemporary design. The pouf had already generated considerable excitement for its thoughtful form and cultural relevance, making the debut one of the festival’s most widely discussed moments.Wuka wearable hot-water bottleChosen byAnoushka Rodda, co-founder of Templo branding agencyI’d love to put the newWuka wearable hot-waterbottle into the mix because it says so much about how things are shifting in women’s health. These days there are more practical products that actually make our lives easier. I remember back when I first got my period wearing the biggest, most itchy pads and being in so much pain. That’s a world away from the thoughtfully designed purposeful products which are available now.Frances Priest’s ceramics collection Motif | Line | ColourChosen byAdam Nathaniel Furman, designer and authorFrances Priest’s new collection of vessels, on show in her solo exhibition at Blackwell House in Cumbria, is a set of ethereal columns, pinched inwards at their tops and bottoms. They are dusted in dense but limpid motifs that flutter over the ceramic surfaces like the autumnal ghosts of a leaf fall. They seem to be moving yet so delicate as to almost fade into translucency. I have been enamoured with Priest’s oeuvre for some time. I promise that anyone who encounters her vessels in person will fall deeply in love …Noah Davis exhibition at the Barbican, LondonChosen byLewis Dalton Gilbert, curator and creative director of A Vibe Called TecView image in fullscreenDelicately portrayed … Noah Davis, 1975.Photograph: Kerry McFate/Noah Davis/David ZwirnerI was lucky enough to see Noah Davis’s paintings at the gallery he created, The Underground Museum in LA. What I wasn’t prepared for was the thoughtful design of this exhibition (by studios Freehaus and A Practice for Everyday Life). It brought Davis’s practice to life and delicately portrayed his ideas, adventures and artwork. I will always sing about his work to the rooftops, but less is said about the power of great exhibition design.Showtown museum, BlackpoolChosen byAmber Butchart, curator and fashion historianI am ahuge fanof the seaside and Blackpool is one of my favourite places. This year I visited Showtown – the museum that celebrates the entertainment heritage of this razzle-dazzle-loving town. It’s a great visit for anyone interested in Blackpool’s rich history of magic, circus, illuminations and dance, and is especially good for family visits. The museum’s design allows visitors a glimpse behind the scenes at everything from Punch and Judy puppet shows to the town’s famed drag cabaret Funny Girls. I am in love with their collection of clown costumes, which includes examples by renowned French costumier Gérard Vicaire.View image in fullscreenGlimpse behind the scenes … Showtown museum, Blackpool.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianAlice Gomme’s textile archive at Twos, LondonChosen byTamsin Clark, director of Tenderbooks, bookshop and event spaceFor three days in April the tiny shop space Twos on Hackney Road showed a selection of extraordinary clothing fromAlice Gomme’s textile archive for sale. Her collection of rare garments and repaired textiles were found in European rag yards, and to view these salvaged clothes up close was remarkable. I found myself noticing small details in the wear of a collar or the fade of a pattern. This was an opportunity to look at the overlooked. As Gomme explained in an accompanying publication: “Looking at these pieces helps us connect to the past. Each piece, each repair holds a memory.”Oríkì: Material Affirmations in Three Actsmonograph by Nifemi Marcus-BelloChosen byAndu Masebo, product designerView image in fullscreenNifemi Marcus-Bello exhibition Material Affirmations: Oríkì Acts I-III at Tiwani Contemporary, Nigeria.Photograph: Erik BenjaminsNamed Oríkì after the Yoruba practice of praise poetry, the first monograph of Nigerian-born artist Nifemi Marcus-Bello coincided with his solo exhibition at Tiwani Contemporary, Nigeria. The canon of the mainstream design world has long centred on “the West” – its movements, its narratives and its influence on our collective imagination. In Nifemi’s practice, I find a profound significance in his directing of his work toward his country of birth. To me, his work signals a shift in the culture: a moment when the eyes of the world are turning toward new centres of creativity, expanding the very idea of where design leadership can emerge, changing how the history of design will be written in the future.Le Corbusier executive desk in The Electric Kiln show, LondonChosen byEmma Glynn, creative director, WedgwoodThis lived-in exhibition occupied a building which was once British potter Emmanuel Cooper’s studio and home, now restored, owned and lived in by curator Rajan Bijlani. Every piece had its own quiet brilliance, from Lucie Rie to Frank Auerbach, but Le Corbusier’s executive desk stayed with me long after. The engineering is so perfectly judged that it grounds the entire space; its calm authority, precision and purity of purpose are a true feat of design. The remarkable works in this show were so purposefully curated they felt like part of the living space. The whole experience was a privilege – an immersive, quietly meditative dialogue of material, technique and memory.Ibraaz cultural institution, LondonChosen byEva Langret, director of Frieze art fairIbraaz opened this autumn to great acclaim. Created by Kamel Lazaar Foundation – a non-profit cultural organisation rooted in Tunisia and across the Middle East and north Africa – it brings a much-needed space for art and ideas from the Global Majority to the city. Set in a Grade II–listed building in Fitzrovia and redesigned by architect Sumayya Vally, it draws inspiration from diasporic spaces in London. Built in the early 20th century, the building has transformed from a synagogue to a residence, a club, and now a cultural centre. It’s a place for artists and thinkers to meet, exchange ideas and build new connections. Ibraaz launched with work by artist Ibrahim Mahama based on his research into Ghana’s post-independence history, and its upcoming programme spans talks, screenings, music, and residencies.Loewe teapotsChosen byTF Chan, director of Collect art fairView image in fullscreenExceptional … Suna Fujita’s teapot at Milan Design Week 2025.Photograph: LoeweAt this year’s Milan Design Week, Loewe stole the show with an exhibition of25 teapotscommissioned from the world’s leading artists. One, by Japanese ceramicist Takayuki Sakiyama, looked as though it was poured from soft-serve ice-cream. Another, by Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola, resembled a lumpy squirrel, meant to be held by its tail. A third, from Pritzker Architecture prize laureate Wang Shu, was a mint-green cuboid with a sliced-off corner in place of a spout. These vessels were whimsical and puzzling, but consistently brilliant – a testament to erstwhile creative director Jonathan Anderson’s knack for convening contemporary craft talent. It also offered proof, amid an arms race of ambitiously scaled installations at design weeks around the world, of the value of small objects of exceptional quality.Mary Woolaston statue by Marcia Bennett-MaleChosen bySumitra Upham, associate director of curatorial and public practice at Wellcome InstituteView image in fullscreenInspiring healing … Marcia Bennett-Male and her Black Mary statue in Calthorpe Community Garden, King’s Cross.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesThis remarkable public statue, handcrafted by British artist and stonemason Marcia Bennett-Male, honours Mary Woolaston. As legend has it, Mary was a Black woman and keeper of a well in 17th-century King’s Cross known for its chalybeate waters that she supplied to people as a form of healing. The absence of Black working-class histories has left her story overlooked, but this statue can now be seen at Calthorpe Community Garden in Camden – the former site of the well. It has been designed to inspire communal healing and remind us of our shared humanity. The work forms part ofthe Black Mary Project, an initiative to honour Mary and her well.Seat for Surrender by Carlos H MatosChosen byIngrid Schroder, director of Architectural Association SchoolArchitect and sculptor Carlos H Matos’s Seat for Surrender was produced for the group exhibition A Stubborn Man and a Hermit Walk Into a Bar,which was shown at Mexican architect and muralist Juan O’Gorman’s iconic 1940s Nancarrow House in Mexico City. Made from plywood boards, the chair manages to capture the socialist and nationalist political spirit of O’Gorman’s architecture. The strength and quiet humour of the piece is typical of Matos’s creative work.Compiled by Alice FisherExplore more on these topicsArt and design2025 in cultureArchitectureDesignExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A curio.Updike tropesReligion, death11Seek My Face (2002)Over the course of a single day, 79-year-old painter Hope Chafetz endures the determined attention of Kathryn D’Angelo, a young, ambitious art journalist. Updike had by this point been on the receiving end of many such encounters and the novel, told almost entirely from Hope’s perspective, bristles with resentment at the presumptions and blind spots inherent in the situation.Updike tropesArt, religion10 S. (1988)An epistolary novel that draws on Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 19th-century story of adultery and hypocrisy, The Scarlet Letter, to ironise faith and fidelity in the 1980s. As revealed in her letters and tapes, Sarah Worth has abandoned her family to find herself in an Arizona ashram led by the guru Arhat Mindadali. The form allows for a fragmented narrative in which the facts Sarah conceals from her husband and daughter are as telling as the facts she details.Updike tropesSex, religion9 Gertrude and Claudius (2000)A prequel to Hamlet that focuses on the tangled love lives of the prince of Denmark’s father, mother and uncle stops short before Shakespeare’s bloody denouement. Gerutha (Gertrude) is married off in her teens to the coarse Horwendil (Hamlet senior) while harbouring a reciprocated passion for Feng (Claudius). The omens are not good. As with Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, the deeper your knowledge of Hamlet, the more you will enjoy Updike’s embellishments.Updike tropesSex, family8Memories of the Ford Administration(1992)The reader will learn very little about Gerald Ford, the 38th president of the United States, from this novel. James Buchanan, the 15th president and something of a minor obsession for both Updike and his narrator Alfred L Clayton, is given slightly more room but what concerns Clayton most is his overboiled erotic memories. Clayton is a history professor well aware that there is no correct interpretation of the past. Clayton’s account of his infidelity and the failure of his marriage is appropriately partial, misleading and self-regarding.Updike tropesSex, family7The Centaur(1963)Chiron, the wise centaur with a fatal wound, stands as an allegory in this novel for the teacher George Caldwell. His son, Peter, recognising his father’s suffering and frustration, determines to escape a similar fate through art. Updike himself achieved the escape that Peter dreams of but, as this early novel demonstrates, he would mine the memory of small-town life for the rest of his career.Updike tropesReligion, family6The Witches of Eastwick(1984)Adapted into both a film with a stellar cast (Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jack Nicholson) and a successful musical, the novel is strong enough to stand apart from those glitzy distractions. The arrival of Darryl Van Horne in a tight-knit New England enclave stirs diabolical feelings in Alexandra, Jane and Sukie, the eponymous sorceresses. Fatal mayhem naturally ensues. With its gossipy tone, the story doesn’t take itself too seriously and neither should the reader.Updike tropesSex, death5Of the Farm (1965)The publication of Updike’s immaculately crafted fourth novel served notice that a once-in-a-generation talent had arrived. Joey Robinson brings his new wife and her child from a previous marriage to the Pennsylvania farm where he grew up to meet the matriarch who struggles to manage the place alone. Through a painstaking accumulation of telling details Updike reveals the tensions between the three adults and the inexorable reality of change.Updike tropesSex, family4The Complete Henry Bech(1993)This edition gathers together short stories – Bech: A Book (1970), Bech Is Back (1982) and Bech in Czech (1987) – featuring peripatetic Henry Bech in a fictional mashup of Jewish writers Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Isaac Bashevis Singer (with a dash of Waspish JD Salinger). Our antihero lives in the shadow of his own celebrity, gives speeches behind the iron curtain, accepts awards at prestigious universities, and spreads the message on the “Cultural Situation of the American Writer” to readers in Ghana, Korea, Venezuela and elsewhere. The irony is that such far-flung adventures are inimical to the writer’s creative process, generating existential anxiety. Updike carries off the satire with a light touch, affectionately sending up literary squabbles and personal rivalries.Updike tropesReligion, sex, death3Couples(1968)This is the novel that made Updike rich and famous and put him on the cover of Time. Readers who look into it hoping to find graphic depictions of middle-class adultery will not be disappointed, but they will also get beautifully wrought accounts of religious doubt, vivid descriptions of commonplace life and sharp observations of social mores in early-60s America. The plot involves the tortuous romantic machinations of 10 couples. At the heart of the action is Piet Hanema, whose need for extramarital sex is matched by his desire for communion with the divine. His life will be shattered by both.Updike tropesSex, religion2Roger’s Version (1986)When this novel was published, its premise that the existence of God could be proven through a computer programme seemed cutting edge. If that now strikes the reader as quaint, the author’s virtuoso upending of his reputation for social realism remains enthralling. We are trapped in the head of Roger Lambert as he obsessively conjures an affair between his wife and a young student, describes his own scandalous relationship with his half-sister’s daughter, and proudly displays his familiarity with the Latin scholarship of the early Christian theologian Tertullian. How much is real and how much can we rely on the omniscient voice of Roger?Updike tropesSex, religion, adulteryView image in fullscreen1Rabbit Angstrom: the four novels (1995)The author’s supreme achievement – if you have never read any of these novels, jump right in at the start and work your way through to the heartbreaking finale. To rank each work in turn, they go: Rabbit at Rest (1990), Rabbit Is Rich (1981), Rabbit, Run (1960) and Rabbit Redux (1971). A separately published novella, Rabbit Remembered (2001) , is a disappointing misfire. Taken as a whole, the tetralogy offers an unforgettable portrait of the life of the white middle-class American male in the last century. Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom is priapic, patriotic and prone to bouts of religious introspection. When we first meet him, he feels trapped in a stale marriage, his days as a feted high-school basketball player behind him, long years of existential emptiness ahead. Those years will cover the counterculture explosion of the 1960s, the monied excess of the early 1980s and the bitter realisation by the close of that decade that unbridled materialism has poisoned the body corporeal and politic. Updike’s gifts for vivid description and apt metaphor have never been surpassed.Updike tropesSex, religion, deathThis article was amended on 22 December 2025. An earlier version said Harry Angstrom was a baseball player; this should have said basketball player.Explore more on these topicsCultureRankedJohn UpdikeFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.There is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.When I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winningClair Obscur: Expedition 33, andHollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many peoplereallycontribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.View image in fullscreenSmaller-scale wins … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Kepler InteractiveTheNintendo Switch 2was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.But the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios,including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology.AI-generated artwork and voiceovershave made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.All this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be foundprotesting outside the Game Awardsearlier this month.) In the UK, thefiring of 30 stafffrom Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Rockstar Games office in Edinburgh in November.Photograph: Lesley Martin/PAAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: whenMicrosoft acquired Activisionin 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudisalso bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’sinterview with Human Rights Watchfrom earlier this year is an essential read.)What we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he wasdiscovered to be a fake gamerin January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images ofthe president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue tofeed culture war spatsover a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?View image in fullscreenElon Musk boasted about being an elite gamer online – and turned out to be faking itPhotograph: Evan Vucci/API don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after Iwrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.Why the enormous Saudi-led deal to acquire EA matters, whether you play games or notRead morePlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this,this year’s Summer Game Fest– a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.It matters, who has power.Gamesfeel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.Explore more on these topicsGamesDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

First, she starred as an amoral model in John Schlesinger’s Darling, a snapshot of Swinging London that reflected the trendy, flashy, forward-thinking culture that had seduced young adults. Then she starred as an elusive Russian beauty in Doctor Zhivago, a three-hour-plus historical epic from David Lean that was as stodgy and old-fashioned as Darling was suggestive of the future. There was an appetite for both that year – credit Christie’s astonishing magnetism for that, at least in part – but a sense that one era was crashing into another and times were about to change.Julie Christie at 85: her 20 best films – ranked!Read moreIt seems fitting, then, that Doctor Zhivago is about what happens when history takes a turn and a band of insurgents make a once-stable and familiar place seem completely unrecognizable. It’s easy to imagine a master like Lean, who had just made Lawrence of Arabia a few years earlier, feeling a bit like his hero, Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), a celebrated poet whose work suddenly falls out of favor after the Russian Revolution. Though Doctor Zhivago was honored with a raft of Oscar nominations – and five wins, mostly in technical categories – many contemporary reviews had dismissed it as an ossified romance, disengaged with the harsh realities of early-to-mid-1900s Russia. Even 60 years later, it feels like a relic of an earlier era.And yet there’s still a kind of magic to the film, owed to Lean’s peerless sense of scale and how it elevates a love affair that survives the upheavals of war and fate, and a distance that stretches from Moscow to the Ural mountain range. While it’s true that Doctor Zhivago isn’t the most substantive treatment of Russian history, Lean cares more about individuals swept up in a current they have no power to bend, which is terrifying but also as deeply romantic as storytelling gets. That’s the trick of love stories set against tumultuous backdrops: there’s a plane-going-down urgency and passion to them that ordinary times cannot possibly replicate. Kisses detonate like bombs.The stakes were significantly lower for Lean’s Doctor Zhivago than for the original novel by Boris Pasternak, which had so rankled the Communist party that it had to be smuggled out of Soviet Union for publication in 1957. (Pasternak was also not allowed to accept the Nobel prize he’d win a year later. His son finally accepted it on his behalf in 1989.) Working again with the Lawrence of Arabia screenwriter Robert Bolt, Lean gives this historical moment the appropriate scope while retreating from its politics, displaying a lightness of touch that’s carried over from TE Lawrence’s adventures in the Arabian desert. In that, he’s not unlike Zhivago in an early sequence where his hero stands on his balcony and witnesses peaceful demonstrators slaughtered at the hands of tsarist dragoons. He sees everything but feels distinctly removed from the action.Flashing back from an affecting framing story where Zhivago’s half-brother (Alec Guinness) questions a young woman he believes to be Zhivago’s long-lost daughter, the film settles in 1913 Moscow, a city on the brink of the first world war and the Russian Revolution. The orphaned Zhivago lives comfortably as a doctor and celebrated poet, engaged to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), the daughter of the family friends who raised him. Meanwhile, the beautiful 17-year-old Lara (Christie) finds herself snared by the affections of Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a rich and connected brute who’s also involved with her mother. But Lara’s heart belongs to Pasha (Tom Courtenay), an idealistic young Bolshevik whose resolve hardens after encountering violent government resistance to his cause.The film deftly suggests the inevitability of Zhivago and Lara’s romance while keeping them apart for much of the first half, waiting until the first world war to unite them on the frontlines, where they tend to the wounded as doctor and nurse. While the two remain faithful to Tonya and Pasha, respectively, their feelings for each other are too overwhelming to suppress, especially as history itself seems to be playing matchmaker. Only behind the snow-frosted windows of an abandoned manse deep in the Urals can their love find a place to flourish, inspiring Zhivago’s most treasured book of poems.View image in fullscreenJulie Christie and Tom Courtenay on set.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyUnfolding over roughly 200 minutes, with space allotted for an overture and an entr’acte at intermission, Doctor Zhivago is a lumbering beast of a movie, with little of Lawrence of Arabia’s fleetness, much less the intimacy and wit of “smaller” Lean love stories like Brief Encounter. Yet the sheer scale of the production, along with his staging of conflicts like an attack on demonstrators or the chaotic early days of communist rule, feels persuasive as only a Lean epic can. Though Lean’s intrepid Zhivago sympathizes with the revolutionaries to a point, he’s like everyone else in this world, reacting and adapting to circumstances that are far beyond his control.As Pasha tells Zhivago late in the film, after the civil war is over, “The personal life is dead in Russia. History has killed it.” Pasha used to like Zhivago’s poetry, but the feelings and affection within them are not only rendered meaningless, but now stand out as anticommunist. Lean’s heroes tend not to be the hot-blooded type, and to that end, Zhivago seems resigned to the fact that he’s simply fallen out of favor by no fault of his own. He’s even unperturbed to discover that his home in Moscow has been splintered into residences for 13 different families, because it seems just and there’s nothing he can do about it anyway.Yet the famously bitter cold in Doctor Zhivago – the definitive curl-up-by-the-fire home video experience for a long winter afternoon – thaws whenever Zhivago and Lara steal some time together, away from the tumult in their country and within their families. Theirs is an us-against-the-world story that inevitably bends toward tragedy, but the film is a reminder that love perseveres through dark times, as does the art that spins out of it. By that token, Doctor Zhivago may seem like a relic, but it’s also enduring.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsJulie ChristieOmar SharifAlec GuinnessRomance filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-3140Dope ThiefView image in fullscreenRide-or-dies … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/AP(Apple TV) The two amiable, small-time Philadelphia crooks at the heart of Dope Thief have a good thing going. They rob low-level stash houses disguised as DEA officers and put on a performance of authority to avoid using violence. But when a big score at an out-of-town location is offered, they roll the dice and very quickly regret it: soon they have a bunch of very dangerous people on their tails. The key to this show was the chemistry between ride-or-die leads Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura. As the stakes rose, these alternately hilarious and heartbreaking hoods had us rooting for them in no time.What we said:“Brian Tyree Henry ranges from comedy to tragedy in a single scene and never misses a beat. He is extraordinary and the rest of the cast are up there with him. He gives Dope Thief heart and at times threatens to break the viewer’s. Wonderful.”Read more39Squid GameView image in fullscreen‘Hi, Cate Blanchett!’ … Squid Game.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) Hwang Dong-hyuk’s killer game dystopia was one of those exciting shows that nobody saw coming – and it quickly became the biggest show of 2021. But after the sagging second series, the end was in sight with this final one. Fans simplyneededto know whether Player 456 – name: Gi-hun – could take down the evil game masters and VIPs from within. While he attempted that, new games meant more scream-at-the-screen entertainment, and we had other contestants to side with (or hate). The twists were totally bewildering (hi, Cate Blanchett!), which made this one hell of a ride to the finish line.What we said:“If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job.”Read more38Dept. Q(Netflix) Like a Scottish Slow Horses, but with fewer fart gags. This TV adaptation of a series of Danish crime novels – relocated to Edinburgh – was a sarcasm-packed thrill ride as it told the tale of unpopular maverick copper Carl Morck, sent to work on futile cold cases in the basement. You couldn’t help but root for the team he pulls together to track down a missing lawyer, but the show’s real joy lay in the dynamic between grumpy Morck andKelly Macdonaldas his cheeky, pomp-pricking, work-mandated therapist.What we said:“It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience.”Read more37This City Is Ours(BBC One/iPlayer) The city in question was Liverpool and while the drug gang at this drama’s heart had the territory well and truly locked down, the internal politics of family and succession were a different matter. James Nelson-Joyce stole the show as Michael, the gang’s heir apparent who finds his assumed rise to the top threatened by retiring boss Ronnie’s (Sean Bean) surprising preference for his feckless son Jamie. Needless to say, as the brains and the brawn of the operation, Michael doesn’t take this well. This City Is Ours never fully escaped from standard gangster tropes but instead, leaned into them with compelling relish. And that final rooftop standoff! Breathtakingly tense.What we said:“The Sopranos influence can be felt” …Read more36The Beast in MeView image in fullscreenAwards will surely be given … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/AP(Netflix) An extraordinary performance of jittery, self-destructive anguish fromClaire Daneslies at the heart of this ambiguous psychological thriller. Danes is Aggie Wiggs, a creatively blocked and prickly author who is dealing with the trauma of bereavement. When Matthew Rhys’s rebarbative (indeed, possibly murderous) real estate magnate Nile Jarvis moves in next door, it seems like the last thing she needs. Sure enough, the pair hate each other almost on sight – but soon, a weird, co-dependent fascination develops between them which leads to some very dark waters indeed. The two leads inspire each other into something genuinely startling.What we said:“It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.”Read more35A Thousand Blows(Disney+) The best of Steven Knight’s many shows this year, this punchy underworld drama contained pretty much a full house of his favourite tropes: strangely poetic outlaws, beautifully realised period trappings (London’s East End in the grubby, gruesome late Victorian era) and regular outbursts of bone-crunching violence. It also boasted a trio of magnificent lead performances: Malachi Kirby’s immigrant boxer, Hezekiah Moscow, was charming, principled and deadly, while charismatic gang leader Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) was shrewd and slippery. Meanwhile, Stephen Graham – an actor whose combination of vulnerability and volatility loomed over this TV year – was somehow terrifying and desperately poignant as fading prize-fighter Henry “Sugar” Goodson.What we said:“Hasan irresistible, Dickensian-yarn quality that helps smuggle in timely social and political commentary, much as the great man did himself.”Read more34I Love LAView image in fullscreenA gen Z delight … I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy(Sky Comedy/Now) Is internet comedianRachel Sennottthe Lena Dunham of her generation? Her first comedy series certainly has potential to be as relevant to gen Z as Girls was for millennials. The show follows 27-year-old aspiring talent manager Maia (Sennott) in LA as she navigates relationships, friendships, career ambitions and all of life’s mortifying moments in between. It took a few episodes to find its feet but the cast burst with energy as they delivered near-constant gags. Plus, for the millennials: Leighton Meester guest stars as Maia’s boss.What we said:“The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.”Read more33The ChangeView image in fullscreenGorgeous whimsy … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Photographer: Jon Hall/Channel 4(Channel 4) Bridget Christie’s comedy drama is something special: a deeply personal call to arms for menopausal women who feel invisible. It’s also hilarious. Linda (Christie) is a fiftysomething mother and wife who escapes life on a motorbike to go and find herself in the Forest of Dean. By series two, she has had quite an effect on the local people: women wear “Je suis Linda” T-shirts and, armed with their copy of Linda’s Ledger, boycott doing unrecognised work. But she’s still on her own journey, too, with plenty of touching moments and acts of sisterhood. All of this was explored with Christie’s gorgeous whimsy. What a shame Channel 4 cancelled the show, despite Christie writing it for a three-series arc. Hopefully it will find a new home.What we said:“The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.”Read more32South ParkView image in fullscreenIncredible … Donald Trump and Satan in bed in South Park.Illustration: YouTube(Paramount+) After Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£13.5m) and discontinued Stephen Colbert’s show after the late-night host called the deal “a big fat bribe”, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a $1.5bn five-year contract with the network – and immediately fought back. Episode one starred Donald Trump with a micropenis, climbing into bed with Satan. ICE, AI, tech bros and Labubus have all been in the line of fire. For an animated show in its 28th series to not just stay relevant, but boldly retaliate against the Trump administration’s censoring of the media, is incredible. It’s also still really, really funny.What we said:“Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.”Read more31Mussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic/Now) Joe Wright’s stylish adaptation of Antonio Scurati’s doorstop of a historical novel followed Il Duce’s wobbly first steps towards fascism, as he moved from national laughing stock to the March on Rome and his ultimate enshrining as dictator. Luca Marinelli was chillingly compelling as a fourth-wall-breaking Mussolini, walking the audience through each of his norm-shattering acts in a series that served as a honking great warning klaxon in these fractious times.What we said:“A brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster.”Read more30-2130What It Feels Like For a GirlView image in fullscreenCertainly a wild ride … Ellis Howard as Byron in What It Feels Like For A Girl.Photograph: Hera Pictures/BBC(BBC Three/iPlayer) Based on Paris Lees’ unflinching coming-of-age memoir, What It Feels Like For a Girl followed Nottingham teenager Byron (an incredible breakthrough for Ellis Howard) who befriends a group of club-loving transgender women and starts to explore their own identity. Byron is far from a likable protagonist – but that, along with the nuanced ways the story tackled sex work and drug use is what made it so authentic, so bold. It was a challenging but captivating watch, made even better for capturing the 00s in all their inglorious mess.What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read more29AmandalandView image in fullscreenWelcome to SoHa, darling! … Lucy Punch as Amanda and Samuel Anderson as Mal in Amandaland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman(BBC One/iPlayer) Replicating the sheer watchability of Motherland’s phenomenal ensemble cast is no mean feat. But it certainly doesn’t hurt to draw on solid-gold comedy pedigree performers like Joanna Lumley and Siobhán McSweeney, plus Motherland’s most underrated character: the gloriously daffy Anne. Add in the subtlety and vulnerability that Lucy Punch brought to her turn as post-divorce queen bee Amanda, plus a script that skewered Insta-obsessed posh parents, and you had a televisual joy. Just don’t accuse her of living in South Harlesden: it’s “SoHa”, darling.What we said:“When writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.”Read more28The BearView image in fullscreenStill hits so hard … Ayo Edebiri as Sydney in The Bear.Photograph: FX(Disney+) This one sure divided the critics. There were those who felt the hit restaurant drama that skyrocketed blood pressures and sales of sexy white T-shirts had served up its duffest course yet. But those who stuck with its fourth season were rewarded in spades with way less shouting of “Yes chef” and way more deep and brave and emotional television that had catharsis by the crateload. The under-the-table wedding scene? That two-hander between Sydney and Carmy (“I believe in you more than I’ve ever believed in myself”)? The funeral reveal (“I will fucking destroy you, Carmy”)? This was TV that still hits so hard.What we said:“Having put his creations and his audience through hell, showrunner Christopher Storer now lets the light in via a torrent of tenderly written, fiercely performed interactions where broken people who love each other start to heal, saying variations on those two beautiful phrases, ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you.’”Read more27Andor(Disney+) Probably the best and certainly the most universally appealing of the many additions to the Star Wars universe in recent years, this Rogue One prequel may have had the usual fantasy trappings but was also a stirring meditation on oppression and resistance. And dropping in the year of Donald Trump’s second coming, it felt particularly poignant and potent. It starred the excellent Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a thief and scavenger whose home planet has been rendered uninhabitable by the Galactic Empire. Andor is a natural leader but he’s also a cynic; sceptical of revolutionary idealism. How does such a man turn into a freedom fighter, willing to risk everything for his cause?What we said:“Even when it’s in a lighter mode, Andor is Star Wars for grownups. This rebellion is a serious business.”Read more26HacksView image in fullscreenStuff of dreams … Jean Smart as Deborah in Hacks.Photograph: Universal(Sky Max/Now) Never mind that this wasn’t the Jean Smart-starring, odd-couple sitcom’s finest season. So glorious is this Emmy-winning tale of a veteran standup paired with a gen Z comedy writer that even a low-key outing is the stuff of most show’s dreams. This time round, we got a new roster of scene-stealing minor characters, heart-wrenching moments of pathos and zingers so acerbic you were in constant danger of spraying tea across the room. It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it.”Read more25Trespasses(Channel 4) This beautiful adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s layered story about a forbidden love affair set against the Troubles truly crushed hearts. It followed young Catholic teacher Cushla (Lola Petticrew) who falls for Protestant barrister Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen). Obviously, things couldn’t end well – as the story navigates the temperature of Belfast during that time. Gillian Anderson has, rightly, received a lot of praise for her portrayal of Cushla’s grieving alcoholic mother. But Petticrew is a rising talent, as proven in last year’s Say Nothing.What we said:“Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. The narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.”Read more24The AssemblyView image in fullscreenRare candour … Danny Dyer is grilled in The Assembly.Photograph: ITV(ITV1/ITVX) There’s no denying that one of the great pleasures of this interview show was watching Gary Lineker subjected to an unfiltered grilling, just as he followed years of controversy by announcing he was leaving the BBC. But that was just one of many excellent reasons to tune in to TV’s most joyous chatshow, with the questions this group of neurodivergent people fired at a visiting celebrity leading to unfailingly brilliant viewing. The panel were fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to. All the celebrity guests, including Danny Dyer, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant, answered with rare candour – while the musical performances left you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read more23Dreaming Whilst BlackView image in fullscreenAlways goes there … Adjani Salmon and his Tyrese backing singers in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary Moyes(BBC iPlayer) “Sometimes you have to Hit the Pavement. Ask Zohran Mamdani.” Since season two of his BBC comedy Dreaming Whilst Black came out, Adjani Salmon has been taking to the streets of central London with his Bafta in one hand and a poster in the other that says “Do you watch Black shows”. It’s an ace marketing strategy, but everyone in the UK should already know Salmon, and should already have watched his show – one of the most exciting and hilarious comedies of our age. In its second outing, aspiring film-maker Kwabena (Salmon) starts out unemployed – his uncle brutally roasts him, declaring “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter” – but soon lands what seems like a dream gig: directing a new period drama with colour-blind casting. Soon, though, the wheels come off (literally) in the most catastrophic way. It’s punchy and it always goes there; it even recreated the Tyrese Gibson RnB banger How You Gonna Act Like That. More please, BBC!What we said:“Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised in this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?”Read more22Riot Women(BBC One/iPlayer) This story about a menopausal rock band in Hebden Bridge was unmistakably by Sally Wainwright: a wickedly funny, hugely moving and personal take on women who feel invisible in midlife – with a few twists chucked in for good measure. The cast was some of Britain’s best, including Joanna Scanlan, Lorraine Ashbourne, Tamsin Greig and Sue Johnston. But Rosalie Craig was the standout as furious lead singer Kitty, who belted out their absolute bangers (“Give. Me. HRT!”). There was poignant social commentary, too, and many moments that were a reminder to call your mum tonight. But ultimately, it was a rollicking ode to women who won’t be ignored. Rock on series two!What we said:“Sally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT.”Read more21MoView image in fullscreenAlmost miraculous … Mohammed Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/Netflix(Netflix) Mo is an almost miraculous thing, managing to find humour and humanity in the most impossible circumstances. And the worst of it is that while Mo’s struggles towards belonging in America during season one were already considerable, the Trump administration’s extreme hostility towards “invaders” makes the real situation for such people almost unbearable to contemplate. And yet, Mo’s Palestinian-American creator Mohammed Amer continues to make his extremely heavy points with remarkable lightness – really, the big takeaway should be that the pride, ingenuity and cultural richness offered by strivers like Mo would be an asset to any nation open-hearted and self-possessed enough to welcome them in.What we said:“Surely one of the most heart-rending things you’ll watch on TV this year. It brings together food, identity, immigration, family and Middle Eastern politics in a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read more20-1120Just Act NormalView image in fullscreenThere’s no other show like this … Tionne (Akins Subair), Tiana (Chenée Taylor), Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) and chicken in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge(BBC Three/iPlayer) Drugs, social services, a live chicken: this wry comedy drama had it all. As if a comic tale of three under-18s desperately trying to avoid being taken into care after their mum vanishes wasn’t idiosyncratic enough, it set the series up with one of the year’s most astonishing narrative rug pulls. The youthful cast was astonishing, the gags were strong and its charmingly dark tone was like nothing else on TV. Eye-prickingly sad moments of childhood trauma rubbed up against satire, with plots that ranged from hilarious spoofs of heist movies to a tender teen romance whose early stage played out in a massage parlour. It also featured the most touching tale of a child bonding with a local drug dealer seen on TV this year. Like we said, there’s no other show like this.What we said:“It is, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension … It is altogether a wonderful thing.”Read more19ShiftyView image in fullscreenDazzling … a waxwork of Margaret Thatcher from Shifty.Photograph: Adam Curtis(BBC iPlayer) While it’s possible to argue that Adam Curtis has been telling variations of the same story for many years now (the slow death of liberal democracy and human autonomy at the hands of late-stage capitalism), he still finds new and dazzling ways of illuminating his thesis. Shifty was his most convincing offering in some time: an emotional rather than strictly historical journey and all the better for it. It begins in the Thatcher years and, using Curtis’s extraordinary skill as an editor and archive-hunter, maps a path to the New Labour years. There’s no voiceover – simply a cascading collage of imagery that feels at once familiar and revelatory. Curtis’s films are best appreciated as art installations rather than historical narratives, but this intuitive masterpiece felt convincing on every level.What we said:“It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.”Read more18Slow Horses(Apple TV) We’ve reached season five of the little espionage thriller that could, and by this point it’s become a bona fide blockbuster. Though we can’t help but feel it’s a slight case of diminishing returns, this season still had Gary Oldman giving his all as the slovenly Slough House spy boss Jackson Lamb, Nick “Celebrity Traitors” Mohammed as the London mayor nearly getting shot in a mosque and the honey-trapping of Roddy Ho almost bringing down the whole of MI5. Thankfully, Jackson managed to step in with a cracking checkmate to save the day – and his Slough House crew. Or as he put it: “Fuck MI5. My gaff, my rules.”What we said:“Season five isn’t really about white nationalists, or environmental activists, or hostile foreign actors, and yet it is also about all of those things, all at once.”Read more17The Chair Company(Sky Comedy/Now) Fans of Tim Robinson’s awkward brand of humour were in for a real treat with this cracking series. He played family man and office worker Ron, who becomes obsessed with tracking down the company behind the chair that caused an embarrassing accident in front of his colleagues. But what starts as a week of angry emails and phone calls turns into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and the unravelling of a man who has had enough. Bizarre, worryingly relatable and absolutely hilarious.What we said:“You can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming.”Read more16Last One Laughing UKView image in fullscreenAnyone who cracks is out! … host Jimmy Carr with the cast of Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studios(Prime Video) It’s a simple concept: round up 10 comedians in a room and get them to try to make each other laugh – anyone who cracks is kicked out. No wonder it’s been a hit in 26 other countries. Joe Lycett lasted mere minutes, while Richard Ayoade’s deadpan ways consistently worked in his favour. Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster deserves a shout-out, too, but it was Bob Mortimer who stole the show. So much so that he has already been confirmed for season two next year.What we said:“Bob Mortimer performed a magic act first seen on The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer 30 years ago and sang some songs he posted on social media during Covid. The fact that these routines not only found new life on LOL UK, but also pushed his fellow contestants to the brink, is testament to Mortimer’s talent.”Read more15PlatonicView image in fullscreenComedy gold … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Katrina Marcinowski/Apple(Apple TV) Kayaking disasters, LSD-related wedding catastrophes and the most grim golfing-related accident ever shown on TV – in its second season, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s tale of two uni pals navigating midlife lost none of its anarchic spark. And yet its depiction of the pressures of working motherhood felt more acute than ever, with Byrne the standout performer, reliably turning in comedy gold that veered from deadpan to OTT frenzy. Not bad going in a year that her co-star broke records for the number of Emmys he won for his other comedy, The Studio.What we said:“The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.”Read more14Big Boys(Channel 4) It kicked off with Jack finally losing his virginity in a tent in Faliraki and ended up with an emotionally pulverising beach scene (“I didn’t make it did I?”) followed by the revivification of a most beautiful mate. But over three series, Jack Rooke’s gorgeous autobiographical uni comedy about awkward bod Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) and his straight best mate Danny (Jon Pointing) was never one to do things by halves. It tackled love, loss and the drinking of poppers. It had a fish named Alison Hammond, a dissertation called To Bum or Not to Bum, and it offered a masterclass in how to eat Peperami while giving birth to your delivery driver’s baby. But the way it moved towards its final moments was a masterstroke. We can’t wait to see what Rooke does next.What we said: “It’s heartbreaking, it’s beautiful, it’s a valuable companion in itself: sitcoms don’t get much more deep and meaningful than this.”Read more13Such Brave Girls(BBC Three/iPlayer) None of the characters are nice, but it’s almost impossible to watch an episode of this darkly comic, impeccably acted show about three women on the brink and not want to spend more time in their company. A ferocious, laugh-out-loud funny rampage through mental health crises, debt and toxic relationships. Given that creator Kat Sadler and her sister co-star Lizzie Davidson are wringing sparklingly bleak comedy out of material based on their own lives, it makes the bravery of this Bafta-winning creation even more impressive.What we said:“If you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout.”Read more12PluribusView image in fullscreenSpectacularly original … Rhea Seehorn and Kevin Chambers in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/Apple(Apple TV) With Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul behind him, there were huge expectations for showrunner Vince Gilligan’s new drama – but he has pulled off a spectacularly original sci-fi story. Carol (the brilliant Rhea Seehorn, who the show was written for) is a miserable novelist who is immune to an alien virus that takes hold of 99.9% of the world and turns them into a happy hive. As Carol tries to “save” the world, the show morphs into a sharply funny social observation and a psychological thriller that hums with existential dread. As per Gilligan’s works, trust and patience are rewarded – thanks in part to those hypnotic opening montages – and each episode racks up more questions that you’re happy to wait whole series to find answers to. It’s a good job season two has already been commissioned.What we said:“It takes some chutzpah to look at the world in 2025 – especially if you are a non-Maga citizen of the US – and say to yourself, “Yes, but wouldn’t it be almost more terrible if everybody just … got along?” But that is essentially what Gilligan has done. The execution may not be flawless but the audacity of the question is incredible.”Read more11The White LotusView image in fullscreenMelting hearts … Aimee Lou Wood in The White Lotus.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Parker Posey’s lorazepam-fuelled North Carolinian accent! Aimee Lou Wood’s melting of hearts! And … Patrick Schwarzenegger’s sibling incest! The third season of Mike White’s luxury resort drama, set in Thailand, might not have been the best – but it was stuffed with viral comedy moments, treacle-dark twists and career-high performances. This is still one of the most solid series going, with White taking it in weirder and wilder directions each time, so who on earth knows what the next White Lotus stay will bring.What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. ”Read more10-210Louis Theroux: The Settlers(BBC Two/iPlayer) As a follow-up to his 2011 film, The Ultra Zionists, Louis Theroux returned to the West Bank after the 7 October attacks, as more Israeli religious nationalists settled in the occupied Palestinian territory. Not many could keep their cool while having rifles pointed at them repeatedly, or when spending time with Ari Abramowitz, a gun-holding settler from Texas who refused to utter the word “Palestinian”, or Daniella Weiss, the outspoken “godmother” of the settler movement. Even Theroux, in a jaw-dropping moment, set aside his gentle persona and asked whether she is a sociopath. Bold, alarming and necessary viewing.What we said:“I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. It suits him.”Read more9SeveranceView image in fullscreenTouching and troubling … Adam Scott and Britt Lower in Severance.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV) Following up the stunning cliffhanger finale of this creepy workplace satire’s first season was always going to be a difficult feat. But this second outing managed to move past the novelty of a clever premise, featuring employees mentally “severed” into two personalities so that their workplace incarnations are ignorant of their personal lives and vice versa. What emerged were love stories that were touching, troubling and had a flair for wrongfooting the viewer, the show’s creepiest scenes ever and a terrifying guest spot from Gwendoline Christie that’s not just a strong contender for the show’s most memorable moment, but possibly one of her defining roles. Forget Brienne of Tarth: here’s Terrifying Corporate Goat Herd.What we said:“Severance is a rarity in so many ways – stylish without sacrificing substance, a thoroughly singular vision, fresh, challenging, a wholly credible world made of a tissue of incredulities.”Read more8How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)(BBC One/iPlayer) The Gibbons brothers’ BBC revival of Partridge continued apace with this triumphant return to fly-on-the-wall TV redolent of I Am Alan Partridge. This supposed attempt by the broadcaster to tackle a mental health epidemic had a wide brief: from episodes spoofing BBC show Winter Walks to Partridge taking on borderline consumer champion role that saw him tackle an unscrupulous tech boss on behalf of an unfairly sacked employee (only to “give her story the hearing it deserves” by flying one of the company’s jetpacks while screaming “Sell your kids! Get one before they ban it!”). He got wasted on white wine at a book club, was forced to let Lynne nearly crash his car and ruined her church music group by turning them into a rehearsal space for his electronic drum kit. Is that how you champion better mental health? Clearly not. But this is Alan Partridge, after all – on the form of his life.What we said:“Whatever medium he inhabits, Partridge remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, and even placeholder Partridge has more laughs-out-loud per half-hour than anything else on telly.”Read more7The RehearsalView image in fullscreenPrepare to be wrongfooted … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.(Sky Comedy/Now) Nathan Fielder is worried about aircraft safety. Well, he might be. Or he might be using the subject as a smokescreen for a rambling, surreal exploration of the concept of authenticity. Or maybe a bit of both? Fielder’s new series – in which he tries to persuade the aviation industry to adopt new techniques to ensure better cockpit communication between pilots – will wrongfoot you so frequently you’ll end up stumbling in circles. Along the way, he builds a full-scale replica of parts of Houston airport, performs an experiment with a pair of cloned dogs and suckles on a huge model of the mother of heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger. He also (quite literally) sticks the landing in a way that genuinely leaves you gasping. Whatever you expect this show to be, prepare to be wrong. But prepare to be dazzled too: no one else makes television like this.What we said:“At the end of the finale, I realised that all I had written for the final 30 minutes was ‘how on EARTH did they do this????’ over and over again, like a bad version of the typewriter scene in The Shining.”Read more6Alien: EarthView image in fullscreenHell was unleashed …. it’s the demon-eyed sheep on Alien: Earth.Photograph: FX(Disney+) Who could have predicted that a demon-eyed sheep would become the most symbolic baddie in the Alien franchise? Making a TV series of the beloved films (the first two, at least) was a huge gamble. But boy did Noah Hawley pull it off. Fleshing out the mythology, he introduced us to a not-so-far-fetched dystopia where a rich brat in pyjamas called the shots and immortalised dying children via synthetics. He also really wanted aliens. But when his wish came true, hell was unleashed: the trypanohyncha ocellus – a tentacled eyeball that buried itself in its victim’s eye socket, including that poor sheep – joined the xenomorph in scaring the bejesus out of fans. Hawley took his time in telling the story, but even when humans weren’t being ripped apart, the masterly production ensured a sense of doom and always had you wondering: who are the real monsters here?What we said:“The series always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something gloriously horrific is just around the corner.”Read more5Blue LightsView image in fullscreenWhat a show … Siân Brooke as Grace in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PA(BBC One/iPlayer) It’s meticulously researched, so rooted in its Belfast location that it feels like no other cop drama on TV, and almost certainly the show with television’s finest Westlife-based comic moment. As its third season saw action move to the drug trade’s links to wealthy elites it took a darker turn than previously, with fewer comic moments, and a run of grippingly tense episodes that repeatedly raised the bar for the year’s most intense watch. The stress of two officers failing in their battle to stop a car crash victim bleeding out, only to nearly end up being assassinated by dissident republicans while informing the driver’s parents of his death? Pfft. Standout episode Ordo Ab Chao saw a low-key restaurant disturbance end in a stabbing for constable Shane, while colleague Grace had to protect a witness against a carful of gunmen, despite having no weapons, armour or clue what she was supposed to do. At times it was stressful enough to give you a panic attack, and yet, it still managed to end the series on a joyful, smile-inducing singalong. What a show.What we said:“Blue Lights has quietly become one of the best shows on TV.”Read more4The StudioView image in fullscreenOne side-splitting farce after another … Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen and Chase Sui Wonders in The Studio.Photograph: AP(Apple TV) Seth Rogen’s sitcom about a Hollywood film studio broke records for the number of Emmys it won, and with good reason. Despite being stuffed with brilliant celeb cameos (Dave Franco as a live wire, drug-taking party monster! Ron Howard knocking Rogen head over heels in a fight!), its core cast outshone them, oozing astonishing comic flair as they rattled through one side-splitting farce after another. The show’s embrace of its subject matter extended to a soundtrack of big band-style skittering drums redolent of golden era Hollywood and artfully directed episodes whose camerawork included one filmed in an elaborate single-take shot (while the plot of the episode is about a film-maker trying to get an elaborate single-take shot). Don’t let the highfalutin artsy stuff fool you, though: after all, one of the most memorable moments of this hilariously slapstick show is a drug-addled, violently spray-tanned Bryan Cranston in a leopard-skin thong. Unforgettable.What we said:“Many things mark The Studio out from the ever-increasing herd of satires on Hollywood. There is the unimpeachable casting, from core to cameos; the former comprising not just Catherine O’Hara as the raw-nerved Patty but also Kathryn Hahn as permanently, incandescently furious marketing maven Maya.”Read more3The Celebrity TraitorsView image in fullscreenBrilliant … The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) The Traitors has long blown every other reality TV show out of the water with its ability to create event television. And it might just have torpedoed even itself with its brilliant celeb version. Throwing in a troupe of national treasures to the Scottish castle made for instant investment in a show that has never exactly been difficult to care about. The joy of not just seeing the gripping game mechanics unfold, but also being able to draw conclusions about both the contestants (how does Alan Carr have so little volume control?) and the nature of celebrity itself (is the reason they did so badly that they’re all so used to fakeness that they can’t spot it?) added even more layers to a millefeuille of stressful viewing. And the twist in that finale! Undoubtedly the finest Traitors ever. How are we going to go back to caring about the normal one now?What we said:“All the essential elements are present and correct. The Winkleman. The castle. The only difference is that it is a bit easier to keep track of those first-round contestants because they are all familiar faces, designed as a group to pull in punters from all possible demographics and keep the BBC’s current greatest hit as popular as ever.”Read more2Dying for SexView image in fullscreenBeautiful and life-affirming … Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX(Disney+) This spectacular show starredMichelle Williamsat her funniest and most vulnerable as Molly, a woman with terminal cancer who decides to devote the rest of her life to a quest for her first ever orgasm with a partner. Based on a brilliant podcast, Molly’s sexual adventures took in all-day masturbation sessions, cock cages, pup play and a dominatrix awakening. Helping her in this pursuit were a glorious Jenny Slate as her best pal and soulmate, Sissy Spacek as her eccentric mother and Rob Delaney as the comically slovenly neighbour who allowed her to open up. Beautiful, life-affirming TV to revel in – and weep to.What we said:“A wave of horniness”Read moreNo 1 coming soon"

Bitchin Bajas – Inland SeeChicago minimalist trio Bitchin Bajas are experts in crafting the ultimate slow burn, with a discography full of soundscapes that often stretch languorously around or beyond the 10-minute mark. Their latest record follows suit with four winding, blissed-out tracks over a 40-minute run time. But it’s not just overindulgent lounge music: the analogue loops quietly build to transcendental heights, nudged along by wandering sax solos, spritely keys and other cosmic flourishes. It’s a lush, often moving odyssey which, towards the end of the epic 18-minute closer, climaxes in an effervescent flurry.9. Trystero – Humming FuzzIn 2024, Trystero emerged seemingly out of nowhere with an album that sounded like it had been ripped straight from a lost 80s tape, marrying moody krautrock and downtempo dance music. The now-expanded group of Luxembourg musicians (who met through a residency on a barge in France) carry the same hypnotic formula to this year’s follow-up, but with an added stroke of lightness and a fun dancefloor kick. Here, there are also shades of acid house and big beat: playful percussion, euphoric synth stabs and baggy basslines energise the dense, swirling instrumentals.Tell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more8. Alpha Maid – Is This a QueueMuch like her collaborators in the Curl Recordings universe and their post-punk predecessors, south London musician Alpha Maid twists the guitar into janky, angular shapes on this battered but brilliant album. Across its nine tracks, simple hooky riffs and reverb-heavy meanderings coalesce with other DIY elements, including grimy, off-kilter loops and squawking sax flourishes from experimental composer Ben Vince. At points it’s pleasingly melodic (6-9, 2 Numbers), at others, things get out-of-hand, as in Why We Have to Move, which features the frenzied drums of percussionist Valentina Magaletti. Even at its most chaotic, Alpha Maid’s vocal delivery remains dry and effortlessly cool.Read the full review7. Saeko Killy – Dream in DreamView image in fullscreenDizzying effect … Saeko KillySaeko Killy has built a reputation in underground music circles for her swampy, downtempo productions, which sound suited to some otherworldly late-night dancefloor. On her second album, Killy offsets her signature dimly lit sound with a euphoric touch: dreamy Japanese and English vocals, arpeggiated synths and birdsong samples weave in and out of dubby basslines and swathes of echo. Alongside these chugging excursions, there are also references to 80s guitar music – tracks such as Next Time and Melancholic have a skippy post-punk vibe, complete with krautrock-y psychedelic spirals – and hints of functional dance music. But even the most club-adjacent tracks have a dizzying effect.6. Chris Imler – The Internet Will Break My HeartBerlin-based musician Chris Imler conjures all the dark, heady feelings of too much time spent on the internet on this record – and it’s just as moreish. Compounding elements of krautrock, post-punk and downtempo dance music, the tracks often sound as seedy and stuffy as their subject matter: he chants the miscellaneous contents of a late-night doomscroll over an eerie robotic loop on Liturgy of Litter, and jackknifes from war into sex in the chugging Let’s Not Talk About the War. Standout single Agoraphobie (featuring underground experimentalist Naomie Klaus) is also suitably, and brilliantly, claustrophobic.Read the full review5. Raisa K – AffectionatelyView image in fullscreenLow key … Raisa KAfter more than a decade in bands and various DIY projects (most notably Good Sad Happy Bad), south London musician Raisa K made her first big solo outing this year with her debut album Affectionately. Written between a busy work and parenting schedule, and produced entirely on her laptop, the record is as primitive and intimate as a diary entry. K’s lyrics are plain and her delivery is cool, almost deadpan, as she ruminates over the sweet sentiments and everyday dramas of relationships: on the title track, shemumbles “we never have anything to talk about” over and over, like an absent-minded mantra. Her woozy melodies, made from rickety drum loops and scuzzy electronics, are just as low key and charming.Read the full review4. Sacred Lodge – AmbamOne of the first things you’re struck by in Sacred Lodge’s second album is his growling, death-metal-pitched voice: sometimes it’s the centrepiece – dense and in your face – and at other times it’s just texture, stalking around his foreboding instrumentals through echo-laden yelps and cries. Inspired by the tradition of field hollers and ritual chants, the vocals are one of the Paris-based sound artist’s nods to his ethnological research, which focuses on ethnomusicology and his own Equatoguinean heritage. The sense of urgency is sustained elsewhere, too: through the turbulent drums, the steely, horrorcore-influenced electronics and the deep, murky low end. It’s a thrilling listen.Read the full review3. feeo – GoodnessView image in fullscreenShapeshifting … feeo.Photograph: Ciara ReddyThe 11-track debut album by south London-based experimentalist feeo is a great introduction to an exciting, shapeshifting artist. There are echoes of her improvisational project Grain Residency in these droning compositions, which fuzz and mutate, punctuated by spoken word features and field recordings. They also show off feeo’s talent as a vocalist. She has a gorgeous voice, which saunters between eerie, breathy whispers and full-on mellifluous croons. Parallels could be drawn to a generation of alt-electronic musicians such as Sampha and James Blake, but these warped tracks feel uniquely innovative.2. Dania – ListlessThe dreamy, downtempo sounds of trip-hop have been ubiquitous this year, in underground and commercial releases alike. Listless, the new album by Baghdad-born, Barcelona-based producer Dania, is one example, with slow, syncopated drum patterns and murky textures embedded throughout the synths and soft layered vocals. But it doesn’t feel like an opportune case of hopping on the bandwagon: the palette is perfectly matched to the album’s theme: written and recorded after midnight, and inspired by Dania’s experiences on night shifts as an emergency doctor, it is an atmospheric, occasionally brooding, musing on the nocturnal hours.Read the full review1. Joanne Robertson – BlurrrView image in fullscreenUnderstated … Joanne Robertson.Photograph: Nis BystedFor many years, Glasgow-based painter-musician Joanne Robertson has been making beautiful, understated songs using little more than her voice and acoustic guitar. It’s music that might sound straight-up pleasant if it wasn’t tinged with only the slightest streak of the uncanny (an element that makes her an ideal match for past collaborator Dean Blunt). Her new album is full of gorgeous, wandering tracks with a warm but ghostly atmosphere: stray guitar strums flicker beneath Robertson’s soft voice, which is sometimes shy, sometimes yearning. It’s a simple formula, but somehow it’s full of feeling. The fact that many of the tracks sound as if they were recorded at home, bookended with string squeaks and amp echoes, only adds to the intimacy.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicBest music of 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

One fan tribute in particular hailed how his work on It Chapter Two stood out in a cast whose members included Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy and Skarsgård’s brother, Bill, who portrays the antagonist Pennywise.Among those in Hollywood to weigh in was Ransone’s fellow actor Wendell Pierce, who worked alongside him onThe Wireand Treme, another Simon creation.“Sorry I couldn’t be there for you, brother,” the Tony award winner wrote on social media.Film-makers Spike Lee, Larry Clark and Sean Baker – who each directed Ransone during his career – expressed similar sentiments. “I’ll miss you dearly,” the Oscar-winning Baker said in a social media post.Ransone’s widow, Jamie McPhee, published a social media note thanking him for their “greatest gifts”: their six-year-old son, Jack, and daughter Violet, four.“I have loved you 1000 times before and I know I will love you again,” McPhee’s post said. “We are forever.”Ransone was born in Baltimore in 1979.

The decision comes days after his publisher, HarperCollins,cut ties with the author. Walliams has denied the allegations.Walliams was set to appear at the Dundee leg of the festival on February 7. He has now been removed from the list of speakers on the festival’s website. A spokesperson for Waterstones told the Guardian: “HarperCollins have confirmed thatDavid Walliamswill no longer be appearing at our festival in Dundee.”HarperCollins dropped Walliams after an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women, the Telegraph reported on Friday. According to the newspaper, he was the subject of complaints that he had “harassed” junior female staff at HarperCollins UK. One woman who raised concerns is understood to have left the company after reaching a settlement that included a five-figure payout. After the investigation, the publisher decided it would no longer release new titles by the author.A spokesperson for Walliams said that he had “never been informed of any allegations raised against him” by HarperCollins. “He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice.”In a statement to the Guardian on Friday, HarperCollins said: “After careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO, HarperCollins UK has decided not to publish any new titles by David Walliams.”The news comes as Walliams is scheduled to appear on a festive special of the comedy panel show Would I Lie to You? on Boxing Day on BBC One. The episode attracted controversy earlier this year after it emerged that he had made two Nazi salutes during the recording. At the time, the BBC apologised to those present. A spokesperson for Banijay UK, which owns Would I Lie To You? producer Zeppotron, said it was “immediately acknowledged during the recording that this segment would not be broadcast under any circumstances.”After last week’s allegations about Walliams, a spokesperson told BBC reporters: “While we’re not making any changes to the festive schedules, we have no future projects directly involving David Walliams.”Two of Walliams’ books, Mr Stink and The Boy in the Dress, have been adapted for television and were broadcast on CBBC on Sunday.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Lee Child and Andrew Child, Charlie Mackesy, Dan Brown, Kristin Hannah and Jamie Oliver also feature in the list.Colouring books appear to be trending again as Coco Wyo’s Cozy Corner and Cozy Cuties, marketed to adults and children, made the top 15. The two books account for close to 500,000 sales this year.“So many people have fallen for these beautiful colouring books because they provide people with a place to relax, unwind and get creative, away from screens,” said Fenella Bates, non-fiction publisher at Penguin Random House Children. “We’re encouraged to put down our phones and escape into the pages of these books, which have become a little pocket of calm in our hectic world.”The rise of colouring as an adult hobbymade headlines in 2015. That year, the Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford’s colouring bookstopped the Amazon bestsellers listin the US.Bates has taken up colouring herself and said she has become “hooked on the books”, describing them as “a great way to destress and find a moment for yourself at the end of the day.”Coming in at 20th overall was Nicholls’s You Are Here, a romance following the blossoming of a relationship between two divorcees on a hiking trip through the Lake District.Federico Andornino, Nicholls’s editor and executive publisher at Spectre, attributes the book’s success to readers’ cravings for escapism and connection. “No one does that better than David: he’s got the very rare gift of making people think, laugh out loud and cry – often in the same chapter,” he said.View image in fullscreenDavid Nicholls’s latest novel, You Are Here, came in 20th overall.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverThe top 20 bestsellers of 2025The Impossible Fortune by Richard Osman (Viking, hardback) – 391,429 copiesThe Housemaid by Freida McFadden (Little, Brown, paperback) – 342,899 copiesSunrise on the Reaping by Suzanne Collins (Scholastic, hardback) – 333,340 copiesWe Solve Murders by Richard Osman (Penguin, paperback) – 323,293 copiesOnyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros (Piatkus, hardback) – 304,728 copiesAlways Remember by Charlie Mackesy (Ebury Press, hardback) – 286,090 copiesCozy Corner by Coco Wyo (Penguin, paperback) – 255,682 copiesThe Secret of Secrets by Dan Brown (Bantam, hardback) – 245,318 copiesFourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros (Piatkus, paperback) – 241,532 copiesA Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J Maas (Bloomsbury, paperback) – 224,535 copiesThe Women by Kristin Hannah (Pan, paperback) – 220,629 copiesThe Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins and Sawyer Robbins (Hay House, hardback) – 218,919 copiesEat Yourself Healthy by Jamie Oliver (Michael Joseph, hardback) – 217,520 copiesThe Hotel Avocado by Bob Mortimer (Gallery, paperback) – 210,116 copiesCozy Cuties by Coco Wyo (Penguin, paperback) – 205,619 copiesIn Too Deep by Lee Child and Andrew Child (Penguin, paperback) – 204,538 copiesIron Flame by Rebecca Yarros (Piatkus, paperback) – 201,474 copiesThere Are Rivers in the Sky by Elif Shafak (Penguin, paperback) – 193,640 copiesThe Housemaid’s Secret by Freida McFadden (Little, Brown, paperback) – 191,804 copiesYou Are Here byDavid Nicholls(Hodder & Stoughton, paperback) – 187,010 copiesExplore more on these topicsBooksRichard OsmanSuzanne CollinsDavid NichollsBob MortimerHunger GamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Hello Chris.Ghost in a time-ripped landscapewhere a low solstice sun spills whiskedthrough a metallic staircase.With joy, the man’s smile haunts me for miles —a long blasted path, where a dead rat’s belly festoonsits purple crinoline Christmas hat.In canal-light, in time-light, in Cratchit-light,in ripped-light, in rat-light, in Solstice-light,in metallic-light, in frost-light, in grief-light,in Christmas-lightfrom the smile of a strangerI remake my father.This week’s poem is fromHedonism, Chris McCabe’s latest, sixth poetry collection. It confirms a prodigious talent for the assimilation of ideas, and for letting them loose in forms that are variously experimental, and use the full muscle and gristle of lived language. Hedonism, at its simplest, isthe philosophy that prioritises pleasure. McCabe’s interpretation uncovers all kinds of delightful and surprising stories: they are antidotes to melancholia, but capable of a sustaining emotional realism.Connective tributaries weave in and out of the collection: the loss of a father, associated with Christmas Day, is one of them. In this week’s poem, it appears that McCabe’s adult persona is back home in his native Liverpool for some festivities. But the remaking of the past seems to begin with the impulse to take Christmas out of doors, into a local but larger-than-family setting.The unidentified man who meets the speaker by the canal emerges out of “water-light”, not water. If a reader thinks about identifying the figure as Christ, there’s a quick corrective: Cratchit, Scrooge’s clerk and foil in A Christmas Carol, is the word. It’s a scratchy name, like the cheap scarf the shivering figure in the story needed to wear indoors. This dream-Cratchit recognises the poet-speaker with a friendly surprise and names him instantly: “I know you. Hello Chris.”Plainly audible end-rhyme marks the mutual recognition, and the power of a particularly haunted “Day” to speak and to “say”. Internal rhyme and alliteration complicate the textures. We then step abruptly into the difficulty of seeing how past and future connect. The soundscape is alive with whispers and clicks: “Cratchit-wrapped”, “time-ripped”, “solstice”, “spills”, “whisked”, “metallic staircase”. The images call up fissures of neglect and redevelopment, and the inconvenient ways memory and imagination muddle the smooth with the rough.Roughness is interrupted by the “smile” that “haunts me for miles” but rediscovered and heightened by the presence of the rat, brutally dead in the fancy clothes and colouring of decay. Decomposition is not necessarily a negative image: the poem leaves us room to accept it without revulsion – perhaps invites us to do so.“Rat-light” is among the forms of light the poem gathers together, a spectrum that constitutes one big “ripped-light”. The rip produces clarity as well as complication, especially in the unequivocal presentation of the quietly enlightened hero-father: he’s the breathing ghost of a morality that suspends relativism or cynicism. McCabe’s sense of moral value, and what it might mean politically, is essential to much of his insight as a thinker and writer, and helps inform the joy of Hedonism.Shifts of “light” are necessary to the poem’s vision, but they are to some degree the backdrop, as the syntax of the last six lines makes clear. Now the ordinariness underlying the miracle is revealed: “from the smile of a stranger / I remake my father”. It’s a non-cryptic clue for making the future from the hauntings of the past (and, just maybe, for turning a stranger into one of the family).Another poem in McCabe’s new collection led me to a discovery – the remarkable work and ideas of the writer, music critic and philosopherMark Fisher. The idea of “haunting” and its more complex form of “hauntology” add a special edge to the current poem, and to the collection.Chris McCabe himself givesa rewarding short interview here.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over time, and possibly coloured by the historical context of Portuguese colonists’ rampages across the globe, “palaver” came to refer to a complex debate or negotiation between two culturally distinct parties.Culture clashes, conflicted conversations, oppositions and exchanges are principal interests for Washington. His debut novel, 2020’sMemorial, was a sobering but sensitive consideration of a fracturing interracial gay relationship set between Houston and Osaka. This was followed in 2023 byFamily Meal, again taking place in Houston, with its pithy observations of a combustible queer love triangle. Palaver centres on the tense relationship between protagonists “the son” and “the mother”. Guarded and prickly, the son is an American who has lived in Tokyo for the best part of a decade, teaching English as a foreign language. Throughout this period, he’s been estranged from his Jamaican-American mother back home in Texas. The novel opens with the equally crabby mother unexpectedly turning up on her son’s doorstep, and mostly covers the week and a half they spend together, moving between their two perspectives. Illuminated by Tokyo’s harsh neon, mother and son edge around reckonings with their bitter past of familial dysfunction, and make their way towards something resembling rapprochement.Conversation between the two often seems impossible. The son reverts to the body language of adolescent discontent: he is endlessly groaning, grimacing or rolling his eyes. While these gestures might signal a metaphorical evasion of connection, he avoids his mother more literally too. Instead of showing her the delights of his adopted home town, he continues his usual routine of drinking a little too much with his rather fabulous crew of extremely funny and silly gay pals, going on questionable Grindr hookups and coasting through relationships with unavailable men.I am itching for Washington to turn his sharp eye to new material and questionsMeanwhile, the mother – an inquisitive and self-sufficient character – becomes a flaneuse. She wanders through Tokyo from the son’s apartment to the shops, “past the hot pot diners, and then the cluster of tiny alleys where teens flipped skateboards, filming TikToks, and then the trio of shawarma stalls whose lines spilled into the intersections; past the bundled buildings advertising hostess bars and international phone plans, toward the tunnel covering huddles of men smoking cigarettes, drinking from Sapporo cans on the overpass alongside Ōkubo Station”. Her confidence at navigating the city’s spaces develops in tandem with her boldness in persuading her son to share more of his life with her and to see her humanity.Alongside this present-day narrative, there are flashbacks to the mother’s childhood in the Caribbean, where we discover that her hostility and homophobia have a complex and affecting genesis concerning her charismatic brother, Stefan. Then there are recollections of the mother’s emigration to Toronto. There is also a storyline about the son’s brother, Chris, who has spent time in prison. Interspersed amid all this are photos that capture Tokyo’s streetlife, nightlife and Japanese domesticity. All this variety can make proceedings feel as wandering as one of the mother’s undirected strolls. The structure reflects the theme of powerlessness: “the mother couldn’t help but wonder how little control she had over her life, and how little say everyone has in where they end up”. In the same way both mother and son believe they have been thrown off course by often cruel winds of circumstance, so the novel cannot follow a straightforwardly linear path.The determined sparsity and downbeat mode of the narration – signatures of Washington’s oeuvre now – mean that, largely, these scattered fragments come together to form a sensible whole. The narrative is glued together by the themes of alienation, exile and the challenges of creating and sustaining a sense of home.Arguably, there is something colourless and trite about the novel’s ultimate – and seemingly inevitable – move towards mutual understanding between the two lead characters. And throughout, as in Family Meal, there is a tendency towards a kind of faux-insightful Insta-therapy speak in the dialogue that does a disservice to the alluring strangeness and open-endedness of characterisation elsewhere. At one point, an elder mentor figure gives the son the weighty life advice that he needs to “show up for himself”.But fans of Washington’s work will have much to enjoy here. All the staples of his style are on show: the mumblecore prose, the interest in Asian culture and particularly cuisine, messy gay bars, a chosen family of smart aleck and ludic queer sidekicks, frank presentations of sex and sexuality, unwanted guests and unlikely alliances, tricky mothers and harrumphing sons. This, however, was the principal problem for me: I felt that, in Palaver, I was reading a remix of Washington’s greatest hits. Undoubtedly Washington is a fine, stylish and very talented writer. But I am itching for him to turn his sharp eye to new material and questions. In the middle of the novel, the mother remembers her brother nudging her to leave Jamaica, to spread her wings. “You know what life is here … go see what it is elsewhere.” Pertinent advice indeed.Explore more on these topicsFictionBook of the dayreviewsShareReuse this content"

Film-makers explain why Pasolini ‘was a saint to us’Sam MooreMon 22 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 22 Dec 2025 03.28 ESTShareAbel Ferrara was there at the beginning. In his new memoir, Scene, the cult director describes his experience at the American premiere of Salò, the hugely controversial final film from Italian directorPier Paolo Pasolini. At the beginning of the film – at which Ferrara and company arrived with wine and cheese, given its length – there were 15 people in the audience. Once the credits rolled, there were eight. “I was standing with like six people,” Ferrara says now. “And you know, two or three of those people I still see.”When it comes to Salò, it seems that you never forget your first time. The film, which has reached its 50th anniversary in 2025, is known for its seemingly endless cavalcade of cruelty and violence, leaves a stark impact on those who come across it. “We had high expectations, but it went beyond that,” Ferrara says. “He had just died, so he was a saint to us.” But not everyone so readily embraces the film on first viewing. Film-maker Catherine Breillat says that at first, she didn’t like Salò, “regretted seeing it, [and] sort of wished that [I] hadn’t”. For Breillat, “you have to be ready to see Salò. Its like Arthur’s Round Table; it will come to you when you’re ready. There’s a moment where you can sit down with the knights of the Round Table, after following a dangerous path, and you don’t disappear into the abyss.”View image in fullscreenA 1975 poster for the film.Photograph: Album/AlamyIronically, production on Salò, which was shot in a number of locations in Italy in early 1975, appears to have been a contrast to the stark brutality of the film itself. In a documentary about the making of the film, Hélène Surgère (who played storyteller Signora Vaccari) described the mood of the shoot as “jovial and immature”, the cast full of teenagers who would make jokes during some of the film’s most brutal sequences. At the centre of it all was Pasolini himself, who wouldn’t rehearse the actors, and would only tell them what would happen a few minutes before calling action. In an interviewby Gideon Bachmann for Sight and Soundwhile shooting the film – and therefore only shortly before his death – Pasolini said he was aiming to create a “profoundly enigmatic” film, and that “not to be understood or even to be misunderstood is an intrinsic dimension of this work”.Pasolini and his films were never strangers to controversy, but Salò seemed to be at a level all its own. From its initial release, it was plagued by censorship and accusations of indecency. This began in Pasolini’s native Italy; the film was initially rejected by Italian film censors, but was approved in December 1975, a month after the film’s premiere at the 1975 Paris film festival (which itself was only three weeks after Pasolini’s death). The approval did not last long; Italian censors withdrew permissions for the film in January 1976. Eventually Salò was shown in Rome in March 1977, and even then in a truncated form, with four sequences omitted.Salò received a limited theatrical release in the US in 1977, but in the UK, it was rejected by the BBFC in 1976 and was first shown at the Compton Cinema Club a year later, uncut and without a certification but the screening was raided by the Metropolitan police. The film wouldn’t be released uncut in the UK until 2000, as a result of new BBFC guidelines, through which the board would only intervene over material for adults if it was illegal or harmful.View image in fullscreenA scene from the filmPhotograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyBut now, decades after these struggles with bans and censorship, Salò, and Pasolini’s work more broadly, seems to be in the midst of a revival. In 2014, Ferraradirected a biopic of Pasolini with Willem Dafoe in the lead role; for Ferrara, who describes Pasolini as being like “his teacher, even more [so] now”, the power of Pasolini’s films only strengthens with the passage of time. “Like all great work, you can reread them at different points in your life and more is revealed.” More recently, in 2024, Bruce LaBruce shot ahardcore remake of Pasolini’s Theorem, called The Visitor, in which the enigmatic stranger, who changes the lives of a middle-class family through a series of sexual encounters, is recast as an immigrant, taking on a new, politically live dimension in contemporary Britain.Politics is everywhere in Pasolini’s work, and especially in Salò; LaBruce says that its paralleling of De Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom to Italian fascism is “stupefying” , suggesting that Pasolini’s films and politics “transcend any simplistic notion of gay or queer identity”. This seems to manifest in the final scene of Salò, where two young men dance together in an empty room, the sounds of torture and violence just outside and out of reach. There’s a tension in Pasolini’s characters, the ways in which they shift between being victims and collaborators, between trying to save others and save themselves. But not all film-makers relate to the politics of Salò in the same way. For Breillat, Salò unlocked itself to her when she “defrocked it of the metaphor of fascism” and revealed something more universal and philosophical, the idea that, as she puts it, “we all share the same fears and desires”.View image in fullscreenA shift between being victims and collaborators … a scene from Salò.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyBut there also remains a sense that Pasolini’s work remains unfinished. Ferrara describes his approach to filming his 2014 biopic as being like a documentary. “We knew we were going to film his death,” Ferrara says. “That was a reality.” Pasolini died on 2 November 1975; he was beaten, run over with his own car, and had multiple bones broken. Ferrara said he and his crew did their own research into Pasolini’s last 36 hours; in his film, the film-maker is assaulted on a beach outside Rome in a homophobic attack, with Giuseppe Pelosi –who, at 17, confessed to the murder but retracted it in May 2005– fleeing the scene while Pasolini is run over. Over the course of more than five decades, Pasolini’s death remains mired in mystery and conspiracy; there have been suggestions of organised crime involvement, and political motivation. When he retracted his confession, Pelosi said that three men killed Pasolini, calling him a “queer” and a “dirty communist”.Looming over all of this is the sense of what it meant for Pasolini’s life to be cut short. “The guy died with two novels, a brilliant movie, he’d finished two incredible screenplays.” Ferrara shows Pasolini shooting his unfinished project: Porno-Teo-Kolossal, the story of a man and his servant following a star in search of a messiah.Pasolini, it would appear, seems to be a gift that keeps on giving; LaBruce says that he returns to Salò “every few years, and it’s always as if I’m seeing it for the first time. It’s just as profound, just as disturbing, just as relevant, if not more so every time.” It is a sentiment echoed by Ferrara, who says that Pasolini will be “always modern […] anybody who believes in the cinema and just gets it is going to give in.” While it is tempting to think that the lasting power of Salò lies simply in its ability to shock and disturb – although it is, of course, both shocking and disturbing – that does a disservice to both the film and its director. While there currently seems to some anxiety that the circumstances around his death might somehow overshadow his life and body of work, these are the things that will carry Pasolini forward into the next generation and beyond.Explore more on these topicsFilmPier Paolo PasoliniAbel FerraraItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now I feel better for it in every way, while also basking in the afterglow of this luminous piece of film-making that is cinematic fertiliser for thought.With a gentle touch that blends wonder and wit, prioritising none of the different voices and viewpoints we hear over any other (and that includes from plants themselves), McLean builds up an audiovisual collage of perspectives on plant-people relations. Some of the humans featured are merely silent subjects, often as still as the potted protagonists themselves. One woman is a bit woo-woo – but persuasively and charmingly so – about how one of her plants seemed to wither away with loneliness after being separated from her mother-in-law’s tongue plant it sat next to for years, only to become rejuvenated when they were reunited.A man who cares painstakingly for the many plants in the Golda Meir library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee speaks more pragmatically about the art of repotting and optimal placement. His manner comes across as eminently self-effacing but clearly his knowledge is grounded deep in years of close observation, like of many of the other plant lovers we meet here. That includes two aging bonsai specialists who movingly celebrate the oldest specimen’s gnarls and scars, which speak of the tree’s history. Elsewhere, a young man discourses passionately about integrating plants as design elements into minimalist decor, their abundance and randomness a welcome challenge to the austerity of his aesthetic principles.Throughout, McLean weaves in abstract photography as well as on-screen text that is meant to represent a plant speaking, describing what photosynthesis feels like for them. “It feels good to become unstable, to turn light energy into chemical energy,” the text says. Botany fans will thrill to the jargon drops here, the chatter of “vascular bundles” and “stomata and antennae” that leavens the weightier, more metaphysical musings on the synergistic connections between humans and plants. This is perhaps undercut by some of the plants towards the end talking among themselves, and laughing at our need to parse everything up with taxonomies and nomenclature.Unsurprisingly given McLean’s background in photography and visual art, Light Needs is immaculately filmed with lenses that capture the finest textures on every organism’s surface, be it skin or leaf. A thoughtful electronic score adds a playful touch throughout, and this works as a coherent film despite its fragmentary parts. Immaculate.Light Needs is on True Story from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPlantsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Coming up is the panto. On other days, it may be anything from language lessons to arts and crafts. Today in this multipurpose venue, it is the turn of the annual Christmas fair, with its bric-a-brac stalls, grotto and tree. Sitting on four sides of the elegant ballroom in Chadderton town hall, a refuge forOldham Coliseum during renovations, we require no leap of the imagination to picture ourselves at a genuine local fundraiser.That gives Jim Cartwright’s 2012 play a built-in sense of community. Director Jimmy Fairhurst keeps the house lights up, save for the most poignant speeches, and expects us to clap along to the Christmas hits and cheer the young carol singers as if they were children of our own. Blurring the fact/fiction divide, the interval is less a break in the action than a chance to buy the scented candles and prints by Oldham artists that are otherwise part of the set.View image in fullscreenPleasing materiality … Gordon-Harrison as Lucy with Paddy Stafford as Johnny, staffing the bric-a-brac stall.Photograph: Patch DolanThe site-specific hall has its disadvantages. The acoustics are poor and the focus bounces unpredictably around the space, sucking the life out of Cartwright’s jokes. Surprisingly for Fairhurst, whose Not Too Tame company specialises in boisterous entertainment and direct address, there is little audience interaction.But there is a chaotic appeal in the playwright’s structural conceit. The show opens with the caretaker (Lee Toomes) sweeping up an empty space which, with the arrival of bossy Veronica (Samantha Robinson), enthusiast Lucy (Kelise Gordon-Harrison), the vicar (Dickon Tyrrell) and lefty writer Johnny (Paddy Stafford), gradually fills with tables laden with trinkets, toys and teddy bears. Before the night is through, it will all be cleared away again. It is not exactlyWorks and Days, the wordless Belgian show that built a whole house on stage, but it has a pleasing materiality.A breezy first half contrasts with a weightier second, in which the characters take turns to reveal their demons in aria-like soliloquies. The speeches are dramatically inert, back-story reflections instead of present-tense action, but heartfelt for all that. Bathed in goodwill-to-all-men sentiment and acted with charm, it amounts to a slight but wholesome seasonal alternative.AtChadderton Town Hall, Oldham, until 2 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

That should surely now be unconditional. Cutting has risen, almost to the top, and 2025 has been astellar year. This enthusiastically performed and received recital, a world away from the general run of pre-Christmas concerts or countertenor recitals, and accompanied by the eclectically matched eight-strong Refound Ensemble, showed why.Themed recitals are common, but Cutting’s programme of songs and music, all connected to the theme of night, was built on levels of thought and performative imagination that few such programmes would even attempt, much less bring off. The pieces ranged from the baroque to the brand new, via Schubert, folk song and Don McLean. Few familiar pieces on the programme were played as written, with Cutting preferring arrangements mostly by members of the ensemble. It was compelling from first to last, more cabaret than concert.View image in fullscreenHugh Cutting with clarinettist Magdalenna Krstevska at the Wigmore Hall, London.Photograph: Sisi BurnThe calms and charms of night came first. Even here, though, there was instant originality in a lilting Auden setting by Geoffrey Burgon, once famous for the Nunc Dimittis from the BBC’s 1970s Le Carré adaptations. Then, without a break, as was most of the programme, we had Endymion’s soulful song to the moon from Cavalli’s La Calisto and Purcell’s Fairy Queen aria hymning the pleasures of the night, to which Cutting’s lustrous countertenor was ideally suited.Of the two premieres, Piers Connor Kennedy’s Morpheus, a dark and expressive Rupert Brooke setting, was particularly successful, crisply scored and sung with nice subtlety. Elena Langer’s Fabulous Beasts, settings of medieval lyrics about birds and beasts, linked by virtuosic clarinet playing by Magdalenna Krstevska, was odder and quirkier, but too disjointed.Oberon’s “Welcome, wanderer!” from Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream was done in a brilliant arrangement that captured all the transgressive eeriness of the score. Then a darker and more dramatic turn, with Schubert’s Erlkönig and Richard Rodney Bennett’s Baby, Baby, Naughty Baby each unleashing alarming nocturnal demons. Don McLean’s gentle 1970 song Vincent, sung by Cutting in baritone, trod the same knife-edge in a different way. The black humour of William Bolcom’s ghoulish Black Max was terrifically done, and Weill’s Speak Low was a seductive reminder at the end that the night is also made for love.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

A white dome floats in the gloaming above a plain black doorway outlined with red light, like a portal to another dimension.

There are sessions on astrophotography and, on moonless nights, dark sky astronomy with the chance to see “a glittering tapestry of stars, galaxies, nebulae and star clusters”. Its director, Gary Fildes, is a veteran in the field, having founded and led three UK observatories over two decades. The goal at Grizedale, he says, is to create “an immersive, year-round astronomy and science destination that brings the beauty of the Lake District skies to visitors”.View image in fullscreenThe observatory’s regular evenings form part ofCumbria’s annual dark skies festivalin late October and November. The festival offers owl- and bat-spotting walks and chances to swim orcanoe after dark. But the observatory does more than dip a toe in the cosmic lake – it’s a permanent centre for studying the stars. A group of 60 schoolkids is arriving in the morning.I’m here for an Aurora Night, timed to coincide with a period of high solar activity, but the heavens are stubbornly blanketed with cloud. The first drops of rain are falling as we head into Mission Control, with its little cafe tables,hand-painted otherworldly mural, inflatable alien and row of model rockets, built to scale by the observatory’s manager, Ben Marshall, a spaceflight obsessive.View image in fullscreenRobert Bryce Muir’s warrior sculpture in Grizedale Forest.Photograph: Stan Pritchard/AlamyA couple of hours later, we’re all staring up in wonder at a bejewelled night sky with shooting stars – thanks to the centre’s planetarium. An illustrated talk about auroras in the Stargazers’ Lounge combines detailed explanations with a sense of cosmic wonder. In the Meteorite Lab next door, there are microscopes and little space rocks – including actual pieces of the moon and Mars.After hot drinks in Mission Control, Gary leads us through torrential rain to the new cedar-smelling observatory he helped build. He shows us extraordinary photos of the spiralling Andromeda galaxy and the dark Horsehead nebula, silhouetted against a glowing red dust and gas cloud, all taken by the robotic telescope in the retractable custom-built dome. For nights when the weather won’t cooperate, Grizedale gives out a free clear-sky pass so visitors can come back and stargaze another time.For me, astronomy isn’t just about science and telescopes. It’s about people, and realising that we’re all part of something far biggerThe observatory’s team are clearly enthusiasts. Gary has been fascinated by the night sky “ever since I was a kid growing up in Sunderland, standing in the back garden and looking up, wondering what all those stars were”. His life story is remarkable. He tells me: “I was a bricklayer for years, but that curiosity about the universe never really went away. Eventually, I decided to take a massive leap and follow that passion properly – and it changed my life. I builtKielder Observatoryin Northumberland from scratch, thenGrassholme Observatoryin Teesdale, and now I’m working in Saudi Arabia developing the Al-Ula Manara Space Observatory, one of the most exciting astronomy projects in the world.”Gary describes how one observatory visitor wept when she first saw Saturn through a telescope, explaining that her father used to draw planets in a wartime air raid shelter and ringed Saturn was her favourite. “For me, astronomy isn’t just about science and telescopes,” says Gary. “It’s about people. It’s about perspective, wonder, and realising that we’re all part of something far bigger.”View image in fullscreenThe Hawkshead valley looking towards the Old Man of Coniston and Tarn Hows.Photograph: Martin Bache/AlamyNo buses run to Grizedale Forest, but getting here without a car has been surprisingly easy. After an early start from Essex into London, the train up to Oxenholme takes less than three hours, racing past the Chilterns woods and Midlands canals to the cloud-capped Cumbrian fells. The branch line to Windermere is a 20-minute ride through tussocky fields of Herdwick sheep and slate-roofed, whitewashed villages. Finally, bus 505 from outside Windermere station loops round the lake and winds through hilly beech woods to reach the village of Hawkshead by lunchtime.On a nocturnal trip to the loo, up a leaf-covered slope, I see a handful of stars finally winking through a gap in the cloudsThere are various ways of getting from Hawkshead to the observatory, about 3 miles south:by bike,taxior on foot. I decide towalk there over the fells near Esthwaite Waterand back via Hawkshead Moor. There are streams to hop and boggy hills to climb, but the views are worth it. Home to the UK’s firstforest sculpture park, Grizedale has a huge collection of site-specific art. With amap of the walking trails, I follow one waterlogged path to see Andy Goldsworthy’s sinuous dry-stone wall,Taking a Wall for a Walk. Created in 1990, it’s dressed in thick moss and hidden among dense fir trees. There’s no sound other than rushing water and the calls of tiny, pine-loving goldcrests.Forestry England lets out a little cabinnext door to the observatory, and I’m sleeping there tonight. It’s a real log cabin, immaculately clean, with walls of thick pine trunks, tartan wool curtains and furry blankets. Umbrellas stand by the cabin door, on hand for the changeable Cumbrian weather. On a nocturnal trip to the loo, up a leaf-covered slope, I see a handful of stars finally winking through a gap in the clouds.Heading back towards Hawkshead the next day, I find one of Grizedale’s newer works of art.

But for guests who can’t “read” kitchens – or minds, for that matter – there are some principles that might prove helpful at this time of year. And, for hosts who hate delegating, there are a few ways to share the load (and increase the fun) without losing your sanity.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The easiest and perhaps most obvious job at Christmas is to pour drinks: for the principal cook first, and then for others. Not only does popping a cork or shaking a cocktail make a cook feel less like a caterer and more like part of the party, the sound has the effect of drawing in other helpers. “If you make a cocktail and divvy out jobs, even peeling vegetables is fun,” says Wahaca founder andGuardian regular Thomasina Miers, who enlists everyone in preparing for festivities.View image in fullscreenCheers … a glass of wine always helps things go more smoothly.Photograph: Astarot/Getty/iStockphoto“Glass of wine, some music playing – it’s lovely,” saysPassione Vino’sLuca Dusiof hand-making pasta with family and friends. “So long as they get out of the kitchen when I come to make my ragu. Then I donotwant helpers.”Of course, some tasks lend themselves more to communal prep than others, and pasta dough is a great example: anyone can lend a hand in the rolling and stretching stage. For the same reason, the Henderson family often make dumplings on Christmas Eve. “The kids sit around filling the dumplings and making the broth, and they love that,” saysMargot HendersonofRochelle Canteen. “But there are many things about Christmas dinner that lend themselves to group preparation.” As a cook, she shares my mum’s views on the anything-I-can-do? brigade. “It should be obvious!” she says, but experience has taught her that it’s worth “having a big plan in your head, so you have a job to delegate when someone inevitably asks you”. For all the noise that surrounds it, Christmas dinner is a simple meal. “It’s just a big roast,” saysEd Smith, author of several cookbooks including his bestseller on side dishes,On the Side. “And that means the trickiest thing is that the prep is time-consuming.”Peeling and chopping parsnips, potatoes and sprouts, for example: these are easy jobs, but they take time “and should absolutely be delegated, preferably the night before”, Smith says. One of the most foolproof ways to work out what needs to be done and how is to envisage your dinner onChristmasDay – specifically, whether you’re leading or following. “Can I peel those vegetables? Can I lay the table? Suggest a menial task that demonstrates you mean your offer of help, as opposed to platitudes,” my mum says. Likewise, for the lead cook, specificity is key. “Particularly if, like me, you’re a control freak,” Smith says. “Put out all the right tools, cut the first piece at the size you want, and let that be a guide. That way, you’ll spare yourself the horror of discovering that your sister-in-law cuts parsnips into rounds and prefers skin-on roast potatoes.View image in fullscreenShared rituals … involving children in food preparation helps make Christmas a collective effort.Photograph: svetikd/Getty“The assumption is that you can’t delegateandbe a perfectionist,” Miers says. “But I would argue that many Michelin-starred chefs are perfectionists, and that they get there by delegating. You have to delegate with care: show people how you want things done, rather than just saying ‘chop this’, ‘cook that’,” she adds. Yes, it’s more time-consuming at first, but doing so pays dividends in the long term (particularly with young kids). “It’s not just teaching them how to fend for themselves, it’s showing them that the whole family makes Christmas, not just the parents or, in most cases, mum.” It gives young and old alike some ownership over the meal, and it avoids conjuring up that most unwelcome of Christmas spirits, the kitchen martyr, who insists on doing everything only to be exhausted and irritable by dinner.“No one wants a martyr at the table,” Miers agrees – and no one wants kids who think the festival is “just about the presents: the ripping and grabbing”. Involving them in festive preparations is a heartwarming way to counter this tendency, and indeed some of my fondest memories of Christmas as a child are centred on food preparation. I loved making (and sampling) brandy butter with my brothers, decorating the cake on Christmas Eve and even preparing the sprouts, peeling away what I always thought of as their little green bomber jackets. Age-appropriate tasks are key, of course – I was, on reflection, a little young to be “testing” brandy, and handling knives afterwards. “But if you don’t take part in the buildup to Christmas, it’s all over so quickly,” Miers says. “The shared rituals that make Christmas come with decorating and cooking.”To this end, there is merit in giving your helpers some scope for creativity, even if you are something of an autocrat in an apron. Henderson runs a tight ship at home as well as at Rochelle Canteen, but she has also learned that “people aren’t machines. If they don’t feel able to express themselves, they will be miserable.” Just how much leash you allow will depend on the nature of your regime, such as Dusi allowing his kids near his pasta dough, but drawing a firm line at his ragu or broth. It could be as small as letting a kid judge the amount of bacon “blanket” per sausage “pig” – a job that means Miers’ middle daughter is entitled to extra helpings every year – or as big as delegating an entire dish.View image in fullscreenKnives out … the vegetables need prepping.Photograph: David Davies/PA“Most things that are delicious in Christmas dinner are best cooked in the moment,” Smith says. “But there are a few things that can be done in advance.” Cranberry sauce, bread sauce, stuffing, even a slightly fancier vegetable side, though purists will tell you that Christmas dinner has enough going on without the need for such extravagance. “If you’ve room for a side that’s a bit more interesting, a sprout gratin is very good and can be done in advance,” says Smith,who shares such a recipe on his Substack. Another idea, which could stand in for multiple sides, involvespotatoes, chestnuts and parsnips. “It’s a delicious dish that someone can easily do, and it’s just as good the following day,” he says, should leftovers be on the Boxing Day menu.The biggest condition of any offer of help, large or small, however, is that you finish the job. “If you’re washing dishes, put them away,” Henderson says wearily. Ditto dirty dishes in the dishwasher and vegetable peelings in the compost bin. “Cooking is fun, but it’s not just about the end product,” she says. “It’s all the little boring jobs, which are enjoyable when done together, but if they’re not done, it’s just one person cleaning up the mess.” And that, of course, makes for the dreaded martyr.That said, there should be only one person in charge, Dusi insists. Some may resent it, but years of working in restaurants have taught him: “there cannot be too many voices in a kitchen. You may disagree violently with the person leading, but there has to be someone directing the traffic. If you disagree with them when things are stressful, things will go south.” The proverb “too many cooks spoil the broth” is true of professional kitchens and those at home alike. The time to discuss leadership style is after Christmas, when everyone has calmed down, Dusi adds. “The middle of service is not the time to suggest a change of direction.”Inevitably, there will be some cooks who cannot tolerate help; who will combust if someone so much as picks up a spoon, let alone stirs with it. If this is you – or the person whose Christmas you’re at – remember that help does not have to be confined to food. Though chefsItamar SrulovichandSarit Packerare married and the co-founders of a small Middle Eastern restaurant group,Honey & Co, they can’t be in the kitchen together either at home or in any of their restaurants. “All we would do is instruct each other,” Srulovich says. “And that would mess up our business and ruin our marriage as well. So, if Sarit is cooking dinner for friends, she does the whole thing from peeling the carrots to loading the dishwasher. And vice versa.”That doesn’t mean the other half sits on their bum. Srulovich says: “They help with shopping, the cleaning, getting flowers, laying the table – these are not insignificant things. If every time you cook with your partner it ends in a passionate lovemaking session, then go with it. If it ends in friction, avoid. Know thyself and thy relationships, and do whatever works for you. And remember: there are jobs outside the kitchen as well as in it.”If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive Feast in your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFoodFeastChristmas food and drinkChristmasVegetarian food and drinkDessertnewslettersShareReuse this content"
