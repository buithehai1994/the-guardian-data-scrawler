Tax it properly – and turbocharge the fight against child povertyGordon BrownNew thinking is urgent now. I have not seen such deep poverty since I grew up in a mining and textiles town blighted by unemploymentWed 6 Aug 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 14.14 EDTShareFrom 1945 to 1951, a Labour government, struggling to pay down Britain’s war debts in what became known as the “age of austerity”,created Britain’s welfare state, pioneered a free National Health Service and implemented family allowances. In the 1970s, facing an oil shock and rising deficits, Labour introducedchild benefitfor 7 million families. By 2010, despite a global financial crisis, the government had raisedtax creditsfrom zero in 1997 to £30bn, taking millions of pensioners and children out of poverty.It is to the credit of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves that within days of entering office, they set up thechild poverty reviewwith a remit to ensure an “enduring reduction in child poverty in this parliament”. Now, for a fraction of that £30bn spent in 2010, they can resume Labour’s historic role and ultimatelytake 500,000 children out of povertywithout dropping manifesto commitments.As a former chancellor who understands why it matters to balance the books, I sympathise with Reeves’s fiscal inheritance. This autumn, as growth is hit by tariffs and trade restrictions, and the fiscal position weakens as we come to terms with defence requirements, a history of low productivity and steep interest payments, the window for long-promised social improvements might appear to be closing. But having been invited to respond to the government’s consultations on both child poverty andgambling taxation– and following recent reports from theSocial Market Foundationand the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) – it’s clear that we can identify sources of revenues to fight the war against child poverty. The first step is raising billions by taxing the extraordinarily profitablegambling and betting industry, without affecting lotteries or bingo.There is an urgent need to act. I have not seen such deep poverty since I grew up in a mining and textiles town where unemployment was starting to bite hard. Now, each night,1 million childrenin the UK try to sleep without a bed of their own. Two million households livewithout cookers, fridges or washing machines, and many are withouttoothpaste, soap or shampoo. It is heartbreaking that3 million childrengo without meals because their families run out of food. The decisions of previous Tory governments have pushed4.5 million childreninto poverty. This is a national scandal and a stain on our country’s soul. Britain is now enduring the worst levels of child poverty since modern records began, even worse than in the Thatcher-Major years, and far worse than in most European countries. Yet without action to improve family incomes, the numbers will, on the government’s own definition of poverty, rise to a wholly unacceptable4.8 million children by 2029.These are austerity’s children, the victims of 14 years of Tory rule, an era whose most vindictive act was to treatnewborn third and fourth childrenas second-class citizens, depriving them of all the income support available to their first and second siblings. By next year, every other child in cities such as Manchester and Birmingham will be condemned to poverty. In 2010, the Trussell Trust ran35 food banksin the UK. Now, along with independent ones, there are 2,800. Since the election, the number ofhomeless childrenin temporary accommodation in England has risen by 17,510 to 169,050.This summer, Dickensian levels of poverty have beenreported by the children’s commissioner. If we look into the eyes of these young Britons, we won’t like what we see: instead of a generation filled with optimism about the future, we’ll see among too many a deep, impenetrable sadness reflecting a loss of hope. Yet without action the government will have little chance of meeting its well-publicised target that75% of childrenwill be ready for school at age five.0:33Keir Starmer says he wants to cut child poverty before next election – videoThe child poverty review, when it is published, will deserve credit for proposing more breakfast clubs, free school lunches, family hubs and additional childcare. Moving thousands into better-paid jobs will also help. Sadly, however, none of these measures will prevent child poverty continuing to rise. School lunches are worth £12 a week per child, and breakfast clubs £9 a week, but under thetwo-child benefit capfamilies have lost £66 a week for their third child. If they have a fourth child, the total is £132 a week.The Conservative party cultivated the myth that poverty is the fault of work-shy parents and a culture of dependency. Yet70% of children in povertylive in families where someone is working but on pay too low to make ends meet. Many of the rest are single parents unable to work because they cannot afford childcare or are coping with illness in the family. Abolishing the two-child rule – what the children’s commissioner says has to be “the foundation for all else” – would cost£2bn in 2025-26and £2.8bn by the end of the parliament. As theResolution Foundationhas shown, almost 500,000 children can be lifted out of poverty by 2029-30 at a total cost of £3.5bn.Inaction will cost more. Currently, local authorities and the NHS are picking up huge bills for ill health, homelessness and the cost of supporting children in care. For every 100,000 children, each 1% increase in child poverty forces anadditional fiveof them into care. Each child looked after by the care system costs an estimated£1.2min terms of lost productivity and their use of public services.Excluding the lottery, betting and gaming was an £11.5bn sector last year that incurred only£2.5bn in tax. As much as £3bn extra can be raised from taxing it properly. Remote gaming duty (effectively the tax on online slots games) is about35% in the Netherlands,40% in Austria, 50% inPennsylvaniaand 57% in tax haven Delaware, two of the few US states where it is legal. Yet the same activity is taxed at just 21% in the UK, raising only £1bn. Applying a 50% levy – much less than the80% tax on cigarettesand the70% tax on whisky– would raise £1.6bnmore. Raising the general betting duty on bookmakers’ profits from 15% to 25% could generate an additional £450m, after returning£100m as additional supportto boost the horseracing industry.To achieve parity with their online equivalents, machine game duty payable on the revenue from in-person slot machines should also increase from 25% to 50%. According to IPPR estimates, this would raise an additional £880m.The government could then start to reduce child poverty. Unlike almost all other businesses, most gaming and betting is exempt from VAT. Its most addictive practices are responsible for social harm that costs the NHS and other public servicesmore than £1bn a year.Gambling levies aren’t the only source of revenue that could pay to alleviate child poverty. But this should be one straightforward budget choice. The government can fulfil today’s unmet needs by taxing an undertaxed sector.Gamblingwon’t build our country for the next generation, but children, freed from poverty, will.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the selfless act of crossing the boundary with a potentially career‑threatening injury meant Woakes entered cricketing folklore – echoing Colin Cowdrey in 1963,Paul Terryand Malcolm Marshall in 1984, andRishabh Pant at Old Traffordjust a week earlier.England and injured Woakes denied as India win fifth Test thriller to draw seriesRead more“I don’t know what it is,” Woakes says, back home in Birmingham and awaiting further scans on the injury. “You just know you’re part of something bigger. It’s not just you that you’re playing for out there. It’s your team and your teammates, all the hard work and the sacrifices they put in, the people watching at home and in the ground. You just feel a duty to do it for everyone.”That sense of duty led to the 36‑year‑old seamer instantly being hailed as a national hero, with praise from around the world and the image of England’s one-armed batsman making front-page news. For Woakes, there is a mixture of pride and frustration, the team having been within touching distance of a monumental chase of 374 runs and a 3-1 series win.“I’m still gutted, devastated really, that we couldn’t get the fairytale. But I never considered not going out there, even if it had been 100 runs still to win or whatever. It was nice to have the ovation and some of the Indian players came over to show their respect. But any other player would have done the same. You couldn’t just call it off at nine wickets down.”Going out to bat with 17 runs required, Woakes did not have to face a delivery before Gus Atkinson was bowled by the irrepressible Mohammed Siraj to end a dramatic match. But simply running his partner’s runs – something he had not factored in when trying to work out how he might bat – was unbearable, occurring four times.“The first one was the worst,” he says. “All I had taken was codeine and it was just so sore. Instinct took over here – even with my arm strapped down I tried to run as you naturally do. I genuinely worried my shoulder had popped back out again, hence you saw me throw my helmet off, rip the glove off with my teeth, and check it was OK.”View image in fullscreenChris Woakes worried his shoulder had popped out the first time he ran with Gus AtkinsonPhotograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a serious injury, no question, sustained on the first evening of the series decider when Woakes – the only England seamer to play all five Tests – went to chase down a ball that was running to the boundary, only to land awkwardly as he flicked it back. A run was indeed saved but the cost far outstripped it.“We chase down every run,” Woakes explains.“That has always been the way. As a bowler, you really respect guys trying to save every run. It means a lot to you. So you kind of do the same for the team. And a tight game like that one – just six runs the difference – kinda shows how they all add up.“The outfield was wet from the rain, almost greasy, and my hand slipped as I landed and my full body weight went through my shoulder. I heard a pop and knew I was in trouble.“The pain came on pretty quickly and my arm was just hanging there. It was grim and my thoughts were racing. ‘Is it game over? Is it career done?’ It was a horrible place to be. We got it into a makeshift sling with my jumper and got off the field.”What followed sounds utterly excruciating, with Anita Biswas, the England team doctor, and Ben Davies, the physiotherapist, spending the next 30 minutes in the dressing room trying to get the shoulder back in place.View image in fullscreenChris Woakes has received many messages from India players since his injury.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockWoakes recalls: “It is a horrible feeling, your shoulder not where it should be and worrying it might never get back in. It felt like three hours but the medical staff were amazing.“I had this vape pen thing which tasted rank but took the edge off, pain-wise. First we tried me lying flat on my front on the bench and letting the arm hang down to do it. But the pain was too much to get into position.“In the end it was just a case of lying on my back and Anita gradually straightening my arm and trying that way. We thought we had it in with a ‘clunk’ but then my pectoral muscle spasmed and rejected it. That was horrendous. Another 10 minutes or so, with her knee in my armpit, there was another ‘clunk’ and it was back it properly. It hurt but there was such a feeling of relief with it, too.”Woakes went to A&E at St George’s hospital in Tooting that evening for an X-ray to confirm there was no break, before returning to his wife, Amie, and their two young children at the team hotel. Needless to say, going to sleep that night was close to impossible but he reported back at the Oval the following morning.It was during England’s first innings that day, at four wickets down, when Woakes first approached Brendon McCullum to say he would be prepared to go out to bat if called upon. “No chance, boss,” came the reply from the head coach. “Park up and we’ll see where we get to later in the match.”Set a huge target in the fourth innings, it was clear Woakes might well be called upon and so preparation to bat one-handed began on day four in the indoor school with Marcus Trescothick, the assistant coach. The first instinct was to attempt an orthodox stance, both hands on the bat, and see how it felt. The answer? Not good.“I defended one normally and, oh mate, it was agony. So yeah, we soon worked out that a left‑hander’s stance would shield the shoulder and at least allow me to sort of block with my top hand in control. I hit a few, missed a few, but it felt like the only way to survive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was helped into his whites by Davies, while Ben Stokes strapped on his pads for him. Typical of the man, Woakes says he worried about being a “pain in the arse” here.“It was bittersweet in the end,” he says of the fact that he did not face a ball. “Part of me wondered what it might be like, to see if I could have defended the ball, seen out an over maybe, squeezed a run or carved a four.View image in fullscreenChris Woakes walks out to bat on the fifth morning but he had been thinking about batting since the second day.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images“But the other side of it was: ‘Thank God I didn’t face a 90mph bouncer, one-handed, facing the wrong way around.’ And I knew I was going to have to wear a few bouncers if I did get on strike. Those were the anxious feelings, really. You’re still pretty exposed out there.”Like Stokes bowling toe‑hunting yorkers to Pant at Old Trafford, despite the India wicketkeeper having a broken foot, any short balls aimed at Woakes would have been fair game – the brutal, uncompromising side of a sport that, bar concussion, does not do substitutions. Stokes himself has said he does not think a rule permitting them should come in.While the series was a powder keg, with running verbals throughout, the scenes at the end showed the respect underpinning it all. Shubman Gill, India’s captain, made a point of stopping to commend Woakes after the match, as did pretty much his entire team. Pant, whose foot had been broken by Woakes during the fourth Test, was back in India but the pair have since swapped messages.“Shubman said something like: ‘That was incredibly brave,’” Woakes says. “I told him: ‘You’ve had an unbelievable series, well played, and credit to your team.’ Both sets of players had been through the mill in the series and deserve credit for the show we put on. Both teams wanted the win, of course, but it does kind of feel fair that it was drawn.View image in fullscreenIndia’s captain, Shubman Gill, told Chris Woakes he was ‘incredibly brave’.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I saw Rishabh [Pant] had put an image of me on Instagram with a salute emoji, so I replied thanking him: ‘Appreciate the love and hope the foot is OK,’ etc. He then sent me a voice note saying: ‘I hope all is OK, good luck with the recovery and I hope we meet again out there some day.’ I obviously said sorry for the broken foot.”The time since has been a whirlwind of emotions for Woakes and, with him seeing a specialist this week and a full prognosis to follow, any questions about what lies ahead would be wrong. There are a couple of final queries, though: first, having gone through this ordeal, does he think Test cricket should have substitutions?Ben Stokes hails Chris Woakes’ one-armed effort in dramatic defeat to IndiaRead moreWoakes replies: “I’m with Stokesy, to be honest. Having played for 18 years, the game is what it is: you lose a player and as a team you have to find a way. It makes you more resilient and the team stronger. I do understand why people might think it’s needed for freak injuries like mine but there would be too many grey areas or loopholes.”And being hailed as a hero? “I mean, it’s not the way you want to be front-page news – you’d sooner it was for five wickets or a century. There have been a lot of ups and downs since but yeah, the love from the public has helped.“It is so weird to go from the start of a Test week, thinking ‘one last push’, to ending up on a physio’s table wondering what the future holds.”Whatever that is – whether that was indeed one last act of selflessness in an England career that has been built on it – the world will be wishing him well.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamEngland v India 2025CricketinterviewsShareReuse this content"

On Reddit, postersobserve: “As I get older it feels like life is losing its color,” andask: “Were colors brighter and more vibrant when I was younger?”Indeed, according toresearchfrom the UK’s Science Museum Group, there’s been a stark increase in gray everyday objects since the mid-20th century. But this dullification may go beyond the modern preponderance ofashen cars,sad beige nurseriesandmillennial gray apartments. Scientists believe that color perception itself can fade, altering how the world appears. Depending on how your eyes – and brain – age, the bright red balloon you remember from your seventh birthday party might not look as vivid if you came across it again at 93.Changes in color perception can occur for several reasons. One common factor is structural shifts in the eye. For instance, a cataract – a condition that clouds the eye’s lens – can gradually tint vision with a yellow-brown “brunescent” hue. In the US, about4mcataract surgeries are performed annually. A brunescent lens “can pull the blue and green out” of the world around us, says Dr Andrew Iwach of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. After a cataract is removed, the difference in color clarity afterward can be so striking that Iwach wears a bright blue tie to delight his recovering patients.Why it’s important to protect your hearing as you age – and what experts suggestRead moreChanges in color perception can also be caused by glaucoma or macular degeneration. Iwach recommendsroutine eye exams, and says if you notice this type of change, see an ophthalmologist.Research from 2024found that up to 15% of global dementia cases could be linked to problems with color perception issues, meaning that an eye exam can be an important step in screening and mitigating the disease.Some medications can also affect color perception, says Iwach – namely Viagra (pilots arerequiredto abstain from the drug eight hours before flying lest it affect their perception of blue hues) and some types of heart and tuberculosis medications.Yet research suggests that even in the absence of eye disease or medication use, color perception can shift over the course of our lives.Dr Janneke van Leeuwen, a social neuroscientist and honorary research fellow at University College London’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, noticed a subtle trend in behavioral studies from the last three decades: older adultsconsistentlyratedcolors duller than younger participants did.Van Leeuwen set out to investigate: do we truly see the world differently as we age? And if so, is it the eyes or the brain driving that change?Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Her2023 studyinvolved 17 young adults and 20 older adults in “an eye tracking experiment” featuring 26 colors, which varied in lightness (how light or dark a color appears) and saturation (how pure and intense a color appears).Using a camera that recorded pupil diameter 1,000 times per second, Van Leeuwen’s team observed how participants’ pupils reacted to each color. They found a reduction in the way older people’s pupils responded to more highly saturated colors, even when correcting for the shrunken baseline pupil sizes that come with age.Thus, it seems some older adults may genuinely perceive the world as less colorful. Van Leeuwen recalls one participant saying: “Oh, it’s a shame there’s not a real punchy red.” “I was thinking: ‘Well, you’re looking at one!’” she says.The issue, Van Leeuwen explains, “doesn’t necessarily originate in the eyes, but in the brain”.Pupil responses are controlled by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, a midbrain structure that receives input from the retina and the visual cortex. This means that pupillary reactions reflect both what the eyes detect and how the brain processes that information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe brain becomes less sensitive to how saturated and vivid colors are not because the eyes fail to register them, says Van Leeuwen, but because the visual cortex may no longer interpret them with the same intensity.“Older adults seem to be particularly less sensitive to the intensity of colors on the magenta-green pathway,” she adds, referring to the anatomical structures in the eye that help process colors. More research is needed to understand why, but the cause probably lies in how the cones in our eyes interact with color-processing pathways in the brain. Currently, Van Leeuwen is following up her study with an investigation into how differences in saturation perception influence the way colors make younger and older adults feel.I’m an expert on ageing. Here’s what I know about thriving in later life | Kerry BurnightRead moreThe 2023 study’s findings align with a phenomenon called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect: the brain’s tendency to perceive highly saturated colors as brighter than less saturated ones, even if their actual lightness is the same. Believed to be an evolutionary trait for important evaluations such as the ripeness of fruit, this effect also takes place in the primary visual cortex. This “further supports our findings that the decline in sensitivity in color saturation in healthy ageing originates in the brain, and not the eyes”, says Van Leeuwen.There is no sign this loss of saturation perception follows the same process as the onset of certain types of dementia, Van Leeuwen emphasizes – many older adults experience vision declines without developing dementia, which has multiple risk factors. However, the study does provide insight into how our brains change as a result of normal, healthy ageing, which is useful context in the study of neurological disease.Is there anything you can do to stop age-related declines in saturation perception? Researchers don’t currently believe that lifestyle habits can meaningfully influence this process. But there’s some evidence that the brain can be “trained” to see the world differently. Anya Hurlbert, a color and vision scientist at Newcastle University, points to a2020 studyinvolving EnChroma glasses, which feature a saturation-boosting tint to help reduce the effects of some types of color blindness. Participants with red-green color perception deficiencies who wore the glasses reported seeing increased color saturation even after removing them.Alternatively, simply surrounding oneself with more intense colors could help. As Van Leeuwen notes, “Older adults tend to evaluate more saturated colors more positively than younger adults … which seems to suggest they might need the extra stimulation.”Just another reason to see the new Wes Anderson movie.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe joys of ageingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than 170 Palestinian journalists have been killed so far, and no outside reporters or cameras are allowed in.The effects of this policy of concealment – which the Guardianmanaged to pierce this week with a shocking aerial photographthat made the front page – are to ensure that the outside world only catches sight of Gaza’s horrors in small fragments, and to stifle empathy for those trapped inside by hiding them from view, obscuring their humanity. But a new documentary film, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, seeks to open a window to the unfathomable suffering inside Gaza.A wasteland of rubble, dust and graves: how Gaza looks from the skyRead moreIt focuses on the life of a single young Palestinian woman named Fatma Hassouna, known as Fatem to those close to her. She is 24 years old when we meet her, and has such a broad smile and enthusiasm for life that she compels attention from her first appearance, a few minutes into the film.We see Hassouna’s life through the screen of a mobile phone belonging to the director, Sepideh Farsi, and most of the film is made up of the conversations between these two women as they develop an increasingly strong personal bond over the course of a year.The director knows all about conflict and oppression. Farsi is Iranian-born and was a teenager at the time of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. When she was 16 she was imprisoned by the Islamic Republic regime, and she left the country for good two years later, settling in France. She was on tour with her film The Siren, a feature-length animation about the Iran-Iraq war, when theGazaconflict erupted in October 2023. As the civilian death toll mounted, she found herself unable just to sit on the sidelines, watching endless debates that did nothing to stop the slaughter.View image in fullscreen‘She was very special’ … director Sepideh Farsi at a film festival this summer in Mallorca.Photograph: Tomas Andujar/EPA/Shutterstock“The common denominator was that there was never the Palestinian voice there,” Farsi says. “We had different points of views: the American, the European, the Egyptian, the Israeli, but never the Palestinian. It started really bothering me, and at some point I couldn’t live with it any more.”In spring last year she flew to Cairo with the idea that she could somehow find a way across the Gaza border to film the war firsthand. That quickly proved a naive and futile mission, so she began filming Gazan refugees in Egypt. One of them suggested to Farsi that if she wanted to talk to someone inside, he could put her in touch with his friend Fatma in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City.We first see Hassouna the way Farsi meets her, on her little phone screen, materialising with green hijab, big glasses and her broad white strip of a smile. They clearly delight in each other’s presence from the outset.“From the first call, I felt that she was someone very special, and that something clicked between the two of us immediately,” Farsi says. “As soon as we connected, I would be smiling or laughing, and she was the same on her side.”There had been no guarantee the two would get along. Farsi is significantly older, with a daughter Hassouna’s age, and she is a cosmopolitan, sophisticated woman who has travelled the world, while Hassouna has been restricted to Gaza all her life. Hassouna is devout while Farsi is profoundly sceptical of any religious talk and challenges her new young friend over what kind of god would allow innocent people to suffer so painfully.However there is far more that draws them together, in ways that are harder to define. “She had this energy, this shining thing. She was solar,” Farsi says. “That’s the adjective that fits her. Her natural smile. There was this mutual fascination, sorority, comradeship – a mixture of all of these things – and we were happy as soon as we connected.”Farsi makes her phone a portal through which Hassouna recounts her story and the tragedy of Gaza. She talks about her family and introduces her shy brothers to Farsi. She has already made herself a photographer and poet by the time they meet, and Farsi coaches her into being a film-maker and to send out video of the ruination around her.Hassouna is supremely, naturally talented. Her pictures capture the everyday effort of her neighbours trying to survive in the rubble, while her use of language – in her poems and in conversation – is every bit as evocative. The film’s title is taken from her passing description of what it is like to venture outside: “Every second you go out in the street, you put your soul on your hands and walk.”In another conversation, struggling to make sense of what is happening, Hassouna asks: “We live a very simple life, and they want to take this simple life from us. Why? I’m 24 and I don’t have any of the things that I want. Because every time you reach what you want, there’s a wall. They put up a wall.”The film should not work. It is determinedly rudimentary, filmed largely on one phone pointed at another. The image of Hassouna sometimes freezes and buffers as the internet connection ebbs and flows. But these glitches draw us in and make us experience the precariousness of their connection.View image in fullscreenSome of Hassouna’s messages to Farsi about children believed killed in Gaza.Composite: Rêves d’Eau/ 24images“That’s why I decided to keep this low resolution and not to use a regular camera,” Farsi explains. “I wanted it to be very low-key technically, to match the connection problems with her, to match the disparity of life here and there.” She had originally attempted a cleanly edited version with all the disconnections cut out. “It was lacking soul. It didn’t breathe. So we put it back in – this brokenness of image and sound.”The sweetness of the relationship at the core of the film is made bittersweet by the constant threat of death around Hassouna. Every so often she reports the death of relatives, or neighbours whose eviscerated homes she points to out of her window. It feels like the encircling darkness is in a direct struggle with Hassouna’s smile and her instinctive optimism.Anyone who does not want to know which triumphs in the end should stop reading here.Towards the end of the film, Farsi calls Hassouna to give her the happy news that the film has been selected to be screened at Cannes. They excitedly talk about Farsi obtaining a French visa that might allow Hassouna to get out of Gaza temporarily to attend the festival. While they are talking, the young Palestinian sends the film-maker a photo of her passport.That was 14 April this year. The next day, a Tuesday, Farsi could not get through to Gaza to give Hassouna an update on preparations. “So I said, ‘OK, we’ll do it on Wednesday,” the director recalls. “On Wednesday, I was working on the film on my computer with my phone beside me, and all of a sudden I saw a photo pop up. I opened the notification and saw her photo with a caption saying she had been killed. I didn’t believe it. I started calling her frantically, and then called a mutual friend, the one who introduced us, and he confirmed it was true.”In the middle of the night, two missiles fired by an Israeli drone had pierced the roof of her building and burrowed through before detonating, one of them exploding in the family’s second floor apartment, the other just below.Fatma Hassouna was killedalong with her three brothers and two sisters. Her father died later of his wounds leaving her mother, Lubna, as the sole survivor.The investigative group Forensic Architecture studied the missile strike and declared it a targeted strike aimed at Hassouna for her work as a journalist and witness. Farsi has no doubt. “She was targeted by the IDF,” she says. “There were two missiles dropped by a drone on her house. It means they found out where she was living, planned a drone with missiles to go through three storeys of that building and explode on the second floor. It’s amazingly well planned in order to eliminate somebody who just does photography.“I still can’t believe it,” Farsi says, speaking from Bogotá, where she is touring with the film, which is now Hassouna’s legacy. “It’s three months now, a bit more, and it’s still quite unbelievable. For me, she is somewhere out there and I believe I will meet her someday.”In their conversations, Hassouna talked about all the places in the world she dreamed of seeing, while insisting she would always return home to Gaza. Shortly before she died, she told Farsi: “I have the idea that I must keep going and I must document everything, to be part of this story, to be me!”She imagined passing on her experiences to her children, but instead they have been captured for a cinematic audience, and Hassouna’s arresting personality has been preserved at the same time, a portrait of a unique individual among the 60,000 dead.Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.At a domestic level, it’s time to take action. Our kitchens in particular are full of plastic, from washing-up brushes to measuring jugs. And with a constant cycle of news stories about their possible harms – fromblack kitchen utensils that leak chemicalstochopping boards that release millions of microplastics– our kitchens can feel like a swamp of toxins.Many utensils can be replaced with wooden, metal, glass or even bamboo alternatives. We’re not suggesting you throw out all your plastic kitchen accessories in one go – it’s much more sustainable to use what you already have until it needs replacing than send a perfectly good plastic colander to landfill in the name of being more environmentally mindful. But when the time comes to replace your washing-up bowl or you eventually run out of clingfilm, here are a few of our favourite plastic-free kitchen swaps for you to consider.Simple plastic-free kitchen swapsUtensilsBoth wood and metal utensils have their pros and cons, and both need to be used and cared for correctly to get the most out of them. Wooden and bamboo utensils won’t damage the bottom of your pans, but they do need to be washed by hand with soapy water if you want them to last, and oiled if they start looking dry. Metal utensils are much less high maintenance and are often dishwasher-safe, but you need to take care when using them to avoid scratching your cookware.View image in fullscreenKitchenAidbirchwoodutensilset£32 at Dunelm£27.88 at AmazonThis four-piece set comes with a spoon, fish slice, slotted spoon and slotted turner. A great choice if you like your kitchen to be pretty as well as functional, these lovely Birchwood utensils would look great hanging on the wall.View image in fullscreenBambu bamboo spatula£3.95 at Friendly TurtleA utensil that can get into the awkward corners of your pans and bowls is always handy, and this bamboo spatula is shaped to do just that.View image in fullscreenKitchenCraftmetal oval fish slice£6.99 at Season£6.40 at AmazonThis oval fish slice is the ideal shape to slide under food stuck to your baking trays. It’s made from stainless steel, so it’s also dishwasher safe.View image in fullscreenProCookbamboo tongs£2 at ProCookWhether you need to flip bacon or retrieve a crumpet lodged in the toaster (please switch it off at the wall first), these bamboo tongs are a handy kitchen tool. They have a built-in magnet so you can stick them to the side of your fridge or a metal kitchen appliance, saving you from endlessly fishing around in a drawer.Wooden chopping boardThere’s a misconception that wooden chopping boards are less hygienic than plastic, butstudies have shownthis isn’t the case. In fact, plastic chopping boards have been confirmed as a previously overlookedsource of microplastics in our food. So wood is by far the best choice for a chopping board. As with utensils, though, wooden chopping boards do require a bit of extra care. Wash them thoroughly with soapy water after use (but never leave them to soak), and wait for them to dry out completely before storing, to prevent mould or cracking in the wood.View image in fullscreenHabitat industrial wood butcher’s block£25 at ArgosThis industrial-style board is made from dark acacia wood, formed in the classic chequerboard style of a butcher’s block. It’s so pretty you’ll want to permanently display it on your countertop.View image in fullscreenSeasonteakendgrainchoppingboardFrom £70 at SeasonMade from sustainably sourced teak, which has natural moisture-resistant properties, this board has a groove around the edge to catch scraps of food and keep your countertops tidy.Season also sells its own oilto keep it in top condition.Metal colanderOpt for a more durable stainless steel colander over a flimsy plastic one. This one from Dunelm has small enough holes that it can also double as a sieve.View image in fullscreenDunelmEssentialsstainlesssteelcolander£5 at DunelmMeasuring jugIt’s generally advised to avoid consuminghot liquids that have been exposed to plastic, as some plastics may shed microplastics or leak chemicals when exposed to heat. So if you’re partial to mixing up stock or measuring hot liquids in a plastic jug, it’s worth investing in an alternative. For a convenient and easy swap, go for a glass measuring jug – as these are readily available and often microwave and dishwasher safe.View image in fullscreenPyrex glass measuring jug£6 at John Lewis£6 at AmazonThis Pyrex jug has both imperial and metric measurements going up to 1L and 1 and 1/2 pints. It’s microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer safe, making it useful for food prep and storage as well as measuring.Measuring spoonsYou can buy measuring spoons made of stainless steel, china, copper, wood … the list goes on. And there’s no real benefit to plastic spoons over these more eco-friendly materials (with all of them being dishwasher-safe except for wood), so swapping them out is a no-brainer.View image in fullscreenYvonne Ellenfine china measuring spoons£15.40 at John LewisThese cute measuring spoons come in jolly pastel colours to brighten up your baking.View image in fullscreenTala stainless steel measuring spoons£8 at John Lewis£5.95 at AmazonThis Tala set comes with five measuring spoons, ranging from 1/4 teaspoon to a tablespoon, and they’re made from durable stainless steel.Washing-up bowlWashing-up bowls tend to be made of plastic, and most alternatives are made from stainless steel. While a little harder to come by than plastic, it’s worth seeking one out for stainless steel’s scratch- and odour-resistant qualities.View image in fullscreenBuckingham stainless steel washing-up bowl£22.99 at B&Q£35.99 at Robert DyasThis round washing-up bowl has a simple but sturdy design. Its 11-litre capacity means it’s suitable for cleaning larger pots and pans, too.View image in fullscreenElephant Box orange stainless steel washing-up bowl£48.50 at Elephant BoxElephant Box’s stainless steel washing-up bowl is big enough to fit 10in plates, and it’s bright orange so will add some cheer to your kitchen.View image in fullscreenASelected rectangular stainless steel washing-up bowlFrom £19.99 at AmazonThis rectangular bowl is ideal for washing up, but can also be used for washing vegetables or as a mixing bowl. It comes in three sizes.Dish brushIf you search for a “washing-up brush”, you’ll be met with a deluge of plastic options, with many big retailers offering minimal to no alternatives. But you can find wooden washing-up brushes that use natural fibres for scrubbing.View image in fullscreenWild & Stone coconut fibre dish brush£4.95 at Wild & Stone£8.99 at AmazonThis brush from Wild & Stone is made from 100% FSC-certified beechwood and sustainably sourced coconut fibre, meaning it’s mostly biodegradable. Just don’t leave the brush sitting in hot water, as the natural glue around the head may dissolve.View image in fullscreenEcoliving wooden dish brush with replaceable head£3.56 at Natural CollectionThe bristles of this brush are made from plant fibres, and the head can be removed and replaced as needed. This saves you from having to buy a whole new brush, cutting down on waste.ScourersThe scouring part of a standard kitchen sponge often includes plastic, which can shed and become asource of microplastics throughout our kitchens. But plant-based materials such as loofah and coconut fibres are naturally coarse and up to the task of scrubbing your pots and pans.View image in fullscreenSeep eco sponge scourers£26 for 12 at SeepMade from loofah and wood pulp cellulose, these sponges from Seep are safe to use on nonstick pans.

However, many of them still involve plastic packaging for the refills. Not so for Iron & Velvet’s water-soluble sachets, which are delivered inside cardboard packaging. Mix these with water in a dispenser to create the washing-up liquid. There’s no dispenser provided, as you’re encouraged to use one you already own to further cut down on waste.View image in fullscreenIron & Velvet washing-up liquid refill£3.50 for five sachets at VeoDish drainerWooden dish drainers can be tempting for a homespun look, but they also need to dry out completely between washes or they’ll go mouldy.

This grey two-tier drainer is ideal if you need a little more space for your washing-up.Storage containersHaving storage pots of various sizes to stash leftovers is a great way to cut down on clingfilm. Most containers on the market involve a little bit of plastic (even if it’s just in the silicone seal between the pot and lid), but here are a few made entirely of stainless steel.View image in fullscreenA Slice of Green stainless steel oval lunch boxFrom £18.95 at Natural Collection£24.95 at &KeepThis stainless-steel lunchbox with closure clips is perfect for storing leftover meals or taking lunch on the go.View image in fullscreenZenithCart stainless steel storage pots£21.66 at AmazonThis trio of pots comes with three sizes, making it easy to store half a lemon or other odds and ends.View image in fullscreenElephant Box leakproof food canister trio£36 at Plastic FreedomThese useful canisters are leakproof, thanks to their screw-top closure – and they’re pretty cute too.Beeswax wrapsAnother alternative to clingfilm is beeswax wraps. They’re made by coating a piece of material in beeswax to make it pliable and able to hold its shape when wrapped around any leftover food. They’re fairlyeasy to make, if you’re up for it, but if not, there are plenty of ready-made ones available. To maintain them, wash with washing-up liquid in cool water, to avoid melting the wax, and gently scrub to remove any residue. Once clean, lay them flat or hang them from a drainer to dry completely before storing.View image in fullscreenTu-Untangle natural beeswax wraps£9.76 for three at EtsyThis set of wraps includes three sizes in various fun patterns.

Things such as jars and other resealable containers from shop-bought foods can be reused to keep leftovers fresh. If you are going toreuse plastic packaging from takeaways or microwave meals, check the labelling to ensure it is safe to use them in the freezer, microwave or dishwasher first.Cut down on plastic bottlesReduce your use of plastic bottles by having milk delivered in glass bottles from services such asthe Modern Milkman. And if you have a penchant for fizzy drinks, you could invest in a carbonator to make them at home. A reusable water bottle can prevent you from having to constantly buy plastic bottles of water when out and about.View image in fullscreenDrinkmate OmniFizz sparkling water and soda maker£89.99 at B&Q£89.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenChilly’s insulated drinks bottle, 500ml£24 at John Lewis£24 at Chilly’sMake your own cleaning productsView image in fullscreenClean & Green by Nancy Birtwhistle£9.89 at the Guardian Bookshop£9.85 at AmazonMake your own cleaning products and put them in areusable spray bottleto cut out the plastic packaging.

Only months ago the debate was about what further inducements Trump would offer Putin to end the fighting. His administration has not introduced any sanctions against Russia, compared with at least 16 sets of actions in every prior six months back to February 2022, according to a report submitted to the Senate banking committee by top Democrats this week.Trump first set Putin a 50-day deadline then cut weeks off it. “Secondary sanctions and tariffs against China,Indiaand Brazil, which buy Russian oil, are the obvious next step in an attempt to stop the conflict,” the US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, predicted on Tuesday.But as the deadline approaches, there is lingering scepticism about how far Trump will go. He has dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff,to Moscow for the fifth time for last-minute talksand on Friday Trump admitted he did not think sanctions would have much impact as Russians are “wily characters and pretty good at avoiding sanctions”.He has also given himself maximum room for political manoeuvre by ensuring the US Senate did not pass legislation before its summer recess that would have empowered him to slap bone-crushing 500% tariffs on exports from countries that import Russian oil, principally India, China, Brazil and Turkey.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool/EPATrump had argued that the congressional legislation was unnecessary as he can act through executive orders, mentioning instead 100% tariffs on economies that import Russian oil – a whopping number, even if lower than the 500% floated by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham.It is striking that in the run-up to Witkoff’s talks in Moscow that Trump, normally keen to tout his leverage before a negotiation, has given only sketchy detail of the punishments the importers of Russian energy may face, either in terms of US sanctions on foreign refineries importing Russian oil or US tariffs on countries importing Russian oil.Some ofTrump’s warningsthis week to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, that he would raise tariffs on India because its government did not care “how many people inUkraineare being killed by the Russian war machine” do not yet seem to fit into a wider strategy. The tensions appears as much about Trump’s previouscomplaints with India’s trade practicesas its purchases of cheap Russian oil. They are due to start on August 27.Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Century, said if India was to receive a penalty but China – the largest buyer of most Russian crude – did not, the Russian oil trade may just go further underground. Some of Trump’s advisers, notably the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, warned China last week of tariff hikes related to Russia energy purchases, but it is hard to see such threats as credible given Trump’s eagerness for a trade deal with China and the risks associated with a sudden stop to trade between China and the US. In 2024 China accounted for 32% of Russian petroleum and oil exports.McFaul told Foreign Policy magazine about a possible boomerang effect if generalised increases in tariffs turn into a full trade war.Trump has wavered about the impact of economic pressure on Putin. Many academics say that sanctions on oil reshape economic relationships and change markets rather than produce changes in state behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russia chalked up economic growth of 4% in 2023 and 2024, kept unemployment to an astonishing 2%, and even reduced social inequality by sustaining real wage growth that has disproportionately benefited Russians at the lower end of the economic ladder, a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based thinktank, found. The authors predicted that Russia’s economy can withstand the current level of sanctions for at least three more years.But the report also pointed to developing vulnerabilities in Russia. Interest rates are at 18%, inflation stubbornly high and growth is stalling. Russia has had to rework its 2025 budget as oil revenues slipped, largely because of a fall in prices and the discounts importers such as India could demand. As a result, government revenues from Russian oil and gas in May-June were 35% lower than the same period in 2024, the Kyiv School of Economics said in its July review. Russian oil export revenue is projected to drop 16% from $189bn (£142bn) in 2024 to $163bn in 2025 and $151bn in 2026.The federal budget deficit reached 3.7tn rubles ($40.4bn) in the first half of 2025 – 97% of the full-year target of 3.8tn rubles. This is more than five times larger than the deficit in the first half of 2024 and 57% higher than the largest first six-month deficit in recent years (2023).Oilprices are unlikely to recover significantly, meaning Russia will miss its budget target by a wide margin, increasing reliance on its national welfare fund (NWF) and domestic debt issuance.View image in fullscreenRussia’s economy has so far withstood international sanctions, but it will be increasingly be forced to rely on its national welfare fund if the war continues.Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov/EPAThe NWF’s liquid assets are also under pressure, with Russia expected to draw heavily on these reserves by year end. In a report this week, Oxford Economics predicted that Russia “may tip into recession”.The overall reason is simple: the level of military spending, including the cost of voluntary recruitment is distorting the economy. The economist Janis Kluge, who conducts research on Russia at the Berlin thinktank SWP, thinks overall Russian military spending is 8 to 10% of GDP once all expenditure including regional recruitment is included.The pressure could grow. The EU’s most recent sanctions package included a ban from next January on buying oil products made from Russian crude. The package for the first time put sanctions on a big Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, causing Microsoft this week to suspend software services. Other refineries could be placed under sanction – with the UK likely following suit – but the question then arises as to how the supply gap created by the loss of Russian oil can be filled.Moreover, if Trump is joining sanctions, the US andEuropewill have to come to a joint decision on the continuing value of the elaborate oil price cap, a Biden-era device designed to squeeze Russian oil profits while keeping the global price of oil low.The cap was introduced across the G7 in December 2022 and operates by withdrawing insurance from any shipping company that has not obtained a certificate that it is selling Russian oil below $60 a barrel, but a multitude of problems have arisen.In recent months, as the price of oil has fallen, it’s become evident the $60 cap was set too high. The cap has also led to the birth of a shadow fleet of oil tankers operating without formal insurance that are now being sanctioned by the EU, the US and the UK. The UK and the EU have agreed to lower the price cap from 2 September to $47.60 a barrel, but Trump is keeping the US cap at $60 a barrel, a recipe for circumvention.The one prerequisite is that Trump must not back off, McFaul said. “Making threats and not carrying through with them is one of the biggest mistakes you can make in diplomacy.” The former ambassador recalled George Shultz, the great Reagan-era US secretary of state, saying “never point a gun at anyone unless you are prepared to shoot”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaDonald TrumpVladimir PutinTrump administrationUS politicsOilCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

A separate Palestine solidarity march is taking place in London on the same day.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper,proscribed Palestine Actionlast month after activists caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton military base in Oxfordshire.A wasteland of rubble, dust and graves: how Gaza looks from the skyRead moreOn Wednesday, a cabinet minister urged members of the public to stay away from events supporting proscribed organisations. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the government would not dictate to police how they handled any action and added that some coverage had also been “conflating legitimate protests”.She commended pro-Palestinian protesters who she said had been peacefully demonstrating outside parliament. But she added: “There’s a difference between that and supporting a proscribed terror organisation that wishes harm on the British people. And I would just urge people to stay away from those sorts of events and to exercise their democratic rights in a peaceful and legitimate way.”The letter from Klein, Davis and others states: “As scholars dedicated to questions of justice and ethics we believe that Yvette Cooper’s recent proscription of Palestine Action represents an attack both on the entire pro-Palestine movement and on fundamental freedoms of expression, association, assembly and protest.”It adds: “As hundreds of people again risk arrest by joining street protests on 9 August and as students and teachers prepare for the start of another turbulent academic year, we express our full solidarity with those mobilising on their campuses or in their workplaces and communities to put an immediate stop to the escalating genocide and to end all UK complicity with Israel’s crimes.”Along with Klein, the Canadian author and activist who is now a professor at the University of British Columbia, and Davis, a former member of the Black Panther party who is now a distinguished professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz, other signatories include the American feminist philosopher Judith Butler, who is a distinguished professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Palestine Action ban is an attack on fundamental freedomsRead moreOthers who have signed the letter include the philosophers Étienne Balibar and Rebecca Comay. Historians include the Israeli political scientist Ilan Pappé of the University of Exeter and the British-Israeli academic Avi Shlaim of the University of Oxford.Prominent Palestinian signatories include Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, Abdaljawad Omar, an assistant professor of philosophy and cultural studies at Birzeit University, and Haidar Eid, an associate professor of postcolonial literature at al-Aqsa University inGaza.They are joined by the political thinker Michael Hardt of Duke University and Eyal Weizman, the British-Israeli founding director ofForensic Architectureand a professor at Goldsmiths, University of London.Their letter comes after 300 left-leaning Jewish figures, including the director Mike Leigh and the authorMichael Rosen, earlier this week wrote to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to describe the ban on Palestine Action as “illegitimate and unethical”.That letter, by the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman KC and the playwright Gillian Slovo, also accused the government of “hand-wringing over the level of slaughter and suffering in Gaza and the West Bank” and of offering “tacit support” for the actions of the Israeli state.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warNaomi KleinAngela DavisMike LeighMichael RosenProtestPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Labour has warned that the industry is a “wild west” because of a lack of regulation around who can administer treatments such as dermatological filler and Botox injections.At present a licence is not required to perform such procedures in England.Healthdepartment officials said botched treatments had left people “maimed” and suffering from “dangerous complications, permanent scarring and even death”.Ministers plan to introduce new rules whereby only qualified healthcare professionals can deliver high-risk procedures such as liquid Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs).UK health officials issue warning over cosmetic jabs after 38 botulism casesRead moreProviders will need to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and those found to be breaking rules could face sanctions and financial penalties. Clinics offering lower-risk procedures such as Botox and fillers will need to be licensed by their local authority.The proposals will be subject to a consultation early next year that will seek views on the types of procedures that should be covered by the new regulations.Liquid BBLs involve injecting filler into the buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger or more rounded. The procedure can cause serious side-effects such as blood clots and sepsis.A 33-year-old woman, Alice Webb,died last yearafter complications from a suspected liquid BBL in Gloucestershire.Last month, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute warned that fat injections, BBLs, Botox and fillers were being offered by untrained people in places such as public toilets. Health officialslaunched an investigationafter several people had reactions to Botox-like injections this year.The government urged people always to ask for providers’ qualifications and insurance and to be wary of “suspiciously cheap” offers.Restrictions on high-risk treatments will be introduced via an amendment to the CQC’s regulations, while licensing for providers of lower-risk procedures will be introduced via secondary legislation.The government also plans to bring in restrictions for under-18s on high-risk cosmetic procedures unless these have been approved by a healthcare professional. It became illegal for children to receive Botox and dermal fillers in England in 2021.The Scottish government announced plans in May to regulate aesthetic treatments, but there have been no moves to tighten regulation in Wales or Northern Ireland. “The government’s move to regulate non-surgical aesthetic procedures is an important first step forward for patient safety,” said Tim Mitchell, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons.The sudden, surprising rise of beard transplants: ‘This industry is a wild west’Read moreBut Mitchell stressed that regulation should go further, by ensuring that procedures such as buttock or breast augmentation are performed only by surgeons who have been recognised by the Cosmetic Surgery Board.“This will ensure high standards of care, reduce avoidable harm and give patients the confidence they deserve when seeking aesthetic treatments,” he said.Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said the changes would “mean little without a serious overhaul of consumer enforcement teams such as trading standards, which are currently stretched too thinly to properly investigate these rogue traders who are putting consumers at risk”.Millie Kendall, the chief executive of the British Beauty Council, which represents the industry, said the changes “will help instil confidence as well as helping to prevent the normalisation of horror stories that have become synonymous with our sector”.Karin Smyth, a health minister, said: “The cosmetics industry has been plagued by a wild west of dodgy practitioners and procedures. There are countless horror stories of cosmetic cowboys causing serious, catastrophic damage.“This government is taking action to protect those seeking treatments, support honest and competent practitioners, and root out the cowboys as part of our plan for change.“This isn’t about stopping anyone from getting treatments – it’s about preventing rogue operators from exploiting people at the expense of their safety and keeping people safe. We’re giving them peace of mind and reducing the cost to theNHSof fixing botched procedures.”Explore more on these topicsPlastic surgeryHealthWes StreetingNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

On the spy chief’s agenda: moving vast amounts of top secret intelligence material into the US company’s cloud.Meeting at Microsoft’s headquarters near Seattle, a former chicken farm turned hi-tech campus, the spymaster, Yossi Sariel, won Nadella’s support for a plan that would grant Unit 8200 access to a customisedand segregated area within Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.Armed with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity, Unit 8200 began building a powerful new mass surveillance tool: a sweeping and intrusive system that collects and stores recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.Revealed here for the first time in an investigation by the Guardian with the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand Hebrew-language outletLocal Call, the cloud-based system – which firstbecame operational in 2022 – enables Unit 8200 to store a giant trove of calls daily for extended periods of time.Microsoft claims Nadella was unaware of what kind of data Unit 8200 planned to store in Azure. But a cache of leaked Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the company and Israeli military intelligence reveals how Azure has been used by Unit 8200 to store this expansive archive of everyday Palestinian communications.Quick GuideContact the reporters about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians.View image in fullscreenSatya Nadella speaks at a Microsoft event in New York on 26 October 2016.Photograph: Lucas Jackson/ReutersIntelligence sources with knowledge of the project said Unit 8200’s leadership turned to Microsoft after concluding it did not have sufficient storage space or computing power on the military’s servers to bear the weight of an entire population’s phone calls.Several intelligence officers from the unit, which is comparable to the US National Security Agency (NSA) in its surveillance capabilities, said that a mantra emerged internally that captured the project’s scale and ambition: “A million calls an hour”.The system was built to sit on Microsoft’s servers behind enhanced layers of security developed by the company’s engineers with Unit 8200’s instructions. The leaked Microsoftfiles suggest that a large proportion of the unit’s sensitive data may now be sitting in the company’s datacentres in the Netherlands and Ireland.Disclosures about the role of Microsoft’s Azure platform in the surveillance project come as the US tech giant faces pressure from employees andinvestorsover its ties to Israel’s military and the role its technology has played in the 22-month offensive in Gaza.In May, an employee disrupted a keynote speech by Nadellain an act of protest, at one point yelling: “How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”After the Guardian and othersrevealedin January Israel’s reliance on Microsoft technology during the war in Gaza, the company commissioned an external review of the relationship. The review, Microsoftsaid, had “found no evidence to date” that Azure or its AI products were “used to target or harm people” in the territory.A senior Microsoft source said the company had held conversations with Israeli defence officials and stipulated how its technology should be used in Gaza, insisting Microsoft systems must not be employed for the identification of targets for lethal strikes.View image in fullscreenA signal intelligence–gathering installation of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit responsible for collecting signals intelligence (Sigint) and code decryption, located on an observation point on the Israeli-Lebanese border near Rosh HaNikra crossing also known as Ras al-Naqoura crossing.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyHowever, Unit 8200 sources said intelligence drawn from the enormous repositories of phone calls held in Azure had been used to research and identify bombing targets in Gaza. One of the sources said that when planning an airstrike on an individual located within densely populated areas where high numbers of civilians are present, officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the immediate vicinity.The sources alsosaid use of the system had increased during the campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 60,000 people in the territory, the majority of whom are civilians, including over 18,000 children.Q&AHow many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?ShowAccording to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people.The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But the initial focus of the system was the West Bank, where an estimated 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military occupation. Unit 8200 sources said the information stored in Azure amounted toa rich repository of intelligence about its population that some in the unit claimed had been used to blackmail people, place them in detention, or even justify their killing after the fact.“When they need to arrest someone and there isn’t a good enough reason to do so, that’s where they find the excuse,” one said, referring to the information stored in the cloud.A Microsoft spokesperson said it had “no information” about the kind of data stored by Unit 8200 in its cloud. They said the company’s “engagement with Unit 8200 has been based on strengthening cybersecurity and protecting Israel from nation state and terrorist cyber-attacks”.“At no time during this engagement,” they added, “has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services, including through the external review it commissioned.”‘Tracking everyone, all the time’The driving force behind the cloud project – described by one source as a “revolution” within the unit – was Sariel, commander of Unit 8200 between early 2021 and late 2024. A career intelligence officer, Sariel was a strong advocate for projects of this scale.Following a 2015 wave of deadly so-called “lone wolf” attacks by young Palestinians, many of whom were teenagers unknown to the security services, Sariel had overseen a significant expansion of the volume of Palestinian communications that Unit 8200 intercepted and stored.His answer was to begin “tracking everyone, all the time”, said an officer who worked for Sariel at the time. Instead of traditional surveillance of specific targets, Sariel’s project relied on mass surveillance of Palestinians in the West Bank and used novel AI methods to extract insights.“Suddenly the entire public was our enemy,” said another source who worked on the project, which sought to predict whether someone represented a threat to Israeli security.One system developed in this period, sources said, scanned all text messages between Palestinians in the West Bank and assigned each message a risk rating based on an automated analysis of whether it included words deemed to be suspicious. Still in use, the system – known as “noisy message” – can identify text messages in which people talk about weapons or discuss wanting to die.View image in fullscreenNablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 1 November 2022.Photograph: Issam Rimawi/Anadolu via Getty ImagesWhen Sariel became Unit 8200 commander in early 2021, he prioritised forging a partnership with Microsoft that would give the unit the ability to go further and capture and analyse the content of millions of phone calls each day.At his meeting with Nadella later that year, Sariel does not appear to have explicitly stated his plan to store Palestinian phone calls in the cloud, referring instead to “sensitive workloads” of secret data, according to internal records of the meeting.But documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files, while some Israel-based Microsoft staff, including alumni of Unit 8200, appear to have known about what the unit hoped the joint project would achieve.“You don’t have to be a genius to figure it out,” one source said. “You tell [Microsoft] we don’t have any more space on the servers, that it’s audio files. It’s pretty clear what it is.”Microsoft’s spokesperson said: “We are not aware of Azure being used for the storage of such data.” They said Unit 8200 was simply a customer of its cloud services and Microsoft “did not build or consult with Unit 8200” on a cloud-based surveillance system.However, in early 2022, Microsoft and Unit 8200 engineers worked quickly and closely together to design and implement advanced security measures within Azure to meet the unit’s standards. “The rhythm of interaction with [the unit] is daily, top down and bottom up,” one document noted.Among Microsoft staff, the project was shrouded in considerable secrecy and engineers were told not to mention Unit 8200 by name. Under the plan, vast troves of raw intelligence material would sit in Microsoft’s datacentres overseas.View image in fullscreenA signals intelligence–gathering installation of Unit 8200 located near an observation point in Misgav Am, a kibbutz close to the border with Lebanon in northern Israel.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyFiles suggest that by July this year, 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data – equivalent to approximately 200m hours of audio – was held in Microsoft’s Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion was stored in Ireland. It’s unclear if all of this data belongs to Unit 8200; some may belong to other Israeli military units.According to the files, Unit 8200 informed Microsoft that it planned to move over timeas much as 70% of its data, including secret and top secret data, into Azure and was willing to “push the envelope” with the kind of sensitive and classified information that intelligence agencies normally held on their own servers. “They’re always trying to challenge the status quo,” one executive noted.Asked about Sariel’s meeting with Nadella, Microsoft’s spokesperson said it “is not accurate” to say the CEO provided his personal support for the project with Unit 8200. They said Nadella “attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting” and there was “no discussion” of the content of the data the unit planned to move into Azure.However, according to internal Microsoft records of the meeting seen by the Guardian, Nadella offered support for Sariel’s aspiration to move so much of the elite surveillance unit’s data into the cloud, described earlier in the meeting as including sensitive intelligence material.“Satya suggested that we identify certain workloads to begin with and then gradually move towards the 70% mark,” one record states. It adds that Nadella said “building the partnership is so critical” and “Microsoft is committed to providing resources to support.”‘The solution to our problems’Several months before meeting Microsoft CEO Nadella in 2021, Sariel had published a book about artificial intelligence under a pen name – revealed bythe Guardianto be the spy chief’s – in which he urged militaries and intelligence agencies to “migrate to the cloud”.Known within Israeli intelligence as a tech evangelist, Sariel valued what he characterised to colleagues as a friendly relationship with Nadella, according to a senior intelligence source. “Yossi bragged a lot, even to me, about his connection with Satya,” they said. (Microsoft denied that Nadella and Sariel had a close relationship.)“He sold [the partnership] internally and got a huge budget,” another former intelligence colleague said. “He claimed it was the solution to our problems in the Palestinian arena.”Sariel declined to comment and referred the Guardian’s questions about the project to the Israel Defence Forces. An IDF spokesperson said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on “legally supervised agreements”.They added: “The IDF operates in accordance with international law, with the aim of countering terrorism and ensuring the security of the state and its citizens.”After publication, the IDF issued a new statement. “We appreciate Microsoft’s support to protect our cybersecurity. We confirm that Microsoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.”For its part, Microsoft viewed the multiyear partnership as a lucrative commercial opportunity. Executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue and “an incredibly powerful brand moment” for Azure, according to the files.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators hold banners and signs as they protest outside the Microsoft Build conference at the Seattle convention center in Seattle, Washington, on 19 May 2025.Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images“[Unit 8200’s] leadership hopes to expand the mission-critical work tenfold in the coming years,” one executive noted.As Unit 8200 began to make use of Azure’s storage capabilities in 2022, intelligence officers rapidly grasped the new powers at their disposal. “The cloud is infinite storage,” one source familiar with the system said.Calls–which include calls made by Palestinians to international and Israeli numbers–are typically retained in the cloud for about one month, though storage can be scaled up, allowing the unit to keep hold of calls for longer periods of time when needed, several intelligence sources explained.‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targetsRead moreThis allows the unit to go back in time and retrieve the phone conversations of people who become of interest, they said. Previously, surveillance targets would need to be pre-selected for their conversations to be intercepted and stored.Several of the sources insisted the cloud-based system had prevented deadly attacks against Israelis. One said “saving lives” of Israelis was the principal motivation behind Sariel’s vision for the system. But it notably failed to prevent the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 in which nearly 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and 240 people were kidnapped.In the wake of the attacks, Sariel faced criticism for his apparent prioritisation of “addictive and exciting” technology over old-fashioned intelligence methods, which some critics said contributed to the disaster. Sariel resigned last year, accepting responsibility for “8200’s part in the intelligence and operational failure”.In the ensuing war in Gaza, the cloud-based system pioneered by Sariel has been put to frequent use alongside a series of AI-driven target recommendation tools also developed on his watch and debuted by the military in a campaign that has devastated civilian life and created a profound humanitarian crisis.Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s telecoms infrastructure has reduced the volume of phone calls in the territory but sources said theinformation held in thecloud remained useful. According to one, enthusiasm for the system had grown among intelligence officers working on Gaza as the war progressed and they saw the military is “heading towards long-term control there”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMicrosoftMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

Well, there’s good news and there’s bad news.Eating chips has been found to raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but baking, boiling or mashing potatoes was much healthier.Consuming french fries three times a week increases the chances of someone getting the disease by 20% – and doing so five times a week by 27% – according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.Globally, potatoes are thethird most commonly consumed food crop, after rice and wheat.Nine out of 10 of the estimated 5.8 million people in the UK with diabetes have the type 2 version of the disease, which is closely associated with lifestyle, especially diet.The findings confirm potatoes do not of themselves pose a danger to health, but frying them to turn them into chips, and eating them regularly, does make a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes more likely.An international team of researchers, led by Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, a public health expert at Harvard University, investigated the relationship between potato intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and 2021.Someone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%.“The high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes,” the study explains.Replacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%.Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but it’s how we prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium.“But when we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and calorie content that’s much more likely to contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.”However, replacing any form of potatoes with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the paper found.Dr Hashem added: “This research reinforces the simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes – just don’t rely on chips as your go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on, which are healthier and protective for long-term health.”The researchers stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk.The Food Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsChips (french fries)NutritionDiabetesnewsShareReuse this content"

Both men are in custody and due to appear at Warwick crown court on 26 August.Warwickshire county council’s chief executive briefed Finch confidentially about the immigration status of the two men, according to a letter by the force’s chief constable, Alex Franklin-Smith.Franklin-Smith said he confirmed to Finch last Thursday that this information was accurate but that “we wouldn’t be releasing immigration status at point of charge as we follow national guidance”.The police chief said he had asked the Home Office to confirm the full immigration status of the two men, given that Finch had released some details publicly.He added: “I am confident that Warwickshire police has treated this investigation seriously from the outset, working tirelessly to identify, locate, arrest and charge those suspected of being responsible for this awful crime as quickly as possible.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “As the home secretary said yesterday, it has been widely reported that this case involves two Afghan individuals who are in the asylum system, some of which information has already been confirmed in open court.“The home secretary has made clear that there is a strong public interest in maximum transparency wherever that is possible.“That is why the Home Office and College of Policing are working together to strengthen and clarify the guidance around how and when information is released.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was introduced by the conservative People’s party (PP) and passed with the abstention of the far-right Vox party and the opposition of local leftwing parties.The proposal states “municipal sports facilities cannot be used for religious, cultural or social activities alien to our identity unless organised by the local authority”.The local Vox party posted on X: “Thanks to Vox the first measure to ban Islamic festivals in Spain’s public spaces has been passed. Spain is and will be forever the land of Christian people.”Mounir Benjelloun Andaloussi Azhari, president of the Spanish federation of Islamic organisations, told El País newspaper the proposal was “Islamophobic and discriminatory”.“They’re not going after other religions, they’re going after ours,” he said. Referring to the recent rise of racist rhetoric and attacks, he added: “We’re rather surprised by what’s happening in Spain. For the first time in 30 years I feel afraid.”Jumilla has a population of about 27,000, of whom 7.5% come from largely Muslim countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And what about the centuries of Muslim legacy here?”Jumilla was part of the Roman empire until the Arab conquest in the eighth century. As Yumil-la it remained a principally Arab town for centuries until it was attacked by Christian troops led by Alfonso X of Castile in the mid-13th century.The local Arab ruler reached an agreement, known as the capitulations of Alcatraz, under which Alfonso could be king as long as the rights of the existing population were respected. However, shortly after Alfonso’s death Castile invaded Jumilla, ending Arab rule.Explore more on these topicsSpainIslamophobiaIslamThe far rightEuropeReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Her attacker was Roy Barclay, 56, who had been living rough to escape capture.He had been jailed for an attack in 2015 on a man in his 80s, who was also found with his dog tied to his leg.Barclay had been released early from a 10-year sentence, but was wanted for recall to prison for breaching the terms of his licence when he attacked Rose, a mother of six. The court heard she suffered a “vicious and brutal attack” with Barclay raining down “kicks, stamps and blows on her”. His boot print matched those found on her body.View image in fullscreenAnita Rose was out walking her dog near her home when she was attacked and killed.Photograph: Suffolk Police/PARose died four days later in hospital, having been found by passersby, suffering injuries so severe they were similar to those of a victim of a car crash.Barclay was sentenced to a minimum term of 25 years.Rose’s daughter, Jessica Cox, told of her family’s grief in a victim impact statement. Barclay had shown no remorse, she said, and had not told police why he had exploded in violence.Cox said: “He has put us through a nightmare which we can’t wake up from. I believe he’s cunning and I believe he’s enjoyed what he’s done and the trial itself.“He’s not answered why he did what he did. What he’s done is horrific and it’s evil. He’s given no reason why he’s changed our lives forever. We will never have the answers we deserve as a family.”Barclay lived rough for two years, breaking into a sewage works through a hole in the fence, which he cut, to wash. Rose was found near the sewage works, just after 6.25am having set out just after 5am to walk her springer spaniel, Bruce.Having left Rose for dead, Barclay stole items from her including her earphones, which he used, and other phone accessories, which were found on him when he was arrested.1:07CCTV footage shows dog walker and murderer in same area before attack – videoA search of Barclay’s phone found he had scoured the internet for news about the police manhunt and had searched for information about DNA detection, how long a murder trial took and prisons. He had also searched online for information on the detectives who were leading the hunt for him.Barclay shaved his head and beard as he tried to avoid capture and lived rough near a bridge.In 2015, Barclay attacked an 82-year-old man in Essex so severely he needed 10 titanium plates in his head. He was released from jail in 2020 and was required to live at approved premises, but failed to do so. By May 2022, he was recalled to prison and started living off grid to avoid capture.Barclay stayed mostly in the countryside. He was captured three months after the attack on 21 October inIpswichLibrary. The Suffolk probation service has started an internal inquiry.Judge Martyn Levett described Barclay as “unpredictable” and “someone prone to dangerous outbursts at the slightest confrontation”.He said there were similarities between the two attacks and added: “Due to your silence in police interviews and you choosing not to give evidence in your defence, we will perhaps never know what triggered this outburst of horrific violence.”DCI Matthew Connick, who led the manhunt, said: “Anita Rose was subjected to the most shocking and violent attack on the outskirts of her village whilst she was alone and vulnerable on her early morning dog walk.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeSuffolkIpswichnewsShareReuse this content"

Of those, only “a few hundred are believed to still remain”, according to the auction house Auctioneum, which discovered the novel without a dust cover on a bookcase at a home in Bristol.Bidders from around the world drove the price up by more than four times what the auction house expected. Caitlin Riley, Auctioneum’s rare books specialist, said: “It’s a wonderful result for a very special book.”Riley added: “Nobody knew it was there. It was just a run-of-the-mill bookcase. It was clearly an early Hobbit at first glance, so I just pulled it out and began to flick through it, never expecting it to be a true first edition.”The copy is bound in light green cloth and features black-and-white illustrations by Tolkien, who created his Middle-earth universe while a professor at the University of Oxford.View image in fullscreenThe first edition of The Hobbit is bound in light green cloth and features black-and-white illustrations by Tolkien.Photograph: AuctioneumThe book was passed down in the family library of Hubert Priestley, a botanist connected to the university and the brother of the Antarctic explorer and geologist, Sir Raymond Edward Priestley.It is likely the men knew each other, according to Auctioneum, which said Priestley and Tolkien shared mutual correspondence with his fellow author CS Lewis, who was also at Oxford.The Hobbit, which was followed by The Lord of the Rings, has sold more than 100m copies and was adapted into a film trilogy in the 2010s.

From relationships with women to Andrew’s mysterious finances, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, by the historian Andrew Lownie, also dives into the prince’s ill-advised friendship with the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew’s representatives were contacted for comment.Claims from the extracts serialised in the Daily Mail include:1.Andrew and EpsteinLownie claims that, although Andrew claimed to have met Epstein in 1999, “the truth is he and his ex-wife Sarah had known the financier for almost a decade by then”. Lownie writes Andrew “was easy prey for a rattlesnake like Epstein”, and adds: “Epstein played Andrew. The prince was a useful idiot who gave him respectability, access to political leaders and business opportunities. He found him easy to exploit.” Lownie quotes the US businessman Steven Hoffenberg, said to be Epstein’s “mentor” and a convicted fraudster, as saying Andrew was his “Super Bowl trophy”.2.Secrets passed to foreign officialsCompromising material on Andrew may allegedly have been passed to Israel’s Mossad secret service, Saudi Arabian authorities and Muammar Gaddafi’s Libyan intelligence services by Epstein, according to the book. Lownie credits a documentary by the Canadian journalist Ian Halperin, writing the claims were “confirmed” to Halperin by “many in Andrew’s circle”. Although some of Epstein’s victims have alleged the financier kept video recordings of high-profile friends having sex with women, no proof has been made public to date. The claim Epstein boasted of planning to sell Andrew’s secrets to the Mossad, first reported by the US Sun, was made by Hoffenberg.3.Was Putin passed Andrew material?Compromising material on Andrew may also have ended up in Russian hands, Lownie claims. He examines British intelligence fears, first reported by the Sunday Times, that John Mark Dougan, a former deputy in Palm Beach county sheriff’s office, fled to Russia with copies of files on the Epstein investigation and was in touch with Pavel Borodin, a “mentor” of Putin. Lownie writes: “Asked what might be in the files, Dougan said: ‘Lots of videos, but I wasn’t going to sit around and watch them. Also lots of scanned documents.’” Dougan, a former US marine, has previously been described by the BBC as spreading a number of disinformation claims from Russia.4.Harry, Meghan and AndrewAccording to Lownie, Prince Harry gave Andrew a “bloody nose” during a heated argument at a 2013 family gathering.This has been denied by Harry. Another allegation that Andrew made disparaging remarks to Harry about how long his marriage to Meghan Markle would last was also denied. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.” The spokesperson confirmed a legal letter from Prince Harry’s counsel had been sent to the Mail.In 2021, after Meghan was accused of bullying staff, which she has denied, Lownie also claims: “Buckingham Palace braced itself for historic complaints about Prince Andrew’s bullying, profanities and impossible demands. Some say a report on bullying accusations against Meghan Markle has never been released because it would also raise questions about the behaviour of the queen’s second son.”5.Mysterious financesWith no obvious source of income beyond his Royal Navy pension, family money he may have inherited and handouts “first from the queen and now King Charles”, Lownie questions how Andrew can afford the 30-room Royal Lodge, which he spent £7.5m refurbishing and which has annual running costs of about £250,000.He revisits how £750,000 from Turkish millionaire Nebahat Isbilen ended up in Andrew’s Coutts account, according to 2022 high court papers from an action between Isbilen and her banker, Selman Turk, for misuse of funds. Andrew’s office described it as a gift for Princess Beatrice’s wedding, but it was later repaid. Andrew’s holiday to Tunisia with the convicted Libyan gun-smuggler, Tarek Kaituni, who is also said to have presented Beatrice with an £18,000 solitaire diamond necklace for her 21st birthday, are among several allegedly questionable relationships examined in the book.6.Personal lifeThere are various eye-popping claims about Andrew’s sex life, as well as stories alleging a vulgar sense of humour. One claim is that more than 40 women were brought to his hotel room during a stay in Bangkok. “Hotel staff were used to foreigners bringing in girls, but amazed that more than 10 a day were going to Andrew’s room,” Lownie writes. As to claims over bullying, the book makes many, including that of Andrew calling a palace staff member a “fucking imbecile” for not referring to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother by her full title.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Whatever happened to them?Alcopops were the subject of a moral panic that led tobad publicity, duty rises and bansfrom major pub chains and supermarkets. But mostly they succumbed to a sharp decline in drinking by young people.So they just disappeared?Almost completely. Sales plummeted and brands vanished. Even the Bacardi Breezer was discontinued in 2015.RIP Alcopops – you taught a whole generation to throw up in every colour of the rainbow.Not so fast.

Drinks giant Diageo has launched a new campaign across 20 countries torestore the fortunes of Smirnoff Ice, amid a near doubling in RTD sales over the last decade, fuelled by new brands includingBuzzBallz.How have these RTDs managed to overcome the inexorable decline in alcohol consumption?Gen Z have started drinking again.They have?Arecent studyshowed that in March 2025 the proportion of UK gen Z consumers who drank alcohol in the last six months was 76%, up from 66% in 2023.That seems pretty worrying …Who cares?

And alcopops have slyly adapted to their new habits.How?In part by being less alcoholic. In their original formulations alcopops mostly hovered around 5% alcohol.

Playing the psychedelic theatre troupe made up of hippies and drag queens, these eight performers are magnetic, conjuring up a cabaret wildness between them.They sing, dance and sashay out from beyond a red curtain in outre outfits.Allen and Adcock’s costumes are stone cold fabulous: a storm of fishnets, feathers, kooky dresses, long socks and bodices. There are Sgt Pepper jackets twinned with ballerina tutus and a dazzle of sequins. The choreography by Paul McGill is cheeky, quirky, cute. It is all so imaginative, and winning.The one – significant – setback is that there is just not enough to Rae Binstock’s skimpy book. The Cockettes get together, make it big in San Francisco and are booked for New York, but their opening night is a flop, so they go back home.You get a sense of what this LSD-taking troupe stands for and that they become their own chosen family. But there is no filling in of the details so you do not learn much about their avant-gardism, and that they endeavoured to put their lifestyle on stage.There is a central tension between Hibiscus (Andrew Horton, whose song, A Crab on Uranus, is a highlight) and Sylvester (Gregory Haney, just as good with his song, There’s a Lady on the Stage).

It’s broad-brush and, at times, the sense of anarchy on stage trips over into confusion. Under the direction of McGill, it is not always immediately clear what is going on. This is not helped by a sound system that seems to over-amplify voices so that lyrics are occasionally hard to discern. The singing is still sparky, with Baylie Carson, who plays Sweet Pam, especially characterful.We hang on for Brandon James Gwinn’s songs as well as the dance and glitter of the performances.

That movie’s reputation has only grown over the years – it’s basically the thinking and anxious person’s Independence Day – but the Wells text has been revisited repeatedly since its publication at the tail end of the 19th century. 2025 seems as good a time as any for another update. And if ever any viewers yearned to see a new War of the Worlds beset with the constant pinging of a Microsoft Teams chat, Prime Video has a real treat in store.How KPop Demon Hunters became the surprise Netflix smash of the summerRead moreYes, hovering towards the top of Prime Video’s movie charts is a new War of the Worlds, which arrived with little fanfare on the service at the end of July. In it,Ice Cubeplays Will Radford, a Department of Homeland Security official who monitors an array of feeds for terrorist threats. Despite a belated heads-up from his Nasa pal Dr Sandra Salas (Eva Longoria), he (somewhat bafflingly) fails to pay much mind to a series of mysterious gathering storms, until it’s too late: meteor strikes occur worldwide, and from the meteors emerge alien tripods that quickly lay waste to buildings and people everywhere. Will has been distracted by the hunt for a hacker called “Disruptor”, as well as by spying on his grown-ish kids Faith (Iman Benson), who is expecting her first child, and Dave (Henry Hunter Hall), a gamer Will thinks is wasting his life.In a novelty that turns into a hindrance almost immediately, most of this unfolds on Will’s computer screen at his mostly empty office, where he’s working what’s described as a “graveyard” shift despite it being, you know, daytime. Actually, it’s more accurate to say that it unfolds near Will’s computer screen. Unlike past “screenlife” movies like Unfriended, War of the Worlds is not exactly rigorous about adhering to its self-imposed limitations. Though Will’s face is often display on screen as part of various video calls (which is how Unfriended and others have worked actors’ faces into a screen-only framework), the movie also flat-out cuts away to traditional shots of Will that are framed vaguely like a Zoom call but clearly take place outside of Will’s computer. This makes sense. After all, when you’ve got an actor as expressive as Ice Cube, you want unmotivated closeups that can capture every single cocked-eyebrow scowl. How will the audience know how to feel if they can’t see Ice Cube scowling at his computer screen?That’s probably not fair to Cube, who has been quite good in plenty of other movies. The man has presence. What he does not have is the kind of subtlety or emotional range that benefits from de facto solo occupation of the screen. Really, every actor in War of the Worlds feels like they’re performing in a Zoom-style vacuum – and seemingly not as a commentary on the coldly disconnected world of digital communication. In fact, quite the opposite: in this movie, everyone video-calls everyone all the time, to better show off some of the worst visual effects ever seen in a movie bearing theUniversal Pictureslogo out front. No amount of handheld phone-camera or grainy news footage can disguise how terrible the alien ships look. They wouldn’t pass muster on a whimsical Snickers ad.So how did this happen? How did this D-grade reimagining of a public-domain property wind up going from major studio to major streaming service to the top of the charts?It should have been a fortuitous confluence of events. Film-maker Timur Bekmambetov remains high on the screenlife format, a variation on found footage, where stories are told entirely through activity on device screens. He’s produced several successful film series based on that tech: the aforementioned horror film Unfriended and its sequel, and a pair of less bloody companion thrillers, Searching and Missing. All of these movies make innovative use of their central gimmick, and War of the Worlds came out as a pandemic-inspired variation. It was announced in the fall of 2020 as a spectacle-driven sci-fi movie that could nonetheless unfold in a series of contained environments, with actors all filming their parts separately.So the reason War of the Worlds feels not just like eavesdropping on a Zoom call but like a movie pieced together through Zoom is that it more or less was. More technology was involved, but that’s barely clear from the final product, which has the rushed jankiness of something that should have come out a month or two after filming and been marketed as a quickie experiment. Instead, the movie seems to have sat on a shelf for literally years before it was sold off to a streaming service. Weirdly, it’s not the only 2020-shot Universal-produced sci-fi movie to get that treatment:Long Distance, a space survival movie starring Anthony Ramos, recently debuted on Hulu despite filming wrapping before the end of 2020. Even a lengthy post-production would mean that it spent three years on the shelf, and couldn’t even rate a release in the aftermath of the 2023 strikes. (Long Distance looks and acts more like a real movie compared with War of the Worlds. This is also true of many network TV shows and some big-budget ads.)The simplest answer to why the hell these movies have remained in limbo, then, seems to be Covid-era buyer’s remorse. Studios were panicking about how to keep their pipelines moving during an unprecedented disruption, and didn’t wind up having room on the release schedule for these smaller projects. The real question is how audiences have made it through an unconvincing cheapie like War of the Worlds – a sci-fi epic that seems to take place in real time yet features a vast and coordinated worldwide mobilization of multiple armed forces – without shutting it off in disgust (it boasts a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes).Maybe they haven’t. Streaming viewership is notoriously sketchy to measure, and most services rely on total minutes watched, which means watching five minutes of an awful movie and then flipping to something else can add to its total. War of the Worlds seems to have been made for its Covid-era convenience, and cynically capitalizes on surveillance paranoia and government secrets without actually saying anything coherent about, well, anything. But Amazon – which figures into the plot so embarrassingly that it seems like a plea for a Prime Video pick-up – stumbled upon the perfect streaming product: a cheap piece of junk with a recognizable title and stars, just enough for millions of people to hit play. Maybe some of them even watched through the end; the movie certainly doesn’t compete with second-screen phone-scrolling, in the sense that your scroll is likely to eventually hit upon something vastly better than the movie’s own toggling between chat windows. Amazon has plenty of experience helping consumers find junk, so War of the Worlds wound up in a fitting home – at least until Temu starts its own streaming service.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction and fantasy filmsIce CubeUniversal PicturesHG WellsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What allegations of racist language? Despite firing its hosts, the BBC food show seems to be pretending there is no problem here …Hannah J DaviesWed 6 Aug 2025 09.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.52 EDTShareTo say that this year’s MasterChef UK has been an unmitigated calamity for the BBC feels like an understatement. In early July, Gregg Wallace was fired from the show after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, including one accusation of unwanted touching (45 out of 83 claims against himwere upheldfollowing an official report), leaving the BBC with a headache over whether to broadcast the latest series, which was filmed last autumn. It then emerged that the report into Wallace’s behaviour had also highlightedan accusation of racist languageon the part of his co-host of 20 years, John Torode. The BBC swiftly dispensed with him, too, despite him saying that he doesn’t believe the incident happened.The corporation confirmed in late July that it wouldbroadcast the series anyway; one contestant,Sarah Shafi, was so appalled by the decision that she agreed to be edited out. Meanwhile,the broadcasting union Bectusaid: “If [the BBC] are serious about addressing this industry-wide problem, broadcasters should not reward bad behaviour with primetime coverage.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, no advanced screeners were offered to the media; the first three episodes landed unannounced on BBC iPlayer on Wednesday morning, ahead of its 8pm broadcast on BBC One.And so to the programme itself. Would the first episode be full of jarring jump-cuts, introduced to minimise the presence of Torode and Wallace? Would it seem as though the pair had just happened to wander on to the set now and again?It began like any other series of MasterChef, with the narrator,India Fisher, introducing the latest “battle for the ultimate culinary prize” between 60 new contestants, over some characteristically tense music. As in previous series, Wallace and Torode featured prominently in the opening montage, alongside nervous contestants and lingering shots of plates buckling under the weight of jus and garnishes, with Torode saying: “This is the sort of stuff that dreams are made of,” and Wallace describing one dish as “a cracker of a job”.MasterChef contestant edited out after asking for new series not to be broadcastRead moreAs usual, the first challenge was “basic to brilliant”. As usual, Torode and Wallace introduced the conceit (contestants have to zhoosh up a workaday grocery item of their choosing). The duo stood and salivated at the prospect of digital marketing manager Thea’s gorgonzola risotto and recruiter Gon’s take on the Thai dish kaphrao. But there wasn’t as much in the way of witty repartee between the hosts and the contestants, unlike the previous series, which opened with one participant declaring that they “[couldn’t] wait to meet John and Gregg and hoping that Wallace would give their dish a “phwoar” of approval.Nonetheless, both were definitely, firmly hosting the show. Wallace was limited to asking questions rather than offering up punchlines, but he delivered his usual gushing critiques. Speaking of business development manager Gemma’s mackerel-heavy take on the Malaysian national dish, nasi lemak, he said: “I could dip bread in this all day.” Torode quibbled over whether vocal coach Beth’s chocolate and orange ganache tart was, in fact, merely a chocolate tart. Overall, very much business as usual.Gon and Shaun, a digital marketing manager, received the first aprons and progressed to the next round. Then it was on to the mystery box challenge, with the amateur cooks charged with fashioning a dish from any or all of trout, beetroot and chocolate. As always, there was some light chat from Torode and Wallace about the sort of mistakes the contestants might make, with comments that seemed far from truncated. “We have a trout-off!” declared Torode as four contestants reached for the fish. Wallace quizzed writer Penelope about her skills with invention and asked whether her couscous was likely to turn into porridge.The critiques were largely effusive, even if Torode did have to console an overwhelmed Thea with the words: “It’s a big thing, isn’t itMasterChef?” Those words would take on a greater meaning in the months after filming. Thea was booted off alongside Gemma, with Penelope and Beth bagging the next two aprons.In the final round, the four remaining contenders cooked for the 2024 champion, Brin Pirathapan, and the finalists Chris Willoughby and Louise Lyons Macleod. As the hosts fawned over Gon’s Thai-influenced steak tartare and risotto and Shaun’s scissor-cut noodles, it was just like old times.Pirathapan, Willoughby and Lyons Macleod took centre stage as the food started to appear, but not in a way that seemed out of the ordinary for the show’s guest judges. Still, their presence was surely a boon to Banijay, the producer of the show, which could give over a huge chunk of the episode’s final 20 minutes to their discussions about what makes a good tartare and whether fish and apples should ever be on the same plate.But there was still much time given over to Wallace and Torode, speaking with their mouths half-full, raving over a chicken dish that Wallace said he could have eaten by the kilo. By the time the names of the three contestants advancing to the next stage of the competition were announced over a bed of uplifting plinky-plonk music, it was easy to forget that there had ever been a national controversy.It was always going to be a challenge to be faithful to the series while also editing out the two people at the centre of it, but if episode one is anything to go by, it seems the BBC and Banijay have decided essentially to ignore the problem and hope that putting out more or less the same show as ever will suffice. Maybe further chopping the contributions of Wallace and Torode would have felt ludicrous, but it might also have been the right thing to do. Instead, the BBC is getting to have its chocolate ganache tart and eat it. Still, you imagine the ratings will be astronomical. Phwoar indeed.This article was amended on 6 August 2025 to clarify the circumstances in which Sarah Shafi was edited out of the MasterChef series.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefTelevisionGregg WallaceFood TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was part of the plan, a teasing trailer that only told a small part of the story and a swaggering title that promised something grander than we could initially see, and that might be why I found the reaction to be a little alienating. It was showered with euphoric praise upon release and first-time writer-director Zach Cregger, whose background is in comedy, was immediately heralded as a new king of the genre. For me, it was more trick than treat, a sizzle reel that showed Cregger to be a film-maker of considerable skill but also one who papered over the cracks of an exasperatingly illogical and uninspired script with flashy gimmickry.Freakier Friday review – puppyishly uninhibited Jamie Lee Curtis saves body-swap sequelRead moreThere’s been an inevitable shift in the hype machine for Cregger’s follow-up, the bigger, bolder and, thankfully, better Weapons, buzz that began when his spec script caused a talk-of-the-town auction months after Barbarian overperformed. Industry rumourssuggestedthat Jordan Peele was so determined to land the project that when his company lost out to New Line, he parted ways with his management. There’s since been over two years of anticipation – Cregger comparing the project to Magnolia, stars such as Julia Garner and Josh Brolin signing up, an all-out assault of a marketing campaign – and so second time around, it’s virtually impossible not to see this one coming. Credit to the Warner Bros marketing team for still holding something back though, the jolting string of trailers highlighting enough of the standard WTF imagery without really revealing all that much beyond the striking premise.Seventeen children from the same class are missing. They all got out of bed at 2.17am and ran off into the darkness. The police are baffled and the parents are furious, aiming their anger at teacher Ms Grady (Julia Garner). She’s one of many alternating viewpoints, which also include a parent (Josh Brolin), a cop (Alden Ehrenreich), a small-time criminal (Austin Abrams) and the one kid who didn’t run away (Cary Christopher), slowly building a picture of what really happened that night.It’s a tantalising set-up, pitched somewhere between Stephen King and the Brothers Grimm, and Cregger’s careful slow build keeps us in thrall for the most part, eager to see just how the puzzle-pieces fit. The POV-shifting allows for his excellent cast to each get their moment, from Garner’s nervy, vodka-swilling hate figure to Ehrenreich’s quick-tempered philanderer, although Cregger’s characters are all rather thinly drawn, resembling less the protagonists of thoughtful short stories and more the bodies one inhabits in a video game. They are in service of a magnetic drip-feed mystery plot that unravels so compellingly that it takes us a while to notice how empty it all is. On the one hand, it’s a relief that unlike so many of his genre peers, Cregger isn’t all that interested in the dirge of trauma horror and while those who wish to look for it might still find a deeper allegorical read of Weapons (probably the same few who laughably claimed Barbarian was a powerful #MeToo statement), it’s mostly an engine of brute force, similar to a schlocky paperback you can’t put down on holiday. But it’s also crucially lacking something, an added element of surprise or sophistication.It reminded me of Denis Villeneuve’s lurid missing children thriller Prisoners and while it’s mercifully not as undeservingly self-serious, it’s similarly handsome, high-end packaging for something that’s incredibly silly and straightforward. The tricksy structure and repetition of scenes from different viewpoints would have one believe there’s a labyrinthine plot to be uncovered but Weapons is far hokier and, frustratingly, dumber than it would seem, relying on staggeringly incompetent police and wilfully ignorant citizens. Cregger remains a remarkably confident and alluringly immersive director, constructing some wonderfully rattling shocks and moments of seat-clenching unsureness. His canny mood-conjuring grips us in the moment (the film is a fun, reactive experience with a big audience) and he draws a fantastically scary and nightmarishly odd performance from a late-arriving actor whose name would be a spoiler to reveal but his storytelling crumbles even before the lights come up. The finale might up the violence to a wince-inducing level but it doesn’t cut anywhere near as deep as it could have, chaos without meaning.Cregger might be expanding and improving his arsenal, using his skills more effectively than he did in Barbarian, but there’s still something missing. Something sharper.Weapons is out in Australia on 7 August and the UK and US on 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsJulia GarnerJosh BrolinThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

The more precise answer is France, where the internet is available. But I tried not to use it compulsively because there isn’t much point in getting away from it all if you carry it all with you on a phone and check it every few minutes.At some point in the past decade or so, the condition of vacation came to be defined more by detachment from the digital realm than departure from home. The break begins not in a departure lounge but with the act of logging off, setting the out-of-office email auto-reply, archiving work-related WhatsApp chats, deleting social media apps.The benefit isn’t immediate. The cacophony rings in your ears for a few days before you notice the stillness, the change in tempo. It is the difference between gliding on thermal currents of private thought and hurtling along rails, propelled by the burning urgency of other people’s opinions. The contrast is even starker in reverse, the roar of the tunnel as you go back to work, the jostle of notifications, the bowed head, scrolling the horizon away.I’m not an analogue nostalgist. I don’t prefer getting lost to having Google Maps. I don’t think people were better informed when they had fewer channels or were less vulnerable to superstition when clerical authority was absolute.We are now in the third decade of the first digital century. The revolution is irreversible and of unknowable duration. History has had a number of these explosive profusions of interconnectedness, driven by a radical innovation in communication technology. But not many. The writer Naomi Alderman calls them “information crises”, and argues that the present one is only the third. The printing press was the second. The invention of writing some time around the fourth millennium BC was the first.The comparison doesn’t have to be exact for us to marvel at the scale of what we are experiencing. It is immeasurable because we don’t know how far along the track we have travelled. AI is only getting started.Readers of theGutenberg Biblein the late 15th century had no means of anticipating the ways that movable type would transform European social, cultural, economic and political organisation. Are we better equipped to imagine the world after another 100 years of digital Reformation?My measly fortnight of technological temperance isn’t likely to afford much additional perspective. But it is a reminder that the transformation under way is operating at a cognitive level. When you switch the information flow off for a moment, or just dial it down a bit, you appreciate how intense and overwhelming it is the rest of the time.Our brains evolved to handle the relatively limited dataset of an immediate physical environment, tracking the bush for predators, eking a survival strategy from scarce resources. We are organic processing units. Our capacity for rational judgment is limited by the rate at which we can turn signals from our senses into a workable mental model of the universe, and choose an appropriate course of action.1:56App stores have 'huge disincentive' to remove pornography due to profits says eSafety boss  – videoIt is an extraordinary talent, but fallible, especially in conditions of sensory overload. That doesn’t mean we are incapable of handling perception of the world on an altered scale, or at much higher speeds. We can adapt to the tsunami of additional stimulus, just as we adapted to life in cities after centuries of rural subsistence. But such accelerated transitions are turbulent, stressful and usually violent. Information crises generate cosmological upheaval. They change the way humanity organises and views itself. Hierarchies tumble. Social norms are recoded. Morality is redefined. New philosophies are hatched. Gods are discarded.Under the circumstances, it isn’t surprising that democratic politics is struggling to adapt. How is one parliament on a small north Atlantic island supposed to impose new rules for the application of technology that spans the globe, dissolves national borders and vaporises the authority of analogue institutions?In the short period of my internet abstinence last month, long-delayed provisions of the Online Safety Act came into force.Social mediaplatforms and search engines are now obliged to restrict underage users’ access to content listed as harmful by the new statute – abuse, pornography, material promoting self-harm, terrorism and suicide.Tech companies have lobbied ferociously against the change. Donald Trump’s White House characterises it as an assault on free speech. Nigel Farage agrees andpromises to repeal the actif he ever forms a government. Labour ministers have said the Reform leader’s position aligns him with theinterests of paedophiles.As a law-abiding adult user of social media, I cannot judge whether the new restrictions perform their advertised function. The age-verification process is efficient, painless and feels no more or less sinister than any of the other personal data submissions we now routinely make as the price for a frictionless internet.There are reported cases of non-pornographic news and public health sites being blocked by accident. There are claims that the protections are easily circumvented with a modicum of digital knowhow. It seems plausible that risk-averse or lazy tech companies are applying ill-designed, overzealous filters. But the impact on political liberty – the impediment to free speech that might justify some of the lurid comparisons being made to totalitarian censorship – is probably still in the order of zero.Social media battles and barbs on both sides of Atlantic over UK Online Safety ActRead moreOf course, any instrument for policing flows of information contains the theoretical foundations of a more repressive agenda. A future government could redefine “harmful” content to include criticism of the government, for example, or anything that undermines traditional family values. Liberal defenders of the new law should not be complacent about its potential misuse.But its most vigorous critics,especially in the Trump administration, are not credible advocates of political liberty. The cause they advance is not free speech as a civic virtue. It is the commercial interest of companies that control much of the world’s digital information infrastructure. The system is awash with toxic material. Poison flows into the public realm and the pump’s owners deny responsibility, resisting regulation for the same reason that polluters have done since the Industrial Revolution. Because they can. Because their business is more profitable when someone else cleans up the mess.The Online Safety Act can be flawed and necessary at the same time. It is just a tiny skirmish in the early stages of the battle to decide how power is wielded and by whom in a world reordered by the information crisis. It is a faint but vital signal – a cry for help by analogue politicians drowning in digital noise.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInternet safetyOpinionInternetSocial mediaNigel FarageDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

This was an ideological ploy from which we have yet to recoverWed 6 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.28 EDTShareThe housing problem in the UK has become so pervasive that it can sometimes seem natural and eternal, the ever-present background to British life. But it’s important to remember that specific political projects and policy choices brought about the housing crisis – and continue to maintain it.A newreport from the thinktank Common Wealthtallies up some of the continuing costs of one of the culprits: the right to buy, Margaret Thatcher’s signature social policy. It demonstrates that the right to buy has amounted to a massive giveaway of public resources, and one of the largest privatisations in British history.Focused on England, the report’s figures show the enormous scale of the public assets that local government was forced to give away. Since the policy’s introduction in 1980, 1.9m English council homes were sold at an average discount of 44% of market value. Common Wealth calculates that the discount resulted in councils giving up £194bn in equity. More than 40% of the homes sold under the right to buy are now privately rented.The history of the right to buy illuminates the political logic underlying it. Thatcher didn’t invent the idea – councils had been able to sell the public housing they owned to their tenants on a discretionary basis since 1936. But it was the Thatcher government that made it central to its strategy and brand.The 1980HousingAct systematised and expanded the existing procedures for selling council houses to tenants. It obliged councils to allow discounted sales and required them to offer deposit-free mortgages to facilitate these sales. Local authorities were allowed to keep half of the proceeds from right-to-buy sales but were in effect prevented from spending it on replacing lost public housing.The right to buy managed at once to satisfy a number of rightwing political constituencies. Traditional conservatives favoured it as a way to expand owner-occupation. Neoliberals saw it as an opportunity to foster the entrepreneurial spirit and push back against municipal socialism. Above all, the right to buy was intended to encapsulate the Tory ideal of a property-owning democracy, which dated from the 1920s but featured prominently in the 1979 Conservative manifesto.There’s no question that many households benefited from the policy, which remains broadly popular. But uptake has been very uneven, disproportionately benefiting more affluent tenants living in more valuable locations and housing types.More serious has been the impact of the right to buy on the housing system as a whole. Its goal was to undermine public housing and lessen its role in British life. And in this, it has unfortunately been successful. The policy drove a structural shift in British housing tenure. Before the policy was enacted, social housing of all types made up 31% of overall housing tenure in England. Today it is 16%. As a result, council housing waiting lists and homelessness have surged.In addition to its impact on existing housing, the right to buy also made building new council housing less viable. Asone council officer put it: “It makes us all more cautious about growing our stock.” If councils must sell at a discount any social housing units they build, then doing so becomes a risky venture.Rules about spending right-to-buy proceeds have been tweaked, but they still restrict the construction of new public housing. One councilhas calculatedthat it would need to sell six homes through the right to buy to generate enough funding to build one new home. The policy amounts to, in the report’s words, a “decision to de facto ban new social housebuilding”.To be sure, the issue is not just the right to buy, but the whole suite of housing policies that accompanied it. This included the deregulation of housing finance, the creation of the buy-to-let mortgage market and other support for landlordism and private home ownership. Through stock transfers, estate regeneration and other mechanisms, this housing policy trajectory has been upheld by Labour governments as well as the Tories. But the right to buy set the initial direction.In addition to its quantitative impacts, the policy had long-lasting ideological and political effects. For one, it strengthened the ideology of home ownership. It equated owner-occupation with independence, ambition and success while stigmatising and denigrating households that did not own property. Just as significantly, it helped sever the link between housing and social citizenship. The British state never fully institutionalised a right to housing, but for a few decades in the 20th century, public housebuilding was a sign of successful governance for both major parties.Today, it is clear that the property-owning democracy was a mirage.Social housingand owner-occupation are on the backfoot. Private landlordism and elite multiple property ownership are expanding. Rents and house prices are rising. The result is a housing crisis, precarity and inequality.Thatcher’s motto that “there is no alternative” was never an empirical claim so much as a normative ambition. The right to buy has been an exercise in trying to make this ambition a reality in the housing sphere, by eliminating existing alternatives to the private housing market.Critics have been calling for the policy’s abolition since it was introduced. The policy was already scrapped in 2016 in Scotland and 2019 in Wales. Shelterestimatesthat fully suspending the right to buy would save on average more than 10,000 social homes a year. If the right to buy council housing were to be eliminated, asocial tenants’ deposit schemeor other offsetting policies could be established to compensate tenants without undercutting social housing as a whole.If Britain’s housing problem is ever going to be solved, it will require fully ending the right to buy. But that alone is insufficient. The way out of the housing impasse is by privileging occupancy over property rights, flattening the tenure hierarchy, expanding social housing and building other decommodified housing alternatives. Resolving the housing crisis depends upon reversing and replacing the changes to the British housing system and society that the right to buy helped to bring about.DavidMadden is associate professor of sociology and director of the Cities programme at the London School of EconomicsExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingHousing marketRenting propertyLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

But when my aunt and uncle needed to get their beloved Timmy out of the country, it was a different matter …Wed 6 Aug 2025 13.18 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 13.29 EDTShareIncredibly, given all the trouble in the world, we were short of an item or two on my BBC radio show recently. Someone suggested something about budgie smugglers coming back into fashion. Hardly veryReithian, is it? On the other hand, we all need a break from the dark stuff. And anyway, it turned out there was plenty in the budgie smugglers story with which to inform, educate and entertain our listeners.For a start, we needed to define the term. I’d been banging on about budgie smugglers on the radio all morning when I got a text from my mum demanding I explain what the devil these budgie smugglers were. In fact, she was so unfamiliar with the term that she spelt it phonetically using her Croatian keyboard, which renders it “bađi smagles”. So, to be clear, we’re talking men’s swimwear, withbađi smaglesbeing the tight, not-leaving-much-to-the-imagination style, as distinct from rather more modest swimming shorts which, mercifully, have become the norm. The tight ones had fallen out of favour but now, someone read somewhere, they were making a comeback.Eyewateringly tight swimming pants have been referred to as budgie smugglers for barely a quarter of a century, the description originating in a 1998 Australian television series called The Games, which satirised the 2000 Sydney Olympics. We can only wonder what kind of twisted mind came up with it, or indeed what kind of gentleman’s arrangement they saw that looked as if there might have been a couple of budgerigars down there. I for one have never seen such a thing and certainly have no desire to. I can’t get past the thought of some fella, engaged in rearranging things, inadvertently releasing a couple – or would it be three? – relieved budgies, freeing them to live better lives.If the fashion comeback is for real, it’ll be good news for the Australian brand, Budgy Smuggler. Shame on them for the spelling but we’ll let that pass. Their website says they are “On a mission to free the thighs of the world”. That’s an interestingly demure take on the purpose of their gear. I’ve always taken these things to be less about freeing anything and more about a) packing things up rather too snugly and b) showing off what there is to be proud of, including, but not restricted to, the thighs.I, needless to say, am very much a swimming shorts man. If you’d given the matter any thought, I hope you’d have reached this conclusion. Take any man, and it’s clear which way they lean when it comes to swimwear. Ronaldo’s a smuggler all day long. I’d be staggered if a single pair of swimming shorts had ever seen the inside of his wardrobe. Lionel Messi, on the other hand, shorts all the way. Have a Google of this and you’ll see I’m right. There is, to be fair, the odd shot of Ronaldo in shorts, but only in ones tailored tight enough to suggest that some kind of smuggling operation is indeed under way. Messi, though, is 100% standard shorts, bless him.In politics I have our prime minister in shorts, as is only right and proper. The only male member of the cabinet I can see in smugglers is Hilary Benn, for some reason. Across the floor, I can imagine Robert Jenrick keeping him company. Nigel Farage, shorts. Lee Anderson, definitely smugglers. Feel free to play this game at home.View image in fullscreen‘He’d tilt his head in a sweet way when whistled to’ … a budgie (but not Timmy).Photograph: CBCK-Christine/Getty ImagesOn the radio I was enjoying myself no end with all this when a listener texted in alleging that in France, budgie smugglers are mandatory! How I laughed! But it’s true. Jump into a public pool wearing shorts and you’ll be hauled right back out. Hygiene reasons, apparently. I’d have thought that shorts, allowing a bit more freedom and ventilation, would be healthier. But the logic is that you might have been in shorts all day before getting in the pool, whereas you’re unlikely, even in France, to have been a man about town in yourcontrebandiers de perruches.You may by now be wondering if my level of interest in all this is entirely healthy. Well, the truth is, I once had a hand in a budgie-smuggling operation – that is, the smuggling of an actual budgie. I’m not proud of it, but it’s time to come clean. In mitigation, this was in the 1970s and I was but a child. Auntie Lily and Uncle Sid, Lily being my grandad’s sister, had long lived in Perth, Australia. But now they decided to live out their days back in Birmingham. They brought with them a budgerigar called Timmy. Timmy was a most excellent budgie. He’d tilt his head in a sweet way when whistled to, say the odd word, and fly around the front room without crapping everywhere.They loved Timmy. We all loved Timmy. But Lily and Sid didn’t love life back in Birmingham, so resolved to return to Perth. Disastrously though, the rules were such thatTimmy wouldn’t be allowed back into Australia. Disaster. Lily – pardon the slight pun – hatched a plan. She’d smuggle Timmy back to Oz in her handbag. The Timmy training commenced. Day by day we accustomed him to ever longer periods of handbag time which, being a prince among budgies, he soon got the hang of. During the flight Lily planned to feed him and let him out for a quick flap when she went to the toilet.Departure day dawned. The jeopardy was very real. If, God forbid, they were rumbled and Timmy was to be confiscated, Lily even had with her something with which to euthanise him. Quite where she sourced this budgie poison, I know not. But off they went on a flight that still feels like the longest flight I’ve ever taken, even though I wasn’t on it. The wait was awful. Then a three-word telegram arrived: “All is well.” Oh, the joy. And the three of them lived happily ever after.I am now bracing myself for letters about some ghastly avian health calamity that subsequently came to pass down under, with the finger pointing at our Timmy as budgie zero. Please let it not be so. If it is, as my penance, I’ll wear nothing but budgie smugglers, in and out of the water, for the rest of my days.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I rarely put literal pen to paper any more and it seems my overreliance on a keyboard means I may have lost the ability to write legible cursive. I’m not alone: handwriting isdisappearing. It’s possible my kid willnever be taughtjoined-up writing at school. While typing is more efficient, studies suggest typing notes rather than writing may have a negative impact on thebrain’s ability to learn.A keyboard feels like stone age technology now; as AI becomes more embedded in our lives, what impact will that have on our brains? We’re still figuring that out. The people who make money from the tech keep telling us we need it, or we’ll fall behind. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, recently said if you don’t wear AI-powered smart glasses,you will find yourselfat a “significant cognitive disadvantage” in the near future. However, a recent study suggests an overreliance on ChatGPTcould harm critical thinkingabilities. And then, of course, there’s all the other collateral damage of AI – from its massiveenvironmental impactto its exploitation of underpaid creatives’ labour.Not everyone is keen on participating in this brave new world. Meet the “AI vegans”: people who have chosen to abstain from using AI for environmental, ethical and personal wellness reasons. Yes, “AI veganism” is a real phrase. No, I didn’t make it up. Although I rather wish I did, because it’s quite catchy, isn’t it? Side note: one of the most genius rebrands of all time was the way fake leather (which is often made from polyurethane, a type of plastic) suddenly became aspirational “vegan leather”.Will AI veganism catch on? Who knows. But, just like regular veganism, I’m sure its practitioners will tell you about it. And while it may be unrealistic to expect the masses to go digitally vegan, it’s not a bad idea for us all to be more cognisant of how much AI we consume and its impact on the planet. Perhaps any request to AI apps should be met with a digital calorie count first?Yes, I can generate a picture of a cat in a spaceship eating a taco, but my AI model mightguzzle a bottle of waterto do so and10times more energythan a Google search … do you really want that picture?Just some food for thought.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionVeganismcommentShareReuse this content"

We need a leader who will tell him where to shove itWed 6 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 08.19 EDTShareWho remembers the spate of “introduction videos” that emerged during the first Trump administration – a series of tongue-in-cheek clips about European countries to introduce them to Donald Trump? The viral video trend wassparked by the Dutch comedian Arjen Lubach, who endedhis segment on the Netherlandswith: “We totally understand it’s going to be America first, but can we just say the Netherlands second?” It seems that Europe’s leaders remember the videos all too well; that they internalised the caustic message a little bit too much.Afraid of rocking the boat during its trade negotiations with Trump, the EU decided to pre-emptively sink itself. Instead of strategic autonomy, it will spendhundreds of billionsof dollars on American weapons; in place of future climate goals, it will pour hundreds of billions into US natural gas; instead of a mutual tariff reduction, it will take a huge unilateral hit to EU exporters; instead of self-respect, humiliating prostration.The new trade “deal”announced byTrump and Ursula von der Leyen last month left a five-year-old’s worth of whys to ponder. Why does the EU, a colossus, think it is a mouse? Why is it content to merely nibble at the edges of power? Will it ever respect itself as much as China, which met Trump tariff for tariff until he backed off? Why don’t its politicians understand that voters want leaders who will defend them, and that, as for Canada’s Mark Carney and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there are actually electoral rewards to be reaped by doing so without reserve? Why, even after Brexit, do they ignore the lesson that these same voters prioritise identity and emotion over cold economic rationality?The EUcouldhave called Trump’s bluff; the problem is that, asEmmanuel Macron remarked, the EU isn’t “feared enough”. And yet, it has far more leverage than China does against the US economy. If deployed, the EU’santi-coercion instrumentwould enable it to flatly end the future manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors in the US by shutting off exports, turningTrump’s $500bn Stargate AI projectinto an intergalactic bridge to nowhere. It could obliterate long-term US tech dominance by taxing the Silicon Valley behemoths, blocking their market access and removing their intellectual property protections. It could severely disrupt Americans’ supply of Ozempic and Wegovy for good measure.Would this spiral? Undoubtedly – but as the weaker tech player, the EU arguably has less to lose and ultimately more to gain. Plus,Europeans hate Trumpand would probably unify in the face of a full-blown trade war, whereas Americans – half of whomalso hate Trump– would not.We tend to take the EU for granted, but there is anger brewing amid latent pride. The first European politician to tell Trump where to shove it – in a crude, unapologetic and very public way – is going to surf a wave of never-before-seen emotion and support.Is this far-fetched and unrealistic? Probably. Buteverythingabout Trump is far-fetched and unrealistic. Why are we willing to accept – expect, even – boundary-pushing, shocking behaviour from the US, but not from ourselves? Surrendering to Trump’s demands is the act of an entity that still believes the US is a wayward friend to appease, cajole and fear, all while the US under Trump sees and treats Europe as a weak, naive thing to manipulate and exploit. Well, congratulations, Europe proved it right – and all but ensured that Trump and his ilk will come back for a second round of ransom demands and threats. In fact, they already are, with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick,going after EU tech regulationsfollowing the deal.Europe might not like it, but the world has changed. In this new era, Russia, China and the US all want a return to spheres of influence and the rule of power in place of the rule of law, just with varying appetites for chaos (Russia) versus stability (China). Within this fuzzy picture, Trump is a genius at twisting emotion to his purposes, but he is also deeply ignorant, intellectually incoherent and follows mafioso-style instincts about how to wield the power he has, with the end result of undermining it more quickly.The EU is the only significant force left with a deep desire for a world that abides by the rule of law. That doesn’t mean it’s theonlyactor that wants this – it’s joined by the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and, especially when it comes to climate, a host of other nations potentially led by Brazil.For decades, though, Europe has been enthralled with the story the US spins. As a result, it’s now in thrall to an America spinning a dark story. That’s a bad place for Europe to be. Not just economically, but geopolitically, because its dependence on the US (and fear that Trump will drop Ukraine into the deep end) leaves it in a place of hypocrisy in relation to would-be global partners: unwilling to uphold international law against Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza all while rightly exhorting it in response to Vladimir Putin’s relentless bombing of civilians in Ukraine.There is an inflection point looming – or perhaps it has just arrived – where Europeans will have to ask themselves, what is the purpose of an EU for ever consigned to can-kicking half measures, choosing the lowest common denominator among its internal divisions, and repeated capitulation? The far-right nationalists have an answer: no real union at all, and a future of vassalage and endless bickering for the scraps of global irrelevance.What is the federalist answer? This is not just a nice intellectual exercise. I don’t want to live in a world where aggressors grab land when they want, where genocides go unchecked, where the climate crisis spins out of control and where far-right autocracy takes root.The answer has to be that the EU starts to actually believe in itself, rather than the narrative the US so deftly spins. That means an end to being enthralled by GDP per capita as a measure of prosperity. It means including the climate crisis as context in every economic discussion, for the same reason that a nutrition label that made no mention of sugar content would make no sense. Europe-based economic activity is amongthe least carbon-intensive in the world; the World Trade Organization is broken, so why not reorganise global trade – among the willing, and excluding the unwilling – around a price on carbon, using the EU’s existing emissions trading system as a starting point?It means removingthe far-right’s complaintthat countries “send” money to the EU by replacing national contributions with a common corporate tax rate for its members, along withwealth taxesandtaxes on big tech. It means getting over the internal allergy to spending internationally insignificant sums of money, because almost every sphere in which the EU feels inferior to the US boils down to a willingness to spend – or not. The EU is jealous of the US’s big tech firms, but there is no secret sauce here beyond investment. Take space for example, where, again, the US is dominant. How could it be anything other when Nasa’s2023 budget was $25bnand the European Space Agency’swas €7bn? Time instead to roll out a budget worthy of a true geopolitical power, and invest in long-term economic, environmental and political success.And finally, it means copying one thing from the Trump playbook: DGAF. Or, for the polite pages of the Guardian, “caring less”. As in, if a von der Leyen spokesperson is reading this, the next time you hold a press conference, you might shoot back at all the public criticism: “The European Commission president might not be a great negotiator, but at least she’s not a sexual predator or a convicted felon.”Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeUrsula von der LeyenDonald TrumpGlobal economyInternational tradeTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

But his medical details do not diminish his suffering, or that of other children in GazaWed 6 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 08.51 EDTShareBetween April and mid-July this year, more than 20,000 children inGazawere admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition, 3,000 of whom were severely malnourished, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global initiative whose members include UN agencies such as the World Health Organization, World Food Programme and Unicef, as well as NGOs and research institutes.Over this period, and in the weeks since, the Guardian has published many images of hungry children, among them at least 20 shown in an emaciated condition. (It does so working to an editorial code that gives special protection to children, publishing on matters that may intrude into their welfare only when there is a strong public interest to do so.) Butone photograph, which appeared on the homepage of the website on 23 July and on the front of the print edition the next day, prompted fierce controversy.The picture was powerful and pitiful: an 18-month-old boy, Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq, cradled in his mother’s arms; his bare back skeletal, his diaper a black plastic bag. This image, as well as others of the same child, were published widely by major news organisations.Freelance journalist and antisemitism campaigner David Collier accused the media that published the photos of doing so “to push a lie about famine”. He saida May 2025 medical report he had seen stated the boy had cerebral palsy. This was not the face of famine, Collier wrote in hisblogposton 27 July, but a child who “has needed specialist medical supplements since birth”.“What we can see from [unpublished] pictures is that both Mohammed’s mother and his older brother look healthy and are not suffering from any type of starvation that would be necessary to cause the thinness suffered by Mohammed,” he said.A reader who contacted me directly decried the image as “a fake”. Another said: “Definitely this poor child is suffering. But is it from starvation? It is from several medical conditions Muhammad was born with … You need to make sure your readers know the real ‘WHY’ behind this picture.”It seems unarguable that readers want to know the “real why” in whatever they are seeing. But its availability is not always as straightforward. War is chaotic and individual circumstances invariably complex.Foreign journalists are barred by Israel from entering Gaza, meaning they rely on local journalists, including photographers, working in difficult and dangerous conditions. The Guardian receives about 1,000 images a day from Gaza, provided by or via major picture agencies. The pictures of Muhammad came through Getty Images from the Turkish state-run Anadolu agency.In the wake of the accusations, Anadolu publishedan articlethat quoted Suzan Marouf, a doctor treating the boy at the Patient’s Friends hospital in Gaza City, saying doctors there had diagnosed him the previous month with “moderate malnutrition on top of congenital health problems, including brain complications and muscle atrophy” but that these issues were “not significantly affecting his weight” until the hospital’s nutritional supplements became depleted. Since then, he had developed severe malnutrition, she said.Separately, Anadolu distributed an image from Muhammad’s bedside showing a picture of him before he lost weight. Muhammad’s mother said he dropped from 9kg to 6kg in recent weeks.The Guardian was not aware until after it published the images (the first was in a picture gallery on 22 July) that the boy had other medical conditions. Should they have sought to ask? The relevant editors I have spoken to here each told me that seeing his wasted frame did not stand out as unusual; they had “consistently seen similar pictures for months”.In a hunger crisis, they point out, experts attest to how children and those with existing medical conditions are among thosemost at risk. According to the WHO, of the 63 malnutrition‑related deaths recorded in July, 24 were children under five. That is 38%, when under-fives make up around 15% of the total population of Gaza.Children with developmental disorders can have special nutritional needs. One paediatrician, speaking to me for background, said diagnosis was frequently challenging in settings without access to early identification tools, which meant that with cerebral palsy, for example, definitive diagnosis is sometimes not made until the age of two.Editors say reference to Muhammad’s existing health issues would have been included if known – and the picture captions have now been amended – but they consider that the images still stand, saying a sick child who is starving is “not any less deserving of our attention than any other child”, asprevious reportingfeaturing malnourished infants with underlying feeding conditions has demonstrated. In other words, the face of malnourishment is most often the face of the already vulnerable.For my part, I agree that the missing information was relevant to a fuller reading of the picture. But the Guardian has not, as some claim, relied on this image alone to illustrate reporting of what the IPC days later termed (though Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejects the assessment) an “unfolding” famine. And if we recognise that it is the most vulnerable who are most impacted by lack of food and health services, publication of this picture of real suffering did not, in my view, act to deceive.Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian’s global readers’ editorguardian.readers@theguardian.comThe subheading of this article was amended on 6 August 2025. An earlier version referred to the child having cerebral palsy; as the article indicates, this was a claim but not a diagnosis stated by doctors treating him in recent weeks in Gaza City.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I mean, apart from ants, obviously. With their long snouts and even longer sticky tongues, they trundle around, slurping up insects like milkshakes. They have handsome, bushy tails, which they wrap around themselves at night like a blanket. And they’re excellent parents. Giant anteater mothers allow their young to cling to their backs, rucksack-style, for periods of up to a year.Indeed, the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí was so taken with the giant anteater that he once took one for a walk through the streets of Paris. And before you ask, no, this wasn’t a cheese dream. There isphotographic evidence.As if that weren’t enough, a recent study published in the journalEvolutionhas found that mammals have evolved into anteaters not once, not twice, but 12times since the demise of the dinosaurs some 66m years ago. Anteaters, it seems, are a recurring trend. The finding prompted the study’s lead author, Thomas Vida from the University of Bonn, to tellSciencemagazine: “Things keep evolving into anteaters, somehow.” Which raises the question: will humans one day follow suit?By “things”, Vida means mammals, and by “anteaters” he includes the four species of anteater from Central and South America, the pangolins and aardvarks of Africa and Asia, and the echidnas of Australia. Different animals, on different continents, that all practise myrmecophagy, also known as the consumption of termites and ants. If you were a parent of young children, you’d call them fussy eaters. If you were an evolutionary biologist, however, you’d point out that they’re not being deliberately difficult. Instead, they have evolved to fill a very particular ecological niche.That niche is provided by the world’s extensive population of ants and termites, some 15,000 species, whose collective biomass is more than10 times greaterthan that ofallwild mammals. At least a dozen times in evolutionary history, mammals decided that if you can’t beat them, eat them, and began to consume the crunchy delicacy.Such an abundant food source can act as what biologists call a “selective pressure”. Characteristics that enabled animals to eat more ants and termites – and thus survive better – are more likely to be passed on. Over millions of years, animals from all three major groups of mammal life, including marsupials and the egg-laying monotremes, evolved to have long, sticky tongues, reduced or missing teeth and strong forelimbs for busting into insect nests.It’s a powerful example of convergent evolution, the phenomenon by which different species, in different places or times, independently evolve similar characteristics. Faced with the same problem – how do I eat these ants? – they all arrived at a similar solution. So, though they’re not closely related, they possess features that are superficially similar.Convergent evolution is how echolocation (the ability to determine the location of objects using reflected sound) evolved separately in bats and dolphins, camera-like eyes evolved in octopuses and vertebrates, and opposable digits evolved in primates, koalas and chameleons. Powered flight has evolved independently at least four times – in birds, bats, pterosaurs and insects – and venom production more than100 times, while crustaceans have evolved the classic, crab-like body planat least five times. Known ascarcinisation, it has spawnedcrabby memes aplenty.The evolutionary biologistSimon Conway Morrishas used convergent evolution to argue that evolution is both deterministic and predictable. Rewind the tape of life, play it over again and similar-looking lifeforms would evolve, he says.This means that in theory, with enough time (many tens of millions of years), the appearance and retention of the requisite genetic mutations and, critically, thesameselective pressures that shaped the emergence of former ant-eating animals, some mammals – including maybe us –couldevolve gummy mouths and sticky tongues. Forget the history books, it’s the cookery books that would be rewritten.Only there’s a fly in the ointment. We’re wrong to presume that because myrmecophagy has evolved multiple times, it is the pinnacle of some evolutionary tree. There are, after all, many more mammals that have not evolved into anteaters than have started breaking into termite mounds. The fact that convergent evolution occurs does not necessarily make it the default pathway.In addition, evolution has a way of pulling the rug. It canbe predictable, but it can also be quirky and erratic. In his 1989 book, Wonderful Life, another titan of evolutionary biology, Stephen Jay Gould, argued for the importance of random events. These can be anything from lightning strikes to asteroid impacts: any unforeseen occurrence that derails the prevailing trajectory of evolution and sends it along a different path. In other words, “sliding doors” moments that have been influencing evolution for as long as there has been life on Earth.So, just because things kept “evolving into anteaters” in the past, doesn’t mean that history will repeat itself. Which is a shame. Anteaters and aardvarks don’t typically eat all of the ants or termites in a nest, but leave some behind so the colony can rebuild itself. This makes them the epitome of sustainable living. If we can’t evolve into them, we can at least learn from them.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author of Bring Back the King: The New Science of De-Extinction and Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on EarthExplore more on these topicsEvolutionOpinionAnimalsBiologycommentShareReuse this content"

When things go wrong, official news ignores the setbacks. When problems cannot be downplayed, Mr Putin is portrayed as the wise corrector of errors made by underlings.Foreign perceptions of Mr Putin havebeen shapedby this image. It has been boosted online by Kremlin influence operations and embraced by nationalist politicians who admire the Russian president’s methods of domestic control and contempt for the rule of law.Until recently, Donald Trump was the most powerful figure in that category. The US president is no convert to democratic pluralism but he has become notably more suspicious of Russia and less effusive in his admiration for its president. He has threatened Moscow with tightened sanctions if there is not progress towards a ceasefire in Ukraine by the end of this week. Steve Witkoff, the White House special envoy, met Mr Putin on Wednesdayfor talks. The substance of the discussion was unclear.Uncertainty also shrouds the reasons for Mr Trump’sshifting stanceand its durability. June’s Nato summit appears to have been critical in nudging the president towards greater appreciation of the alliance and scepticism about Mr Putin’s claims to want peace.The presidential ego is also a factor. Mr Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the Ukraine war and imagined it could be done swiftly. His initial method was to sidelineand bullyVolodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, while offering sweeping territorial concessions to Russia. That was a disgraceful betrayal of an embattled democracy and a reward for unprovoked military aggression. It was a gift for the Russian president. Yet Mr Putin was not satisfied and instead intensified the onslaught.Mr Trump has no record of sympathy with Ukraine’s plight, but he is notoriously sensitive to a snub. Mr Putin embarrassed him by refusing to do a quick deal.The Russian president’s motives are also obscure. He may be betting on the US staying keen to secure a ceasefire on a land-for-peace basis, and so grabbing more land before White House patience runs out altogether. But he is also trapped by his own maximalist demands. He has senthundreds of thousands of young Russiansto their deaths on the grounds that the nation is locked in an existential struggle with the west. He has cast Ukraine as a rogue province to be reintegrated into the greater Russian motherland. He has geared the country’s economy for perpetual war. His image as a great military leader is in jeopardy if Mr Zelenskyy is still the president of a viable sovereign country when the guns fall silent.There seems no brilliant plan behind Mr Putin’s determination to continue a brutal war of attrition. He does it through inertia and paranoia. He appears afraid to end the fighting on terms that risk ordinary Russians fully grasping the horrific pointlessness of the whole bloody business.History will surely record Mr Putin’s conduct in Ukraine as the action of a delusional murderer. The myth of the Russian president as some kind of mastermind is just another weapon of propaganda. Its function is to project strength where there is weakness, and make victory seem inevitable when the facts of the war describe a litany of Kremlin failure.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Neither will tackle Britain’s pitifully low levels of business investmentWed 6 Aug 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 15.03 EDTShare“We are, it is admitted, the financial centre of the world,” said the chairman of the Union Bank of London in 1903. Back then, the City of London was the world’s banker, and its stock exchange was worth as much as the New York and Paris exchanges combined. Today, the stock market is shrinking at itsfastest ratesince 2010. While the mining company Glencore’srecent decisionto retain its London listing provided a temporary boost, it won’t stem the tide. Companies are increasinglyditching Londonand moving to Europe andthe US.Rachel Reeves hopes to revive the exchange by pushingstock ownership, encouraging people to become their own portfolio managers. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has itsown proposals, including tax breaks and looser bonus rules. Both of these plans are based on deregulation, and neither addresses the underlying problem: Britain’s ailing stock market is both a cause and consequence of stubbornly low business investment and a broken growth model.In theory, the stock exchange gives companies access to capital, which they invest in their businesses, making those more productive and causing the economy to grow. Pension funds and savers who buy their shares gain from this growth (as do workers, whose wages are supposed to go up as productivity rises). But the stock exchange isn’t providing enough access to capital, and listed companies aren’t investing to boost growth. British pension funds, once major buyers of UK equities, have retreated. Many have shifted to gilts, or headed to the US to take advantage of the tech boom. In 1997, UK pension schemesallocated 53% of their assetsto UK equities; today, that figure just is 6%.British businesses have grown more slowly. At the same time, their shareholders have pushed aggressively for dividend payments, producing a toxic spiral of stagnant growth and diminishing prosperity. Instead of boosting investment, this has redistributed wealth upwards. Dividend payments grewnearly six timesfaster than real wages between 2000 and 2019, and British companies now spend less on research and development than theirEuropean equivalents. The dividend yield isabout twice as highfor UK shares as it is for US stocks. The British economy excels at rentierism – less so at the investment that would boost productivity.Firms listed in Britain are consequently vulnerable to foreign and private equity takeovers, while successful companies are heading overseas to raise money. The British semiconductor firm Arm was worth £24bn when Japan’s Softbank bought it in 2016. Despitedesperate lobbyingfrom politicians, Arm couldn’t be persuaded to list its shares in London when it went public. Instead, the UK-based company listed on the US Nasdaq, and has since gained approximately £85bn in value, most of which accrued to investors overseas.The CBI wants Ms Reeves to coax pension funds into investing more in British businesses. An influx of pension capital would help, but it isn’t going to fix an economic model skewed towards wealth extraction. Public investment must form part of the solution. Government-backed regional banks could lend money to upstart companies outside London. Ms Reeves should also do more to force existing firms to invest in productive activities. Taxes onshare buybackswould be a good starting point. So too would mandating employee directors on company boards. But such proposals would require a sense of political imagination – something that the current government doesn’t seem to possess.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We deplore the repressive consequences that this ban has already had, and are especially concerned about the likely impact of Cooper’s ban on universities across the UK and beyond.We therefore applaud the growing campaign of collective defiance that aims to overturn the ban. We commend the courageous stand taken by Defend Our Juries, and the exemplary recent motionadopted by Derry City and Strabane district councilthat “supports all those who have protested the ban on Palestine Action and calls for charges against them to be immediately dropped”.Leading global scholars sign letter urging UK to end Palestine Action banRead moreIn alliance with thousands of trade unionists, teachers and students throughout the UK and abroad, we affirm our own solidarity with all those who are campaigning against the proscription. We fully share the aim of ending the flow of weapons from Britain to Israel and the belief that all participants in the pro-Palestine movement should be free to make our own decisions about how best to achieve that goal. We remind the UK government that its own most urgent priorities should already be determined by its binding obligation “to prevent and to punish” genocide.As the organisers of massive national demonstrations face prosecution, as hundreds of people again risk arrest by joining street protests on 9 August, and as students and teachers prepare for the start of another turbulent academic year, we express our full solidarity with those mobilising on their campuses or in their workplaces and communities to put an immediate stop to the escalating genocide and to end all UK complicity with

Alas, the same government that has authorised a massive expansion of Heathrow airport has also just pulled the plug oncompleting the electrificationof the Midland Main Line from London to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield.By my reckoning, this is the third time the scheme has been abandoned partway through. It will ensure that four diesel trains an hour will be plying the route for the foreseeable future, adding to air quality issues and consuming more fossil fuels.The overhead wiring for the electric trains currently ends in the middle of nowhere a few miles south of Leicester. New trains being built for the route are bi-mode – that is, equally capable of operating on diesel or electric power. It’s all a huge waste – and more proof that, when it comes to investing in the north, the money always runs out.Alan WhitehouseSilkstone Common, South YorkshirePolly Toynbee is correct to assert the advantages of rail versus flying, especially for domestic journeys. She does not mention the big drawback of the current UK rail system – unreliability. I live in Aberdeenshire and have family in Birmingham and London. I have given up on using the train to visit family because on many occasions my train has not reached its destination because of cancellations of connections or driver shortages. I now reluctantly fly to Birmingham and London from Aberdeen. I will return to rail (my preferred option) when I can be sure of reaching my destination.Dr Nick WilliamsAuchenblae, AberdeenshireLiving as I do adjacent to the flight path to Manchester airport, I would of course welcome any reduction in non-essential air travel. But more Eurostar journeys are of little relevance to anyone living outside the south-east because of the cost and time involved in getting to St Pancras. But here’s an idea. Now we have an integrated rail network, why not adapt the Interrail idea of allowing the cost of the journey to and from the home station to St Pancras to be covered by the standard Eurostar fare? That would incentivise the use of rail travel to Europe for all of those who currently fly because there is no practical alternative.Michael ReardonCheadle Hulme, Greater ManchesterPolly Toynbee is so right in her analysis of the case against theHeathrowthird runway. If our only hope of stopping them is Boris Johnson indeed lying down in front of those bulldozers, we are doomed.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, FifeInternational Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, is implying that the cost of a third runway at Heathrow will be so expensive that it can’t be done without public subsidy (Heathrow’s third runway ‘is going to be empty’ if it means high fees, says BA owner, 1 August). As air travel comes bottom in the hierarchy of sustainable transport to meet our climate obligations, and the last thing Londoners need is more plane noise and air pollution, I can’t think of a single reason for rescuing this venture, particularly as so many other parts of the UK are in urgent need of investment in better rail infrastructure.Jenny Rathbone MSSenedd member for Cardiff CentralHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But for the sake of all who take those calls, it must change course, 29 July), I am a still Samaritan, and spent several hours last Tuesday on the phone to some extremely distressed callers. I did that from what was formerly the front bedroom of a ramshackle Edwardian terrace house, which has room for just two workstations.The words “call centre” have been widely used to depict the charity’s proposed shift to larger, more modern branches. I wonder how many readers who work in comfortable, modern offices housing 20 (or even more) desks would consider themselves marooned in an inhuman “call centre” (or “regional hub” as Ormerod labels them)?Because Ormerod is no longer a Samaritan, he perhaps has not had access to the FAQs for volunteers, which note that nobody will be asked to work on their own. As many readers will experience daily, digital technology allows teams to work together when they are not in the same physical space.Change isreallyhard. I worked for the Guardian in the 2000s, when it moved from a poorly converted old factory building in Farringdon to brand-new premises in King’s Cross (“the middle of nowhere”, as it was labelled by some staff); from holding back news stories for the next day’s paper, to publishing them first on the website; from keeping the tech team separate from the editorial team, to having them work alongside each other; and from air-freighting copies of the paper to countries where fewer than 100 copies per day were sold, to not doing that.All these changes were stoutly resisted, particularly by some (not all) longer-serving staff. I wonder how many of these changes would strike today’s Guardian staff as destructive of the spirit of the enterprise?Tim BrooksGreat Bourton, OxfordshireHaving read the article by Peter Ormerod, I have to confess that I felt panic. Many many years ago when I was a single mum with a baby, few friends and no family, I called the Samaritans in the middle of the night. I was not suicidal, but I did feel as if I could no longer cope, that I was breaking apart. Bless the woman that answered my call; she chatted to me for quite some time, was at no point judgmental and gave me strength to go on. Many years later, I was unemployed, so I volunteered at my local Samaritans, went through their training and shadowed existing staff.There is no way that volunteers should be asked to work from home. There may be some nights when the only calls you get are from troubled individuals seeking self-gratification, but it is possible that the next call you take will be from someone about to cut short their life, or maybe no one speaks but you can hear in the background awful sounds of abuse. Once that call has finished, you need to be with someone who can empathise with you and help you put it from your mind so youdo not take it home with you. This cannot be done when working from home.Samaritans should not put volunteers’ own mental health at risk – it is hard enough as it is.Ilona NotleyNorwichI volunteered with the Samaritans for 12 years across two branches. I left on the day that I found myself getting too emotional about two consecutive calls. Up until then I had never left a branch with a call hanging over me. Any difficult call and you get to debrief with the other Samaritans on your shift. This was essential, talking to a real person, face to face over a cup of tea, in a private room.I met and chatted with Chad Varah, the Samaritans founder, in a dinner queue at a conference. He was impressed that I was a younger volunteer; I was impressed with the way he was still a slight irritant to the then “management”. His attitude that you should never put the phone down on callers – even sex callers – was correct. My fellow volunteer, Karen, said she had never put the phone down on anyone: she just treated them like any other caller in crisis and either they would put the phone down on her in frustration; or, as frequently happened, they turned into genuine callers – men (it was nearly always men) who were lonely, unloved, sad.I gave talks to a variety of organisations and schools about what we did. I was keen to encourage more transparency about the Samaritans (the thinking then was that you should not tell people you were a Samaritan in case a caller called up and got you, someone they recognised). This decision to close branches in favour of remote working is shortsighted. I think I should still be worried about the management even now. I’m sure Chad would be thinking the same.Colin KerriganHaslemere, SurreyI have volunteered for Citizens Advice for many years in several small offices at several different times in my life. I am retired now, have skills and experience to offer, would dearly like to use them again for Citizens Advice but the only options are to work in a large noisy impersonal phone hub or to take calls from home. Neither are possible for me – the former is too distant and too noisy and stressful, the latter is emotionally terrifying. So Citizens Advice has lost me. Samaritans will lose many like me if it follows its current plans.Cathy HillSheffieldExplore more on these topicsCharitiesMental healthVoluntary sectorWorking from homeVolunteeringlettersShareReuse this content"

Chelsea stayed relatively under the radar for much of the Club World Cup – in part because of their relatively kind route to the later stages – but theircommanding 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germainin the final means they are again regarded as a potentially dominant European force and perhaps even as contenders for the Premier League title.That is ifChelseaare ready – mentally, physically and tactically – for the new season. By the time Chelsea played the Club World Cup final on 13 July, nearly every other Premier League side had started their pre-season. Since then, while Liverpool, Arsenal and co have been hard at work, the players have had three weeks off and returned on Monday, with two friendly matches, two days apart, scheduled before their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on 17 August. To say Chelsea are playing catch-up is a severe understatement.That said, this is probably the most exciting period for Chelsea since the Champions League triumph in 2021. With the exception of goalkeeper and possibly centre-back, Enzo Maresca has a claim to having two elite players in every position and he could yet add further depth with Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho heavily linked. Departures will be needed to trim the fat and balance the books – Chelsea were givena €31m (£27m) fine last month by Uefa for breaking financial rules– but few would argue against them having the deepest squad in the league and one of Maresca’s biggest challenges will be maintaining harmony and continuity, on and off the pitch. Last season, the Conference League was a useful chance to rest and rotate players. The Champions League will not be so accommodating.Past five seasonsThe managerAs recently as April, Maresca was at odds with the Chelsea fans and appeared to blame a negative environment at Stamford Bridge fora 2-2 home draw with Ipswichthat left top-five hopes fading fast. But five wins from the final six league games secured fourth place, saving Chelsea’s season and possibly Maresca’s job. “They were saying that we are too young, we are not good enough,” he said. “Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong. So in English, how do you say? Eff-off to all of them.” Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph – and the tactical masterclass by Maresca in the final to neutralise PSG’s front three and create pockets of space for Cole Palmer – means he will get a very different reception at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s league opener.View image in fullscreenThe Chelsea head coach, Enzo Maresca, will be a more popular man when he returns to Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureChelsea’s much-maligned financial gymnastics of recent years – the eight-year contract amortisation (a loophole closed by Uefa), the sale of their hugely successful women’s team (to their own parent company) and their rampant use of multiclub ownership and the loan system – have infuriated rivals and allowed them to assemble one of the deepest, youngest, most talented squads around. In the Todd Boehly era, Chelsea have spent more than £1.5bn and the club face an additional €60m fine from Uefa if they fail to comply with regulations over the next four years. A bigger stadium would help, but what Chelsea do with Stamford Bridgeremains unclear; the 40,044-capacity ground is not easily developed given challenges ranging from the freehold to a nearby railway line. A move to Earl’s Court has been mooted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 18-year-old’s performances at the Club World Cup – includinga brilliant strike for Palmeiras against Chelseain the quarter-final – suggests that the summer arrival is already world class.Players swooned over the teenager at the final whistlein Philadelphia – “I told Estêvão: ‘We are excited for you to join’ but he didn’t understand a single word I said,” Palmer said after swapping shirts with the £52m signing. Capable off both wings or as a No 10, the slender Estêvão will want to impress the former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, now of Brazil, before the World Cup next summer.Stepping up“He potentially can be a top defender for this club,” Maresca said of Josh Acheampong after the defender’s performances at the Club World Cup prompted whispers that several clubs in England and Europewere tracking the teenager. How the 19-year-old fits into Maresca’s plans remains to be seen, but his versatility, 6ft 3in stature and composure enabled him to enjoy a breakthrough year with 13 first-team appearances. Naturally a right-back or a centre-back but capable of playing anywhere across the backline, Acheampong joined Chelsea as an under-eight and signed a new five-year contract in 2024. “The clubs that were mentioned, they like Josh, but we also like Josh,” Maresca said. “The best plan for Josh is to be with us.”A big season for …Roméo Lavia. The 21-year-old’s quality is not in question. Chelsea are a better side with Lavia, more fluid and press-resistant, and he wassensational in a 3-1 win against Liverpool in Maywhen he completed 100% of his passes. Maresca even moved Moisés Caicedo to right-back to accommodate Lavia alongside Enzo Fernández at the back end of last season, but concerns remain over the Belgian’s fitness. After a first year when he managed 32 minutes in 2023-24, another injury-hit campaign followed, starting 11 league games. Another year on the sidelines could spell trouble, particularly as Chelsea have Caicedo, Fernández, Dário Essugo, the impressive Andrey Santos and perhaps Reece James competing for two spots in defensive midfield in Maresca’s preferred 4-2-3-1 formation.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26ChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

You know that phrase: ‘The game’s gone’? I think the game is genuinely going away. It’s excluding traditional supporters and the communities that built the clubs in the first place.”Clarke has just celebrated his 30th birthday and is coming off the back of a big season. As one of the four season-ticket holders behind the MCFC Fans Foodbank Support, Clarke has been active among the Manchester City fanbase and in the community since the pandemic. With the growing concern over the pricing and provision of tickets at his club last year, he helped coordinate protests by fans whose rivalries go back generations, but whose problems are increasingly shared. Supporters of Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United and others joined City fans under the banner “Stop Exploiting Loyalty” and in doing so became part of a new wave of supporter activism.Sexism and misogyny drive record levels of abuse at football games last seasonRead more“I know there’s all these things about multi-club ownership, private and state ownership, playing games abroad, accusations of killing the soul of the game,” Clarke says. “But, really, what is the game? It’s the communities that go to it, it’s the communities that have made the clubs who they are, going back four, five, six generations till their very inception.“The wider football supporter community are only just now cottoning on that we have so much more in common and if we don’t stand together the game is going to be gone before we know it. That’s all we have to do and all we can do. We just need to really keep up that momentum.”It already seems there will be reason for fans to take a stand once more this season. It is not the first time they will have come together to demand change, but for those with clubs at the top of the pyramid there is a sense the ground is shifting and the needs of fans is becoming an afterthought, if not an outright problem.At the heart is a concern that clubs want to move away from having matches filled with season-ticket holders towards something more casual, and more lucrative. Imagine every Premier League fixture becoming more like an Oasis gig, for ever.“The problems are different at different levels of the game,” says Tom Greatrex, the new chair of the Football Supporters’ Association, who drove the Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. “In the Premier League, and at the top of the Championship, Stop Exploiting Loyalty has helped to bring to the fore a set of issues that have been developing over a period of time.“We are seeing that parts of clubs’ fanbases, which have traditionally been loyal and go home and away, are now almost expendable to not all, but many of the people that currently run a number of those clubs. It’s gone beyond exploitation to expendability.”View image in fullscreenFootball fans are increasingly ready to take a stand against their club.Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty ImagesFans are suffering rises in ticket prices, the lowering or ending of ticket concessions and initiatives that require season-ticket holders to attend a certain number of games each season or risk losing their place, as examples of this trend. According to Greatrex, the effects are being felt in some grounds.“The number of people who are there almost to experience something which they’re not necessarily part of has tipped into a significant proportion to the extent that it undermines the thing they’re going there to experience,” he says. “There is a real danger that in a short-term push for increased revenue from matchday tickets and associated spend that clubs are in danger of actually undermining the whole ‘product’ they’re so proud of.”One topic that crystallises the anxiety over expendability is that of matches being selected for TV. There will be more televised games than ever this season, with Sky showing a minimum 215 Premier League fixtures. With each televised match comes possible rescheduling and a potentially challenging (or even impossible) journey for fans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think there’s been enough focus on things that could be done to mitigate some of the frustration that comes from those changes.” The FSA has called for a 12-week notice period on fixture rearrangements, the provision of more “football special” trains and the extension of the £30 cap on away tickets into the EFL.The Premier League has committed to giving six weeks’ notice of fixture adjustments on all matches until January, but last month had to apologise after failing to meet its own deadline of announcing all September adjustments by 9 July.It is striking that the mood among fans is so febrile at the time the government has passed legislation designed, in part, to give supporters more influence over their clubs. Fan consultation is a central requirement of the new Independent Football Regulator for the English men’s elite game and legislation is, in part, the result of long-term campaigning by the FSA.It is not a panacea and its influence is unlikely to take hold for some seasons yet, but Greatrex, a former Labour MP, believes it can form a platform for better understanding between fans, clubs and competitions. “More than ever, there is an appreciation – among some, it’s reluctant, but among others, it’s embraced – thatsupporters have a legitimate voicethat deserves to be heard and their views to be considered,” he says.“[The regulator] is actually the basis for a much more constructive approach, which means that if clubs are sensible you can prevent a lot of the flashpoints getting to the point at which they become high profile, because you’ve dealt with it sensibly ahead of that time.”Clarke would much rather have dialogue than protest. “I don’t want to be doing another protest all my life,” he says. “I know there’s no easy answers but a lot of this protest energy has come because people feel they’re not being listened to. That’s where the anger comes from.”Explore more on these topicsFootballFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On an evening when Viktor Gyökeres was meant to announce himself as the solution to all of Mikel Arteta’s problems, instead it was a figure from Arsenal’s past who stole the show.At £72m – £8m more than they may end up paying for the Sweden striker – Nicolas Pépé was an expensive Arsenal signing, a few months before Arteta replaced Unai Emery in 2019. Most of the fans who packed out the Emirates Stadium for this pre-season friendly will not have many fond memories of the Ivory Coast international’s spell in north London, but he clearly had a point to prove here.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 1: ArsenalRead morePépé’s early goal and strikes from Karl Etta Eyong and the former Tottenham loanee Arnaut Danjuma sealed an impressive win forVillarreal, and left Arteta with plenty of questions to resolve before Arsenal’s opening game of the season next weekend against Manchester United.Gyökeres, who is the headline act of a spending spreethat could exceed £200m, looked short of match fitness as he toiled up front for 62 minutes. Only the introduction of the 15‑year‑old Max Dowman for his first senior appearance at the Emirates Stadium could lift the mood as he won a penalty that allowed Martin Ødegaard to make the scoreline more respectable. But there were more reasons to be fearful for Arsenal’s fans as they aim to improve on finishing as Premier League runners-up for a third successive season.There had been a sense of anticipation in the late summer air as they queued patiently at the club shop before kick‑off, with several already sporting Gyökeres’s new replica No 14 shirt. Having made his debut last week as a substitute against Spurs in their 1-0 defeat in Hong Kong, the Sweden striker is still playing catch‑up having stayed away from pre-season with Sporting as he attempted to force through his move. But he was included in a strong starting lineup, with Ethan Nwaneri deputising for Ødegaard alongside the new signing Christian Nørgaard and Mikel Merino in midfield.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta (centre, in black) watches the penalty shootout against Villarreal.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe match programme featured pictures of all six of Arsenal’s summer arrivals on the cover, with Martín Zubimendi, Cristhian Mosquera, Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga on the bench. Arteta used his programme notes to express his belief they “will add quality and depth to the squad, which is what we are going to need throughout the season”.Arteta added: “We know what our targets are and what we want to achieve this season – there is a big belief in our ability to achieve that. We have been very, very close the last few seasons and the whole team is going to determine whether we achieve that or not.”It was Nwaneri, who has signed a new contract this summer, who caught the eye early on. A cross from Merino that was meant for the forehead of Gyökeres instead found Bukayo Saka at the back post and he could not direct the ball on target. But with only Gabriel Magalhães missing from his first-choice back four, Arteta will be concerned with how easily Villarreal established a 2-0 lead.Thomas Partey close to joining Villarreal in week of court appearanceRead morePépé, who joined Villarreal last year on a free transfer and is set to be joined by the former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey after he agreed an initial one-year deal, was unlucky when his shot came back off the post before he eventually forced the ball past David Raya when Arsenal failed to clear. The Spaniard was left fuming with his defence when Etta Eyong doubled the Spanish side’s lead just after the half-hour, although Nørgaard immediately pulled one back from a corner.Like last season when they struggled from a lack of creativity, that seemed to be Arsenal’s best chance of scoring as Gyökeres was forced to live off scraps before the break. Mosquera and Zubimendi were summoned for the second half and there was an immediate improvement. Gyökeres finally had a sight of goal when played in by Merino but his shot was well saved by Luiz Júnior.It needed Dowman, who has been hailed as a “special talent” by Arteta despite his tender years, to save some face after Danjuma had raced clear to make it 3-1, although Madueke missed the decisive penalty in a post‑match shootout.“Max is moving so fast – even last year when he was training with us, he was doing these kind of things and now he is doing them in the games,” Arteta said. “The efficiency he shows in every attacking action is incredible and he deserves more chances.”On Gyökeres, Arteta said: “Every day in training he is getting a really good feeling and connection with all the other players who are going to help him. He hasn’t trained for a team for two months and, on Saturday, he will take another step and be in a very good position.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalVillarrealfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when Partey was playing for Arsenal.Ex-Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey in court on rape and sexual assault chargesRead morePartey was granted conditional bail on Tuesday and the chief magistrate said he understood that the 32‑year‑old would soon be moving to Spain. Villarreal have agreed to sign the Ghana international on a one-year contract with an option to extend by 12 months.Rahul Lakhani, a football journalist and La Liga expert behind theLa Liga London account, said: “It’s rocked the community. I’ve had people in my social media responding quite aggressively to me, saying he’s innocent until he’s proven guilty. But the overarching reaction is that Villarreal fans don’t want their names associated with him.”On social media scores of fans have voiced their opposition to the move, using a hashtag that translates to “No to Thomas Partey”. Others have passed around contact details for the club’s official channels, urging people to complain.As Arsenal gear up to host Villarreal in a friendly on Wednesday, Lakhani described Partey’s potential signing as a stain on Villarreal, a club deeply intertwined with its home town of 52,000. “They’re seen as someone who isn’t like Real Madrid or Barcelona or the [Premier League’s] Big Six,” he said. “They’re the antithesis of that. They’re a club that has helped their community a lot, they’re seen as a family-run club.”Partey’s arrival would probably alter this image, Lakhani said. “Their name is now going to be associated with wanting to sign someone who has five [rape] charges over his head, rather than being known as a club that plays good football or punches above their weight.”More than 800 people have signeda petitionthat describes the move as a “slap in the face” to the club’s supporters and “all victims of sexual abuse worldwide”. The petition was launched by the online content hub Villarreal Report, which said this week that the signing would be “an act of pure betrayal of the highest order” against the club’s supporters and Villarreal’s values. “The darkest day in the club’s history is drawing closer by the second,” it said on social media.Villarreal did not respond to a request for comment.As Partey’s contract with Arsenal neared its expiry date, the club confirmed they were in talks over a new contract. After they failed to agree a new deal, it emerged that Partey, who has played for Atlético Madrid, Mallorca and Almería, was heading to Spain. He was charged not long after he left Arsenal, after an investigation that began in 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because in the end, the team may improve in the short term. But in the long term, this will do a lot of damage to our image.”Explore more on these topicsVillarrealLa LigaEuropean club footballArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The 100-ball format is enshrined in the England and Wales Cricket Board’s domestic TV contracts with Sky Sports and the BBC until 2028 but the Guardian has learned that both broadcasters are open to switching to T20 next summer if requested by the newly formed Hundred board, which will be dominated by representatives ofthe eight franchises.TheECBfirst explored dropping the Hundred in favour of the global-standard T20 format two years ago in informal discussions, which drew a lukewarm response from Sky in particular. The broadcaster has invested heavily in marketing the Hundred, which has succeeded in attracting more diverse crowds to grounds and has a younger TV audience than other forms of cricket on the network, while the BBC also likes the format as it is easier to fit shorter matches into its schedules.The Hundred returns with star names, tech titans and an intruder who thrilled Lord’sRead moreThe sale of, in most cases, minority stakes in the eight franchises for £520m this year has altered the power dynamics, however, with the new co-owners expected to have a huge influence over the future of the competition given the collective size of their investment. Four of the joint owners are Indian Premier League franchises, two are Indian‑American consortiums, and two are US investment companies.Formal discussions will not take place until the Hundred board meets for the first time in October, but the issue of format is expected to feature prominently. The 20-strong board will be made up of four representatives from the ECB and two each from the eight host venues and new investors, which in effect puts the franchises in control.A source at one franchise said the IPL owners in particular want to switch to T20 to align with the other franchise leagues where they operate teams in India, South Africa, the US and the United Arab Emirates. The T20 format will also be used in the Olympics when cricket returns after 132 years at Los Angeles 2038, which is particularly significant given India are bidding to host the Games in 2036.The Hundred this summeris in effect a transitional tournament before the new owners formally come on board on 1 October, when the sales of Oval Invincibles and Trent Rockets are due to be completed.While Sky and the BBC have resisted ditching the Hundred until this point, there is a growing feeling that it would be better to relaunch the competition with a bang next year rather than make a series of incremental changes. There will be other significant innovations next year, including new team names at some franchises, new commercial deals and a fresh digital strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her first ever professional tennis match took place next door to a Rolling Stones concert. Now, 31 years later, at 45 years old, Williams is still here.Three weeks after returning to professional tennis for the first time in 16 months with a straight sets singles victory over the then world No 35 Peyton Stearns at the Citi Open in Washington, which marked her as the second-oldest woman in history to win a WTA Tour-level singles match and also silenced criticisms about her enduring presence on the tour, Williams now takes her comeback to the Cincinnati Open.Emma Raducanu adds Rafael Nadal’s former coach Francisco Roig to her teamRead moreOnce one of the most precocious youngsters of her time, a US Open finalist by the age of 17, Williams continues to compete. She is one of the greatest tennis players of all time in her own right, a seven-time singles grand slam champion, Olympic gold medallist and former No 1 in singles. Despite all she has achieved, her enduring love for her sport means she continues to step on the practice court every day with the aim of being the best player she can be.“Love is the key, right?” says Williams. “If you don’t love it, then get out of it. If you can, if you have that luxury, not everyone has that luxury. For me, I think a lot of the motivation for me is just to come back and try to play in the best health that I can.“I never stopped hitting the ball, even when I was away, not as intensely as you would if you were playing tournaments, but I was still going out there. And I think that at the end of the day, you have to live your life on your own terms. Your terms should be yours. Doesn’t matter what anyone else says or what anyone else thinks, if you get to live life on your own terms of life, [do] that. And I firmly believe in that.”This comeback, however, is not merely about striking a tennis ball. Last month, Williams revealed she has suffered with fibroids for years, non-cancerous tumours that develop in and around the uterus, which left her with excruciating symptoms including pelvic pain and heavy bleeding. In addition to the significant impact fibroids has had on Williams’ everyday life, it also affected her tennis career. She says she had been misdiagnosed for years.Last week, in the aftermath of her returning in Washington, Williams posted a series of videos from exactly a year ago when she was undergoing an open myomectomy surgery to remove the fibroids and a large focal adenomyoma in her uterus, tissue from the lining of the uterus that had grown in her uterine wall.View image in fullscreenVenus Williams spoke about her health issues and desire to compete before the Cincinnati Open.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty Images“I was told I was inoperable,” she wrote. “I was told I could bleed to death on the table. I was told to get a surrogate and forget the hope to carry my own children. I was misdiagnosed. I went untreated for years and years and years.”As she has returned to the court, Williams has used the publicity around her return to shine a light on women’s medical issues. “I just remember after my surgery, I was feeling so much gratitude but I was able to have the resources to finally get through that, and I remember that was the biggest feeling that I had. And at that point, I was nowhere near playing professional tennis, but now a year later, I’m in a completely different space, and I have a clean bill of health, thank God, and I’m ready to play and compete.”The next competitive challenge for Williams will be the 22-year-old world No 51 Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro. On the day Bouzas Maneiro was born, 24 September 2002, Williams had already won four grand slam singles titles, reached No 1 and contested the previous three consecutive major finals against her younger sister, Serena.The elder Williams sibling said the US swing was the focus for her return and she is unlikely to compete after the US Open. The rest is unknown. “I’m very much in the moment,” she said. “I don’t think you should ever rule me out. That’s all I can say.”Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The rest of the first-team squad had been put through their paces by Howe as they reconvened for the first time since stepping off atheir near 15-hour flight from Seoul shortly after 8am on Monday.Transfer trouble and boardroom bother: vexed Newcastle face a puzzled future | Louise TaylorRead moreIsak was absent from the pre-season tripto Singapore and South Korea as the Sweden forward attempted to force through a transfer to Liverpool. Although the club claimed that a minor thigh strain had prevented him boarding the private charter plane to south-east Asia, scans indicated no evidence of injury.Rather than train and/or receive treatment at Newcastle, Isak flew to northern Spain and his former club Real Sociedad, where he trained alone for much of last week. Howe said he learned of this expedition through the media and before leaving Seoul he said players exhibiting “poor behaviour” could forfeit the right to train with his squad.“You have to earn the right to train with us,” he said. “We’reNewcastle United. Players have a responsibility to be part of a team and a squad. No player can expect to act poorly and train with the group. You have to act in the right way.”View image in fullscreenA Liverpool fan shows shows his support for signing Alexander Isak, at a pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao this month.Photograph: Phil Bryan/ShutterstockLiverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak rejected, but Newcastle believe they will return with a higher offer once a suitable replacement has been found. That quest has proved frustrating, with their latest target, RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko,poised to join Manchester United.Isak was due to meet Howe at the training ground for talks on Wednesday, when his thigh was also scheduled to be inspected by the medical team.Regardless of whether he is reintegrated into first-team training, Isak seems unlikely to be involved in the Sela Cup at St James’ Park, where Newcastle face two La Liga sides, Espanyol on Friday night and Atlético Madrid on Saturday afternoon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be interesting to see,” said Nasser Majali, secretary general of the ISSA, who was speaking in London on Wednesday. “It depends on the appetite, it depends on what we are able to do based on sustainability. But having good quality sports competitions is always welcome.”Access to the event this year is limited to the 57 countries that make up the ISSA and which, in turn, are members of political grouping the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation. The ISSA includes countries from four continents and states with religiously diverse populations. Current members include Albania, Nigeria and the Caribbean state of Guyana, where muslims make up roughly 7% of the population, comparable to the 6.5% of population in England and Wales.Majali observed that athletes at the Islamic Solidarity Games could themselves belong to any religion or none. “The first Jordanian to win a gold medal at the 2017 games was a Christian, a spectacular swimmer,” he said. Majali added that while it was “currently” the case that the games were open only to ISSA members, “you don’t know how [participation] can be done in the future”.The Solidarity Games will be the first significant staging post on Saudi Arabia’s journey towards the 2034 World Cup and a possible Olympic bid. It will once again put an international spotlight on the Saudi capital of Riyadh, increasingly a magnet for major sporting events. The Games will see an athletes’ village built in the country for the first time and could feature events held outside stadia and in public spaces, as at the Paris Olympics last year.Majali, a former secretary general of the Jordanian Olympic Committee, said that the Saudi capital is now a “major” sporting destination. “You’ve got excellent quality competitions happening all the time there,” he said. “It’s become second nature to deliver such events and the quality is spectacular. From my point of view, it is a destination for sports events. And a major one at that.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 6 Aug 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.49 EDTShareJEFF’S COMING, YO!You come at the Stelling you’d best not miss, as the famous quote from The Wire’s Omar Little kind of goes. Feared by his enemies and loved by viewers, the scar-faced stick-up man’s advice suggests that anyone attempting to challenge the established order should be prepared for unpleasant consequences if their plan backfires. It is a lesson Hartlepool United owner Raj Singh is currently learning the hard way after sending a letter to each of Hartlepool’s fellow National League clubsasking them to ban Jeff Stelling– the TalkSport and former Soccer Saturday host, and national treasure – from their boardrooms and hospitality suites for the season ahead. In scenes that his chum Chris Kamara would almost certainly describe as “Unbelievable, Jeff!” (unless they in some way involved an Anthony Vanden Borre red card at Fratton Park), Stelling resigned from his role as president of Hartlepool in May, in protest at Singh’s handling of negotiations over the protracted non-sale of his beloved hometown club.Apparently still fuming over Stelling’s decision to step down from an honorary role in which he wielded the same amount of power as your average regimental goat, Singh recently embarked on a letter-writing campaign to call upon his fellow owners to deny Stelling any of the myriad lavish trappings of hospitality associated with cash-strapped non-league clubs when he travels to Hartlepool away games. Having initially made it clear that Jeff was not to be considered for any freebies specifically designated for club officials, Singh added: “In the unlikely event that Mr Stelling independently attends any Hartlepool fixture at your home ground, I’d further request that you consider to seat Mr Stelling separately to any HUFC dignitaries or staff.” And while nobody is denying Hartlepool has its dignitaries, it seems actual dignity is currently at a premium in their corridors of power.Football Daily doesn’t claim to be familiar with the nitty-gritty of the beef, but what we can say for sure is that we hope Stelling has another one of his charity walks teed up, so that he’ll be able to march off the excess blubber he’s certain to put on after National League clubs the length and breadth of the country fall over each other to defy what looks like a petty and sly act of vindictiveness. In calling for Stelling to be denied hospitality, Hartlepool’s owner has almost certainly guaranteed that the universally popular broadcaster will be subjected to the kind of extreme levels of corporate largesse unlikely to be witnessed in the fifth tier ever again unless Manchester City end up playing in it after the verdict on those 100-plus charges is finally announced.“I’m a lifelong supporter of that football club and if it came down to the fact that I travelled and stood with the Poolies, the Hartlepool supporters, wherever they are, then that’s fine,” a slightly baffled Jeff told his radio audience. “I’d already bought my ticket – we’re away to Yeovil on Saturday – to be with the fans, so I didn’t get the issue or why Mr Singh wanted to raise it. The other thing that I took offence to was in the statement he says in theunlikelyevent that I attend games independently. Well, I mean, last season I went to Aldershot, Eastleigh, Solihull, Southend, Sutton, Wealdstone, Woking, Dagenham and Redbridge, Ebbsfleet, Maidenhead and a few others as well, so, it’s not so unlikely that I’ll attend. I’ll be at Yeovil on Saturday and I’ll tell you what, I’ll say it right now – if Mr Singh is there, I’ll be happy to meet him and have a chat with him.” Meet him? If the Yeovil Town hierarchy have anything at all about them, Jeff will be sitting right beside the man he says he hasn’t seen in at least a year. It certainly sounds like it’s time for either a long overdue catch-up or 90 minutes of awkward silence.QUOTE OF THE DAYI’ve done one live performance which felt a bit weird – there was a live band playing the drums and I had to literally use it as an instrument, which felt crazy, but I enjoyed it.

But other legal scholars argue that it isunclear what precise violation Bolsonaro committed, noting that he was not explicitly banned from speaking at public events.In response to Moraes’s latest ruling, politicians aligned with Bolsonaro have blocked congressional proceedings, demanding that lawmakers vote to impeach the supreme court justice and grant amnesty to the hundreds accused of involvement in the alleged coup attempt – including the ransacking of Brasília on 8 January 2023.The case against the 70-year-old politician is at an advanced stage and a verdict is expected as early as next month, with Bolsonaro facing a potential sentence of more than 40 years in prison.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But scientists called the work a milestone that put the illness on an equal footing with other debilitating diseases and opened potential avenues for treatments.“This really adds validity and credibility for people with ME,” said Sonya Chowdhury, chief executive of Action for ME and a DecodeME co-investigator. “We know that many people have experienced comments like ‘ME is not real’. They’ve been to doctors and they’ve been disbelieved or told that it’s not a real illness.”Despite its long history, scientists understand very little about the causes of ME/CFS, though most patients report an infection before symptoms first appear. Typical symptoms include extreme tiredness, sleep problems, brain fog and a worsening of symptoms after physical or mental activities, known as post-exertional malaise, which can take weeks to recover from.It is estimated that 67 million people are affected by ME/CFS at an annual cost to the global economy of tens of billions of pounds. In the UK, the annual economic toll is calculated atmore than £3bn. There is no test or cure for the illness.The DecodeME study, a collaboration between Edinburgh University, ME charities and patients, was launched in 2022 to explore whether genes play a role in who develops ME/CFS. For the latest work, researchers analysed 15,579 DNA samples from 27,000 people with ME/CFS and more than 250,000 people without the illness.The eight genetic regions that stood out in people with ME/CFS contain genes involved in immune defences and the nervous system. It will take more work to unpick the biology, but some gene variants may make people more vulnerable to ME/CFS by compromising their ability to fight bacterial and viral infections. Another genetic difference seen in ME/CFS is known from people with chronic pain, a symptom that many with ME/CFS also experience. “Overall, what is happening here is the genetics align with how people with ME have described their illness,” Ponting said.Andy Devereux-Cooke, a DecodeMe co-investigator, said the findings would be huge for patients. “The vast majority of the patient population essentially has been abandoned in one way or another, by families, the government, the medical system,” he said. “This will be huge for the patient population. Even though it does not provide all the answers [and] it does not provide practical assistance, it is a welcome drop in the ocean towards turning the tide.”Among the many questions that remain is why ME/CFS affects far more women than men. Diagnoses are four times more common in women, but the study found no genetic explanation. Another question is whether long Covid overlaps with ME/CFS. While many symptoms are similar, the researchers found no genetic link between the two. “One of the key things we’re doing is enabling others to use their different approaches to ask and answer the same question,” said Ponting.Prof Anne McArdle, who studies ME/CFS at the University of Liverpool, said the results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, provided “a solid basis” for future work that would hopefully help accelerate the development of a treatment for the devastating illness.Dr Beata Godlewska, who studies ME/CFS at the University of Oxford, recently used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to scan the brains of people with ME/CFS and long Covid. Those with ME/CFS but not long Covidhad high levels of lactate in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that integrates information about effort and emotion. This points to disrupted energy metabolism in the brain, and impaired mitochondria, the battery-like structures that provide energy inside cells.Godlewska said “It’s a very sad fact that people with ME/CFS are still disbelieved and the disease has been so neglected, especially when it comes to research funding. Hopefully this study will come with a benefit of both fighting the stigma, and convincing research funders that this is a truly biological condition.”Explore more on these topicsME / Chronic fatigue syndromeUniversity of EdinburghHealthGeneticsBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

As part of an international endangered species programme that coordinates efforts for the lions’ survival in captivity, the cubs will be sent to other participating parks, including the Midbarium zoo in Israel.There is a chance that may not be the end of the story. The deputy director of Dvůr Králové, Jaroslav Hyjánek, said preliminary steps had been taken to possibly reintroduce the Barbary lion into its natural habitat – but that was still in the “far distant future”.View image in fullscreenOne of the four cubs plays with its parents at the Dvůr Králové safari park.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APThe Barbary lion, a majestic member of the northern lion subspecies, once roamed freely in its native north Africa, including the Atlas mountains.A symbol of strength, the Barbary lion was almost wiped out by humans. Many were killed by gladiators in Roman times, while overhunting and the loss of habitat contributed to their later near extinction.View image in fullscreenThe parents, Bart and Khalila, rest in their enclosure.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APThe last known photo of a wild lion was taken in 1925. It is believed the last small populations went extinct in the wild in the mid-1960s. Fewer than 200 Barbary lions are now estimated to live in captivity.Hyjánek said that after initial talks with Moroccan authorities, who have not rejected the idea of the lions’ reintroduction, a conference of experts has been planned in Morocco for later this year or early 2026 to decide whether to go ahead with such a scheme in one of the national parks in the Atlas mountains.View image in fullscreenThree of the four cubs at play.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APAny reintroduction would face bureaucratic and other obstacles. As the lions have not been present in the environment for so long, the plans would have to ensure the animals’ protection, a sufficient prey population, and cooperation and approval from local communities.Hyjánek said reintroduction was still worth trying if it turned out to be sustainable. “It’s important to have such a vision for any animal,” he said. “Without it, the existence of zoos wouldn’t make sense.”Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesCzech RepublicZoosAnimalsConservationWildlifeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But the environmental and human health effects of this widespread contamination of the biosphere are not widely appreciated, in spite of a growing body of evidence linking chemical toxicity with effects ranging from ADHD to infertility to cancer.“I suppose that’s the biggest surprise for some people,” Harry Macpherson, senior climate associate at Deep Science Ventures (DSV), which carried outthe research, told the Guardian.“Maybe people think that when you walk down the street breathing the air; you drink your water, you eat your food; you use your personal care products, your shampoo, cleaning products for your house, the furniture in your house; a lot of people assume that there’s really great knowledge and huge due diligence on the chemical safety of these things. But it really isn’t the case.”Over eight months, as part of a project funded by the Grantham Foundation, Macpherson and colleagues spoke to dozens of researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, and analysed hundreds of scientific papers.According to the DSV report, more than 3,600 synthetic chemicals from food contact materials – the materials that are used in food preparation and packaging – alone are found in human bodies, 80 of which are of significant concern. Pfas “forever chemicals”, for example, have been found in nearly all humans tested, and are now so ubiquitous that in many locations even rainwater contains levels regarded as unsafe to drink. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global population breathes air that breaches World Health Organization (WHO) pollution guidelines.When these chemicals contaminate our bodies, the results can be disastrous. The report found there were correlational or causal data linking widely used chemicals with threats to human reproductive, immune, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney and metabolic systems.“One of the main things that came out quite strongly was links between pesticide exposure and reproductive issues,” said Macpherson. “We saw quite strong links – correlation and causation – for miscarriage and people basically struggling to conceive.”The DSV research adds to previousfindings by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Researchthat we have already far exceeded the safe planetary boundary for environmental pollutants, including plastics. On Sunday, another report warned that theworld faces a “plastics crisis”, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age amid a huge acceleration of plastic production.The report also highlights critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research and testing methods, exposing the ways in which existing checks and balances are failing to protect human and planetary health.“The way that we’ve generally done the testing has meant that we’ve missed a lot of effects,” Macpherson said. He singled out the assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are substances that interfere with hormones, causing problems ranging from infertility to cancer. These have been found to confound the traditional assumption that lower doses will invariably have lesser effects.“One of the things is that when you have a chemical which is interfering with the endocrine system, it sometimes has a nonlinear response. So you’ll see that there’ll be a response at a very low dose, which you wouldn’t be able to predict from its behaviour at a high dose.”DSV describes itself as a “venture creator” that spins out companies aimed at tackling big problems in environmental and human health issues. Part of the purpose of the report is to identify problem areas that can be tackled by innovation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He cooks with a cast-iron skillet. He especially avoids heating food in plastic.“Unfortunately, it is a recommendation to eat more organic food, but it is more expensive in general. So at least washing fruit and vegetables before eating them, but organic if you can afford it.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentPollutionPackagingPlasticsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs by José CíceroWed 6 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 08.29 EDTShareThough 60 miles (100km) apart, the Brazilian municipalities of Presidente Kennedy in Espírito Santo state and Campos dos Goytacazes in Rio de Janeiro state have one big thing in common: oil. Since late in the last century, their public funds have been bolstered by billions in royalties fromoil finds in the offshore Campos Basin.Yet despite having significantly more resources than other towns and cities inBrazil, both still face problems such as poor sanitation and healthcare, inadequate social housing and state education as well as corruption scandals.View image in fullscreenDespite Presidente Kennedy receiving record amounts of oil revenues per capita, the town still suffers form poor infrastructure.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaThe Brazilian government’s resolve to continue to explore for oil – in June, it announced it wouldauction a series of oil and gas exploration blocks, including 19 of 47 areas near themouth of the Amazon River– echoes adecades-old Brazilian promisethat oil exploration would benefit its people, despite evidence that it has not always resulted in gains for much of the population.A map showing th eocation of Presidente Kennedy and Campos dos GoytacazesAnalysis based on Candido Mendes University (Ucam)’s InfoRoyalties, a database of Brazilian oil revenues, reveals that most of the 15 municipalities with the highest oil revenues per capita between 1999 and 2024 have mediocre social and economic indicators, often ranking among the worst in their regions.Adjusted for inflation, these municipalities collectively received nearly 150bn reais (£20bn) over the five years, or about R$95,000 for each resident.View image in fullscreenOne resident of Presidente Kennedy says: ‘Many say our people could be among the wealthiest, and I agree, given the royalties it receives.’Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaAlthough royalties have enabled local councils to fund infrastructure projects and welfare programmes, they have not significantly reduced poverty. Nearly one in four people in these municipalities live below the poverty line, with a family income per head of less than 218 reais (£29).Our people could be among the wealthiest … the city should be a showpiece but instead it remains a city of miseryFélix de Jesus, farmerIn 2023, six of these 15 municipalities are ranked lowest in their states based on the Brazilian federal government’sBasic Education Development Indexfor early primary education, while only four are top performers in later years.More than half of the municipalities have rates of preventable deaths and infant mortality (ie of children aged less than one year)that are only average or worse for their states.Lia Hasenclever, a researcher at Ucam, says the oil revenues have had little positive impact on key socioeconomic development indicators. “Municipalities which do not receive royalties perform better in health and education than those that do,” she says. “Oil has an economic impact but no social impact.”The small town of Presidente Kennedy holds the record for Brazil’s highest oil revenue per person. Between 1999 and 2024, the municipality received 5.7bn reais in royalties – or nearly R$390,000 for each of its 14,600 or so residents.View image in fullscreenCampos dos Goytacazes had oil revenues averaging $1bn a year from 2019 to 2024 but still has abandoned health facilities around the city.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaThe oil boom provided “luxuries” that are rare in other municipalities of similar size and many public facilities were upgraded.But everyday problems persist. Despite investments in health facilities, including the local hospital, residents are frustrated by the lack of provision for more complex medical care and complain about medicine shortages at health centres.“If you need an MRI, ultrasound or to see a specialist, you have to go to other municipalities,” says one Presidente Kennedy resident who preferred not to be named. Pregnant women are sometimes forced to travel up to an hour to reach a birth centre or maternity ward, they add.In the Marobá Beach area of Presidente Kennedy, basic sanitation is lacking and residents rely on bottled water. “The water here was very poor, sometimes tasting like iron. Now it’s better, but still not drinkable,” says Renata Oliveira, secretary of the town’s Z14 fishing company.View image in fullscreenCampos dos Goytacazes’sSambódromo,a stadium built to host the samba schools’ annual parade, had its wiring stolen and lies unused for most of the year.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaFélix de Jesus, a farmer, says he cannot see where the oil money goes. “Many say our people could be among the wealthiest, and I agree.“Given the royalties it receives, the city should be a showpiece, but instead, it remains a city of misery,” he says. “Where is this money going?”In Campos dos Goytacazes, a city of about 500,000 people, oil revenues totalled more than 37bn reais from 1999 to 2024, averaging R$72,700 per resident.But, says Ucam professor Rodrigo Lira, “this budget increase has not resulted in social justice or reduced inequalities. No research demonstrates any progress in this area.”View image in fullscreenEven with a larger budget than bigger cities, Campos de Goytacazes’s education indicators are below the state average.

In Novo Jóquei, José Ricardo, a school caretaker who also offers low-cost tutoring for the area’s children through his charity, Anjos Solidários do Bem (Solidarity Angels of Good)–says there are teenagers moving from fifth to sixth grade, aged 11, without any solid educational foundation.“We could be in a much better situation now if the politicians had invested in industry and in the city’s future,” he says.Brazilian politicians have long championed the idea that oil wealth is key to the development of Brazil and its municipalities, ever since the first oilfields were explored.View image in fullscreenPresident Luiz Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva, centre, with ministers and Magda Chambriard, head of the state-owned oil firm Petrobras on his right, at the Duque de Caxias refinery last month.

That’s the kind of cool novelty of this manuscript, that we included three different pollinating groups that are very diverse.”The research, carried out over the summer of 2019, involved Ellis visiting allotments in Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield, in varying urban densities, to sample the number of pollinating insects from all three groups. “We just collected insects every month for six months in eight sites in each city – so it was a lot of driving.”Their findings were sobering. They found that for every 10% increase in impervious surfaces – such as roads and building cover – there was a reduction of up to 7.5% in the variety of pollinating species. But the number of moths and hover flies of any species took a far greater hit compared with the number of bees.“We hypothesise that this could be due to the fact that they’ve got more complex life cycles because they need those different kind of resources other than flowers to become adults,” Ellis said. But that crucial vulnerability also contains a potential answer. If gardeners and urban planners bear in mind the needs of other pollinators, then there are straightforward ways to cater to them.“We’re so good now planting flowers for pollinators like bees and that could be the reason why we’re not seeing them decline,” Ellis added. “It’s just a matter of taking these guys into account and maybe having some more shrubs or a pond or something like that to also benefit those insects.“The diversity of habitat is the most important – so you need your flower patch, you need a tree, you need some shrubs, you need an untouched bit of grass – and kind of just keeping the patches that you have diverse and catering for all different types of insects and animals.“A huge thing that’s important is collaborating and talking to your neighbours and families and friends and encouraging them to do it too. Because an individual allotment or flower garden is pretty small and almost useless, but when you create a whole network of people that are interested and engaged these small little patches can become these huge habitat networks in cities.”Ellis and her colleagues’ findings are published in theRoyal Society’s biological research journalProceedings B.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeGardensBeesInsectsUrban wildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

If approved it would be the biggest embassy in Europe.The controversial plan has met fierce opposition from local residents and campaigners concerned about Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Several large protests have taken placeoutside the site in recent months.In her letter, Rayner noted that two of the proposed embassy buildings on the drawings – the Cultural Exchange Building and Embassy House – had been “greyed out”.She wrote to the planning consultancy in charge of the Chinese embassy proposal asking it to “identify precisely and comprehensively” the drawings that had been redacted and explain the rationale and justification for these redactions.She asked the embassy to “consider whether to provide unredacted versions” of the drawings and questioned whether the redactions might infringe on the principle that the public must know what planning permission is granted for.The letter also noted that the Home Office and Foreign Office had requested the construction of a “hard perimeter” around the embassy site to address public safety concerns and that this could represent “a material amendment to the application that would require further consultation”.A lawyer for the Chinese embassy told the planning inquiry into the proposal earlier this year thatChinahad no intention of altering the design. In her letter, Rayner asked for further details on how the embassy intended to address the government’s safety concerns.Luke de Pulford, executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which is a long-standing critic of the plans, said: “We have gone from the mega-embassy feeling like a done deal to Beijing having a mountain to climb to secure it.“The only way this development now gets approved is if the foreign and home secretaries roll over on their very modest conditions. They must stand firm, and we must finally put this disastrous plan to bed.”China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there stalled afterTower Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022, citing security concerns and opposition from residents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision was taken in March earlier this year.In a statement published on its websitethe SRA said that a tribunal “has certified that there is a case to answer in respect of allegations which are or include that, on or around 26 April 2017, Ms Gill sent or arranged to be sent correspondence which contained an improper threat of litigation”.It added that the allegations were subject to a full hearing and were as yet unproven.

However, it is understood that the case relates to Gill’s work for OneCoin, which was later established to bea multibillion-dollar fake cryptocurrency, and its founder, Ruja Ignatova.In 2023 the Bureau of Investigative Journalismreportedon threats from Carter-Ruck on behalf of OneCoin and Ignatova, including a letter sent on 26 April 2017 to Jen McAdam, a OneCoin victim.The letter was obtained and published by the thinktank Tax Policy Associates and its founder, Dan Neidle, who complained about Gill to the SRA.In the letter published by Neidle, Gill accused McAdam of posting links to online videos alleging that OneCoin was a fraud. “The statements you have published … go way beyond what may be considered to be legitimate debate,” Gill wrote to McAdam. “You can be in no doubt therefore of the damage being caused to our clients’ reputation and business.”In a statement Carter-Ruck said: “We are disappointed by the SRA’s decision to bring these proceedings against our colleague, who we will be fully supporting in her defence of this matter.” McAdampostedon X that she was unable to comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just before 8pm Birmingham Airport said its runway had reopened and flights had started to depart.The hub apologised for the disruption caused by the incident and said passengers must check flight details and follow advice issued by their airlines. Some flights had to be diverted to Manchester and East Midlands airports.Passengers have been told to check the status of their flight before coming to Birmingham airport, where check-in and security were also temporarily closed.All of those onboard the Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, which was flying to Belfast, have been discharged.Earlier, Birmingham airport posted on X: “Following an aircraft incident that occurred this afternoon, operations are expected to remain suspended until at least 8pm. Passengers at the airport are advised to speak to their airline for further information. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.”The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said disruption at the airport was “minimal” but she understood “how frustrating” the situation was for passengers.Gunnar Lauridsen, 76, from Denmark had been on holiday playing golf, and said he would most likely miss his connecting flight because of the closed runway.“We are ultimately going to Billund in Denmark,” he said. “This delay probably means we can’t get our connection, so that means that we will be staying probably in Amsterdam overnight.“I should have been to the doctors tomorrow morning. When you travel things happen.”Camile Monteleone, 30, was meant to fly home to Barcelona after working in the UK for three days but did not know if her flight from the airport had been cancelled.The visual merchandiser said: “I don’t have any news … It doesn’t say anything on the Ryanair app about the flight. I’m just waiting for information. I have to let people know I’m here, stuck at the airport. I can’t do anything else.”Faye Melhuish, 38, who arrived home from a holiday in Spain with her six-month-old daughter, said her flight had been unable to land at Birmingham and had to be diverted.“We flew from Spain and we were due to land here at 2.20pm,” she said. “Then in the air we were circling to see if we could land. The captain basically said we are going to have to go to East Midlands.”Speaking about her daughter, Melhuish said: “It’s her first time on a plane and her first time on a coach.”West Midlands police had previously posted on X: “We are at Birmingham airport this afternoon after a small aircraft was involved in an emergency landing at around 1.40pm. Officers are among the emergency crews at the scene and one person has been reported to have minor injuries.“The Civil Aviation Authority has been informed and the airport has suspended operations as an investigation is carried out.”The response to the incident will be led by the Air Accidents Investigations Branch, a CAA spokesperson said. “In the event of delays or cancellations, passengers will be expected to be provided with food and drink as well as accommodation if delayed overnight,” they said.The Air Accidents Investigations Branch said it had started an investigation into the incident, with “a multi-disciplinary team including inspectors with expertise in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data” deployed to the airport.Woodgate Aviation said one of its Beechcraft aircraft was involved in the emergency landing as a result of landing gear problems.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamAir transportEnglandWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

These were Manchester, Leeds, York, Newcastle, Lancaster, Sheffield and Durham.It said many of these institutions were unfairly disadvantaged by two further criteria related to their proportion of overseas staff. Larger universities are less likely to meet the 35% quota of international staff given their size, it said, although the University of Manchester missed out by just 0.3%.Henri Murison, the chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said it welcomed the principle behind the fund but it “undermines innovation in the north”.“The north isn’t pleading, it’s simply asking not to be overlooked in favour of special treatment for nations like Wales, which, while important, are far smaller in scale,” he said.“The north remains the UK’s only credible economic counterweight to London and the greater south-east. If the government is serious about delivering growth across every part of the country, it cannot allow UKRI, the intermediary between government and our world-class research councils, to stand in the way of that ambition.”A government spokesperson said:“The £54m global talent fund will help some of our leading universities and research institutions to attract top researchers and their teams to the UK. Institutions across all four nations of the UK were selected based on measurable criteria.“We are determined to maximise the opportunities in every part of the country, including the north of England, through our regional growth strategy, by building more cross-national research partnerships, and by investing our record £22.6bn funding for R&D through schemes like the local innovation partnerships fund.”As well as the “golden triangle” three, the institutions selected are Queen’s University Belfast, the universities of Bath, Birmingham, Cardiff, Southampton, Strathclyde and Warwick, the John Innes Centre in Norwich and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandNorth-south divideHigher educationUniversitiesEducation policyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A dream of Italy’s late former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and revived soon after Meloni’s government came to power in 2022, the 3.7km bridge and its surrounding facilities are expected to take 10 years to build.Cars, trains and foot passengers currently cross the Strait of Messina, between the Sicilian city of the same name and Villa San Giovanni in Calabria, by ferry – a journey that takes about 30 minutes.The green light for the bridge, which the government argues would give a much-needed economic boost to Italy’s poorer south, was given by an inter-ministerial committee on Wednesday, said the transport minister, Matteo Salvini, who is also the project’s chief backer. Salvini described it as “a metro over the strait”.View image in fullscreenA rendering by Webuild of the proposed Strait of Messina Bridge.Photograph: Webuild-Eurolink Image LibrarySalvini said the approval would need to be validated by the national audit court, which could take a few weeks, but said he was optimistic work would begin “in September or October”.“The Strait of Messina is a project without precedent in the world,” Salvini told reporters. “This goal is to complete by 2032-33.”Salvini added countering any attempt at criminal infiltration in the project would be the government’s “raison d’être”.“We must monitor the entire supply chain to ensure it is impervious to criminals,” he said, adding if it was discovered that the mafia was involved then the bridge would not be built.It will be constructed by a consortium led by Italy’s Webuild Group and including Spain’s Sacyr and the Japanese group IHI.Pietro Salini, the chief executive of Webuild, said the project would be “transformative for the whole country”. The company estimates the bridge’s construction will create more than 100,000 jobs.The approval will allow for preliminary works, including archaeological and geological surveys, to be carried out. An estimated 4,000 people on either side of the strait will be forced to leave their homes as part of an expropriation plan. They will be compensated, but this has not been enough to stop frequent protests against the bridge’s construction.Despite Berlusconi’s attempts to approve the project during his three governments, it was rejected because of the high costs, engineering impracticability and the environmental impact.Environmental associations this week filed a complaint with the EU, flagging serious risks for the local environment, while Angelo Bonelli, an MP for the Greens and Left Alliance, said the plan was “a colossal waste of money” and vowed to continue to fight against it. The area of the construction is also among those with the highest seismic risks inEurope.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeGiorgia MeloniConstruction industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He said he opposed “illegal migration … and joining the euro”, and wanted a “sovereignPolandthat is in the European Union … but is and will remain Poland”.A devout Catholic, Nawrocki ended his speech with a cry: “May God bless Poland, long live Poland.”Backed by the populist rightwing opposition Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, Nawrocki ran under a Trumpesque slogan of “Poland first, Poles first”.View image in fullscreenNawrocki and his wife, Marta, arrive at parliament before his swearing-in ceremony in Warsaw.Photograph: Paweł Supernak/EPAHe defied the polls to narrowly beat the Oxford-educated liberal Warsaw mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, and replace the conservative incumbent, Andrzej Duda, who was stepping down after two terms.Nawrocki, who faced controversy during the campaign when it emerged he had taken part in an organised brawl between football hooligans in 2009, has little experience in frontline politics. He served as the head of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, a state research institute.Poland goes to the polls in second round of close-fought presidential electionRead moreHis manifesto – going far beyond presidential powers – contained 21 promises, including to lower taxes and energy costs, stop the EU’s green policies, block irregular migration and ensure “safe childhood without ideology”, a phrase taken to mean opposition to same-sex adoption and gender education in schools.After an unexpected visit to Washington in the final weeks of the campaign, Nawrocki sought and secured Donald Trump’s endorsement before the vote. A White House delegation also took part in the swearing-in ceremony.As it tries to stand up to an increasingly aggressive Russia, Poland will hope that his personal relationship with Trump will help in defence talks with the US administration. Marek Magierowski, Poland’s former US ambassador, said in an analysis for the Atlantic Council that the links could “help keep both countries aligned in the contest against Russia”.View image in fullscreenKarol Nawrocki with Donald Trump at the White House in May.Photograph: The Whitehouse/XOn Ukraine, Nawrocki has pledged to continue support for Kyiv, but opposes its Nato membership.Domestically, the new presidency is expected to directly challenge Tusk’s pro-European coalition government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhile the role of the Polish president carries limited powers, it gives him some influence over foreign and defence policy, a high public profile, and the ability to veto new legislation. The veto can only be overturned with a majority of three-fifths in parliament, which the government does not have, potentially stymying its ability to pass promised changes on contentious issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.Nawrocki is expected to make the most of his powers, seeking to stand up to the increasingly unpopular Tusk. He is expected to put forward his first legislative proposals this week in an attempt to set the political agenda for the autumn.On Wednesday, Nawrocki drew some early battle lines. He challenged the government’s plans to restore the rule of law after the previous administration’s clashes with the EU, accusing Tusk’s government of undermining the country’s constitution and calling for its broader rewrite by 2030 – an ambition with a clear political implication.Any change to the constitution would require a two-thirds majority in parliament. The Law and Justice party hopes to use Nawrocki’s success in the buildup to the 2027 parliamentary election to return to power, potentially in a coalition with the libertarian far-right Konfederacja party.View image in fullscreenNawrocki supporters gather near St John’s Archcathedral in Warsaw’s old town during a mass after the swearing-in ceremony.Photograph: Radek Pietruszka/EPA“He spoke about a confrontation with the government, and, of course, we are ready for that,” Tusk told reporters after the speech. He said he hoped “the rather defiant and confrontational tone won’t lead to any practical consequences”. Still, he added that “if needed, we will stand firm”.He also pointedly criticised Nawrocki’s comments about the rule of law, putting them in the context of investigations into alleged irregularities under the previous Law and Justice government.He said: “Even if some people complain that the reckoning process is going slowly, I’m not surprised PiS [the Law and Justice party] is desperate for President Nawrocki to somehow paralyse the work of the prosecutor’s office.

It began in the village of Ribaute in the Aude department, spreading across the rural, wooded area of the Corbières, famous for its vineyards and medieval villages.A woman died in her home and one person was in a critical condition with severe burns, according to the Aude prefecture. Several firefighters were also injured. At least 25 homes were destroyed or damaged. Police are investigating the cause of the fire.The environment ministry said the fire had destroyed the same amount of land in 24 hours that wildfires typically burned across France in a year.“This is an exceptional fire that illustrates the scale of the consequences of the climate crisis,” the ministry said in a statement.Map of southern FranceThe wildfire remained “very active’’ on Wednesday, local authorities said.The mayor of the village of Jonquières, Jacques Piraux, said all residents had been evacuated. “It’s a scene of sadness and desolation,” he told the broadcaster BFM TV. “It looks like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters of the village has burned down. It’s hellish.”Lucie Roesch, the secretary general of the Aude prefecture, said: “The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups.”Planes were dropping water on the flames but Roesch said: “This fire will keep us busy for several days. It’s a long-term operation.”Weather conditions were expected to remain unfavourable due to strong winds, rising temperatures and dry vegetation in the area, officials said.Camping grounds and at least one village were partially evacuated and several roads closed. Residents and tourists were asked to remain in their homes unless told to leave by firefighters. Some tourists who were evacuated from campsites spent the night in municipal buildings.One person told France 2 TV: “I wanted to go back to my house to get my things but I couldn’t go in. We’re waiting to see what the damage was. When I left, there were flames at the foot of the house.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fires have burned more than 25,700 hectares of Portugal since the beginning of 2025, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. There have also been wildfires in central Spain,Turkey, Greeceand in the Balkans.Scientists say climate breakdown is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.

The radio announcer who appears in our living room; the movie star we see on a screen; the relative’s voice we hear on a phone: they all mix up our sense of the real and the imagined.So it is with artificial intelligence. A poem generated instantly by ChatGPT feels as magical to us – and as magically wrong – as the first printed books must have done to an illiterate population, unschooled in mystical Latin. How to account for something that communicates like a human being, yet is not physically present?It is an uncertainty that haunts the AI-themed plays on this year’s Edinburgh fringe. It also accounts for their apocalyptic mood. Do we even have a future, they all seem to ask, or are we bequeathing it to the machines?View image in fullscreenA kind of female Hamlet … Alfrun Rose’s Dead Air is more about processing grief than the limits of digital technology.TakeDead Air, in which playwright Alfrun Rose stars as Alfie, a kind of female Hamlet. Like Shakespeare’s vacillating hero, she communes with her dead father and grows furious with her mother for hooking up with a new man, John, an old boyfriend. As Alfie sees it, John is in line to become her stepfather with unseemly haste.The difference with Hamlet is that her dad is no ghost but an AI simulacrum, powered by a service called AiR.For as long as she pays the subscription (no easy feat), Alfie can hang on to her dead dad and hang on, too, to her sense of survivor’s guilt and unfinished business. The online service, with its chirpy operatives and Stayin’ Alive hold music, supplies her with a nearly-but-not-quite reproduction of the real man. If something feels off, she can switch the temperature controls to turn him from mechanical to fanciful. Whether he is a comforting replacement or a cynical means of data mining is a moot point.The question Rose raises in an absorbing storytelling show is less about the limits of digital technology and more about processing grief. Alfie’s fury with her mother and rage about John is little to do with them (they seem as perplexed by her outbursts as Gertrude and Claudius are by Hamlet’s) and a lot to do with her miscarriages. Conflating the death of her father with the loss of her children, she is frozen into inaction. Having a virtual father only prolongs her inertia. Whatever this AI father is, however lifelike, he can never be the real thing.The AI chatbot played by Elisabeth Gunawan inStampin’ in the Graveyardalso purports to have our interests at heart. She is there, she explains, authentically stiff-jointed, to ease our transition to the end of the world. Her name is Rose and if she starts hallucinating, as AI is wont to do, a rose graphic flashes up on screen.Through an interface that is all glitches, network errors and messages saying “Not applicable is not applicable at this time”, she polls the audience to guide her through optional storylines. Each show plays out with a different combination of scenes in a tech-savvy production co-created with movement director Matej Matejka for Kiss Witness.Hard to say what the story adds up to – it is a catastrophic tale that begins with a couple seeking marriage guidance from a vending machine and ends with forced separations and closed airports – but it is fascinatingly done with the audience tuning in on headphones and Gunawan playing a steampunk synth-accordion hybrid created from recycled electronics. If this is the future, we are in for a world of computer errors and digital indifference, a hostile place for our messy human interactions.View image in fullscreenFreakily realistic … AI: The Waiting Room – An Audiovisual Journey at Studio at C Arts, EdinburghPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianTackling the technology even more directly, New York’s Angry Fish Theater and the Ally Artists Group use AI to generate a bespoke script for each spectator. Before the start ofAI: The Waiting Room – An Audiovisual Journey, you fill in a questionnaire, truthfully or otherwise, about your ambitions, loved ones and legacy. By the time you are in the theatre, there is a custom-built story ready to play out in your headphones, delivered by a freakily realistic voice.The sections unique to you are folded into a bigger tale, experienced by everyone, about societal breakdown and hi-tech rejuvenation. Nobody else will ever hear my yarn about a sugary moon, a bag of gold and 61 statues. This is a good thing, much as I enjoyed the novelty of hearing a romantic story about me and the family cat.All this takes place as we move freely around a studio, watching a monochrome animation (perhaps also artificially generated) and following instructions intended to make us play characters in our stories. These demands for audience participation seem forced – especially a misjudged prompt to “dance party?” – but it is a quirkily intriguing attempt to be humanly creative with this inhuman technology.Dead Air is atPleasance Courtyarduntil 24 August.

Released in 1995, it was directed by Ang Lee and is a movie with the pleasures of a golden age studio picture of the kind made by William Wyler. It was the second half of Thompson’s Oscar double – she won her first one in 1993 for acting in Howards End – and she is still the only person in Academy Award history to win for acting and writing.With marvellous lightness and gaiety, Thompson found a response to Austen’s comic register, expertly marrying it up to the romance, and 1995 now looks like the golden age of Austen adaptation, having also seen the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle Pride and Prejudice on television and Amy Heckerling’s Emma-homage Clueless at the movies. Thompson paid due attention to Austen’s unique and toughly realistic concern with money and status – but on this more serious point, perhaps a rerelease is also due for Patricia Rozema’s very worthwhile interpretation of Mansfield Park from 1999, a darker and more political take on Austen.Sense and Sensibility is a film stuffed with blue-chip British acting talent but, for me,Kate Winsletis the movie’s beating heart as the spirited and innocent Marianne Dashwood, younger sister of the more sober Elinor, played outstandingly by Thompson herself. With their widowed mother (Gemma Jones) and little sister Margaret, played by Myriam François, the sisters find themselves evicted from their handsome estate due to a technicality of their late father’s will and forced to occupy a modest cottage elsewhere.This film delivers the keynote generic moments: the formal ball in which dialogue is exchanged in the middle of silly dance moves, the secret engagement and the whispered gossip about wealth and projected annual income. The houses are, of course, grand and even the Dashwoods’ cottage doesn’t look too awful. There is a tree house that looks staggeringly big.It is in her relatively reduced circumstances that Elinor encounters the personable Edward Ferrars, brother to the spiteful and grasping Fanny Dashwood, the sisters’ relative by marriage played with vinegary glee byHarriet Walter. Hugh Grant brings a coolly underplayed star power to the role of Edward; he has a hilariously diffident way of entering a room and a generally comic manner that Austen surely can’t have imagined, but which works tremendously well. (Thompson invents for Edward and Elinor a tremendous gag about the location of the Nile.)As for Marianne, she is bowled over by the bounderish Willoughby who is to shatter her heart, a role that Greg Wise made immortal (and his real-life marriage to Thompson is an extra-textual romance that has helped to make the film iconic). But there to heal Marianne’s heart is the manly and reticent Colonel Brandon, played byAlan Rickmanwith pride, decency and slot-mouthed hauteur.Brandon is the third character in this film with a broken heart, having fallen for Marianne only to see her infatuated with the awful Willoughby, but it’s a lump-in-the-throat moment when Marianne, recovering from her near fatal illness, sees how the devoted Brandon has brought her mother to see her and thanks him from her sickbed.As for these men, well, it’s Colonel Brandon who has the estate and Edward Ferrars is content with the relatively modest clergyman’s living. God is not otherwise mentioned, other than in Marianne’s astonished encounter with her faithless suitor in London: “Good God, Willoughby!” So the double wedding is a compromise between marrying for love and for something more material, and finds there is no great problem in balancing the two.Sense and Sensibility is in UK cinemas from 8 August, and Australian cinemas from 10 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsJane AustenPeriod and historical filmsFilm adaptationsEmma ThompsonreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s also real depth to this gag-packed comedy about two mischief-loving friends reuniting in midlifeRachel AroestiWed 6 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe Studio, Seth Rogen’s cosy Hollywood satire which dropped on Apple TV+ earlier this year, features a glut of industry figures cameoing as themselves: Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron, Zac Efron, Ron Howard, Zoë Kravitz, Nicholas Stoller. Unless you also happen to work in the movie business, that last name probably won’t mean much: in the show Stoller is introduced as a reliable writer of kid-friendly fare – The Muppets, Captain Underpants – who can make a decent job of the IP-driven film (“the Kool-Aid movie”) that Rogen’s studio head, Matt Remick, has been forced to pursue.In real life, Stoller did indeed write those films. Yet he’s also a key figure in the later years of the Judd Apatow-abetted Frat Pack era, responsible for a number of box office hits including Sex Tape, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek and Neighbors, which starred Rogen andRose Byrneas a couple warring with the fraternity next door. Pairing lowbrow farce with zingy dialogue and hapless beta male protagonists, these were out-and-out comedies made at a time when the genre occupied a significant slice of the cinematic zeitgeist.Those days are over, but Stoller has adapted his shtick to the requirements of the age. In Apple TV+’s Platonic, now returning for a second season, he teams up with his wife, co-writer Francesca Delbanco, for a comedy drama starring Rogen and Byrne, this time as two mischief-loving college pals reunited in midlife after a five-year falling out. Byrne is Sylvia, a married mother of three whose life of predictable happiness and domestic drudgery is beginning to chafe; Rogen plays Will, a recently divorced brewmaster who wears aspirationally quirky outfits and likes kicking over parked e-scooters.Seth Rogen on going from onscreen slacker to studio boss: ‘People really do scream at each other in Hollywood’Read morePlatonic has a fair amount in common with its cinematic predecessors. It relies heavily on the likability of its stars and a healthy roster of eccentric supporting characters (including Sylvia’s eight-year-old son, who coolly suggestscontroversial true-crime documentary Dahmerfor family film night) and is powered by a series of silly set-pieces. Season one saw the duo snatch a collar off a ferocious doberman, stumble round a grocery store high on ketamine, and – my favourite – take a tour of the abandoned nursing home Sylvia feels cornered into buying (very “colonial hospice, Cape Cod mortuary,” nods Will).There are also differences. Platonic is lightweight, comforting entertainment primarily focused on the gag, but it has real depth, too. During an argument, Will calls Sylvia “a miserable stay-at-home mom who hangs out with me to escape your boring life.” That’s not quite true: Sylvia’s not miserable, she’s a frustrated fun-lover low on self-esteem after 13 years out of the workplace. The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.Meanwhile, Will has his own struggles – namely to find love and get along with his colleagues at the bar they run, Lucky Penny, after they decide to collaborate with a cringy diner chain. Will quits in protest, believing the value of his beer to be inextricably linked to its non-corporate edge. Platonic seems curiously keen to disabuse him of his resistance to capitalist overlords; by the first season’s end he is working at the chain’s head office and engaged to the CEO, Jenna.This is where season two kicks off, with Sylvia organising the pair’s wedding – she’s now moonlighting as a party planner – while secretly hoping they will split. The pair do seem ill-matched – Will is a committed slacker, Jenna is an overachiever and yet quite basic (she slips lines from the Barbie movie into conversation). She’s also dismissive of Sylvia in a way that plays neatly into the motherhood theme.If I Had Legs I’d Kick You review – Rose Byrne is a knockout in anxious dark comedyRead morePlatonic ranges from great to decent company. The leads have palpable (nonsexual) chemistry, and it’s always nice to watch something that is putting serious effort into making you laugh. Byrne is undoubtedly the comic engine, a natural clown who is given plenty to do; season two begins with Sylvia posing as an eastern European glamourpuss in order to test-drive a sports car which she repeatedly stalls before fleeing.Sometimes you can’t help wondering if Platonic would work better if its most hilarious moments were smooshed together into a lean comic movie rather than padded out into a flabby, 10-hour-long TV series. Having worked through the tensions caused by an adult male-female relationship in season one, the show now asks whether Will and Sylvia should continue their mildly dysfunctional friendship. This question doesn’t provide quite enough direction or dramatic substance: the storylines are circular, the bickering is repetitive and there’s a distinct streaming-era bagginess to proceedings. Still, there remains a lot to enjoy here.Platonic season two is on Apple TV+.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRose ByrneSeth RogenTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its hugely elaborate, joke-packed return sees its star on wonderful formSarah DempsterWed 6 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 19.24 EDTShareHark! ’Tis the peal of baleful bells, for a new semester has befallen Nevermore Academy, and freshly minted celebrity Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) is, naturally, having none of it. “I liked it better when I was feared and hated,” she monotones as a flock of awestruck fellow students scrabbles around her ankles, autograph books a-flap.Alas, her newfound fame is inescapable. “You’re kind of a big deal now after the whole saving the school from the demon pilgrim thing”, “It girl” Bianca (Joy Sunday) explains, as much to the viewer as to Wednesday, who is perhaps too busy administering icily efficient death-stares to her swooning fanbase to fully appreciatethe ramifications of last season’s finale. The demon pilgrim thing? Ah, yes. The demon pilgrim thing. This, you may recall, was the climactic first-series kerfuffle surrounding one Joseph Crackstone, a bloodthirsty 17th-century pilgrim resurrected by dastardly botany teacher/beastmaster Marilyn Thornhill (Christina Ricci). Having already manipulated barista/actual monster Tyler Galpin (Hunter Doohan) into killing a series of pupils, police and local therapists, Thornhill planned on using the reanimated Crackstone to help her snuff out everyone else. Anyway, thanks to Wednesday the evildoers are now either exploded (Crackstone) or banged up (Thornhill and Galpin) and Nevermore, finally, is safe. Let joy – or at least guarded relief – be unconfined.And now? Peace descends and the second series of this most deliciously macabre of smash-hit murder-mystery/high-school comedy dramas – or at least the four episodes available prior to the second half of the series being launched in September – can proceed in orderly fashion. Or not, as the case may be, because – ruh-roh – here comes another baddie! Specifically, here comes the Kansas City Scalper, a serial-killing, doll-collecting professional dog groomer in a velour tracksuit played, with much oleaginous glee, by Haley Joel Osment (ofThe Sixth Sense fame). In a breakneck pre-title sequence, we learn that Wednesday has spent her summer vacation tracking down the Scalper, being tied up by the Scalper, turning the tables on the Scalper, relieving the Scalper of his scalp and, finally, delivering the Scalper to justice. The ultimate significance of all this is moot (certainly the incident is, at least in this first episode, not referred to again) although only a berk would bet against the scalpless sod popping up at a later date and putting everyone off their Weetos.It is, all in all, a veryWednesdayintroduction to the new season of Wednesday. That is; a hugely elaborate and wildly entertaining thing that happens very quickly and at great budgetary expense only to be promptly buried under the demands of a more immediately pressing plot strand. Which is, in this instance, Wednesday’s mystery stalker. Having emerged at the end of the last series, he/she/it has decided that our peerlessly nihilistic heroine must pay for something or other and has begun to leave her a series of increasingly shouty cryptic notes demanding she DO SOMETHING or other ABOUT THIS. Who is this irate foe? And what, precisely, is the nature of his/her/its beef?Further unusualness abounds. A local private investigator is pecked to death by a distinctly murderous murder of crows. Wednesday has horrifying visions of ditzy roommate Enid (Emma Myers)’s imminent demise.Nevermore, meanwhile, has an enthusiastic new principal in theNed Flanders-y form of Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi, complete with statement knitwear and a moustache that follows you around the room). Dort is a Bruce Springsteen fan and is Not To Be Trusted.Also straddling the tantalising first-episode divide between “seems quite nice, actually” and “is almost certainly a shapeshifting necromancer” is wispy new music teacher Isadora Capri (Billie Piper, clearly having a blast).Similar fun is to be had in the return of Catherine Zeta-Jones’s woozy, pillowy Morticia Addams if not in Luis Guzmán’s lumpy, grinning Gomez, whose character, as ever, seems oddly unfinished, as if he’d abandoned rehearsals halfway through, having been distracted, perhaps, by a scotch egg.Minor quibbles aside, the season opener is wonderfully skittish and dense with jokes and plot. Tim Burton’s brisk direction ensures any embryonic wibbles of seriousness or sentimentality are swiftly squished by a shot of a rotting corpse, say, or a scene in which a flotilla of CGI caterpillars assemble themselves, apropos nothing, into the legend “BUG OFF”.In the middle of it all, meanwhile, is Ortega’s Wednesday, whose charisma could power a thousand hearses. Not that she’d appreciate our enthusiasm. “Do not put me on a pedestal,” she warns her besotted schoolmates during her guest of honour speech at the disastrous inaugural Nevermore gala. “The only place I will lead you is off a cliff.”The sensible among us are already preparing our parachutes.Wednesday season two is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsJenna OrtegaTV reviewTelevisionTim BurtonChristina RicciSteve BuscemiWednesdayBillie PiperreviewsShareReuse this content"

Whether they’re the actual record-holder (The Simpsons), a once-canceled cult show turned institution (Family Guy, or the cable-channel-hopping Futurama), or a “newer” show that’s actually entering its 16th season (Bob’s Burgers), these shows leverage their age-defying format to serve as both a constant in their viewers’ lives and a living document of contemporary American life over their many years on the air. So it’s not unusual that King of the Hill, a Fox cartoon that aired in the late 90s and throughout the 2000s, would rejoin its corporate cousins for a 14th season on Hulu. But just as during the show’s original run, it’s an odd fit with those other, brasher animated sitcoms – sometimes blessedly so.King of the Hill review – this charming comedy returns after 15 years … and it’s more welcome than everRead moreIt would be easy enough to characterize King of the Hill as a red-state Simpsons. Instead of bumbling everyman/id Homer Simpson, created by anti-establishment cartoonist Matt Groening, it focuses on the genially repressed Hank Hill (Mike Judge), created by satirical cartoonist Mike Judge. Hank is a buttoned-up propane salesman who values courtesy, patriotism, tradition and decency; in a switch-up from typical sitcom dynamics of its era, the show portrays Hank’s wife Peggy (Kathy Najimy) as the more hubris-prone buffoon of the two (especially as the seasons progress). Throughout the series, Hank struggles to connect with his preteen son Bobby, who doesn’t share his predisposition toward stoicism. And as with the Springfield of The Simpsons, the rest of the show is populated by residents of Arlen, Texas, a fictional but realistically rendered suburb of Dallas.Judge has always made it clear that he doesn’t consider King of the Hill principally political. Hank’s obvious conservatism has as much to do with his manner as his beliefs, which the show takes care to not root in bigotry or ideological stubbornness. Hank pre-visions sitcom characters like Ron Swanson, the anti-government government worker who became a favorite on Parks and Recreation. Unlike Ron, who was genuinely more effective with a touch of cartoonishness in earlier seasons before the show’s writers became addicted to portraying him as a genuinely great guy, Hank is always presented as even-keeled and sensible, with the show’s humor often coming from his squareness. The writers also do an admirable job of keeping its politics local, exploring how social changes (like “going green” in a later-period episode) affect Arlen in particular. The words “common sense” get thrown around a lot, in discussing the show and within the show itself. The sense of cartoon mischief that informs its other contemporaries (including Judge’s more satirical Beavis and Butt-Head) is minimal.For example, when The Simpsons did an episode about the Bush family, it playfully (if somewhat good-naturedly) caricatured ex-president George HW Bush as a Mr Wilson figure to Bart’s Dennis the Menace, a clever riff given that Bush had earlier targeted The Simpsons in a speech as less aspirational than family shows of yore. (Later presidential jabs were not so obtuse.) Beavis and Butt-Head once met Bill Clinton, and the show characterized him as having a little more in common with the boys than some would expect. Meanwhile, in the fifth-season premiere of King of the Hill set around the 2000 presidential election, George W Bush appears at a rally attended by an enthusiastic Hank, who loses faith in his preferred candidate when he gets a sample of a surprisingly limp handshake. Mostly, though, the episode is about taking pride in voting, no matter what compromises or surprises await in that process. The show didn’t change drastically, if at all, with W actually in office – or, for that matter, with the rise of Obama, though the show’s final episodes, aired during Obama’s first term, were likely produced before he was sworn in.That’s also an area where the show’s animated approach came in handy: It was able to run for well over a decade and only nebulously age its characters a few years. The approach was more akin to a newspaper comic strip than a weekly TV series, even a Simpsons-style cartoon (where the characters’ age stasis becomes part of its self-referential lore). Yes, the Hills could encounter George W Bush during the 2000 election, but a decade later, Bobby Hill could remain on the verge of adolescence, the show’s pace intentionally slowed; real-world details were introduced or elided at the show’s convenience. The lead characters’ consistency could remain a beacon of small-c conservatism, in the way that sitcoms can be inherently conservative with their episode-ending resets.The new season makes a major, bold move in that respect: It actually jumps forward in time. Bobby is now college-aged, though he’s running a restaurant in Dallas rather than matriculating anywhere in particular. Hank and Peggy have just returned from a multi-year stint living abroad in Saudia Arabia for Hank’s propane work, from which he has now retired back to Arlen. The viewers’ time away from the characters is at least in part granted to the characters themselves, something that The Simpsons has consigned to the realm of what-if episodes about the future (or episodes about an ever-revised, time-shifted past).It’s a poignant touch that, strictly speaking, may not have been necessary – at least not if the idea is for Hank to react to various modern-day devices, figurative and literal, with a little extra culture shock. Hank doesn’t actually need to dip out from the country to break out his trademark quiet consternation; he was plenty flummoxed by the natural course of history in the show’s original run. Though the time jump does generate fresh material for Bobby, and for Hank and Peggy’s newfound idle retirement, sometimes it also feels like a workaround for the topic of Trump and the degree to which conservatism has lost that small “c” as it shifts further and further to the right.Yet despite that avoidance, the newest season also feels like a specific product of the Biden era, which of course would have been when it was largely developed and written. Without mentioning any elections directly, the characters seem like they’re shaking off the worst cultural clashes of the first Trump term and the pandemic that capped it off. To that end, the gags that have to do with Hank and Peggy’s gap years from Arlen – like the ongoing retrospective saga of paranoiac Dale’s unlikely winning of Arlen’s Covid-era mayoral election, or their friend Bill becoming a shut-in – are lightly cathartic and very funny. When the first episode ends with Hank and Peggy comforted and heartened by the friendliness they receive from a diverse Arlen population, it’s appropriately heartwarming. It’s also sweetly funny to see Hank repulsed by the antics of a men’s-rights group that blames all their problems on “females”. On the whole, the new season is as solid as ever.Yet there’s something slightly off about the show treating this stuff as just another assortment of generational foibles. It’s an understandable instinct. King of the Hill sure isn’t trying to be a firebrand bellwether of good liberal outrage. It’s trying (usually quite successfully) to be funny, and the Trump joke sure isn’t funny anymore, if it ever was. Bringing Arlen into the Trump era without Trump is a way of modernizing the characters without turning their world into the kind of political lightning rod that would make Hank recoil. But it also seems designed to burnish Hank’s image; his particular conservatism can still look sensible if it doesn’t have to be associated with any unseemly actual conservatives. (The men’s rights guys, for example, are presented as misguided dopes misled by a bad apple.) The thing is, Hank doesn’t need the coddling. Plenty of good King of the Hill episodes do revel in his discomfort, even as they sympathize with him. The new season, good as it is, aims to give Hank a new dose of those temporary feelings in a relatively safe space. It’s not really the show’s fault, but there’s an increasingly blurry line between gently understanding humanism and letting everyone off the hook.Explore more on these topicsAnimation on TVTelevisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What made this such a stimulating affair was the juxtaposition of undeniable old masters with works by composers underrepresented in today’s concert halls. With the BBC National Orchestra of Wales on top form throughout, helmed by the energetic Italian-Turkish conductor Nil Venditti, there was much here to relish.The staples first, and Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending received a poetic and thoroughly idiomatic reading at the hands of Bulgarian violinist Liya Petrova. The orchestra laid the velvet-cushioned groundwork over which Petrova soared with elegant phrasing, silvery tone and exquisitely delivered top notes. An assured account of Britten’s Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes teemed with atmosphere. Venditti was particularly adept at bringing out the music’s underlying menace, though the hectic pace adopted for the Sunday Morning bells episode left musical details muddied by the acoustic.If Walton’s Crown Imperial, taken a tad fast, lacked the final ounce of Technicolor chutzpah, Elgar’s Enigma Variations was a painterly tour de force, Venditti holding the architectural line despite twice being interrupted by overeager applause. Tempi were ideal, whether depicting the aquatic high jinks of a bulldog in a river or sustaining a breathtakingly controlled build through Nimrod.View image in fullscreenEnergetic … Nil Venditti.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCThe rarities – all Proms premieres – were a fascinating if slightly mixed bag. William Mathias’s syncopated Dance Overture was a proper crowd-pleaser, the wizardly Welsh composer successfully locating his inner Carmen Miranda. The BBC Singers lent class to a pair of Edwardian part-songs by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, while his daughter Avril’s The Shepherd, a haunting setting of William Blake for male voices and strings, was a fine discovery. Both rather showed up John Rutter’s sugar-coated Bird Songs, here receiving its world premiere. Schmaltzy and curiously derivative, they felt dated in a way the older music did not.It was left to Venditti to right the ship with Grace Williams’ affecting Elegy for Strings, its gently rocking rhythms and intricate interweaving lines crowned by Lesley Hatfield’s heartfelt violin solo.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

You have licence in an otherwise extremely hierarchical society to just express yourself.”This is something the 41-year-old Pakistani-American singer, songwriter and composer hopes to create himself. Though he’s also a writer – be that his acclaimed 2009 novel, The Wish Maker, or contributions to publications such as the New Yorker – music became somewhere Sethi could be accepted, especially as a queer person growing up in Lahore. “I think music has this shamanic function in south Asian culture,” he says, “where things you cannot say in lay language you say in the love language of music.”Sethi’s stratospheric, shiver-inducing voice dissolves cultural divides. Take Intiha, his sublime 2023 experimental album of Sufi poetry with Chilean-American musician Nicolás Jaar, or 2022’s Pasoori, a bombastic raga-meets-reggaeton track which has surpassed a billion streams on YouTube Music, making it easily the biggest song to come out of Pakistan this century. When we speak, Sethi is about to release his debut solo album, Love Language, which builds on Pasoori’s thundering, Technicolor global pop. Working with producers like Brockhampton’s Romil Hemnani and Colombian musician Juan Ariza, it’s exuberant and almost oversaturated, flecked with 00s R&B, Bollywood, drill rap, slinky flamenco, even a skit on the children’s game “akkad bakkad”, all of it underlined with hallmarks of north Indian classical.View image in fullscreen‘The appropriate response is to troll them back’ … Sethi.Photograph: Fujio EmuraNot everyone is pleased. Sethi trained under two of the greats of classical music, Ustad Saami and Farida Khanum, and his initial career was in that more traditional world; some fans yearn for “the old Ali Sethi”. Though he’s adamant about using south Asian ragas rather than western chord progressions to inform the melodies for his songs, Sethi recounts how even the esteemed Ustad Saami asked him whether his music lately is fusion or, simply, confusion. “But I think in today’s completely monstrous world, what could be a better reflection than confusion?” Sethi laughs.The work of Pakistani musicians, including Sethi, has been banned and removed from streaming services in India, where fans are forced to access the music via VPN due to escalating tensions between both countries. “If you’re looking at it from the point of view of ideologues, music is the one thing that has kept the populations of India and Pakistan deeply connected to one another,” he says. “Every time the walls go up, the borders get re-erected but some song slips past, and there’s an instant [release of] fellow feeling … this unspoken connection.”The brief outbreak of conflict between the two nations earlier this year has worsened the cultural divide. The opening track on Sethi’s album was initially a duet with a well-known Bollywood singer, but a film industry body threatened that any Indian artist collaborating with a Pakistani artist would be blacklisted. The song is now censored, cut through with screams and distorted industrial textures. Sethi has also been unable to get a visa to enter India in nearly a decade. “Ever since I started releasing music, my biggest audience has been in India, and it’s the one place I’ve not been able to go,” he says.Ever since I started releasing music, my biggest audience has been in India, and it’s the one place I’ve not been able to goHe wryly notes that the themes of “forbidden love” he explores in his music are “already in place” thanks to the travel ban. Inspired by Pakistani revolutionary poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Sethi’s lyrics read like love songs, but they’re layered with double-meanings about ethno-nationalism, Islamophobia, war, queerness and exile. On Bridegroom, he subverts a 13th-century qawwali sometimes sung at weddings, his untethered, gliding voice delivering coy lyrics that translate to “don’t ask about my husband”. This follows “pretty rigorously orchestrated fake news” two years ago, falsely claiming Sethi and his partner, the Pakistani painter Salman Toor, had breached local law and married.He didn’t know how to react, until the answer came in the form of this song. “I realised the appropriate response is to troll them back with what they think of as semi-sacred music, saying, ‘I refuse to give up my traditions.’”Sethi may laugh in defiance, but his words are tinged with sadness. “These last few years have been a whirlwind, not always in the nicest ways,” he says. “There’s a lot of angst and despair, a lot of ruing the loss of a milieu, the loss of home – but also revelling in new homes, temporary shelters, finding community with other musicians in places like Los Angeles, London and New York.”View image in fullscreenThe cover artwork for Love LanguageHe says the success of NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is revitalising; the way he “squares that distance between all these different communities.” Love Language, then, is Sethi’s attempt at the same: a “diary of displacement” with the accompanying tour set to be “a variety show for the end times”. Mainly, he wants the music to be a refuge, and to capture his and his audience’s multiplicities.“I’m hoping it comes across as a work of synthesis rather than a work of assimilation,” Sethi says of his album, an attempt to make hybrid music without “simplifying or diluting” any of its constituent parts. “I feel equally rooted in Punjabi bhangra and hyperpop, equally conversant with queer club anthems and Sufi poetry; and, actually, I see all these connections all the time, because they dwell within me.”Love Language is out now on Zubberdust Media/The OrchardExplore more on these topicsMusicPakistanSouth and central AsiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Wisely, he does not expend much energy interrogating the conundrum of why she was so significant, and how it was that so many people, not all of them idiots, should have been so preoccupied with her, and why they felt compelled to project their fantasies upon her. She was famous beyond the limits of fame; as Brown informs us, her funeral was watched on television by about 4 billion viewers around the globe, “roughly half the people on the planet”.In its length and profusion of detail, Brown’s book is almost a match for its subject. He seems to have read everything ever written about the Queen: the list of his sources occupies nearly 15 closely packed pages. After such a sisyphean effort, he is keenly aware of the perils involved. “Reading too many books about the Queen and the royal family,” he writes, “is like wading through candy floss: you emerge pink and queasy, but also undernourished.”Given his many years as a contributor to Private Eye, it might be expected that his account of the Second Elizabethan Age would have its tongue jammed firmly into its cheek. True, there are many instances of that tone of barely suppressed, schoolboy hilarity the Eye adopts when it has to deal with topics dear to the nation’s heart. Overall, however, Brown gives an astute account of the wellnigh unaccountable public life of an intensely private person who, for most of that life, was on display before the slack-jawed and pop-eyed gaze of millions of total strangers.John Banville£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionThe abandoned last novelUntil AugustGabriel García MárquezUntil AugustGabriel García MárquezThe abandoned last novel“This book doesn’t work. It must be destroyed.” Not a one-star rant from the bowels of Amazon or Goodreads, but rather the verdict of Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez on his now posthumously published novel, Until August, a breezy romp brewed in his 70s and previously excerpted by the New Yorker in 1999 after he read from it on stage in Madrid with the late José Saramago.An editorial afterword explains how the intimate, decidedly non-epic entertainment now before us – a brisk and frisky tale of extramarital sex doubling as a parable of parental inscrutability – was sewn together from García Márquez’s fifth draft and a document preserving offcuts from prior attempts. The smooth-reading result is the story of Ana Magdalena Bach, who every August leaves her unnamed country on the Atlantic coast for 24 hours on the unnamed Caribbean island where her mother chose to be buried. She takes a ferry to lay flowers on her mother’s grave before returning to her husband – which leaves plenty of time for a yearly one-night stand, as twinkly dancefloor flirtations give way to steamy hotel-room tussles and gnawing regrets played out in comically fraught pillow talk back home.While the overall ambience might be sunny, sultry, even tipsy, there’s a genuine sting when we learn why Ana Magdalena’s mother – described as a teacher who “never in her entire life wanted to be anything more” – decided she wanted to be buried on the island. Her daughter reckons it was the panorama provided by the cemetery’s altitude – a kind of company in solitude – and ultimately her hunch isn’t so far off the mark. Another jolt lies in the surreal payoff, which is entirely García Márquez’s own, chosen in 2010, his editor states, contra the belief of García Márquez’s agent (cited in the afterword) that her client didn’t have an ending; satisfyingly symmetrical, it lends this gentle diversion the depth of fable.Anthony Cummins£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA time-travelling rompThe WatermarkSam MillsThe WatermarkSam MillsA time-travelling rompIf you love Doctor Who, you will love this book. It whirls you off on a similarly breathless Technicolor tumble through different eras and genres. But where the Doctor has the Tardis, the two main characters of The Watermark – journalist Jaime and painter Rachel – have cups of magical tea.The tea is administered to them by Augustus Fate, a bestselling but extremely bitter author, living in rural Wales, who has realised after seven Booker prize shortlistings that his novels lack convincing characterisation and genuine emotion. His solution is to lure two real people to his remote house, and then, by means of the magical tea, to sedate, brainwash and insert them into his stalled work in progress, Thomas Turridge.However, Jaime and Rachel are gradually able to wake up within Fate’s world. They begin to hear the narrator saying things like, “And so Thomas kissed Rachel and they burnt with a fiery, illicit passion.” Here is where the novel is really clever – because it forces us to read extremely attentively. Each anachronism, everything that fits our world but not Victorian times, is a sign of Jaime’s genuine self struggling to break through. Eventually, with the crashing arrival of a helicopter in the middle of a church service, we get the full world-splitting effect. Fate is thwarted, temporarily at least, and Jaime and Rachel are able to flee into another book – this time set in a poorly imagined 2010s Manchester. Poorly imagined, because its author is their friend and adviser from within the first story, Mr James Gwent, apparently a man of the 1860s but actually an earlier abductee of Fate’s.This section is one of the novel’s many highlights. Mills has a great deal of fun with the limitations of Gwent’s imagination. When Jaime and Rachel try an excursion to St Petersburg, their flight becomes increasingly sketchy. “I point at the window. The scenery outside has been leached of colour. Our seats are no more than pencil strokes; the view from the window is reduced to a draft.” Three further jumps occur, with the lovers book-surfing to Soviet Carpathia in 1928, to a robot-dominated London of 2047, and one more destination – I won’t spoil things by mentioning the finale.Toby Litt£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePoliticsHow nationalism changed a countryThe New IndiaRahul BhatiaThe New IndiaRahul BhatiaHow nationalism changed a countryBhatia’s remarkable book is an absorbing account of India’s transformation from the world’s largest democracy to something more like the world’s most populous country that regularly holds elections. It is also a wake-up call to all those who pin their hopes on the institutions intended to safeguard democracy: the bureaucracy, the law enforcement machinery, the media and the judiciary.By minutely observing the experiences of ordinary Indians – not the ones whose names make it into newspapers for what they have done, but those whose lives are affected by the remarks and actions of pundits who fulminate on India’s increasingly shrill and jingoistic television networks – Bhatia provides a vivid portrait of how a nation turns callous and changes into something unrecognisable.Friends Bhatia knows from school, relatives, others he has met casually and used to think of as regular people, have begun expressing their bigotry openly, in language they’d once have been embarrassed by. Their views are just that – views – devoid of facts, absent of logic. They are shaped by relentless, biased propaganda parroted over social media by tens of thousands of accounts: if more people say something, it must be true, the recipient believes. And it is difficult, as Bhatia shows, to fight faith with reason, lies with the truth. Reflecting a broader atomisation, he disengages; like many others (not only in India – this is a phenomenon seen also in the United States, where I live, and the United Kingdom, which has been my home) he retreats into his own bubble. And yet, being the fine reporter that he is, he steps out of it in order to understand the other side.Salil Tripathi£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionMore monstrous menDon’t Make Me LaughJulia RaesideDon’t Make Me LaughJulia RaesideMore monstrous menAli is a radio producer; Ed is a comedian. Ali is vulnerable; Ed is charming. Ali is desperate to be loved; Ed is ready to love her.And Ed is a predator. Ali is prey.Julia Raeside’s debut novel begins like a romcom, and ends like a different kind of fantasy: the kind in which people get what they deserve. In between, though, it feels painfully, precisely, beat-for-beat accurate. Sleazy Ed and bedraggled Ali are both so believable you could Google them. Until said denouement, there is nothing here that doesn’t ring absolutely true: famous men behaving badly? Famous men behaving very badly? Famous men taking advantage of their fame, and powerful men taking advantage of their power?Ali can “remember her first time as a sex object like it was yesterday”, but it doesn’t stop her falling for someone who, from the start, is obviously bad news. Many women faced with Ed’s dismissive, days-later response to a nude shot (“delightful pic x”) might be tempted to block and move on. Ali’s desperate lack of self-esteem may make a certain kind of sense, but it also makes for uncomfortable reading.Weight is a constant and uneasy preoccupation: Ali charts her own weight loss meticulously, and she observes other women’s bodies with the same laser-focused gaze. Her internalised misogyny makes it difficult, sometimes, to tell this gaze apart from the infamous male gaze. It’s as if the rot goes so deep that the plot frequently comes second to the pain. Does the accurate duplication of suffering act as a tool to dismantle the structures that shaped it, or is it just … more of the same?No ending, happy-adjacent or not, can shake the feeling that Don’t Make Me Laugh is a novel in which men are monstrous, but other women might be the real enemy. Which is, of course, the patriarchy’s biggest and most dangerous fantasy of all.Ella Risbridger£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirThe road to survivalScatteredAamna MohdinScatteredAamna MohdinThe road to survivalIn her first book, Guardian journalist Aamna Mohdin explores her Somali family’s refugee experience in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands and Britain, confronting many different versions of herself in the process. As she rests in a hotel after visiting the Kenyan beach where her mother had landed, heavily pregnant with her, after fleeing the carnage in Mogadishu, Mohdin reflects on a quote from William Faulkner’s novel Requiem for a Nun: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”Reading on, she wonders how much of who she is was determined by those events: “All of us labour in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity.” Scattered illuminates the webs that entrap not only Mohdin, but countless others who fled the Somali civil war and many conflicts since.The catastrophe of the war and the humanitarian crisis it created is scarcely written about, and when it is, it’s either politicised or aimed at an academic audience. So the startling honesty and intimacy of this depiction of one family’s chaotic quest to find sanctuary feels fresh and important. All the more so because some of Somalia’s most prominent writers were killed during the war, including the first writer of a novel in Somali, Farah Awl, who was murdered while fleeing Mogadishu in 1991. Movingly, the children born around that time are now piecing this story back together.Nadifa Mohamed£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionAn unsettling fairytaleEdith HollerEdward CareyEdith HollerEdward CareyAn unsettling fairytaleThe year is 1901, the place is Norwich and the hero of this story is 12-year-old Edith Holler who is, as she tells us, “famous”. Edith lives in a theatre and has never set a foot outside, after warnings that the building will collapse if she leaves. A motherless child, she has grown up among a peculiar selection of theatrical stalwarts – the puppet mistress, the stage door keeper, the prompt – who have lived so long in the playhouse they have become part of it, a strange ecosystem evolved to match their environment, like creatures of the deep ocean.Edith Holler is, in part, a love letter to the theatre, and one that gleefully embraces a Tim Burtonesque gothic theatricality. Carey, who has worked in the theatre, apparently began writing the book in lockdown when theatres had closed. It is also, more unusually, a love letter to Norwich. The book is steeped in the city’s history, featuring – among others – King Gurgunt, who sleeps beneath Norwich Castle, ready to rise in battle if needed, and the Grey Lady, a famous Norwich ghost. “We may be eastward but we are not backward,” Edith proudly says of her fellow Norfolkians. This is an enjoyably uncategorisable and atmospheric book, a richly dark and idiosyncratic fairytale for grownups.Joanna Quinn£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryLooking back to look forwardThe Green AgesAnnette KehnelThe Green AgesAnnette KehnelLooking back to look forwardAccording to Annette Kehnel, we have forgotten “how to keep an eye on the well-being of the next generation”. In the last 200 years, industrialisation and the economic miracle that flowed from it have brought immense benefits and wealth. But they have also led to microplastics polluting the oceans, and the climate crisis. In order to deal with these urgent problems, Kehnel – a professor of medieval history at Mannheim University – believes we need to look beyond “musty modernity” and rediscover how our ancestors lived so that we can reshape our “outdated short-term economy into a long-term one”.Although she doesn’t want us to go back to the middle ages, she argues that the period before capitalism offers important examples of how to manage resources both profitably and sustainably. For instance she explores how, over a period of 1,500 years, European monasteries and convents developed “one of the most stable forms of sharing community”. Similarly, during the 13th century, “beguinages” emerged in the urban centres of Flanders. These remarkable female communities were founded by charitable benefactors and maintained by collective commitment. They enriched their towns both economically and culturally, and are “the kind of supportive and empowering community that we might well be inspired to emulate”.Kehnel also highlights how our cities were once filled with people who mended things: “the modern definition of ‘waste’ as useless leftovers did not enter European dictionaries until the 20th century”. At a time when we need to preserve scarce resources, we could learn from their example and revive our repair professions to make recycling an integral part of our lives once more. From the way microfinance helped to bind urban communities together in the 15th century, to how 12th-century “minimalist communities” who lived by the motto “less is more” can teach us the value of frugality, Kehnel reveals many surprising and fascinating examples that could help us solve the problems of modernity.This wonderfully original and eye-opening study will transform your attitude towards the medieval period. Through richly researched case histories, Kehnel shows how sustainability was central to the medieval approach to life and that they “knew the limits of our planet better than we do now”.PD Smith£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionTea, yoga and sonnetsPracticeRosalind BrownPracticeRosalind BrownTea, yoga and sonnetsThis debut novel follows a day in the life of Annabel, an Oxford student writing an essay about Shakespeare’s sonnets. She wakes and makes tea, works on the essay, meditates, does yoga, works a little more, takes walks, has memories and fantasies, eats in the dining hall, talks to her boyfriend on the phone. The book ends as the day ends. For most of the novel, she’s alone in her room. It is an uneventful day in a safe, cocooned, mostly uneventful life.The great strength of Practice is Brown’s gift for the romance of the quotidian. Annabel is absorbed by the minutiae of her day: the “building roar” of the electric kettle, the growing pressure in her bladder, her ephemeral lust on seeing lines of muscle sharpening in a passing runner’s calves.The character of the solipsistic, over-earnest, pretentious, self-consciously ascetic Annabel is brilliantly done. She takes herself too seriously, and knows she’s taking herself too seriously, and takes that too seriously. She takes Shakespeare not only seriously but personally, as only a bookish undergraduate can. Her conception of the love triangle in the sonnets blurs into her own sexual fantasies, then into YA romance tropes before straying on into the weirder outskirts of girlish desire. Like many very young people, she is always performing, just a little bit, for herself.I both enjoyed and admired this novel. It was mostly a pleasure to travel in a lonely country most people wouldn’t even call story, to dwell in the satisfactions and strangeness of less when it’s just less.Sandra Newman£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirSpotlight on Generation XiOther RiversPeter HesslerOther RiversPeter HesslerSpotlight on Generation XiOther Rivers: A Chinese Education is a blend of memoir and reportage that chronicles China’s Covid years, often via its young people. We meet Hessler’s curious, ambitious and frequently jaded university students, who stand in contrast to the “young and naive” cohort he recalls from the 1990s. Members of generation Xi, Hessler discovers, “could be brutally honest about themselves, and they entertained few illusions about the Chinese system … They knew how things worked; they understood the system’s flaws and also its benefits.”Hessler’s compassionate depictions of the conflict between a Communist party seeking to expand its control and an increasingly educated and inquisitive generation have won his writing a band of devotees both inside and outside the country. When he sold his car after being effectively expelled in 2021, it caused a minor social media storm, with users lamenting his departure as the end of an era in which China was open to US perspectives.Other Rivers implicitly makes the case against both countries turning inwards. When Hessler and his wife, the writer Leslie Chang, arrived in Chengdu, they enrolled their nine-year-old twin daughters in a local Chinese school, despite them barely speaking a word of Mandarin. He documents with an anthropologist’s eye the idiosyncrasies of the Chinese education system, which, despite the hyper-competitive atmosphere, is kept going by teachers whose dedication and compassion holds lessons for western classrooms. And he is full of warmth about the pupils, parents and teachers who, at a time of rising suspicion of foreigners, welcomed his family into their curious, often misunderstood world.Amy Hawkins£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionRace as performanceColored TelevisionDanzy SennaColored TelevisionDanzy SennaRace as performanceEarly in Colored Television, 46-year-old Jane Gibson imagines her past self peering through the window of the home she lives in. “Brooklyn Jane” would admire this architecturally interesting house on the hills overlooking Los Angeles, she thinks, and see within it an idyllic scene of family life featuring Jane’s painter husband Lenny – “From a distance, in his horn-rimmed glasses, reading his serious book, he would look like an inspired choice” – and their two children, Ruby and Finn. The vision is warm, sophisticated, “a Black bohemian version of the American dream”.In this sly novel about dreams, ambition and race as performance, Jane’s fantasy is telling. Because what she carefully edits out are the unlovely truths underneath its gleaming surface: that she and Lenny had been in couples therapy until their money ran out. That Lenny’s paintings don’t sell. That Jane has been toiling over a sprawling novel for 10 years, a “400‑year history of mulatto people in fictional form”, which she must publish in order to get tenure. That her son’s unusual behaviour may merit a doctor’s diagnosis. And, finally, that the beautiful house and its accoutrements don’t belong to them; the family are merely house sitting for Jane’s wealthy screenwriter friend Brett, because the only places they can afford in the greater LA area are “not just overpriced but ugly, smelly, and dark”.Senna’s novel resists obvious answers, rejects the attempt to neatly package something as complex and ordinary as a human life. Near the end, Jane herself looks through the windows of the house at her family. The view seems “flat, staged, an imitation of life” – the architecturally interesting house, we realise, is itself a sort of gigantic television. But even as Jane grasps that her picture-perfect dreams are hollow, we gain a poignant sense of their source: an unmoored childhood bouncing between her divorced Black father and white mother – a youth spent, appropriately enough, watching TV. It’s a scene that perfectly sums up this allusive, artfully assembled book.Chelsea Leu£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA story of survivalOotlinJenni FaganOotlinJenni FaganA story of survivalThe Scottish novelist and poet Jenni Fagan wrote this powerful memoir more than two decades ago. It began when she tried writing a suicide note. But it struck her that it “was incredibly sad to think a small assemblage of words” was all that she would leave behind. So she borrowed a typewriter and for weeks sat and smoked and drank coffee, while typing her life story up to the age of 16. Although she vowed never to look at it again, that manuscript kept her alive.Fagan only returned to it years later. She realised then that Ootlin was “politically more important than anything else I might write”. At its heart, it is “a story about how some stories saved me and others destroyed me”. Fagan spent her entire childhood in care. The government, foster parents and social workers all told stories about her, stories that convinced her that she was “some kind of monster”. Later, when she obtained her social work files, she realised she had been brainwashed into believing the story “that I was the problem”. Fortunately, other stories nurtured her, because this is also about how Fagan escapes from “the unbearable hideousness of life” through the magic of words and books.Beautifully written, with flashes of dark humour throughout what is a shocking, heartbreaking memoir, Ootlin tells the story of Fagan’s childhood: constantly shuffled between foster parents and kids’ homes carrying a few possessions in bin bags, sleeping rough, raped at the age of 12, a suicide attempt, and escaping it all through drugs: “I stay high because there is a train going five hundred miles an hour next to me at all times and on every carriage there is a memory I can’t bear.” Somehow she survives this childhood, buoyed up by individual acts of kindness from friends or social workers. Incredibly, she also manages to be a “grade-A student” at school, and decides at the age of eight she wants to be a writer.The winner of the 2025 Gordon Burn prize, this is an astonishing story of survival. Fagan wants it to be a “lighthouse on a distant shore” for others who, like her, are labelled as “ootlin”: “one of the queer folk who never belonged”. Fagan’s important book argues eloquently and movingly that we need to create a society where no child has to live in fear.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Or, rather, an equalisation: a much-needed rebalancing after 150 years during which, we were told, everything was driven by males strutting, brawling and shagging, with females just along for the ride. This reckoning has finally arrived at language.The origins of our species’ exceptional communication skills constitutes one of the more nebulous zones of the larger evolutionary narrative, because many of the bits of the human anatomy that allow us to communicate – notably the brain and the vocal tract – are soft and don’t fossilise. The linguistic societies of Paris and London even banned talk of evolution around 1870, and the subject only made a timid comeback about a century later. Plenty of theories have been tossed into the evidentiary void since then, mainly by men, but now evolutionary biologist Madeleine Beekman, of the University of Sydney, has turned her female gaze on the problem.Her theory, which she describes as having been hiding in plain sight, is compelling: language evolved in parallel with caring for our “underbaked” newborns, because looking after a creature as helpless as a human baby on the danger-filled plains of Africa required more than one pair of hands (and feet). It needed a group among whom the tasks of food-gathering, childcare and defence could be divided. A group means social life, which means communication.The evidence to support Beekman’s theory isn’t entirely lacking, though a lot of it is, necessarily, circumstantial. We know that the compromise that natural selection hit upon to balance the competing anatomical demands of bipedalism and an ever-expanding brain was to have babies come out early – before that brain and its bony casing were fully formed.One of the discoveries of the newly feminised wave of evolutionary science has been that alloparents – individuals other than the biological parents who contribute parenting services – played a critical role in ensuring the survival of those half-cooked human children. Another is that stone age women hunted alongside men. In the past it was assumed that hunting bands were exclusively male, and one theory held that language arose to allow them to cooperate. But childcare was another chore that called for cooperation, probably also between genders, and over years, not just hours or days.Luckily, the reconfiguration of the head and neck required to accommodate the ballooning brain had a side-effect of remoulding the throat, giving our ancestors more precise control over their utterances. With the capacity to generate a large range of sounds came the ability to convey a large range of meanings. To begin with, this was useful for coordinating childcare, but as speech became more sophisticated, alloparents – particularly grandmothers – used it to transmit their accumulated knowledge, thereby nurturing infants who were even better equipped to survive. The result of this positive feedback loop wasHomo sapiens, the sole survivor of a once diverse lineage.Alas, Beekman takes a very long time to get to this exciting idea. She spends about half the book laying the groundwork, padding it out with superfluous vignettes as if she is worried the centre won’t hold. Once she gets there, she makes some thought-provoking observations. Full-blown language probably emerged about 100,000 years ago, she thinks, but only in our line – not in those of our closest relatives. “We may have made babies with Neanderthals and Denisovans,” she writes, “but I don’t think we had much to talk about.”And whereas others have argued that language must have predatedHomo sapiens, because without it the older speciesHomoerectuscouldn’t have crossed the forbidding Wallace Line – the deep-water channel that separates Asia and Australasia – she draws on her deep knowledge of social insects to show that communication as relatively unsophisticated as that of bees or ants could have done the job.Having made a persuasive case for the role of alloparents in the evolution of language, Beekman concludes that we did ourselves a disservice when we shrank our basic unit of organisation down from the extended to the nuclear family. Maybe, but historians including Peter Laslett have dated this important shift to the middle ages, long before the Industrial Revolution where she places it, and the damage isn’t obvious yet. Language is still being soaked up by young children; it’s still a vehicle for intergenerational learning. It may take a village to raise a child, but as Beekman herself hints, a village can be constituted in different ways.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Staying at the Beach Hotel, which is occupied exclusively by “middle-aged foreign correspondents”, she jostles with other reporters for stories while maintaining less-than-cordial relations with her fixer, Nasser. It could almost be a comedy of manners, with sketches of staff members and scenes from the hotel lobby. But it isn’t because, as the hotel owner puts it, “Gaza is a prison in non-stop war”.Vulture is a caustic study of what it means to report from a conflict, and particularly relevant to the current moment. It’s a knowing portrait by Greenwood, who was a freelance reporter in Jerusalem between 2010 and 2013, and later a foreign affairs correspondent at this newspaper. Her antiheroine visits a morgue, where the bodies of children, “dusted in sand and blood”, wear torn Spider-Man pyjamas. She narrowly escapes a bombed hospital, which is “running out of anaesthetic and even basic painkillers”. Still, her editor requires stories, and so – oblivious to the personal toll on Nasser – she pursues increasingly dangerous lines of inquiry. None of the other journalists has “stepped foot near a terror tunnel”, Greenwood tells us, so we follow Byrne in pursuit of this exclusive. Meanwhile, a photographer is killed, and she befriends a strange, hostile child, all the while witnessing scene after scene of unimaginable destruction.In Byrne, Greenwood has created an acerbic character, reluctant or unable to offer emotions in the face of horrifying eventsThe title of the book is testament to its wry tone, and ultimately its position. In Byrne, Greenwood has created a particularly acerbic character, reluctant or perhaps unable to offer sincere emotions in the face of horrifying events. Her battle-weary sense of humour, however, cannot last, and Byrne’s mental state becomes increasingly unstable. She believes a bird – identified as a pigeon, but described more like a vulture – is tormenting her. Her eyes are yellow; she winces with pain when she walks. Greenwood handles this descent well; the narration remains jocular, even arrogant, meaning it never feels hackneyed.A brief foray into newsroom pressures and expectations is lightly handled, but Greenwood punctures it succinctly. As a bereaved mother says to Byrne: “You come, you watch us die, watch us grieve, take our stories, go home. Do you help? No. My husband cleans your sheets, you kill his family.” It is a stark rebuttal to Byrne’s self-pity.Occasionally, Greenwood’s creative writing feels less successful than the news writing within it: the protagonist’s filed copy is sometimes clearer than the prose itself. But Vulture remains a remarkably skilful debut. Greenwood’s style is compelling and blackly comic; the story could not be more serious.Vulture by Phoebe Greenwood is published by Europa (£16.99).

And while that may not sound like a worthy subject for Pushing Buttons, bear with me.I am now 54 – and so officially in my mid-50s – and I still write about video games for a living. I play video games every day; I work in a home office where I’m surrounded by video games. When I’m not playing them, I’m probably thinking about them. But at times like this, I think: maybe should I stop someday? Is there an upper limit on how long someone can do games journalism? Certainly I only know of a handful of people my age who are still writing about games on a full-time basis. Some of my friends outside the industry still play games, but usually only one or two a year –EA Sports FC, maybe, the latest blockbusting narrative adventure, Nintendo with the kids. If you’re not careful, life has a way of shepherding you away from your interests.I now find it difficult to keep up with some areas of the industry. The world of esports feels utterly alien – the multitude of leagues and competitions, the emerging superstars, the controversies. Following it all is a full-time job, one that is more suited to a sports writer. I’m also way behind on influencers and content creators – I don’t watchKai Cenat,LazarBeamorQuarterJade, though I have a vague sense of who they are and how important they have become as arbiters of taste. When I go on press trips to see new games, I’m old enough to be a parent to most of the young writers and creators I meet.The thing is, I’m still obsessed with how games work and how they’re made. I belong to a generation that assumed games would always be for kids, but they’re patently not now. From the nostalgic adventureLost Records: Bloom and Rage, which deals with middle-aged regret to theGod of Warseries with its study of parenthood and legacy (and part of the“dadification of games”trend, which started when a certain generation of developers started to have kids), video games now tell stories that span a whole lifetime. So we need journalists of all ages to write about them. Consider film journalism. Roger Ebert wrote about film for the Chicago Sun-Times until his death in 2013; the Observer’s late, great film critic Philip French officially retired at 80 but kept writing about cinema until he died two years later. They never stop watching and enjoying movies, so why should they have stopped writing about them?View image in fullscreenNostalgic adventure … Lost Records: Bloom and Rage.Photograph: Don’t NodI now have a longer history in games playing than a huge majority of the younger writers I read, commission and admire. I played Pac-Man when it first arrived; I owned aCommodore 64and aMega Drive; I reviewed a game on the Virtual Boy, for god’s sake. At the risk of this becoming a self-indulgent take onRoy Batty’s closing speech, I’ve seen things you peoplewouldbelieve, but perhaps didn’t actually witness. If history has taught us anything, it’s that first-hand experience is vital in understanding sociocultural impact. And while, today, anyone can load up Space Invaders on an emulator, the experience ofseeingthat game in 1978, in its context of disco, the early home computing revolution and Star Wars mania, has a kind of emotional patina that is hard to conjure in 2025.I often say how vitally important it is to keep playing – whether you’re playing video games, chess, football or historical battle re-enactments. It’s also important to keep asking questions about the world and the things we enjoy. And when you’ve been doing that long enough, you get to know how the stories often end. Currently, we’re worried about censorship in games, thanks to the machinations of payment processing companies. But I’ve been here before – I’ve been throughMary WhitehouseandJack Thompsonand a 100 tabloid moral panics. It’s reassuring to know that this too shall pass.You are always an active part of what you enjoy – the books you read, the teams you support, the gigs you go to. Life is a network of experiences between which we get to draw our own connections and conclusions, and create our own maps of the vast, dizzying cultural landscape we live in. This is as true at the age of 95 as it was at 16, or in my case, at age 54.In short, you’re stuck with me. The game, I hope, is far from over.What to playView image in fullscreenRetro … Gradius Origins.Photograph: KonamiAs I’m in a nostalgic mood, I would like to recommend the retro collectionGradius OriginsfromKonami and developer M2, the undisputed expert in updating classic titles to modern machines. Origins gathers all six instalments in the revered arcade shoot-’em-up series, including Gradius 1-3 and the spin-off Salamander titles, including Japanese, North American and often prototype versions, and it adds an impressive new addition, Salamander 3.These are superlative side-scrollers with cool spacecraft, excellent weapon power-up systems and surreal biomechanical landscapes and bosses. Enemy attack patterns are intense yet beautifully choreographed, the action precise and unforgiving (although you do get to save your progress this time round, unlike the originals). Alongside the games, there are tantalising digital galleries including arcade flyers, concept art and guides to all the enemy ships.

It seems there are plans for anApex Legends movie, to go alongside the publisher’s Sims film that is in the works. Personally, I’d rather see a Mirror’s Edge or Titanfall movie, or even better a new Mirror’s Edge or Titanfall game.Over the weekend, the video game retail site GOGoffered 13 mature-rated games for free, including Postal 2 and House Party – and one-million players took them up on the offer.

Is it market fatigue, tech shifts, or something else?”There are a number of reasons, I think. In a similar way to how certain movie genres continually disappear and return, partly it’s do withgenerational cycles of influence. A game developer who loved a genre as a child may, as an adult, seek to re-create it – part of the reason we’re seeing so many low-poly survival horror games now is that the creators grew up playing Resident Evil on the original PlayStation.There’s also acultural,even sociopolitical element– developers are inspired by the world around them and it could be that some contemporary events or themes are best realised by specific game genres. So we may see a sudden boost in military real-time strategy games during periods of global instability and conflict. I think there aretechnical influences, too. When a new console or graphics card is released, there is a rush to produce classic genres on that platform, because veteran players who fondly recall those game types like to see them reinvented.Then there’s theinterplay between nostalgia and innovationin the rediscovery of old genres. In a market where everyone is making Souls-likes, hero shooters and deck-building games, there’s value in producing a new take on, say, a 1990s-style interactive movie game, or a graphic adventure, or a button-bashing multi-sports sim – this way, you’re producing something a little different while still harking back to much-loved archetypes. It’s a win-win situation.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dmitri Weideli, an executive producer at the company, has a hard time replying to this question at first, and then settles on an answer that seems rather broad. “We want to make games that matter and that give players a great story that allows them to go through different kinds of emotions,” he says. “We try to diversify the kind of games we create, but at the same time, keep the same spirit.”There’s certainly something to this idea of diversification. Since its founding in 2008, the French outfit has made action-adventure games about memory, narrative games involving magical college students, and a role-playing game about a Georgian vampire. Recently, it released Jusant, an ecological sci-fi fable that was also a refreshingly realistic take on rock climbing.Aphelion, the team’s latest, does have a little in common with Jusant, at least. It is another science-fiction game, but one with a glitteringly hard edge. It’s based around a mission to the edge of the solar system where an icy world called Persephone has been discovered. Somewhat inevitably, the crew crashlands on the planet, and what follows is a journey of exploration, survival and stealth in a harsh alien climate.View image in fullscreenA long way from Jusant … Aphelion.Photograph: Don’t NodIt’s not hard to look at the trailer with its grappling hook and walls of climbable ice and view this as a spiritual successor to Jusant. This is not the case, according to Weideli. The team working on the new game actually came directly from another project, the episodic supernatural game, Tell Me Why.The emphasis is different, too. Aphelion’s climbing is simpler than Jusant’s, which could get very technical in places, and it’s not the central preoccupation this time around. Several developers who worked on Jusant have joined the Aphelion team in the last few months, however, and have shared their experiences dealing with rope physics and vertical level design.The real inspiration for Aphelion largely came from movies such as Interstellar, The Martian, Ad Astra and Arrival. “We wanted to create a great story-driven game,” says Weideli. “But we wanted to go within another genre, that led us to a more action-adventure oriented game.”View image in fullscreenVertical level … Aphelion.Photograph: Don’t NodIntriguingly, everywhere you look in Aphelion there’s the presence of real science. Persephone itself is based onPlanet Nine, a hypothetical large planet that many astronomers believe orbits the sun far beyond Neptune where it is patiently awaiting discovery.But Planet Nine is only the starting point for the fiction here. “Planet Nine was an important source of inspiration,” Weideli says, “and an interesting scientific grounding for an adventure featuring astronauts who explore a new planet. [But] we then added our own lore, imagination, and most importantly, human drama.”Aphelion is also pitched as a collaboration with theEuropean Space Agency. “The ESA team gave us access to space experts and scientists, with whom we could discuss and challenge our ideas about the story of the game,” Weideli says. “For example, our narrative team could discuss the scientific aspects of a space or extraterrestrial mission, review the vocabulary of a space mission, how astronauts talk to each other during a mission. They also offered to review and give advice regarding the technology.”The design team won’t be playing things entirely straight, however. Alongside exploration and survival, there’s that final element: Aphelion is also a stealth game. Weideli isn’t ready to talk about it yet, but something has survived out in the ice of Persephone, and it doesn’t seem entirely friendly.Whatever lurking horrors await, it’s nice to see Don’t Nod back making complex, hard-to-classify video games, after a recent round of redundancies. With so many people working in games at the moment engaged in an awful real-world spin on the survival genre, it’s thrilling to see a team still turning to the stars.Aphelion is released next year on PC, PS5 and XboxExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsAstronomyEuropean Space AgencyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Smith’s follow-up show mirrors Gilbert in a different way, by addressing an issue the Welshman became associated with in standup and documentary: infertility. Foot Spa Half Empty is about Smith’s low sperm count, discovered as he and his partner start trying for a child. It arranges a suite of humiliating stories and manic overthinking comedy around the more substantial tale of our host’s visit to a clinic to have his sperm tested – in Smith’s hands, it’s as surefire an anecdote for self-abasing standup as it’s possible to imagine.Give or take a weak ending, it’s a killer stage return from a man now increasingly recognisable from your TV screens. Not that fame has gone to his head; Google (“people also search for Robert Mugabe”) has seen to that. He did briefly worry that success might defang a comic style rooted in anxiety and failure. But lo, big-time Smith still sweats the small stuff, and very funnily. See his section about being mocked for being a poor skier, another deconstructing the phrase “wrong place, wrong time”, and a memorable set piece about a gull with a steak knife in its beak harassing punters in a beer garden.These are big-impact routines, all the funnier for their tone of voice, which combines a relish for the absurd, an inability to let things go and an adhesive relationship with indignity. All come into play as the 36-year-old relates his fertility journey, which finds him buying a magic spell from Amazon (“And if that worked, I’m scared of that baby …”), roadtesting old wives’ tales, and pontificating on the milestones that signal we’re getting old – which include, in Smith’s case, a father-son tutorial in extra-strong mints.You can bet that phrase “extra strong” gets a workout from Smith: not a man to leave a casual figure of speech un-interrogated. It may be wearisome to possess, but Smith’s worrisome personality is catnip for comedy lovers. With him at the mic, laughs, at least, go forth and multiply.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsComedy (Culture)Rhod GilbertreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then the New Yorker had, in her words, “a stroke at 30: isn’t that so creative?” Diagnosed with a PFO, or (could itbemore perfect for her comedy?) a “hole in the heart”, she underwent surgery, cancelling her 2023 fringe run. Now she’s back, with the show telling that sorry tale – although in the 33-year-old’s account, nothing could be further from the “trauma comedy” with which the festival’s arteries sometimes feel clotted.The dance with sincerity Broad Strokes performs is in fact part of its considerable charm. We know Cohen for her deranged self-consciousness, splaying across the stage, in song and standup, the babbling inner voice of the self-obsessed millennial. How would such a persona process this medical emergency? As an opportunity to advertise their uniqueness, of course! And so Cohen considers her stroke in relation to once being labelled (horror of horrors!) “a normal girl” by a casting director, and as a vindication of a lifetime’s health anxiety. “I wasn’t a hypochondriac,” she trills, “I was a prophet!”Andrew Doherty: Sad Gay Aids Play review – twice the satire from Gay Witch Sex Cult comicRead moreIn a beautifully constructed hour, we’re led from Cohen’s experience of suffering her stroke, via flashbacks to her “migraines with a visual aura” in childhood, to her stint in hospital (“honey, we’re gonna need a gayer nurse!”). With Frazer Hadfield on piano, an array of songs (about her need for “complete control”; about the many foibles for which a stroke might be divine punishment) suggest how Cohen is processing this event emotionally.Not that the spoken parts of Broad Strokes are emotionally guarded. Far from it: Cohen conceals precisely nothing of her attention-seeking inner life, the whole misadventure being rendered in her usual cascade of overshares, sassy asides, and glamorous or goofy voices – none funnier than the sultry femme fatale she becomes when addressing her surgeon Dr Love. Two final songs, meanwhile, both minister to and subvert our expectation that some learning might arise from this odyssey. This is such a rich, perfectly formed show from one of the most can’t-take-your-eyes-off-them acts in comedy.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)FestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Composer Jennifer Walshe reveals what fed into her epic opera, from low-gravity procreation to Shrek in spaceJennifer WalsheWed 6 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhy write an opera aboutMars? Because Mars isn’t just a planet. It’s a philosophy, an ideology. The way humans think about it changes over time, reflecting the unstable mix of assumptions, hopes, dreams and anxieties that define each historical moment.In 1965,Nasa’s Mariner 4probe flew past Mars and beamed the first closeup images of the red planet (or of any other planet) back to Earth. Prior to that flight, humans knew the planet only through telescopes, and it was thought that its surface would feature vegetation and that life may have evolved there. Mariner 4 revealed the truth: it was a rocky, cratered place seemingly devoid of life. PresidentLyndon B Johnson declaredthat “it may just be that life as we know it, with its humanity, is more unique than many have thought, and we must remember this”. The New York Times went further: “Mars, it now appears, is a desolate world.”One option for space pregnancy is to strap a woman into a subterranean centrifugeIf like me you were not then born, try to imagine what it would have been like to be alive in that summer of 1965. In June,Ed White becamethe first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk. (The Soviet cosmonautAlexei Leonovhad preceded him by just under three months.) White’s experience of the spacewalk was so deeply transcendent that he described re-entering the capsule as “the saddest moment of my life”. Life magazine devoted an issue to White’s “Glorious Walk in the Cosmos”: millions pored over the images. Only a few weeks later, Mariner 4’s images of Mars were broadcast on TV, showing its desolation. We started a summer floating in White’s cosmic bliss, believing that we might not be alone in the universe, only to end it with those hopes quashed.View image in fullscreenHistoric … the first all-female spaceflight crew, including Lauren Sánchez third from left.Photograph: Blue Origin Handout/EPAIn another summer, 60 years later, we are still immersed in news related to space and technology. Spring was already busy enough. April saw the launch of the first all-female spaceflight, led byLauren Sánchez– the then fiancee, now wife, of billionaire Jeff Bezos – in a rocket made by Bezos’s aerospace company Blue Origin. In May, Elon Musk, another billionaire with an aerospace company,stepped down from running Dogewhile wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt.In June, the billionaire venture capitalist,seasteadingenthusiast and early Trump adopterPeter Thielgave an interview to the New York Times in which he declared: “Mars is supposed to be more than a science project. It’s … a political project.” In July, scientists at the National Astronomy Meeting announced evidence of10,000 miles of ancient riverbedsin a part of Mars not previously thought to have featured water. ThenSotheby’s sold the largest Martian meteoritein existence to a private bidder for about $5.3m (nearly £4m) – and President Trump signed an executive order aimed at “preventing woke AI in the federal government”.Why write an opera about Mars? Because when we talk about Mars we are talking about ourselves – about our ideas of the future, and about the operations of power in the present.Watch a trailer for MarsSo, then,howto write an opera about Mars? You begin by choosing a librettist. The writer Mark O’Connell was the obvious choice. We both share an interest in technology, AI, Silicon Valley and a bundle of ideologies that may or may not be on the average person’s radar. These range from transhumanism and futurism through topronatalism– a movement, increasingly popular in Silicon Valley, that advocates for improving fertility and increasing birthrates to address demographic decline in western countries.Our research was far-ranging, taking what might be termed a hard science-fiction approach. We started with mundane details. How do astronauts exercise? Eat? Shower? Poop? Is it possible for a pregnancy to be carried to term in zero gravity, or Martian gravity, which is 38% of Earth’s? The answers range from the benign (using Ared, theadvanced resistive exercise device) to the not so benign (one option is to strap the woman into a subterranean centrifuge throughout the pregnancy).View image in fullscreen‘I turned to AI’ … Walshe and her co-director Tom Creed during rehearsals.Photograph: Ste MurrayThe distance between Earth and Mars – approximately 140m miles – means that real-time communication is an impossibility. We wondered how human relationships would be conducted if conversations could only occur via voice note. Everything we researched led to more questions. How might our understanding of ourselves, and of the universe, be changed if we were to discover life on another planet? Would the legal framework outlined in theOuter Space Treaty of 1967work? Would humans be doomed to repeat the horrific logic of colonisation, or is another way possible?Our opera centres on an all-female mission. Four astronauts – Svetlana, Sally, Judith and Valentina, named after the first four women to go into space – are on their way to Mars aboard the spaceship Buckminster, with only Arabella, the onboard AI, for company. Their mission is to search for water to enable the development of the commune that has already been established there.I analysed hours of celestial audio, including recordings of the toilet on the Space StationThe journey is long, and made more difficult by the fact that they only have Shrek the Third and a few seasons of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. As they prepare to land, they discover their mission has been the subject of a hostile takeover and that they now work for Shadowfax Ventures, a company helmed by libertarian billionaire Axel Parchment. They must now confront isolation, sinister ideologies, the prospect of alien life and a vibeshift toward corporate authoritarianism.As we staked out the plot, the next challenge for me was how to cover this broad territory sonically. I started by thinking about the actual sounds astronauts hear in the different environments they inhabit in space. The sonic overwhelm of a rocket launching; the whirr of fans inside the craft; the industrial clack and punch of machinery. I analysed recordings of the incredibly noisy ambient sounds of the different modules of the InternationalSpaceStation (ISS), and figured out ways to orchestrate and re-create these sounds.View image in fullscreenIrish National Opera’s production premieredat the Galway arts festival in July.Photograph: Pat RedmondI listened to hours and hours of space audio – whistles, auroral choruses, interstellar audio recordings made by Voyager 1, sonifications of the light curves of different exoplanets and Chris Hadfield’s recordings of the toilet on the ISS. I haunted theSpace Exploration Stack Exchange, where the community helped me with questions about how a double bass bow might behave in 38% gravity, how a trumpet or violin might degrade in a Martian habitat.Astronauts seem to have a thing for synth music. A look through Dutch astronaut’sAndré Kuiper’s ISS playlist shows an interest in Vangelis, Mike Oldfield and Brian Eno. I placed synthesisers within the orchestra and also in the spaceship itself. And for our villain, a character Mark described in musical terms as “bad EDM”, I turned to AI. It seemed apt to fight like with like, and I prompted the system with genre descriptions like “bro step” and “fashwave”.In the opera, the astronauts resist the hostile takeover of the future in their own way, no matter the risk. However dystopian the imaginings of Mark and myself, for our astronauts there is ultimately resistance and hope, defiance and even the possibility of joy – all realised through collective action. As our team worked over the summer, aware of the very real human challenges and horrors outside our rehearsal room – in a world that seems to be increasingly controlled by a small number of incredibly rich individuals imposing their will on the rest of us – I was insistently reminded of the fact that it is through coming together that we Earthlings have power and meaning.Mars is atAbbey theatre, Dublin, from 7 to 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicMarsSpaceAbbey theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can even spot the real-life ferris wheel that hints at the fairground finale to come.Greaseisn’t the first musical to be given Secret Cinema’s signature immersive treatment – there was a Moulin Rouge in 2017 – but it is the most ambitious, with a live cast performing all of its memorable numbers in what is essentially a hybrid show.The original movie plays on overhead screens, with occasional footage intercut from a black-and-white stage feed, and a (fabulous) band provides the live soundtrack. It takes a chaotic quarter-hour to get your head around what you’re watching. The actors aren’t lip-syncing their lines, so if you’re following the screen it looks like clunky dubbing. The dialogue regularly gets lost behind the music: perhaps the sound mix will get better over the course of the run. Perhaps it’s not important – this is, ultimately, a full-costume karaoke night, the chance for folk to belt out Hopelessly Devoted to You and Greased Lightnin’ without any fear of being removed by an usher.View image in fullscreenFaithful rendering … Grease: The Immersive Movie MusicalAs for the 30-strong cast, none of them would shame the West End. Stephanie Costi is a sweetly voiced Sandy, while Lucy Penrose reconfirms that Rizzo is easily the show’s most compelling character. Some of the performances feel impressionistic, and Jennifer Weber’s choreography riffs only gently on the original, but you wouldn’t expect anything else of a production dedicated to the faithful rendering of the movie’s world. Matt Costain’s direction does spring a couple of genuine surprises; it also co-opts those who have paid for VIP tickets as willing extras.The charismatic Waylon Jacobs provides a linchpin role, transforming the film version’s narcissistic TV presenter Vince Fontaine into an all-purpose MC and entertainment director. He leads the crowd in conga lines around Tom Rogers’ meticulous sets, from the Frosty Palace that serves up real ice cream sundaes to the gym floor where the audience can join in the iconic dance contest.

One waitress had been there for 44 years. I photographed it empty as a metaphor for people having been kept apart by the pandemic’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 6 Aug 2025 10.16 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.43 EDTShareWhen I moved to Brooklyn in 2005, I noticed people building restaurants and bars that looked like 1950s diner-style restaurants, with soda fountains and lunch counters. I’m from Canada and I don’t think there’s a period that Canadians look back on with such nostalgia. I grew up on Vancouver Island watching old US movies and thinking, as I looked across the water towards America, that they showed what the country must look like.But our idea of those times is not firsthand, and I got really curious about that, and the fact that those days were not better for most people, only a few. That false, nostalgic feeling has become dangerous, with Trump’s “make America great again” rhetoric.In 2013, I started to drive around smaller towns inPennsylvaniato look at places that remain from the 50s. There are towns where maybe the mine closed, or the highway moved, and so – unlike the diners in New York, which keep getting renovated and extended – these places stayed as they were. It feels like the past and the present are somehow taking place at the same time. It’s really beautiful.In 2015, I started an Instagram account calledAmerican Squares, which is moreaboutnostalgia than it is nostalgic. When I look at these prefabricated diners that rolled off assembly lines, so beautiful in their details, I think about how the people who invented them would be shocked that we’re looking back now in this way. They were trying to get to the moon: they were future-oriented people.There is a conspicuous absence of people in this series – making for almost postapocalyptic scenesI first came across this particular hot dog joint in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, called the Very Best, in around 2016. I noticed that it had a lovely Vitrolite storefront and a great typographic sign. It had closed the year before, having originally opened in 1921. But then a local took it on, restored it beautifully and reopened it in September 2019. When I passed by again in 2021, the owner was following social distancing guidelines, which is why it was so quiet.I’m often looking to give a sense of time and place to my photos, and one clue is the image of Hall and Oates on the jukebox. Daryl Hall is from Pottstown and John Oates grew up in the same county. The vintage arcade game Centipede was developed byAtariand co-designed by Dona Bailey – one of only a few female game programmers in the industry at the time. It was one of the first arcade games with a significant female player base.I was working on a series that eventually became my bookLunch Poems, in which this image appears. I focused on communal settings, or “third spaces” outside of home and work. We lost those spaces for a period during the pandemic and we all suffered for it in ways we maybe haven’t fully acknowledged yet.The melancholy of an empty American diner – in picturesRead moreThe Very Best was a beloved third space in this town, where you could stop and chat, where everyone was super-friendly. There was at one time a waitress who had worked there for 44 years. But I chose to photograph this business empty. What photographers leave out of the frame often influences the final meaning as much as what we include. There is a conspicuous absence of people in the pictures in this series and that’s a construct, a metaphor for having been kept apart by the pandemic, driven to despair and divided by politics. I wanted to show the separateness and the emptiness. When we look at these pictures we might ask, “What happened here?” or “What will happen next?”The Lunch Poems photographs paint an almost postapocalyptic scene. Not all the pictures in the book were made during the pandemic, but that was the prism through which I began to look at the finished images, and it shaped the editing process.I frame my photographs carefully to explore what I want to communicate. For this series, if a space was crowded, I waited for people to leave. Or I arrived just as it was opening or closing. I do wonder whether that was always responsible, as I’m guessing the business owner doesn’t want their restaurant to be captured as melancholic and empty.

His follow-up attempts something similar, but trips itself up with a split satirical focus. Sad Gay Aids Play starts out with Doherty again in deliciously bumptious persona, smugly introducing his new drama chronicling the HIV crisis. We expect another genre spoof from an act with an adroit ear for send-up. But that’s not what we get – because the show doesn’t just send up sad gay Aids plays (such as they are), it tilts at Arts Council England funding as well.The conceit is that Doherty wants to make a trashy comedy about reality TV, but ACE won’t fund it. If he wants their cash (and he needs it, because moneyed mum and dad have withdrawn their subsidy) he has to make something grittier, burlesquing his own marginal identity and exaggerating any personal trauma he may (or may not) have suffered. Hence the sub-Angels in Americadrama he’s now workshopping for us, and keeps adjusting according to live feedback from his ACE paymasters.There’s no denying that the voguish vicissitudes of arts funding – and its bias against comedy – are ripe for mockery. But Doherty’s satanic ACE caricature misses the mark here. It also obliges our host to play himself, a hapless supplicant performer, rather than the self-congratulatory alter ego that so amused audiences last year, and at the start of this show.There’s still plenty to enjoy in his play within a play, which rehashes gay life in the early 1980s. We see protagonist Harry Manlove, spurned by his homophobic mum, form a found family with friends including Freddie Mercury. It is, briefly, a carefree time – until Harry develops a cough, and starts wondering about “that last batch of semen I just took”. Doherty is a fantastic performer, and the comedy is potent in this mismatch of solemn subject matter with egotistical and ignorant actor/host. But when Doherty steers us away from that, towards his more effortful satire at ACE’s expense, the delight slightly dissipates.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the minds of Venezuelans, beauty and oil are tied to the idea of progress, modernity and our relationship with power, especially since the oil boom of the mid 20th century transformed us from a rural country to the richest nation in Latin America in the 1970s.During this time Miss Venezuela epitomised the nation’s aspirations. Even in the midst of the hardest economic and political crisis in our history, the pageants continue.Beauty pageants are a platform for personal progress and a possible way out of povertyGrowing up in Caracas in the 90s, every year the country was essentially paralysed when Miss Venezuela occurred. As part of my ongoing project Reinas, there are times when I’ve been to five or six pageants in a week. Women of all ages, the queer community, are all involved.This photograph was spontaneous. I was attending a pageant for young girls and they were rehearsing. I saw this little girl with her pink dress going up the stairs by herself, delicate and feminine, as if she’s walking towards a dream, but then you see the reality around it. They don’t match up.Women behind the lens: ‘The bridal dress is meant to present her as a queen … but to me it always felt like a cage’Read moreI know how damaging pageants can be for Venezuelan women as they impose heteronormative beauty standards, yet participants tell me they feel the most liberated in this character they have created.For Venezuelan women living through political and economic turmoil, beauty pageants are a platform for their personal progress anda possible way out of poverty. The majority of students I’ve met in theescuelas de reinas[queen schools), are from low-income families, despite the high costs involved. Winning smaller titles can open the way to bigger ones, and with them, public figure status. This can lead to jobs in modelling, the media or entertainment industry – even politics.Irene Sáez, Miss Venezuela 1981 and Miss Universe, became the mayor of Chacao and later ran for the presidency in 1998 against Hugo Chavez. The connection of beauty with power isn’t just symbolic.In 2002, anational striketook place. The whole country came to a standstill, schools were shut, everything was closed. I missed three months of school. Part of this strike was halting oil shipments. Thelargest oil tanker that had anchored in Lake Maracaiborefusing to move, was named after the beauty queen Pilín León.

I’d received the news late-afternoon, then went out for cocktails with two friends to celebrate. I remember the evening well: we’d gone somewhere loud but not too loud; I ordered a fluorescent orange drink that I didn’t enjoy. Before I went to bed, I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone. “This could really change your life,” he said.Sometime in the early hours of the following morning, I woke up with a ringing in my ears that has notgone away since.Tinnitus often appears out of nowhere. Some describe it as like standing next to the engine of a plane, or caught within a colony of flying bats. The sound I woke with wasn’t so bad: a sort of midpoint between the hiss of television static and the roar of the ocean. At first I thought it must have been coming from my phone, which was usually inches away from my face as I slept. I then searched my room for malfunctioning electronics, before realising with bracing horror that the noise was coming from inside my brain.View image in fullscreen‘I’d spent many years going to loud concerts and playing drums in a band’ … Williams circa 2015Photograph: Courtesy of Lara WilliamsThe condition can bedivided into three categories: subjective tinnitus (the perception of sound where there is none); objective tinnitus (where there is a sound within or close to the ear that another person can sometimes hear); and somatic tinnitus,which worsens with body movement. Mine was the former: a phantom sound. Little is known about what causes it, but one theory is that loud sounds damage the hairs in the cochlea, flattening them like stems of corn after a storm. The hairs normally pick up sounds and, without them, the brain seeks out sounds from other parts of the ear, sending back signals that translate toa perpetual illusory hum. I’d spent many years going to loud concerts and playing drums in a band, only occasionally protecting my hearing with earplugs. I started to blame myself.The first few days felt long and hard. It seemed absurd to be so troubled by what is basically an annoying sound, but its inescapability and totality was maddening. The world was suddenly bifurcated into quiet spaces, in which I had nothing to mask the tinnitus, and loud spaces, which threatened to damage my hearing further. I couldn’t stop catastrophising: “I will never hear silence again. I will always be too distracted to write. I will be driven mad by loud sounds.”I became anxious and, like21% of tinnitus patients, Ideveloped suicidal thoughts.My GP was unsympathetic, telling me it would not go away but I would get used to it – and no, I couldn’t have any Valium. A few days before Christmas, I went to stay with my boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Ironically, there were copies of the Max Ehrmann poem Desiderata all over the house – printed off in the guest room, hanging beside the bathroom sink. It was one of his mum’s favourites; she identified strongly with the message: “Go placidly amid the noise … remember what peace there may be in silence.”View image in fullscreenWilliams: ‘The white of the snow felt like an equivalent … tinnitus is often described as white noise.’Photograph: Lucy RidgesI read online studies about tinnitus compulsively. I discovered advice to seek out quiet spaces in which I could place my hands over my ears to get a measure of whether it was getting any better or worse. But this only exacerbated my nerves. On New Year’s Day, I couldn’t stop crying; I felt stuck in an abject state of misery and panic.I began hypnotherapy, hoping I could trick my brain into not hearing the never-ending noise. My hypnotherapist told me this was not how it worked. Instead, she tried to teach me how to separate my feelings of anxiety from the sounds in my ears, and how to relax; sending me away with audio files of women whispering about the sea.I began sleeping to the sound of brown noise – named after “Brownian motion”, the random movement of particles in a liquid – replacing one hum with another. I practised progressive muscle relaxation, my antidepressants kicked in and I began the long process ofhabituation– learning to tune out the unwanted, unstoppable sound.Just over a month after I first developed tinnitus, I was on holiday in Brasov, Transylvania – a 30th-birthday present from my sister and mum. Towards the end of the trip, the three of us were walking through the mountains, and when I looked back I realised I couldn’t see either of them. I was surrounded only by recently settled snow. There was something about the white of the snow and the ringing in my ears that felt equivalent; blank and unintimidating, somehow. Tinnitus is often described as white noise, but white is achromatic – a colour that isn’t really a colour. I knew then that I’d make peace with this sound that isn’t really a sound, my new version of silence.That was a decade ago, and these days I’ve learned to accept and adjust. I’d railed so violently against my tinnitus, and achieved nothing. Now I acknowledge what I cannot change, and it doesn’t bother me at all.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is strange that we talk about date-night dressing so much when we all know that the most fun nights to outfit-plan are really nights out with friends. Well, not actually strange at all, just the patriarchy doing what it does, I guess, and making it feel as if the world as seen from a male point of view – in this case, the view of a frock from the other side of a restaurant table on date night – is automatically the point of view that matters.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In a fashion context, it just makes no sense. I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine, but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys.Fashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderieOn a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.Fashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.View image in fullscreen‘Nights out with friends are the most fun to get dressed for’. A scene from the film Sex and the City 2.Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto/AllstarSome features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.But the love language of fashion between the girls isn’t just about solidarity, it is about joy. It is about clothes that are chosen not because they make you look taller or thinner, but because they make you smile. Which are, of course, the clothes that make you truly beautiful. It is about outfits that get captured in selfies, that you treasure not because of what you were wearing but because of the good time you had, and so are knitted into core memories. Nights out with friends, with pals who know your silly side as well as your smart side, who might rib you for wearing double leopard-print but would defend to the hilt your right to do so if anyone said a word against it, are the nights that are the most fun to get dressed for.

Don’t. Raid the fridge and fill it with all manner of scrumptiousnessTom HuntWed 6 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareSome recipes, such asthe gnocchi featured here last week, require only the fluffy insides of a baked potato, leaving the skins behind. Plenty of people leave the skins of their jacket spuds uneaten, too, though heaven knows why: it’s easily the best bit. These humble leftovers are an opportunity to make one of the most indulgent savoury treats known to humankind: loaded potato skins. I love them with just sea salt and a dollop of mayonnaise or soured cream, but they’re also gorgeous piled high with whatever bits and pieces you have to hand, turning scraps and leftovers into something that’s totally scrumptious.Fridge-raid loaded potato skinsThis recipe is about being inventive and making the most of whatever you have in the house. I grill my loaded skins, rather than baking them, both to save energy and to speed up the cooking, which still achieves that perfect crunchy skin.Feel free to experiment with flavours and textures. Some of my favourite combinations include broccoli, bacon and blue cheese; crumbled sausage with cream and sage; and tomatillo salsa with black beans and a cooling dollop of yoghurt. When I made these skins, I had some leftoveraubergine curry, a nub of grana padano, yoghurt, the end of a jar of chilli jam and some mint leaves, and they all came together beautifully.By embracing leftovers and simple pantry staples, this recipe shows how easy it is to make a show-stopping snack or meal from ingredients that might otherwise be forgotten or thrown in the food compost.Serves2Leftover potato skins, ideally with a little flesh still left on – aim for 1-2 skins per personOil, for brushingSea salt andblack pepperOptional toppings and fillings (to taste; you’ll need between 1 and 3 tbsp in total per potato skin)Leftover cooked or raw vegetables– steamed greens, roast veg, cherry tomatoesCooked protein or pulses– bacon, lentils, drained cooked beansLeftover cooked stew or meat– chilli con carne, bolognese, crumbled cooked sausage, shredded chicken20g cheese, such as cheddar, feta or blue cheese, crumbled or gratedSauce– tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, pestoA creamy element– yoghurt, creme fraiche, hummusA fewfresh herb sprigs– parsley, mint, chives, spring onionsCondiments to finish– mayonnaise, mustard, hot sauce, chutney, lemon juice, pickle brineBrush both sides of each leftover potato skin lightly with oil and season with sea salt. Put the skins cut side up on an oven tray and grill for five minutes, until they’re starting to crisp up. Flip and grill the other side for another five minutes, until golden and blistered, then serve with mayo or soured cream, or with yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon, or load with your own choice of toppings.To load the skins, start with one to two tablespoons of any wet ingredients such as cooked or raw vegetables, then top with a tablespoon of cooked pulses or protein or leftover meat or stew such as chilli con carne or bolognese. Scatter on 20g crumbled or grated cheese per skin, then return to the grill for five minutes, until hot and bubbling. Finish with a spoonful of salsa, chutney or pesto, or with a tablespoon of something creamy. Garnish with chopped herbs or spring onions and a drizzle of hot sauce, lemon juice or pickle brine for welcome sharpness, then serve hot.Explore more on these topicsPotatoesWaste notFoodFood wasteSnacksMain courseVegetablesMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I’m sad, stressed or out of sorts, it’s my mum’s Filipino food that I crave. As a whole, Filipino food has sometimes unfairly had a reputation for being overly sweet, overly meaty and deep-fried, but with more than 7,000 islands rich in culinary traditions, there are, of course, thousands of dishes to enjoy. Bringing it back to the UK, though, when we dust off the barbecue, picnic blankets and cool bags, there’s nothing better than incorporating these sweet, sour, spicy and salty flavours for parties (or fiestas as they’re called in the Philippines). And if you’re after a sweet, refreshing treat, look out for ube ice-cream, which is gaining popularity in UK. Ube is a sweet purple yam native to the Philippines.Sweet potato fritters with red onion and sweet chilli dipping vinegar (pictured top)My mum didn’t teach me how to cook so much as how not to waste, which is why fritters are something we make weekly to use up any leftover veg. My daughter adores sweet potato, but this would also be delicious with carrot and potato. The dipping vinegar is something we make in a big batch and use all week to brighten up leftovers such as fried rice, or to dress cabbage slaw or chicken salad.Prep15 minCook30 minMakes20 small frittersFor the fritters400g sweet potato, unpeeled and grated2 large eggs4 tbsp flour– I used buckwheat, but plain flour works, too1 medium red onion, peeled and finely dicedSea saltand black pepperCoconut oil or avocado oil, for fryingFor the dipping sauce1 small red onion, peeled and finely diced2 tbsp maple syrup6 tbsp apple cider vinegar2 tbsp fish sauce, or vegan fish sauce1 red chilli, deseeded and sliced in rings or half-moonsIn a bowl, mix the sweet potato, eggs, flour, red onion and some seasoning, then set aside for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce by combining all the ingredients in a second bowl.Put a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, then drop in a little of the sweet potato batter and taste it for seasoning. Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, drop two tablespoons’ worth of batter per fritter into the pan and cook on a medium-high heat for three to five minutes, until golden brown. Flip the fritters over (they should turn easily), press down on the cooked side with a spatula, then continue frying for another few minutes.Transfer the cooked fritters to a large plate lined with kitchen paper, then scrape out any bits in the pan so they don’t burn. Repeat with the remaining batter. Be sure to space out the fritters when you fry them; if they are overcrowded, they might steam rather than go crispy-edged. Serve hot with the dipping sauce on the side.Grilled aubergine, mango and tomato saladView image in fullscreenThis is inspired byensalada talong(ensalada meaning salad and talong aubergine).

Whether it’s due to a mishandled transfer, or a sneaky suitcase thief in the arrivals hall, lost luggage can quickly turn a holiday into a stressful ordeal. Here’s what to do if yours doesn’t turn up.View image in fullscreenThe dreaded moment when you realise your baggage is missing, so get to the carousel as soon as you can.Photograph: RichardBakerHeathrow/AlamyReport your luggage as missingAll baggage is managed by the airlines from check-in to arrival. So once you are sure your luggage has not arrived, report it as missing at your airline’s desk in the baggage reclaim hall (this is sometimes operated by a third-party ground handler). If there is no one at the desk, call your airline instead.File what’s known as a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport. This official document is used to report incidents involving damaged, lost or delayed baggage. It serves as a record of the incident and is essential for initiating claims and tracking the status of the baggage.To complete the PIR, you will need to provide: the details on your baggage claim tag (attached to your boarding pass or passport); your flight number and travel itinerary; a detailed description of your luggage; contact details; and a delivery address for where you are staying.The airline will give you a reference number. Keep it safe as you will need this if you end up making a compensation or insurance claim. You can also input the reference number into theWorldTracer website, which provides up-to-date information on the status of lost baggage.Meanwhile, the airline will use the information on the PIR to locate your luggage (hopefully).View image in fullscreenReport any loss as soon as possible and be sure to know your rights.Photograph: Lakeview Images/AlamyKnow your rightsYour rights to compensation for lost luggage depend on whether you are abroad/on holiday, or arriving home, when your suitcase goes walkabout.If you have arrived at your holiday destination, you will usually be entitled to reimbursement for essential items, such as toiletries, basic clothing, medication and baby items. Some airlines offer a daily allowance for each day that your luggage is delayed, while others will reimburse you if you provide receipts for items you have bought.You will get less cash from the airline if your luggage is delayed on your return home. This is because airlines presume you have clothes and other essentials available to you at home.If your luggage is found, you will be notified by phone or email. The onus is on the airline to return your luggage to you – you shouldn’t have to go back to the airport to collect it.If your bag is still missing after 21 days, it is officially declared lost. You can then file a claim for compensation directly with the airline. You will need to include a list of lost items (with estimated values), proof of purchase if available, receipts for interim expenses, and a copy of your PIR.The maximum compensation under international law (the Montreal Convention) is about £1,000 (the exact amount depends on currency fluctuations).Depending on your cover, your travel insurance may pay out for amounts over this limit if the airline refuses to fully cover the loss.Reduce the chances of your luggage getting lostLabel your luggage inside and out with your name and contact details, and take a quick photo of your bags before checking in. Make sure you remove barcodes and tags from previous flights. Consider tracking devices such as AirTags or Bluetooth trackers for easier tracking in the event that your bag does get lost.Fly direct where possible. Direct flights significantly reduce the risk of lost luggage as they eliminate the potential for baggage transfer issues. If you need a layover, allow ample time for baggage transfers.Get to the luggage carousel as soon as you can. This will reduce the chance of your luggage being stolen or taken by someone else by mistake. Use a unique luggage tag or accessory to make your bag easily identifiable.Pack essentials, vital medication, a change of clothes and high-value items, in your hand luggage, just in case.Explore more on these topicsMoneyLost or stolenAirline industryTravel & leisureShareReuse this content"

Now claims that sunscreen is toxic flood the internet. What does the science say?Ian SampleScience editorWed 6 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 07.29 EDTShareIt’s summertime in the UK and social media is awash with influencers airing their concerns about sunscreen. Among them is reality TV star Sam Faiers from The Only Way Is Essex, who believes sunscreen is “full of toxic ingredients”. None of her family wore sunscreen, she said, adding that her children had built up “a really good tolerance” to the sun. Some of the claims appear to be fuelled by a US doctor who told his followers: “Be careful what you smear on yourself and your children.” Here we look at the science behind sunscreen and sun exposure.How does sunshine damage skin?It’s all down to the high energy ultraviolet (UV) rays. These cause premature skin ageing and wrinkles by degrading collagen and elastin. Collagen gives skin its firmness and structure, while elastin makes it stretchy. UV rays can also damage the DNA in skin cells, leading to mutations that ultimately drive skin cancers. One in three cancers globally is a skin cancer, and the main driver is UV rays.“Too much UV radiation from the sun is the main cause of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer,” said Dr Claire Knight at Cancer Research UK. “That’s why it’s important to develop good sun safety habits from a young age and protect your skin when the sun is strong using shade, clothing and sunscreen together.”Can you develop tolerance to the sun?When the summer sunshine arrives, the skin responds to protect itself. The outermost layer, the epidermis, thickens and many people develop a tan, as cells in the skin called melanocytes produce more UV-absorbing melanin. Not everyone tans though, and acquiring a tan itself results in DNA damage.“Most of that damage gets repaired, but some of it doesn’t, it causes mutations and those can go on developing throughout life to give rise to skin cancer,” said Brian Diffey, emeritus professor of photobiology at Newcastle University. “Sun exposure in childhood is a critical period for developing skin cancer, particularly melanoma, later in life.”He advises using sunscreen when the sun can harm your skin and not bothering when the UV index is less than three, which in the UK is generally from mid-October to mid-March.Burn notice: Gen Z and the terrifying rise of extreme tanningRead moreHow do sunscreens work?Sun creams contain filters that absorb UV rays. They protect by reducing the amount of UV that reaches the skin where it can cause burning and other damage.There are two main types of UV filters. The first are inorganic compounds, typically zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The second are organic compounds, where organic simply means they contain carbon. Both types are manufactured and added to creams, sprays and lip salves. Many sunscreens contain inorganic and organic UV filters to improve sun protection.Why the concerns?They trace back to a2019 studyconducted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Researchers found traces of organic UV filters, namely avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene and ecamsule, in people’s blood after applying sun cream. The concentrations exceeded the level at which the FDA recommends companies do specific tests for toxic effects. Dr Tro Kalayjian, who runs a US weight loss clinic, posted the paper on X, adding: “Be careful what you smear on yourself and your children.”The study prompted the FDA to call for more work on the compounds, but the authors stressed that they were not warning people off the products. “These results do not indicate that individuals should refrain from the use of sunscreen,” they wrote.The study looked at sunscreen under “maximal use conditions”, which meant really slathering the cream on. Under real conditions, people apply about one tenth of that used in the study, Diffey said. That alone would bring three of the four ingredients below the FDA’s threshold, he added.How might UV filters cause harm?The inorganic UV filters, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, have raised few concerns because they are not easily absorbed into the bloodstream. They can still, however, have an environmental impact when they wash off sun cream-covered swimmers and accumulate in water and marine life.More questions surround organic UV filters such as oxybenzone. These are endocrine disruptors, meaning they mimic natural hormones. Whether they cause harm at the doses people get from wearing sun cream is unclear, but anumberofstudieshave looked at levels of benzophenones (which include oxybenzone) in urine and linked higher levels to effects on sperm and poorer fertility, with affected couples taking longer to conceive.Will sunscreens be reformulated?Regulatory bodies around the world are seeking more information from manufacturers on organic UV filters, but some countries are already taking action. The UK’s Office for Product Safety and Standards plans to tighten limits on oxybenzone next year, bringing them more in line with Europe. Today, UK sunscreens can contain up to 6% oxybenzone, but in 2026 the maximum concentration will be reduced to 2.2% for products that are applied to the whole body. Creams and sprays for the face and hands, and lip salves, can still contain 6%, as they are applied to smaller patches of skin.In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has recommended a reformulation of sunscreens and additional safeguards on three chemical compounds, including oxybenzone. In the US, an FDA review is ongoing.Do sunscreens cause cancer or vitamin deficiency?Some social media posts have spread claims thatsunscreens cause cancer,but that is false. “There’s zero evidence for that,” said Antony Young, emeritus professor of experimental photobiology at King’s College London. “Skin cancers are caused by mutations, and almost all skin cancers have a mutation that is highly UV specific.”Others raise concerns over vitamin D deficiency. In the summer, most of our vitamin D is made through sun on our skin. ButYoung and his colleaguesfound that sunscreens have little impact on the vitamin D people make. The amount of sunlight needed to produce vitamin D is far below what it takes to cause sunburn.But isn’t sunshine healthy?According to some doctors, concerns over skin cancer have eclipsed the broader health benefits of sunshine.Tentativeresearchsuggests that people who get more sun may have a lower risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases and even certain cancers. “Sunburn is a risk factor for melanoma, but sunlight is good for you,” said Prof Richard Weller at the University of Edinburgh. “You can use sunscreen, you can use a hat, or you can pop inside, whatever is good for you. Just don’t get sunburned.”“My general advice is to enjoy the sun, but don’t get sunburned,” Young added. “You can limit your time, or choose your time, or protect yourself, whether that’s by shade, clothing or sunscreen. And sunscreens do work.”Explore more on these topicsScienceThe sunHealthSummerexplainersShareReuse this content"

No matter the modality, offensively attractive fitness instructors wield numbers as weapons to torment and torture me.Numbers have always been a source of struggle for me. I can barely add up, frequently forget my own phone number, and yesterday I messed up an interview time with someone in Tennessee,despite using a time conversion app.Why can’t they just be letters?Unfortunately, there is no escaping the shapely little bastards, and in few corners do numbers taunt me more than the fitness industry.“What’s your BMI?”“How far can you run?”“How much do you bench?”My petty gripe: I don’t begrudge your coffee addiction – but do you have to be such a bore about it?Read moreWhoa, sir, I’m just trying to order a smoothie.In every exercise class, from boxing to ballet, step to spin, Lycra-clad young people with AI-worthy abs personally victimise me with numbers.“Eight reps to go!” sings a painfully perky barre teacher, repeating several numbers twice, even thrice, in the countdown.“Holding for 3, 2 …” breathes a tattooed yogi, stopping to adjust someone’s twisted triangle, while I wait for “1” and wish for death.“Only 30 more seconds,” promises a rare male reformer pilates instructor, keeping us in forearm plank for seven more hours.Why are they like this?

Must its henchmen also torture us with numbers and lies?If they say eight reps to go, there should be one rep per count, not two, nor four. If they count down from three, it should be illegal to have a chat between two and one. And 30 seconds means 30 actual seconds, measured by a clock, not a vibe.

A dermatologist said it looked fine. Over time, the same mole began to itch on a daily basis. Then it bled a little, as though nicked by shaving. She sent photos to her GP and was called in for a biopsy and, soon after, surgery on what turned out to be a malignant melanoma.Her mole awareness and perseverance means she is going to be fine. I say all this because – assuming the weather hasn’t changed dramatically by the time you read this – you probably have more skin exposed than usual. I strongly urge you to pay attention to it.My friend’s recent and ongoing episode may be closer to home, but it is similar to several emails I have received from readers over the years, telling me of their cancer treatment triggered by columns I have written on mole checking. And so I make no apologies for repeating myself: you must look carefully at the moles, marks and spots on your face and body, whether behind your ears or between your toes. And you should log them so you can spot any changes.Take photographs on your phone. This will allow you to track any changes in size, colour, shape or appearanceTake photographs on your phone (pop a ruler or tape measure next to them for scale), then store them in a dedicated album, to which you can refer back every few months. This will allow you better to track any changes in size, colour, shape or appearance.You may notice a mole or patch that has become jagged in outline. Or perhaps one that was brown but is now pink or red in parts. Or a brown spot that has become raised or domed. Any change at all is worthy of a doctor’s attention. Even if your doctor disagrees with your rational belief that something is up, stick at it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Gaining height, the land thickens with oak forests and a Hermann’s tortoise makes a slow, ceremonial turn on to a sheep track at the edge of the asphalt. And then, just as the road briefly levels out before corkscrewing down the other side, a glittering lake appears beneath me – a brilliant blue eye set in a socket of steep mountains. I can’t even begin to count how many times I’ve crossed the pass into the Prespa basin on my way home from trips into town, but the sight of shimmering Lesser Prespa Lake – often striking blue in the afternoons and silvery at sunset – takes me back to the summer of 2000 when I saw it for the first time.Prespa lakesA little over 25 years ago, my wife and I read a glowing review of a book about the Prespa lakes region. In the north-west corner of Greece and an hour’s drive from the towns of Florina and Kastoria, the two Prespa lakes straddle the borders of Greece, Albania and North Macedonia in a basin of about 618 sq miles. We’d never heard of Prespa until then, but the review of Giorgos Catsadorakis’sPrespa: A Story for Man and Naturegot us thinking about a holiday there, imagining a week or two of walking in the mountains, birding around the summer shores and enjoying food in village tavernas at night.View image in fullscreenFootbridge to Agios Achilleios island on Lesser Prespa Lake.Photograph: Julian HoffmanWhen the book finally arrived at our London flat, at a time when we were talking seriously about living somewhere else, it took just a single evening (and, to be fair, a couple of bottles of wine) to decide to leave the city behind. Not for a holiday, but to try to make a home for ourselves in the Prespa national park. Twenty-five years later, we’re still in the village we moved to – Agios Germanos.These two ancient lakes, thought to be 3-5 million years old, are almost entirely encircled by a bowl of mountainsI park the car near the pass and walk further into the hills on a path worn smooth by shepherds and their animals. It’s high summer and there’s a languor to the landscape. Clouds of butterflies drift on the hot air and a hoopoe raises its magnificent crest in an oak. From up here I can now see Great Prespa Lake as well, separated from its smaller neighbour by a wide and sandy isthmus. These two ancient lakes, thought to be in the region of 3-5 million years old, are almost entirely encircled by a bowl of mountains, making it feel a world apart when you cross into the basin. Although the water levels in the lakes have dropped significantly because of climate change in recent decades, Prespa remains a place of extraordinary vitality.Looking north over the rolling oak forests, I can see the rough point in the lake where Greece, Albania and North Macedonia meet. Prespa is a crossroads not only of countries but of geologies too, resulting in an extraordinary profusion and abundance of wild species – almost three times as many butterfly species (172) can be found on the Greek side of Prespa than in the whole of the UK (59).View image in fullscreenThe scarce swallowtail is one of many butterfly species in the Prespa region.Photograph: Julian HoffmanI look up as a mixed group of Dalmatian and great white pelicans lowers towards Lesser Prespa Lake. Seeing these birds in flight, carried across the mountains on wings that can have a total span of more than three metres, it feels as if you have been given a glimpse into the age of the dinosaurs. Until we read the book that brought us here, I had no idea that pelicans could even be found in Greece, let alone nest on these lakes in large numbers, but then Prespa is full of surprises. In some winters, Lesser Prespa Lake can freeze solid enough to walk across – and there are far more brown bears in the region than bouzoukis. While Prespa is a popular winter destination for Greek visitors, in part because of a ski-centre halfway between Florina and the basin, it’s the quieter spring and summer seasons when the place comes into its own for walking and nature tourism.There’s a mosaic of cultural riches to explore here too: the remarkable ruins of the 1,000-year-old Byzantine basilica on the island of Agios Achilleios; the lakeside cliffs on Great Prespa Lake, studded with centuries-old hermitages and monastic cells, reached by hiring a boatman from the fishing village of Psarades; the churches screened by sacred groves of immense juniper trees, found on some of the manymarked walking trails.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A steel-blue dragonfly unzips the air and I can hear sheep bellsBesides the abundant nature and mountain walking that prompted us to move here, what also makes this place so special is the food and hospitality. There are welcoming, family-run guesthouses in many of the villages and excellent tavernas serving regional specialities, including slow-baked beans in a rich tomato sauce with oregano, fresh carp and sardine-sizedtsironiafrom the lake, grilledflorinelacheese brushed with red pepper marmalade, and wild greens calledhortadoused in lemon juice and olive oil.I stop to watch the cross-hatchings of light on the lakes as the hum of insects deepens with the heat. A short-toed eagle turns into the wind ahead of me, briefly motionless as it hunts for snakes in the forest clearings. Then it steers northwards and away across the mountains. Beyond those peaks encircling Prespa are the beautiful, traditional market towns of Korҫë in Albania and Bitola in North Macedonia, which, together with Florina and lakeside Kastoria just outside the basin in Greece, help make the entire region one of endless fascination for me.View image in fullscreenThe Byzantine basilica of Agios Achilleios.Photograph: Julian HoffmanThere are plans to re-open the long-closed crossing between Greece and North Macedonia within the Prespa basin in the next few years, an opportunity to build further bridges between communities and make movement for tourists easier. Another project will establish a cross-border walking route between our village and the neighbouring mountain village of Brajčino in North Macedonia; it will celebrate the cultural and natural heritage of the common watershed while highlighting the importance of low-impact tourism to local economies, particularly at a time when climate change is making itself felt around the lakes and threatening agricultural livelihoods.It’s almost time to return along the path and head home, but first I sit in the shade of an oak, its leaves rustling in the warm breeze. A steel-blue dragonfly unzips the air and I can hear sheep bells somewhere in the hills. The sound shifts and swirls, just as on the saint’s day festivals of summer, calledpanigyria, when the wild, soaring music of clarinets and raucous Balkan brass rises into the mountain nights as people gather with food and drink to circle-dance in village squares.I’ve never thought of Prespa as anything but a shared place, where human cultures and wild species come together and co-exist, a place best experienced slowly and with care. And although Prespa has been my home for a quarter of a century now, when I see that blue water glimmering beneath me as I cross the pass, it still so often feels like the first time.For more information visitSociety for the Protection of PrespaandVisit PrespesJulian Hoffman is the author of Lifelines: Searching for Home in the Mountains of Greece published byElliott & Thompson (£18.99).

But before Winston, there was SplashSign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsTory ShepherdWed 6 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTFirst published on Wed 6 Aug 2025 10.01 EDTShareThere is a photo – or at least a “fabled” photo – that would tie up a lot of loose ends in the strange story of Winston Churchill’s platypuses.Recent research has revived the tale of how the British prime minister asked Australia to send him a live monotreme at the height of the second world war. Sadly his namesake, Winston, died just two days before landing in England in 1943 innow-disputed circumstances.But Associate Prof Nancy Cushing, an environmental history specialist at the University of Newcastle, says Winston’s journey would never have happened without the knowledge gained from another platypus, Splash, that was previously sent to Churchill – albeit after it had died and been stuffed.Cushing describes the connection between Churchill and the platypuses as “weirdly compelling”. Splash sat on Churchill’s desk whileOperation Platypus– a series of reconnaissance missions in Borneo – was under way, academic research has found.View image in fullscreenAacademics say ‘platypus diplomacy’ was an attempt to secure Churchill’s personal affections after feeling abandoned by Britain during the war.Photograph: Australian Museum Archives“I think one thing we would have loved to have found, and is fabled to exist, is a photograph of Splash on Churchill’s desk,” Cushing says. “There hasn’t been really any discussion of [Splash’s journey to London]. And that was such a breakthrough.”Before its death, Splash was the first of the sensitive, duck-billed, beaverish animals to be successfully kept in captivity in Melbourne by Healesville Sanctuary’s Robert Eadie.“Without Splash there wouldn’t have been an attempt to send Winston. He defined how you look after a platypus in captivity.”‘Magnificently idiotic’Churchill famously kept a menagerie, which included kangaroos and black swans. In 1943, he asked Australia’s external affairs minister, Herbert “Doc” Evatt, if he could have not just one platypus but half a dozen, a request described by the zoo owner and author Gerald Durrell as“magnificently idiotic”.Monotremes, which include echidnas as well as platypuses, are distinct from other mammals because they lay eggs. With their duck-like bill, flat tail and partially webbed feet, they are so strange looking that many early European scientists studying specimens suspected they were a hoax.Cushing and Kevin Markwell, from Southern Cross University, wrote in 2009 in their paperPlatypus diplomacy: animals gifts in international relationsthat efforts to fulfil Churchill’s request were motivated by a desire to secure his “personal affection” towards an Australia “which felt abandoned by Britain during the war”.“The feat of transferring the platypus would have brought acclaim to the Australians and viewing the platypus [at London Zoo] would have reminded embattled Londoners of their Australian cousins who were also facing the grim realities of war while raising morale by providing an opportunity to see an exotic animal for the first time,” they wrote in the Journal of Australian Studies.View image in fullscreenPlatypus-related objections from David Fleay’s collection. The researcher was shocked to hear of Churchill’s long-cherished ambition to have six platypuses shipped to him.Photograph: University of Sydney/Renee NowytargerOfficials charged with satisfying the British PM’s request approached Australia’s“father of conservation”, David Fleay, for help. Fleay wrote of his surprise in his 1980 book Paradoxical Platypus: hobnobbing with duckbills.“Winston Churchill had found time suddenly in the middle of the war to attempt to bring to fruition what was, apparently, a long-cherished ambition … he had actually approached our prime minister for no less than six platypuses!” he wrote.He described it as the “shock of a lifetime” and a “tremendous problem landed squarely in my lap”.One giant leap for bettongs released into sanctuary as wildlife conservancy aims to operate on 5% of AustraliaRead moreFleay pushed back against the idea of sending six platypuses on the dangerous mission but caught several and picked one to go. He named him Winston, built a “special travelling platypusary” for him (with burrows and a swimming tank) and trained a platypus keeper to look after him on the ship.“I thought it was a really weird thing to do when you’re running a country, running a war,” Fleay’s son, Stephen, tells Guardian Australia from Portugal.The platypus mission was secret at the time but Stephen gradually learned about it and says his father supervised the whole thing.“They’re very, very difficult to keep,” he says. “But he was completely, completely devoted to the animal.”Splash the ‘tame platypus’Fleay built his knowledge on the work of Eadie, his predecessor at Healesville Sanctuary. “We occupied his original cottage when my father became director in ’37, ’38,” Stephen says.“He did a lot of pioneering work with the platypus, then my father took up his work.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Cushing and Markwell, referring to Eadie’s own writings, wrote that the preserved remains of Splash were “carefully packed and secretly despatched to London”.“When delivered to 10 Downing Street on 19 June 1943, accompanied by a leather-bound scientific description of the platypus and Eadie’s 1935 book The Life and Habits of the Platypus, with Sidelights on ‘Splash’ the Tame Platypus, Churchill was said to have been delighted and later to have displayed the platypus on his desk.”The University of Cambridge’s Natalie Lawrence wrote in the BBCWildlifeMagazine that Splash, who had been a “minor celebrity” in Australia, was sent as an “interim gift” while plans were made to keep Winston alive on the long sea journey.“[Splash] became almost entirely tame from his training by Robert Eadie, who had, as it happened, once saved Churchill’s life in the Boer war in South Africa,” Lawrence wrote.Brisbane’s Courier Mail reported in 1949, in an article about Eadie’s death, that he had indeed been part of a team that helped Churchill escape from captivity (though other accounts have himescaping on his own).Depth charges and heatstrokeWinston the platypus set sail on the MV Port Philip but died just two days before he was due to reach land. The media at the time reported, presumably on advice of the authorities, that the Germans were to blame.On 1 November 1945, Adelaide’s the News reported that Churchill, “in the midst of his war-time worries, wanted an Australian platypus”.“And he would have got a specimen, a husky young male, but for German submarines,” the paper reported.Depth charges dropped when the Port Philip encountered the submarines caused the platypus to die of shock, the paper said.Fleay wrote that a heavy concussion would have killed the sensitive creatures.“After all, a small animal equipped with a nerve-packed, super-sensitive bill, able to detect even the delicate movements of a mosquito wriggler on stream bottoms in the dark of night, cannot hope to cope with man-made enormities such as violent explosions,” he wrote.View image in fullscreenThe midshipman’s log showing temperatures before the death of Winston the platypus.Photograph: Australian Museum ArchivesBut students from the University of Sydney studying Fleay’s collections in the Australian Museum Archives said in June that a shortage of worms to feed Winston, alongside heat stress, could have been factors as well as potential distress from the detonations.The ship’s logbook shows air temperatures soared above 30C and water temperatures rose above 27C for about a week as the ship crossed equatorial waters. Platypuses cannot regulate their body temperatures in environments warmer than 25C, the students wrote.“Heat stress alone would have been enough to kill Winston,” they wrote.“However, it is important to note that food restrictions and the shock of a depth charge, in combination with heat stress, likely had an additional impact on Winston’s wellbeing and together contributed to his demise.”Explore more on these topicsWinston ChurchillWildlifeSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereJason OkundayeWed 6 Aug 2025 07.17 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 09.27 EDTShareHello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m writing from Bridgetown, Barbados, where I’ve spent the past week participating in Crop Over festival. I’ll take you through some reflections on my first experience of theCaribbean.Peeling back Barbados’s orange economyView image in fullscreenTall tales … Andrea Franklin leads a conga line through the legs of the stilt-walker Troy Hunte.Photograph: Graham BelleWhen I looked up the hotel I’ll be staying in before leaving London, one of the first things I noticed is that the gallery is largely made up of white tourists. It’s no surprise – Barbados isheavily reliant on tourism, which contributes nearly one-third of GDP to the economy. And during the northern hemisphere’s colder months, the numbers jump higher.This winter tourism often conjures up a particular image of middle-class couples and families seeking sun, enjoying the resorts, cruises and rum punches but, perhaps, more detached from the local culture.But that is a limited image the country is evidently keen to expand, as I learned when I finally arrived. As Andrea Franklin, the chief executive ofBarbadosTourism Marketing Inc (BTMI), a division of the government’s tourism affairs, tells me that “in the past, the Caribbean was viewed as sun, sand and sea”. Now there is a greater impetus “to recognise who we are as a people – and to promote the culture, the heritage, our food, our music”.Crop Over, which takes place during the quieter rainy season, presents an opportunity to focus on promoting cultural heritage. Franklin says this has helped strengthen the orange economy: the wider contribution of creative and cultural assets, and so Barbados focuses on promoting its musicians, artists and chefs.The Mottley effectView image in fullscreenChangemaker … Mottley ended her tenure as chair of Caricom last month with a rallying cry for regional solidarity.Photograph: CaricomIn part, this reshaping of the island’s image can be attributed to the influence of its prime minister, Mia Mottley. She is the most prominent Caribbean leader outside of the region, having made headlines for her radical climate policies,taking on the IMF, calls forreparative justiceand for transforming Barbados into a republic bysevering ties with the British crown.These bold moves are helping the island shed its “Little England” reputation, a nickname derived from Bajans’ supposedly English affectations and love of cricket, which had been a particular appeal for some tourists. Under Mottley’s leadership, Barbados has also developed ambitions to become the first carbon-neutral island state. Its sustainable and regenerative tourism strategy is central to this – and encourages visitors to become involved in community-driven initiatives, as opposed to just sipping piña coladas on the beach. The idea is that this contributes towards tackling poverty through job creation and upskilling, providing opportunities for Bajans to earn an income from tourism beyond hospitality roles.Mottley’s perceived radicalism has, in fact, boosted interest in Barbados, as has the global megastar Rihanna. Franklin says: “Because [Mottley’s] viewed so highly worldwide, it serves us well as a destination, because people want to see where this woman is coming from, what’s happening on the island.” While positive, you do wonder about the sustainability of a country’s prominence hinging on a politician (especially one who isrumoured to be eyeing the top job at the UNin 2027), and though Rihanna’s cultural cachet is likely to endure, I wonder how Barbados intends to maintain this momentum in prominence when Mottley eventually steps down.My pick of the CropView image in fullscreenPlaying with fire … a demo from Pedro Arthur.Photograph: Graham BelleThis visit is my first time in the Caribbean, and while I had been familiar with aspects of the culture through the UK’s large diaspora, my time in Barbados was an incredibly thrilling education in its heritage and history. Crop Over, originally called Harvest Home, has its roots in the 17th century, as enslaved people throughout the archipelago marked the end of the yearly harvest, making it one of the oldest festivals in the western hemisphere.It is now a multiweek cultural event running through July and August, featuring fetes, arts, food and spectacle – culminating in Grand Kadooment,a street carnival attracting 15,000 masqueraderson the first Monday of August that is a parade of colourful feathers, sequins, jewels and endless soca. The celebrations coincide with Emancipation Day, commemorated across the Caribbean on 1 August, to mark the anniversary of the abolition of slavery, and a reminder of the history and pain that underpin the region.Over the week, I’ve made the most of the cultural feast from fire-breathing demos, stilt-walking classes and T-shirt cutting to a history lesson on the Tuk band, a Barbadian musical ensemble described as a meeting of west African percussive culture and the colonial regimental bands of the British military.What particularly thrilled me was seeing how much these celebrations were a meeting of the Black diaspora. I met fellow Brits and visitors from the US, Canada as well as other Caricom states. Despite the difficulties of travelling between Caribbean islands, I came across Jamaicans, Bahamians, Trinbagonians and St Lucians. Some who, like me, were visiting for the first time, were on a mission to experience different festival and carnival events across the region and to strengthen their understanding of their sister cultures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionUndoubtedly my highlight is Foreday Morning Jam, also known as J’ouvert elsewhere in the Caribbean, a parade in the early hours of the morning in which revellers throw powder and paint over each other while dancing in procession behind a truck blaring soca bangers. Two things I learn are thatJordan English’s track Darkersis the unofficial anthem of this Crop Over season, and that even thousands of miles from home I can’t escape the viralJet2Holiday “song of the summer”, which gets a ridiculous – but frankly delightful – soca reworking.But mostly I am struck by just how free I feel. It is almost cliche to say that dancing in the street is a liberating experience but, as someone who, admittedly, can be uptight, the parade completely unravelled me and released me from all inhibitions. It drove home that this was not simply a party but a collective spiritual experience – nourishment for the soul. It is so far away from the image of pristine beaches and cruises yet feels like the real face of Barbados.The path of progressView image in fullscreenA lick of paint … Foreday Morning revellers get messy.Photograph: Graham BelleThere is one aspect of these celebrations that feels like a meeting of Barbados’s progressive image, who they want to be as a country, and what putting its people front and centre means in practice: the status of its queer community. In 2022, the high courtstruck down colonial-era buggery laws, and Mottley has made clear herintolerance to homophobic discrimination.Luke Lascaris, a queer researcher who has worked with the National Cultural Foundation as a Crop Over ambassador, tells me that in the Caribbean Barbados is seen as a “city on the hill”. The striking down of the buggery law was considered by many as “a pivotal moment. People also believe that becoming a republic in 2021 ushered in a whole set of new rights and a lot more equity and equal representation for all people in society.”It is not that such progress is in service of tourism, but inevitably this will do much to attract a different kind of visitor – younger and more progressive, with a revamped image of openness. Barbados has evidently done much to distance itself from its standing in 2019, when the island was ranked by Forbes as theeighth most dangerous destination for LGBTQ+ travellers. (I must say, I have long disliked these lists for how they oversimplify the context of travel, and their ignorance to how queer people have long navigated their countries of heritage – I have been gay clubbing in Nigeria, after all.)Barbados hosted its first Pride march in 2018 and it has continued annually since. Lascaris tells me that the event “started out as a lot of expats and people from overseas but more and more locals have become involved”. However, it is not only in Pride that queer Barbadians are making themselves visible – with this strategy to promote Barbados’s people, there is a clear demand from the queer population to be included. “There’s been a very large push for queer rights, so that queer people feel seen and heard and not pushed constantly to the shadows,” Lascaris says. “Queerness is a part of our identity as Caribbean people. The national motto of Barbados is ‘pride and industry’, so why shouldn’t we be proud of who we are?”View image in fullscreenReady for the road … Grand Kadooment Day in Bridgetown.Photograph: Graham BelleLascaris is clear that Barbados has some way to go in terms of changing social attitudes. However, so long as the government leads – particularly onrecognising same-sex civil unionsand following up on a promised referendum on marriage – the people will follow, despite their conservatism. “Barbadians will accept what the status quo is and follow along with it, and a lot of people don’t believe there would be homophobic backlash to that,” he says.At Foreday Morning, I felt some of that tension: the in-reach and yet frustrating distance betweenwhat the country is and what it could be. While dancing with other revellers, I had an encounter with a beautiful Caribbean man who made clear his interest in me. We did not quite dance together but rather sprayed each other’s bodies with paint in a way that was more tense and erotic than any dancefloor kiss I’ve had in London. When I looked around, I noticed other same-sex intimacies between men and between women, and I’d heard many stories about queer encounters at festivals and carnivals across the region. And so while centring culture is evidently a success story for Barbados, it is not one that is only about industry and economy, but something charting a society that feels on course to true liberation.This trip was provided by Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsAfricaThe Long WaveCaribbeanMia MottleyBarbadosAmericasFestivalsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

IPPF offered to take them for redistribution at no cost to the US taxpayer, but the offer was declined.Their destruction will deny more than 1.4 million women and girls in the five countries access to lifesaving care, IPPF said.Trump administration to destroy nearly $10m of contraceptives for women overseasRead moreMarie Evelyne Petrus-Barry, the Africa regional director of IPPF, said: “This decision to destroy ready-to-use commodities is appalling and extremely wasteful. These lifesaving medical supplies were destined to countries where access to reproductive care is already limited, and in some cases, part of a broader humanitarian response, such as in the DRC. The choice to incinerate them is unjustifiable.”As a result of the decision, more than 1m injectable contraceptives and 365,100 implants will not be distributed inTanzania, 28% of the total annual need in the country.Dr Bakari, a project coordinator at Umati, IPPF’s member association in Tanzania, said: “We are facing a major challenge. The impact of theUSAIDfunding cuts has already significantly affected the provision of sexual and reproductive health services in Tanzania, leading to a shortage of contraceptive commodities, especially implants. This shortage has directly impacted clients’ choices regarding family planning uptake.”InMali, women will be denied access to 1.2m oral contraceptives and 95,800 implants, amounting to almost a quarter (24%) of the country’s annual need.InZambia, women will go without 48,400 implants and 295,000 injectable contraceptives, while in Kenya 108,000 women will not have access to contraceptive implants.Nelly Munyasia, the executive director for the ReproductiveHealthNetwork in Kenya, said the impact of USAID cuts was already being felt in the country. Stockpiles of long-term contraceptives had already run out, she said, which will have drastic consequences on women’s health and their sexual and reproductive rights. Meanwhile, the skill set of health workers is being reduced and there is a 46% funding gap in Kenya’s national family planning programme.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unsafe abortions remain among the five leading causes of maternal deaths inKenya.While the Kenyan constitution, adopted in 2010,allows for abortion when a pregnant person’s life or health is at risk,the Kenyan penal code of 1963 still criminalises it. Healthcare providers are reluctant to provide safe care while the penal code remains in place, even in emergencies. Munyasia said without adequate supplies of contraceptives there would be a rise in maternal mortality as a result of women seeking to end unintended pregnancies.Last month, a US state department spokesperson confirmed thatthe decision to destroy the contraceptives had been made. Amid reports that the contraceptives were due to be incinerated in France, the French government said it was “following the situation closely” after feminist, rights and family planning groups expressed outrage at the proposal.The department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organisations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson.Explore more on these topicsAfricaTrump administrationMaternal mortalityReproductive rightsContraception and family planningWomenPregnancynewsShareReuse this content"

But other legal scholars argue that it isunclear what precise violation Bolsonaro committed, noting that he was not explicitly banned from speaking at public events.In response to Moraes’s latest ruling, politicians aligned with Bolsonaro have blocked congressional proceedings, demanding that lawmakers vote to impeach the supreme court justice and grant amnesty to the hundreds accused of involvement in the alleged coup attempt – including the ransacking of Brasília on 8 January 2023.The case against the 70-year-old politician is at an advanced stage and a verdict is expected as early as next month, with Bolsonaro facing a potential sentence of more than 40 years in prison.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The plane landed back in Christchurch on Wednesday morning, after a 19.5 hour round trip.In a statement, the US embassy expressed its “deep appreciation” to the air force.“This mission wasn’t just difficult; it was one of the most technically demanding operations an aircrew can face,” said Melissa Sweeney, the US chargé d’affaires in New Zealand.“This required absolute precision … This is the kind of mission that tests every ounce of skill and bravery,” Sweeney added.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAntarcticaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, we must work even harder to build civil society consensus that nuclear weapons must beabolishedfor a genuinely peaceful world.”As applause rang out, white doves were released into the sky, while an eternal “flame of peace” burned in front of a cenotaph dedicated to victims of the world’s first nuclear attack.The ceremony is seen as the last opportunity for significant numbers of ageinghibakusha– survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – to pass on first-hand warnings of the horror of nuclear warfare.Just under 100,000survivorsare still alive, according to recent data from the health ministry, with an average age of just over 86.On Wednesday, the names and other personal details of more than 4,940 registered survivors who have died in the past year were added to a registry kept inside the cenotaph, bringing the number of deaths attributed to the Hiroshima bombing to almost 350,000.View image in fullscreenPeople offer flowers after the memorial ceremony in Hiroshima.Photograph: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockIn his peace declaration, Matsui recalled how one woman had begged for water as fires raged through the city after theEnola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 15-kiloton uranium bomb on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, killing an estimated 140,000 people by the end of the year.“Decades later, a woman who heard that plea still regretted not giving the young woman water,” he said. “ She told herself that fighting for the elimination of nuclear weapons was the best she could do for those who died.”Three days after the devastation in Hiroshima, the US dropped a plutonium bomb on the city of Nagasaki, killing 74,000 people. While the debate continues over whether the attacks were morally and militarily justified, many Americans continue to believe they forcedJapan’s surrender on 15 August.View image in fullscreenPeople pray in front of the cenotaph at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima on Wednesday.Photograph: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockNihon Hidankyo, a nationwide network of A-bomb survivors that last yearwonthe Nobel peace prize, said humanity was in a race against time to challenge theUSand Russia – which together possess 90% of the world’s 12,000-plus nuclear warheads – and other nuclear states.“We don’t have much time left, while we face a greater nuclear threat than ever,” it said in a statement. “Our biggest challenge now is to change nuclear weapons states … even just a little.”At 8.15am, the exact time the bomb detonated, Hiroshima observed a moment of silence. Many attendees lowered their heads and closed their eyes, some clasping their hands together in prayer.The advanced age of the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs has become adefining themeof the anniversary.View image in fullscreenHiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui delivers a speech that called for a renewed push to abandon nuclear weapons as a deterrence.Photograph: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockYoshie Yokoyama, 96, a wheelchair user who visited the park early in the morning with her grandson, told reporters her parents and grandparents had died as a result of the Hiroshima attack.“My grandfather died soon after the bombing, while my father and mother both died after developing cancer,” she said. “My parents-in-law also died, so my husband couldn’t see them again when he came back from battlefields after the war. People are still suffering.”Russiaapparently did not send an official to Wednesday’s ceremony, but its ally, Belarus, attended for the first time in four years. Taiwanese and Palestinian representatives were there for the first time, Japanese media reports said.Successive Japanese governments have faced criticism for refusing to ratify a 2021 treaty to ban the possession and use of nuclear weapons. Dozens of countries have signed the treaty, but they do not include any of the recognised nuclear powers or countries, includingJapan, that are dependent on the US nuclear umbrella.After laying a wreath in front of the cenotaph, the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, did not mention the treaty but said it was Japan’s “mission” as the only country to have been attacked by nuclear weapons to lead global efforts towards disarmament.The UN secretary general,António Guterres, said in a statement that “the very weapons that brought such devastation to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are once again being treated as tools of coercion”. Guterres added, however, that Nihon Hidankyo’s Nobel prize was cause for hope, adding that “countries must draw strength from the resilience of Hiroshima and from the wisdom of thehibakusha”.Explore more on these topicsJapanNuclear weaponsAsia PacificSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

But the phone has stopped ringing since her Instagram account, which had 48,000 followers, was suspended without notice byMetathree weeks ago.“I received a horrible email saying a reference to child sexual exploitation content, which obviously was quite traumatic to see,” she said. “Saying my Instagram accounts have been disabled with just no clear explanation.”Enticknap estimates that, as a result of her account being wrongly suspended, she has lost 80% of the bookings she otherwise would have leading into the busy wedding season in Margaret River.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“A lot of people come through Instagram, they find hashtags and they find word of mouth, and obviously through other businesses that always tag us,” she said.Enticknap said it made her realise how reliant she was on Meta for business. She said she lost two Instagram accounts and a Facebook account as a result of the permanent suspension, and said attempts to contact the company to have the ban appealed had resulted in a “dead end”.She said she was not alone, citing another WA business – which sells artificial flowers – which had been suspended from Meta platforms and received the same reference to child sexual exploitation.“My friend who has another successful makeup business, she went down the week after me, but she’s managed to get her account back,” Enticknap said.Incorrect account suspensions on social media platforms are not a new phenomenon. Often when Meta is asked by media about an account, it is later restored.However, something changed in July.A flood of emails were sent to journalists from people all over the world saying that, without warning, their Facebook and Instagram accounts had been suspended. Many were told – erroneously – by Meta that their accounts had been suspended for breaching community standards on child sexual exploitation, abuse and nudity.Users report Meta has typically been unresponsive to their pleas for assistance, often with standardised responses to requests for review, almost all of which have been rejected.There are petitions with tens of thousands of signatures,a subredditdevoted to people who have had their accounts disabled and talk of a class action against Meta over the bans.From around a dozen emails received in the past two weeks, Guardian Australia has reported five accounts – including Enticknap’s – to Meta, which said it had internally escalated the investigation of those accounts.Media reporting of the plight of businesses struggling as a result of their Instagram ban has led to many of those accounts being restored.But the company claims there has not been an increase in incorrect account suspension, and the volume of users complaining was not indicative of new targeting or over-enforcement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the changes werein part due to the end of Covid-19 “safety net” fundingand other government savings measures, and would “ensure we are focused on delivering the science Australia needs now and into the future”.David Karoly, a University of Melbourne emeritus professor who previously worked at CSIRO, said the cuts were not being offset elsewhere. He said Australia had lower levels of industry funding in research than comparable countries.“There’s a dilemma as to whether Australia wants to support the research infrastructure that’s needed to support ongoing research activities in science,” he said. “The simple answer is Australia doesn’t appear to want to do that.”The latest cuts were understood to primarily affect the CSIRO’s agriculture and food research unit, with reductions in health and safety, IT and business development. Research unit staff were expected to be informed about funding and staffing changes by October.The May federal budget papersshowed an expected 450-person reductionin CSIRO staff, from 5,945 in 2024-25 to 5,495 this financial year.The union said the cuts were the worst since 2014, when the Abbott government oversaw an estimated 20% reduction in staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the policy, “unapproved flags” must not be flown permanently, including flags that represent unlawful activities, are inconsistent with university values, represent a political party or are considered to be “otherwise unsuitable”.Dr David Brophy, a senior lecturer in modern Chinese history, arrived on campus on Tuesday to find his flag, which had been hanging from an external window of a large campus building, had been taken.We know the Sydney Harbour Bridge protest against the killing in Gaza was huge – but just how big was it?Read morePrior to this, he had received an email from the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Prof Lisa Adkins, advising him the university was “aware of a flag” they believed he had displayed on the outer wall of the A18 Brennan MacCallum building.“We consider that the ongoing display of the flag is inconsistent with clause 2.8(1) of the Policy which confirms that unapproved flags can be displayed in such areas on a temporary basis only,” Adkins wrote on 26 June.“To this end, we require you to remove the flag from the outer wall of the building by 4 August 2025. Should the flag not be removed by this time, it will be removed by Central Operations staff and will be treated as lost property.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe policy notes flags must not be flown from university infrastructure without approval from the brand team, and that “no structure or fixture may be attached to any building to allow a flag to be displayed without approval”.Staff will remove flags that are “unapproved”, considered “inappropriate, dangerous or offensive” or contravene “any university policy”, the policy notes. A breach of the rules can be considered as misconduct.Adkins noted in her email to Brophy that if he wished to continue to display the flag he could do so in a “non-shared indoor space”, or apply for approval to display the flag outside.View image in fullscreen‘At some time on Monday night, or yesterday morning, certain people unknown to me, without any sort of communication with me, entered my office and removed my Palestinian flag,’ David Brophy wrote on social media this week.Photograph: David Brophy/FacebookAfter receiving the email, Brophy replied to Adkins, along with the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Mark Scott, saying his conscience “won’t allow me to comply”.“I go through the day now with gruesome images of emaciated children running through my mind,” Brophy wrote on Monday. “At a time like this, ethical obligations far outweigh any ad hoc institutional policies, particularly those transparently aimed at stifling opposition to an ongoing genocide.“I’d like you both to reflect on the moral weight of what you’re doing and withdraw the instructions to remove the flag.”Brophy told Guardian Australia he had received no “direct explanation” as to why “it’s such a bad thing to have this flag up”. The flag was removed when he was not in the office, he said, and as of Wednesday afternoon he was yet to receive a response to his email.“I’ve filed a lost property report, and I’m hoping security will be able to locate my flag,” he said.“I’d like to think the outer facing window of an office at a university was a place where some kind of display of opinion was still possible.“But the whole flag policy was introduced precisely in response to people like me hanging Palestinian flags … they’re hiding behind their policy to justify the action.”A spokesperson for the University of Sydney, who echoed the rules laid out in the email initially sent out to Brophy, said Palestinian flags had not been banned from campus and that the flag was removed from his office because “unapproved flags of any kind can only be flown from university infrastructure on a temporary basis”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It began in the village of Ribaute in the Aude department, spreading across the rural, wooded area of the Corbières, famous for its vineyards and medieval villages.A woman died in her home and one person was in a critical condition with severe burns, according to the Aude prefecture. Several firefighters were also injured. At least 25 homes were destroyed or damaged. Police are investigating the cause of the fire.The environment ministry said the fire had destroyed the same amount of land in 24 hours that wildfires typically burned across France in a year.“This is an exceptional fire that illustrates the scale of the consequences of the climate crisis,” the ministry said in a statement.Map of southern FranceThe wildfire remained “very active’’ on Wednesday, local authorities said.The mayor of the village of Jonquières, Jacques Piraux, said all residents had been evacuated. “It’s a scene of sadness and desolation,” he told the broadcaster BFM TV. “It looks like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters of the village has burned down. It’s hellish.”Lucie Roesch, the secretary general of the Aude prefecture, said: “The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups.”Planes were dropping water on the flames but Roesch said: “This fire will keep us busy for several days. It’s a long-term operation.”Weather conditions were expected to remain unfavourable due to strong winds, rising temperatures and dry vegetation in the area, officials said.Camping grounds and at least one village were partially evacuated and several roads closed. Residents and tourists were asked to remain in their homes unless told to leave by firefighters. Some tourists who were evacuated from campsites spent the night in municipal buildings.One person told France 2 TV: “I wanted to go back to my house to get my things but I couldn’t go in. We’re waiting to see what the damage was. When I left, there were flames at the foot of the house.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fires have burned more than 25,700 hectares of Portugal since the beginning of 2025, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. There have also been wildfires in central Spain,Turkey, Greeceand in the Balkans.Scientists say climate breakdown is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.

It was introduced by the conservative People’s party (PP) and passed with the abstention of the far-right Vox party and the opposition of local leftwing parties.The proposal states “municipal sports facilities cannot be used for religious, cultural or social activities alien to our identity unless organised by the local authority”.The local Vox party posted on X: “Thanks to Vox the first measure to ban Islamic festivals in Spain’s public spaces has been passed. Spain is and will be forever the land of Christian people.”Mounir Benjelloun Andaloussi Azhari, president of the Spanish federation of Islamic organisations, told El País newspaper the proposal was “Islamophobic and discriminatory”.“They’re not going after other religions, they’re going after ours,” he said. Referring to the recent rise of racist rhetoric and attacks, he added: “We’re rather surprised by what’s happening in Spain.

As Yumil-la it remained a principally Arab town for centuries until it was attacked by Christian troops led by Alfonso X of Castile in the mid-13th century.The local Arab ruler reached an agreement, known as the capitulations of Alcatraz, under which Alfonso could be king as long as the rights of the existing population were respected.

Its shares slumped by 9.9%, after the company reported a 5% drop in pre-tax profit, excluding one-off items, for the first half of the year.Adding to investors’ jitters is the pressure being exerted on pharmaceutical companies by the White House, which is demanding that drugmakers including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and GSKcut the price of prescription drugs for Americanswithin the next 60 days.Meanwhile, the US Department of Health and Human Services, led by the health secretary and longtime vaccine scepticRobert F Kennedy Jr, announced on Tuesday it waswinding down mRNA vaccine developmentunder its biomedical research unit, calling into question the safety of a technology credited with helping end the Covid pandemic and saving millions of lives.Kennedy said the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which helps companies develop medical supplies to address public health threats and provided billions of dollars for vaccine development during the pandemic, was terminating 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines.The decision is not expected to affect Britain’s two big pharmaceutical groups,AstraZenecaand GSK, which do not do much mRNA work, but Pfizer and Moderna, known for their mRNA-based Covid vaccines during the pandemic, could be hit hard. GSK said it did not have any of those contracts. AstraZeneca has one, for an RNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine in early stage development, and is exploring its options.In London, the AstraZeneca share price lost 1.5% on Wednesday whileGSKfell 1.7%. In New York, Pfizer was down 3% and Moderna was 3% lower.Some pharmaceutical companies already appear to be responding to US calls to increase investment in domestic drugmaking facilities.AstraZeneca, Britain’s most valuable company,announced a $50bn (£37bn) investmentin the US in July and said it would soon be able to produce all of its drugs for the US market in the country.“There’s a couple of products that are not made in the US, but we are rapidly transferring the supply to the US, because we have the capacity,” said its chief executive, Pascal Soriot.He haspraised the USfor spending 0.8% of its gross domestic product on pharmaceutical innovation, while calling on Europe and the UK to increase current spending levels from 0.3% of GDP.The chief executive of GSK, Emma Walmsley, said last week that the threat of tariffs had not dented the company’s upbeat financial outlook. She reiterated plans to invest “tens of billions of dollars in the US over the next five years”.Switzerland’s Roche and Novartis, and the US firms Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly are also investing in US drug manufacturing.Shares in another European drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, also fell on Wednesday. They lost 5.4% after the Danish company said sales growth of its injectable diabetes and obesity drugs, including Ozempic and Wegovy, hadslowed sharply amid tough competitionand in the face of threatened US tariffs.Booming sales of GLP-1 drugs in recent years had turned Novo Nordisk into Europe’s most valuable company. However, it has shed close to $100bn of its market value in the past week since warning on profits and cutting its full-year sales forecast.Danni Hewson, the head of financial analysis at the broker AJ Bell, said: “Novo Nordisk’s market value has really slimmed down in 2025. The company’s latest earnings … underscore how the company is losing ground on its rivals and the scale of the challenge facing newly appointed chief executive, Maziar Mike Doustdar.”Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryTrump tariffsTariffsTrump administrationVaccines and immunisationRobert F Kennedy JrEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As part of an international endangered species programme that coordinates efforts for the lions’ survival in captivity, the cubs will be sent to other participating parks, including the Midbarium zoo in Israel.There is a chance that may not be the end of the story. The deputy director of Dvůr Králové, Jaroslav Hyjánek, said preliminary steps had been taken to possibly reintroduce the Barbary lion into its natural habitat – but that was still in the “far distant future”.View image in fullscreenOne of the four cubs plays with its parents at the Dvůr Králové safari park.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APThe Barbary lion, a majestic member of the northern lion subspecies, once roamed freely in its native north Africa, including the Atlas mountains.A symbol of strength, the Barbary lion was almost wiped out by humans. Many were killed by gladiators in Roman times, while overhunting and the loss of habitat contributed to their later near extinction.View image in fullscreenThe parents, Bart and Khalila, rest in their enclosure.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APThe last known photo of a wild lion was taken in 1925. It is believed the last small populations went extinct in the wild in the mid-1960s. Fewer than 200 Barbary lions are now estimated to live in captivity.Hyjánek said that after initial talks with Moroccan authorities, who have not rejected the idea of the lions’ reintroduction, a conference of experts has been planned in Morocco for later this year or early 2026 to decide whether to go ahead with such a scheme in one of the national parks in the Atlas mountains.View image in fullscreenThree of the four cubs at play.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APAny reintroduction would face bureaucratic and other obstacles. As the lions have not been present in the environment for so long, the plans would have to ensure the animals’ protection, a sufficient prey population, and cooperation and approval from local communities.Hyjánek said reintroduction was still worth trying if it turned out to be sustainable. “It’s important to have such a vision for any animal,” he said. “Without it, the existence of zoos wouldn’t make sense.”Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesCzech RepublicZoosAnimalsConservationWildlifeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Ayyad fainted while trying to put out the fires, his brother said, and died on the way to the hospital.He was the latest in a string of Palestinian Americans to have died in the West Bank: five US citizens have been killed there since 7 October 2023, and Ayyad was the second to die in July alone.So far, no one has been held accountable for any of the deaths.Family pleads for release of Palestinian-American teen held in Israeli prisonRead more“The government should protect citizens, this is what is written on the American passport. Why do they do nothing when it comes to their own citizens who live in the West Bank?” said Ayyad’s brother, Anas al-Ayyad, 39.Anas al-Ayyad said that he had contacted the US embassy, who promised him they would look into his brother’s death.In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the US state department acknowledged the death of a US citizen in Silwad and said they were providing consular assistance to the family.Members of the US House and Senate called for theTrump administrationto pressure Israel to carry out an investigation and ensure accountability for the death of Ayyad and the other Americans killed by settlers in the West Bank.“We are witnessing the deadly results of a pattern of complicity by the Netanyahu government and indifference from the US government. It’s clear that we must reinstate sanctions and demand justice – including independent, US-led investigations – in the killings of American citizens,” the Democratic senator of Maryland Chris Van Hollen told the Guardian.Map of West BankThe Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), andIllinoiscongressman Chuy Garcia, also demanded an investigation into Ayyad’s killing.The killings come amid awave of violence in the West Bank, where at least 1,013 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers since 7 October 2023.Accountability for settlers who commit acts of violence against Palestinians is rare, particularly under Israel’s current rightwing government.View image in fullscreenMourners carry the body of Khamis Ayyad during his funeral in Silwad near Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 1 August.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersLast week, a famed Palestinian activist, Awdah Hathaleen, who helped make the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, was shot to death during a settler attack south of Hebron. Sanctions had previously been put on the accused killer, Yinon Levy, by President Joe Biden but they were later lifted by Donald Trump.Levy wasplaced under three days of house arrest and then later released, though he still might face charges. A video showed him working in the same spot where Hathaleen was shot the day after his release.Senator Van Hollen said that Trump’s administration repeal of US sanctions against Israeli settlers has “sent a message that violent settlers can literally get away with murder”.The attack on Silwad was carried out around 2.30 in the morning by about 10 Israeli settlers. People rushed outside to try to put out the fires in the houses and cars that were set alight by settlers, but were met with teargas shot by the Israeli army, Raed Hamed, the mayor of Silwad, said.View image in fullscreenPeople mourn Khamis Ayyad in Silwad near Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 1 August.Photograph: Ammar Awad/Reuters“This is not the first attack by the settlers.

Israeli police said it had launched an investigation into the incident.The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, called for an investigation into the killing of 20-year-old Sayfollah “Saif” Musallet, who was beaten to death by Israeli settlers earlier in July. He also visited the town of Taybeh in mid-July, a community with many US citizens that had recently witnessed Israeli attacks against its churches.Ayyad’s family say they want action from the government, not just words.“If it wasn’t for those settlers attacking us in the middle of the night, my brother would not have died.

That’s going to be pretty much up to Israel,” he told reporters on Tuesday.Many people had returned to Gaza City only relatively recently after long periods of displacement to find their homes war-damaged and looted, with even doors and windows stolen in some cases.chartAs Gaza’s health ministry reported that five more people haddied from starvation in the coastal strip, which has been plunged into a devastating hunger crisis owing to Israel’s complete block on aid entering earlier this year, Jordan reported an aid convoy of 30 trucks that had left for Gaza had been attacked by militant Jewish settlers on entering Israel.After the attack, the second in days, Jordan accused Israel of failing to act to prevent repeated assaults. “This requires a serious Israeli intervention and no leniency in dealing with those who obstruct these convoys,” said Jordan’s government spokesperson Mohammad al-Momani.Amid continuing scenes of desperate suffering in Gaza, where vast areas have been rendered fields of rubble by incessant Israeli strikes, the strip’s civil defence agency reported that 20 people were killed when an aid truck overturned on a crowd of people.“Twenty people were killed and dozens injured around midnight last night in a truck carrying aid [that] overturned … while hundreds of civilians were waiting for aid,” said the agency’s spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal.The incident took place near the Nuseirat refugee camp as the truck was driving on an unsafe road that Israel had previously bombed, Bassal added.chartAmid acute shortages of aid, trucks entering Gaza have been surrounded and looted by hungry Palestinians on numerous occasions, contributing to a pervasive sense of chaos.The new forced displacement order for Gaza City was made as Israeli media reported Netanyahu’s apparent determination to push ahead with an expanded war after consultations with his military chiefs on Tuesday and despite growingdisquiet from serving and former Israeli security officialsover the proposals reportedly including the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Eyal Zamir.According to reports, Zamir warned Netanyahu during a tense, three-hour meeting on Tuesday that the plan could trap the military in the territory amid concerns Israel’s military is already badly overstretched. Zamir has made no public statements on the matter.Critics of the plan say any push for full occupation – a demand being made by Israel’s far right – would put the lives of Israeli hostages in Gaza at risk, could take between a year and two years to fully achieve, and would come at the expense of the country’s increasing diplomatic isolation, with the international community increasingly horrified by Israel’s actions.Among those who spoke out against the plan on Wednesday was the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid. “I told Netanyahu that occupying Gaza is a very bad idea,” Lapid said after meeting the Israeli prime minister. “You don’t make such a move if a majority of the people aren’t with you.”1:07'Suddenly they fired': Palestinians tell of desperate search for bags of flour – videoOther critics include former leaders of Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service, the Mossad spy agency and the military – and also the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. In a video posted to social media this week, they said far-right members of the government were holding Israel “hostage” in prolonging the conflict.Netanyahu’s objectives in Gaza are “a fantasy” said Yoram Cohen, a former head of Shin Bet, in the video.A wasteland of rubble, dust and graves: how Gaza looks from the skyRead moreAmid signs of divisions between Netanyahu and military commanders, the defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Wednesday that the army’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, could “express his views”, but that the military would ultimately have to “execute” any government decisions on Gaza.Katz made the statement on X after reports in the Israeli media in recent days suggested that Zamir is opposed to a government plan to fully occupy the Gaza Strip.“It is the right and duty of the chief of staff to express his position in the appropriate forums, and after decisions are made by the political echelon, the [army] will execute them with determination and professionalism … until the war’s objectives are achieved,” Katz wrote.“As the defence minister responsible for the [army] on behalf of the government, I must ensure that these decisions are carried out – and so it will be,” he added.Gaza’s health ministry said that at least 135 Palestinians, including 87 people seeking food, had been killed and 771 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours.Agencies contributed to thisreportQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

On the spy chief’s agenda: moving vast amounts of top secret intelligence material into the US company’s cloud.Meeting at Microsoft’s headquarters near Seattle, a former chicken farm turned hi-tech campus, the spymaster, Yossi Sariel, won Nadella’s support for a plan that would grant Unit 8200 access to a customisedand segregated area within Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.Armed with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity, Unit 8200 began building a powerful new mass surveillance tool: a sweeping and intrusive system that collects and stores recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.Revealed here for the first time in an investigation by the Guardian with the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand Hebrew-language outletLocal Call, the cloud-based system – which firstbecame operational in 2022 – enables Unit 8200 to store a giant trove of calls daily for extended periods of time.Microsoft claims Nadella was unaware of what kind of data Unit 8200 planned to store in Azure. But a cache of leaked Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the company and Israeli military intelligence reveals how Azure has been used by Unit 8200 to store this expansive archive of everyday Palestinian communications.Quick GuideContact the reporters about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians.View image in fullscreenSatya Nadella speaks at a Microsoft event in New York on 26 October 2016.Photograph: Lucas Jackson/ReutersIntelligence sources with knowledge of the project said Unit 8200’s leadership turned to Microsoft after concluding it did not have sufficient storage space or computing power on the military’s servers to bear the weight of an entire population’s phone calls.Several intelligence officers from the unit, which is comparable to the US National Security Agency (NSA) in its surveillance capabilities, said that a mantra emerged internally that captured the project’s scale and ambition: “A million calls an hour”.The system was built to sit on Microsoft’s servers behind enhanced layers of security developed by the company’s engineers with Unit 8200’s instructions. The leaked Microsoftfiles suggest that a large proportion of the unit’s sensitive data may now be sitting in the company’s datacentres in the Netherlands and Ireland.Disclosures about the role of Microsoft’s Azure platform in the surveillance project come as the US tech giant faces pressure from employees andinvestorsover its ties to Israel’s military and the role its technology has played in the 22-month offensive in Gaza.In May, an employee disrupted a keynote speech by Nadellain an act of protest, at one point yelling: “How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”After the Guardian and othersrevealedin January Israel’s reliance on Microsoft technology during the war in Gaza, the company commissioned an external review of the relationship. The review, Microsoftsaid, had “found no evidence to date” that Azure or its AI products were “used to target or harm people” in the territory.A senior Microsoft source said the company had held conversations with Israeli defence officials and stipulated how its technology should be used in Gaza, insisting Microsoft systems must not be employed for the identification of targets for lethal strikes.View image in fullscreenA signal intelligence–gathering installation of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit responsible for collecting signals intelligence (Sigint) and code decryption, located on an observation point on the Israeli-Lebanese border near Rosh HaNikra crossing also known as Ras al-Naqoura crossing.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyHowever, Unit 8200 sources said intelligence drawn from the enormous repositories of phone calls held in Azure had been used to research and identify bombing targets in Gaza. One of the sources said that when planning an airstrike on an individual located within densely populated areas where high numbers of civilians are present, officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the immediate vicinity.The sources alsosaid use of the system had increased during the campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 60,000 people in the territory, the majority of whom are civilians, including over 18,000 children.Q&AHow many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?ShowAccording to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people.The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But the initial focus of the system was the West Bank, where an estimated 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military occupation. Unit 8200 sources said the information stored in Azure amounted toa rich repository of intelligence about its population that some in the unit claimed had been used to blackmail people, place them in detention, or even justify their killing after the fact.“When they need to arrest someone and there isn’t a good enough reason to do so, that’s where they find the excuse,” one said, referring to the information stored in the cloud.A Microsoft spokesperson said it had “no information” about the kind of data stored by Unit 8200 in its cloud. They said the company’s “engagement with Unit 8200 has been based on strengthening cybersecurity and protecting Israel from nation state and terrorist cyber-attacks”.“At no time during this engagement,” they added, “has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services, including through the external review it commissioned.”‘Tracking everyone, all the time’The driving force behind the cloud project – described by one source as a “revolution” within the unit – was Sariel, commander of Unit 8200 between early 2021 and late 2024. A career intelligence officer, Sariel was a strong advocate for projects of this scale.Following a 2015 wave of deadly so-called “lone wolf” attacks by young Palestinians, many of whom were teenagers unknown to the security services, Sariel had overseen a significant expansion of the volume of Palestinian communications that Unit 8200 intercepted and stored.His answer was to begin “tracking everyone, all the time”, said an officer who worked for Sariel at the time. Instead of traditional surveillance of specific targets, Sariel’s project relied on mass surveillance of Palestinians in the West Bank and used novel AI methods to extract insights.“Suddenly the entire public was our enemy,” said another source who worked on the project, which sought to predict whether someone represented a threat to Israeli security.One system developed in this period, sources said, scanned all text messages between Palestinians in the West Bank and assigned each message a risk rating based on an automated analysis of whether it included words deemed to be suspicious. Still in use, the system – known as “noisy message” – can identify text messages in which people talk about weapons or discuss wanting to die.View image in fullscreenNablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 1 November 2022.Photograph: Issam Rimawi/Anadolu via Getty ImagesWhen Sariel became Unit 8200 commander in early 2021, he prioritised forging a partnership with Microsoft that would give the unit the ability to go further and capture and analyse the content of millions of phone calls each day.At his meeting with Nadella later that year, Sariel does not appear to have explicitly stated his plan to store Palestinian phone calls in the cloud, referring instead to “sensitive workloads” of secret data, according to internal records of the meeting.But documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files, while some Israel-based Microsoft staff, including alumni of Unit 8200, appear to have known about what the unit hoped the joint project would achieve.“You don’t have to be a genius to figure it out,” one source said. “You tell [Microsoft] we don’t have any more space on the servers, that it’s audio files. It’s pretty clear what it is.”Microsoft’s spokesperson said: “We are not aware of Azure being used for the storage of such data.” They said Unit 8200 was simply a customer of its cloud services and Microsoft “did not build or consult with Unit 8200” on a cloud-based surveillance system.However, in early 2022, Microsoft and Unit 8200 engineers worked quickly and closely together to design and implement advanced security measures within Azure to meet the unit’s standards. “The rhythm of interaction with [the unit] is daily, top down and bottom up,” one document noted.Among Microsoft staff, the project was shrouded in considerable secrecy and engineers were told not to mention Unit 8200 by name. Under the plan, vast troves of raw intelligence material would sit in Microsoft’s datacentres overseas.View image in fullscreenA signals intelligence–gathering installation of Unit 8200 located near an observation point in Misgav Am, a kibbutz close to the border with Lebanon in northern Israel.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyFiles suggest that by July this year, 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data – equivalent to approximately 200m hours of audio – was held in Microsoft’s Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion was stored in Ireland. It’s unclear if all of this data belongs to Unit 8200; some may belong to other Israeli military units.According to the files, Unit 8200 informed Microsoft that it planned to move over timeas much as 70% of its data, including secret and top secret data, into Azure and was willing to “push the envelope” with the kind of sensitive and classified information that intelligence agencies normally held on their own servers. “They’re always trying to challenge the status quo,” one executive noted.Asked about Sariel’s meeting with Nadella, Microsoft’s spokesperson said it “is not accurate” to say the CEO provided his personal support for the project with Unit 8200. They said Nadella “attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting” and there was “no discussion” of the content of the data the unit planned to move into Azure.However, according to internal Microsoft records of the meeting seen by the Guardian, Nadella offered support for Sariel’s aspiration to move so much of the elite surveillance unit’s data into the cloud, described earlier in the meeting as including sensitive intelligence material.“Satya suggested that we identify certain workloads to begin with and then gradually move towards the 70% mark,” one record states. It adds that Nadella said “building the partnership is so critical” and “Microsoft is committed to providing resources to support.”‘The solution to our problems’Several months before meeting Microsoft CEO Nadella in 2021, Sariel had published a book about artificial intelligence under a pen name – revealed bythe Guardianto be the spy chief’s – in which he urged militaries and intelligence agencies to “migrate to the cloud”.Known within Israeli intelligence as a tech evangelist, Sariel valued what he characterised to colleagues as a friendly relationship with Nadella, according to a senior intelligence source. “Yossi bragged a lot, even to me, about his connection with Satya,” they said. (Microsoft denied that Nadella and Sariel had a close relationship.)“He sold [the partnership] internally and got a huge budget,” another former intelligence colleague said. “He claimed it was the solution to our problems in the Palestinian arena.”Sariel declined to comment and referred the Guardian’s questions about the project to the Israel Defence Forces. An IDF spokesperson said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on “legally supervised agreements”.They added: “The IDF operates in accordance with international law, with the aim of countering terrorism and ensuring the security of the state and its citizens.”After publication, the IDF issued a new statement. “We appreciate Microsoft’s support to protect our cybersecurity. We confirm that Microsoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.”For its part, Microsoft viewed the multiyear partnership as a lucrative commercial opportunity. Executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue and “an incredibly powerful brand moment” for Azure, according to the files.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators hold banners and signs as they protest outside the Microsoft Build conference at the Seattle convention center in Seattle, Washington, on 19 May 2025.Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images“[Unit 8200’s] leadership hopes to expand the mission-critical work tenfold in the coming years,” one executive noted.As Unit 8200 began to make use of Azure’s storage capabilities in 2022, intelligence officers rapidly grasped the new powers at their disposal. “The cloud is infinite storage,” one source familiar with the system said.Calls–which include calls made by Palestinians to international and Israeli numbers–are typically retained in the cloud for about one month, though storage can be scaled up, allowing the unit to keep hold of calls for longer periods of time when needed, several intelligence sources explained.‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targetsRead moreThis allows the unit to go back in time and retrieve the phone conversations of people who become of interest, they said. Previously, surveillance targets would need to be pre-selected for their conversations to be intercepted and stored.Several of the sources insisted the cloud-based system had prevented deadly attacks against Israelis. One said “saving lives” of Israelis was the principal motivation behind Sariel’s vision for the system. But it notably failed to prevent the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 in which nearly 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and 240 people were kidnapped.In the wake of the attacks, Sariel faced criticism for his apparent prioritisation of “addictive and exciting” technology over old-fashioned intelligence methods, which some critics said contributed to the disaster. Sariel resigned last year, accepting responsibility for “8200’s part in the intelligence and operational failure”.In the ensuing war in Gaza, the cloud-based system pioneered by Sariel has been put to frequent use alongside a series of AI-driven target recommendation tools also developed on his watch and debuted by the military in a campaign that has devastated civilian life and created a profound humanitarian crisis.Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s telecoms infrastructure has reduced the volume of phone calls in the territory but sources said theinformation held in thecloud remained useful. According to one, enthusiasm for the system had grown among intelligence officers working on Gaza as the war progressed and they saw the military is “heading towards long-term control there”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMicrosoftMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

Well, there’s good news and there’s bad news.Eating chips has been found to raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but baking, boiling or mashing potatoes was much healthier.Consuming french fries three times a week increases the chances of someone getting the disease by 20% – and doing so five times a week by 27% – according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.Globally, potatoes are thethird most commonly consumed food crop, after rice and wheat.Nine out of 10 of the estimated 5.8 million people in the UK with diabetes have the type 2 version of the disease, which is closely associated with lifestyle, especially diet.The findings confirm potatoes do not of themselves pose a danger to health, but frying them to turn them into chips, and eating them regularly, does make a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes more likely.An international team of researchers, led by Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, a public health expert at Harvard University, investigated the relationship between potato intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and 2021.Someone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%.“The high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes,” the study explains.Replacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%.Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but it’s how we prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium.“But when we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and calorie content that’s much more likely to contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.”However, replacing any form of potatoes with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the paper found.Dr Hashem added: “This research reinforces the simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes – just don’t rely on chips as your go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on, which are healthier and protective for long-term health.”The researchers stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk.The Food Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsChips (french fries)NutritionDiabetesnewsShareReuse this content"

Labour has warned that the industry is a “wild west” because of a lack of regulation around who can administer treatments such as dermatological filler and Botox injections.At present a licence is not required to perform such procedures in England.Healthdepartment officials said botched treatments had left people “maimed” and suffering from “dangerous complications, permanent scarring and even death”.Ministers plan to introduce new rules whereby only qualified healthcare professionals can deliver high-risk procedures such as liquid Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs).UK health officials issue warning over cosmetic jabs after 38 botulism casesRead moreProviders will need to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and those found to be breaking rules could face sanctions and financial penalties. Clinics offering lower-risk procedures such as Botox and fillers will need to be licensed by their local authority.The proposals will be subject to a consultation early next year that will seek views on the types of procedures that should be covered by the new regulations.Liquid BBLs involve injecting filler into the buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger or more rounded. The procedure can cause serious side-effects such as blood clots and sepsis.A 33-year-old woman, Alice Webb,died last yearafter complications from a suspected liquid BBL in Gloucestershire.Last month, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute warned that fat injections, BBLs, Botox and fillers were being offered by untrained people in places such as public toilets. Health officialslaunched an investigationafter several people had reactions to Botox-like injections this year.The government urged people always to ask for providers’ qualifications and insurance and to be wary of “suspiciously cheap” offers.Restrictions on high-risk treatments will be introduced via an amendment to the CQC’s regulations, while licensing for providers of lower-risk procedures will be introduced via secondary legislation.The government also plans to bring in restrictions for under-18s on high-risk cosmetic procedures unless these have been approved by a healthcare professional. It became illegal for children to receive Botox and dermal fillers in England in 2021.The Scottish government announced plans in May to regulate aesthetic treatments, but there have been no moves to tighten regulation in Wales or Northern Ireland. “The government’s move to regulate non-surgical aesthetic procedures is an important first step forward for patient safety,” said Tim Mitchell, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons.The sudden, surprising rise of beard transplants: ‘This industry is a wild west’Read moreBut Mitchell stressed that regulation should go further, by ensuring that procedures such as buttock or breast augmentation are performed only by surgeons who have been recognised by the Cosmetic Surgery Board.“This will ensure high standards of care, reduce avoidable harm and give patients the confidence they deserve when seeking aesthetic treatments,” he said.Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said the changes would “mean little without a serious overhaul of consumer enforcement teams such as trading standards, which are currently stretched too thinly to properly investigate these rogue traders who are putting consumers at risk”.Millie Kendall, the chief executive of the British Beauty Council, which represents the industry, said the changes “will help instil confidence as well as helping to prevent the normalisation of horror stories that have become synonymous with our sector”.Karin Smyth, a health minister, said: “The cosmetics industry has been plagued by a wild west of dodgy practitioners and procedures. There are countless horror stories of cosmetic cowboys causing serious, catastrophic damage.“This government is taking action to protect those seeking treatments, support honest and competent practitioners, and root out the cowboys as part of our plan for change.“This isn’t about stopping anyone from getting treatments – it’s about preventing rogue operators from exploiting people at the expense of their safety and keeping people safe. We’re giving them peace of mind and reducing the cost to theNHSof fixing botched procedures.”Explore more on these topicsPlastic surgeryHealthWes StreetingNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

Just before 8pm Birmingham Airport said its runway had reopened and flights had started to depart.The hub apologised for the disruption caused by the incident and said passengers must check flight details and follow advice issued by their airlines. Some flights had to be diverted to Manchester and East Midlands airports.Passengers have been told to check the status of their flight before coming to Birmingham airport, where check-in and security were also temporarily closed.All of those onboard the Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, which was flying to Belfast, have been discharged.Earlier, Birmingham airport posted on X: “Following an aircraft incident that occurred this afternoon, operations are expected to remain suspended until at least 8pm. Passengers at the airport are advised to speak to their airline for further information. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.”The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said disruption at the airport was “minimal” but she understood “how frustrating” the situation was for passengers.Gunnar Lauridsen, 76, from Denmark had been on holiday playing golf, and said he would most likely miss his connecting flight because of the closed runway.“We are ultimately going to Billund in Denmark,” he said. “This delay probably means we can’t get our connection, so that means that we will be staying probably in Amsterdam overnight.“I should have been to the doctors tomorrow morning. When you travel things happen.”Camile Monteleone, 30, was meant to fly home to Barcelona after working in the UK for three days but did not know if her flight from the airport had been cancelled.The visual merchandiser said: “I don’t have any news … It doesn’t say anything on the Ryanair app about the flight. I’m just waiting for information. I have to let people know I’m here, stuck at the airport. I can’t do anything else.”Faye Melhuish, 38, who arrived home from a holiday in Spain with her six-month-old daughter, said her flight had been unable to land at Birmingham and had to be diverted.“We flew from Spain and we were due to land here at 2.20pm,” she said. “Then in the air we were circling to see if we could land. The captain basically said we are going to have to go to East Midlands.”Speaking about her daughter, Melhuish said: “It’s her first time on a plane and her first time on a coach.”West Midlands police had previously posted on X: “We are at Birmingham airport this afternoon after a small aircraft was involved in an emergency landing at around 1.40pm. Officers are among the emergency crews at the scene and one person has been reported to have minor injuries.“The Civil Aviation Authority has been informed and the airport has suspended operations as an investigation is carried out.”The response to the incident will be led by the Air Accidents Investigations Branch, a CAA spokesperson said. “In the event of delays or cancellations, passengers will be expected to be provided with food and drink as well as accommodation if delayed overnight,” they said.The Air Accidents Investigations Branch said it had started an investigation into the incident, with “a multi-disciplinary team including inspectors with expertise in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data” deployed to the airport.Woodgate Aviation said one of its Beechcraft aircraft was involved in the emergency landing as a result of landing gear problems.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamAir transportEnglandWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision was taken in March earlier this year.In a statement published on its websitethe SRA said that a tribunal “has certified that there is a case to answer in respect of allegations which are or include that, on or around 26 April 2017, Ms Gill sent or arranged to be sent correspondence which contained an improper threat of litigation”.It added that the allegations were subject to a full hearing and were as yet unproven. SRA cases are heard by the independent Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, which can issue an unlimited fine or bar a solicitor from the profession.Carter-Ruck as a firm is not being prosecuted by the SRA.View image in fullscreenRuja Ignatova, the founder of OneCoin, vanished in 2018 and remains wanted by the FBI.Photograph: Paul Hampartsoumian/Rex/ShutterstockThe nature of the threat, and the identity of the client on whose behalf Gill issued it, are not stated in the SRA announcement. However, it is understood that the case relates to Gill’s work for OneCoin, which was later established to bea multibillion-dollar fake cryptocurrency, and its founder, Ruja Ignatova.In 2023 the Bureau of Investigative Journalismreportedon threats from Carter-Ruck on behalf of OneCoin and Ignatova, including a letter sent on 26 April 2017 to Jen McAdam, a OneCoin victim.The letter was obtained and published by the thinktank Tax Policy Associates and its founder, Dan Neidle, who complained about Gill to the SRA.In the letter published by Neidle, Gill accused McAdam of posting links to online videos alleging that OneCoin was a fraud. “The statements you have published … go way beyond what may be considered to be legitimate debate,” Gill wrote to McAdam. “You can be in no doubt therefore of the damage being caused to our clients’ reputation and business.”In a statement Carter-Ruck said: “We are disappointed by the SRA’s decision to bring these proceedings against our colleague, who we will be fully supporting in her defence of this matter.” McAdampostedon X that she was unable to comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both men are in custody and due to appear at Warwick crown court on 26 August.Warwickshire county council’s chief executive briefed Finch confidentially about the immigration status of the two men, according to a letter by the force’s chief constable, Alex Franklin-Smith.Franklin-Smith said he confirmed to Finch last Thursday that this information was accurate but that “we wouldn’t be releasing immigration status at point of charge as we follow national guidance”.The police chief said he had asked the Home Office to confirm the full immigration status of the two men, given that Finch had released some details publicly.He added: “I am confident that Warwickshire police has treated this investigation seriously from the outset, working tirelessly to identify, locate, arrest and charge those suspected of being responsible for this awful crime as quickly as possible.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “As the home secretary said yesterday, it has been widely reported that this case involves two Afghan individuals who are in the asylum system, some of which information has already been confirmed in open court.“The home secretary has made clear that there is a strong public interest in maximum transparency wherever that is possible.“That is why the Home Office and College of Policing are working together to strengthen and clarify the guidance around how and when information is released.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he wrote.Trump had signaled on Tuesday that he would imminently announce new tariffs, tellingCNBCthat the country was “fueling the war machine” against Ukraine.India has said that it feels unjustly singled out for its trade relationship with Russia. In astatementon Wednesday, the country’s ministry of external affairs said that its imports “are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people in India”.“We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable. India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interest,” the statement read.Trump has also been critical of India’s role in theBricstrading bloc formed among some of the US’s trading partners and competitors, including Brazil, Russia, China and India. Trump has called the group “anti the United States”.In 2024, Indian imports into the US were estimated to be worth $129bn (£97bn).India now faces the highest tariff rate along with Brazil, which also has 50% tariffs in response to the country’s arrest of its former president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. Aslateof Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs are set to go into effect this Friday, including the 50% tariff on Brazil, a 35% tariff on Canada and a 25% tariff on Mexico.In recent weeks, Trump has set his sights on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he had said he would end in his first 24 hours in office. Trump set a 10-day deadline for this Friday for Russia to make a peace deal with Ukraine. The US special envoy Steve WitkoffvisitedMoscow on Wednesday to hold talks with the Kremlin. Trumpclaimed“great progress was made” during the three-hour talks.When Trump was asked on Sunday what would happen if Russia does not end the war by his Friday deadline, hesaid: “Well, there will be sanctions, but they seem to be pretty good at avoiding sanctions.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsIndiaRussiaDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Facebook parent has poached staff from OpenAI and others in a hiring drive to build an AI “superintelligence” unit.OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said Meta had taken “none of our best people” despite offering“crazy” signing bonuses of $100m (£74m).Anthropic, another rival, founded by former OpenAI employees, is reportedly in negotiations for a fundraising valuing the business at $170bn. Fundraising is a continuing requirement for AI startups as they seek finance to train the increasingly sophisticated models that power their products, a process that involves using expensive computer chips and data centre capacity.The report comes as Altman indicated that OpenAI was preparing to release an upgraded version of the model powering ChatGPT. On Sunday heshared a screenshotof what appeared to be the company’s latest AI model, GPT-5.OpenAI also launchedtwo new open modelson Tuesday, meaning they can be downloaded freely and customised, in a competitive challenge to Meta and China’s DeepSeek, which have also launched open AI models.“We’re excited to make this model, the result of billions of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the most people possible,” said Altman.However, OpenAI’s main business is based on “closed” models, whose inner workings cannot be accessed, and it charges for subscriptions for enhanced versions of ChatGPT or for integrating its models into businesses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But on the whole it’s been like really wonderfully good for both companies.”In March a US judgedenied Musk’s request for a preliminary injunction to pauseOpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model. Musk, the world’s richest person, was a co-founder of OpenAI and left the company in 2019 – but has accused the startup of straying from its founding mission to developartificial intelligencefor the good of humanity, rather than for corporate profit.OpenAI is also pushing into hardware afterbuying a startup, io, owned by the iPhone designer Sir Jony Ive in a $6.4bn deal. Altman reportedly told employees that OpenAI planned to build 100m AI “companions” that would be part of users’ everyday life.Mass production of the unnamed io gadget is not expected to start until 2027, although Altman has described a prototype as “the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen”.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIChatGPTSam AltmanElon MuskArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMetanewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs by José CíceroWed 6 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 08.29 EDTShareThough 60 miles (100km) apart, the Brazilian municipalities of Presidente Kennedy in Espírito Santo state and Campos dos Goytacazes in Rio de Janeiro state have one big thing in common: oil. Since late in the last century, their public funds have been bolstered by billions in royalties fromoil finds in the offshore Campos Basin.Yet despite having significantly more resources than other towns and cities inBrazil, both still face problems such as poor sanitation and healthcare, inadequate social housing and state education as well as corruption scandals.View image in fullscreenDespite Presidente Kennedy receiving record amounts of oil revenues per capita, the town still suffers form poor infrastructure.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaThe Brazilian government’s resolve to continue to explore for oil – in June, it announced it wouldauction a series of oil and gas exploration blocks, including 19 of 47 areas near themouth of the Amazon River– echoes adecades-old Brazilian promisethat oil exploration would benefit its people, despite evidence that it has not always resulted in gains for much of the population.A map showing th eocation of Presidente Kennedy and Campos dos GoytacazesAnalysis based on Candido Mendes University (Ucam)’s InfoRoyalties, a database of Brazilian oil revenues, reveals that most of the 15 municipalities with the highest oil revenues per capita between 1999 and 2024 have mediocre social and economic indicators, often ranking among the worst in their regions.Adjusted for inflation, these municipalities collectively received nearly 150bn reais (£20bn) over the five years, or about R$95,000 for each resident.View image in fullscreenOne resident of Presidente Kennedy says: ‘Many say our people could be among the wealthiest, and I agree, given the royalties it receives.’Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaAlthough royalties have enabled local councils to fund infrastructure projects and welfare programmes, they have not significantly reduced poverty. Nearly one in four people in these municipalities live below the poverty line, with a family income per head of less than 218 reais (£29).Our people could be among the wealthiest … the city should be a showpiece but instead it remains a city of miseryFélix de Jesus, farmerIn 2023, six of these 15 municipalities are ranked lowest in their states based on the Brazilian federal government’sBasic Education Development Indexfor early primary education, while only four are top performers in later years.More than half of the municipalities have rates of preventable deaths and infant mortality (ie of children aged less than one year)that are only average or worse for their states.Lia Hasenclever, a researcher at Ucam, says the oil revenues have had little positive impact on key socioeconomic development indicators. “Municipalities which do not receive royalties perform better in health and education than those that do,” she says. “Oil has an economic impact but no social impact.”The small town of Presidente Kennedy holds the record for Brazil’s highest oil revenue per person. Between 1999 and 2024, the municipality received 5.7bn reais in royalties – or nearly R$390,000 for each of its 14,600 or so residents.View image in fullscreenCampos dos Goytacazes had oil revenues averaging $1bn a year from 2019 to 2024 but still has abandoned health facilities around the city.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaThe oil boom provided “luxuries” that are rare in other municipalities of similar size and many public facilities were upgraded.But everyday problems persist. Despite investments in health facilities, including the local hospital, residents are frustrated by the lack of provision for more complex medical care and complain about medicine shortages at health centres.“If you need an MRI, ultrasound or to see a specialist, you have to go to other municipalities,” says one Presidente Kennedy resident who preferred not to be named. Pregnant women are sometimes forced to travel up to an hour to reach a birth centre or maternity ward, they add.In the Marobá Beach area of Presidente Kennedy, basic sanitation is lacking and residents rely on bottled water. “The water here was very poor, sometimes tasting like iron. Now it’s better, but still not drinkable,” says Renata Oliveira, secretary of the town’s Z14 fishing company.View image in fullscreenCampos dos Goytacazes’sSambódromo,a stadium built to host the samba schools’ annual parade, had its wiring stolen and lies unused for most of the year.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaFélix de Jesus, a farmer, says he cannot see where the oil money goes. “Many say our people could be among the wealthiest, and I agree.“Given the royalties it receives, the city should be a showpiece, but instead, it remains a city of misery,” he says. “Where is this money going?”In Campos dos Goytacazes, a city of about 500,000 people, oil revenues totalled more than 37bn reais from 1999 to 2024, averaging R$72,700 per resident.But, says Ucam professor Rodrigo Lira, “this budget increase has not resulted in social justice or reduced inequalities. No research demonstrates any progress in this area.”View image in fullscreenEven with a larger budget than bigger cities, Campos de Goytacazes’s education indicators are below the state average. A school caretaker set up a charity to help pupils with cheap extra tuition.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaAs in Marobá, residents along Campos de Goytacazes’ only beach, Farol de São Thomé, lack basic sanitation and must install septic tanks themselves. Urban cleaning and rubbish collection services are poor, and residents use insect repellant constantly to deter the mosquitoes that breed nearby.‘Will you stop exploring yours?’: Latin America forges ahead on new oil frontierRead moreLocal people also complain about the education provision. In Novo Jóquei, José Ricardo, a school caretaker who also offers low-cost tutoring for the area’s children through his charity, Anjos Solidários do Bem (Solidarity Angels of Good)–says there are teenagers moving from fifth to sixth grade, aged 11, without any solid educational foundation.“We could be in a much better situation now if the politicians had invested in industry and in the city’s future,” he says.Brazilian politicians have long championed the idea that oil wealth is key to the development of Brazil and its municipalities, ever since the first oilfields were explored.View image in fullscreenPresident Luiz Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva, centre, with ministers and Magda Chambriard, head of the state-owned oil firm Petrobras on his right, at the Duque de Caxias refinery last month.

The National Petroleum Agency’s (ANP)expansion of offshore oil exploration, announced in June, was a proposal made by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s leftwing government. it has already borne fruit: earlier this weekBP announcedthat it has made its largest global oil and gas discovery in 25 years in the country’s Santos basin.Lula, and other Brazilian policymakers such as the mines and energy minister, Alexandre Silveira, argue that oil extraction from theEquatorial Marginreserves, located 109 miles (175km) off the coast,which includes the Amazon River mouth, couldboost developmentin the northern state of Amapá, which ranks 25th of Brazil’s 27 states in the country’sHuman Development Index (HDI).View image in fullscreenThe municipality spent millions paving the promenade along Presidente Kennedy’s Marobá Beach, but there are few visitors to the area.Photograph: José Cícero/Agência PúblicaBut Sergio Gobetti, from the Brazilian government’sInstitute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), argues that claiming oil money will solve Amapá’s socioeconomic problems is a predictable yet flawed argument.“From Brazil’s and global experience,” he says, “there is no assurance that increased oil revenues will lead to true development.”Additional reporting by Bianca Muniz and Bruno FonsecaThis report is a partnership withAgência Pública.Read it in Portuguese on the Agência Pública siteExplore more on these topicsInequality and developmentThe Latin and Caribbean oil rushOil (Environment)Oil (Business)Fossil fuelsBrazilPovertyCommoditiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her first ever professional tennis match took place next door to a Rolling Stones concert. Now, 31 years later, at 45 years old, Williams is still here.Three weeks after returning to professional tennis for the first time in 16 months with a straight sets singles victory over the then world No 35 Peyton Stearns at the Citi Open in Washington, which marked her as the second-oldest woman in history to win a WTA Tour-level singles match and also silenced criticisms about her enduring presence on the tour, Williams now takes her comeback to the Cincinnati Open.Emma Raducanu adds Rafael Nadal’s former coach Francisco Roig to her teamRead moreOnce one of the most precocious youngsters of her time, a US Open finalist by the age of 17, Williams continues to compete. She is one of the greatest tennis players of all time in her own right, a seven-time singles grand slam champion, Olympic gold medallist and former No 1 in singles. Despite all she has achieved, her enduring love for her sport means she continues to step on the practice court every day with the aim of being the best player she can be.“Love is the key, right?” says Williams. “If you don’t love it, then get out of it. If you can, if you have that luxury, not everyone has that luxury. For me, I think a lot of the motivation for me is just to come back and try to play in the best health that I can.“I never stopped hitting the ball, even when I was away, not as intensely as you would if you were playing tournaments, but I was still going out there. And I think that at the end of the day, you have to live your life on your own terms. Your terms should be yours. Doesn’t matter what anyone else says or what anyone else thinks, if you get to live life on your own terms of life, [do] that. And I firmly believe in that.”This comeback, however, is not merely about striking a tennis ball. Last month, Williams revealed she has suffered with fibroids for years, non-cancerous tumours that develop in and around the uterus, which left her with excruciating symptoms including pelvic pain and heavy bleeding. In addition to the significant impact fibroids has had on Williams’ everyday life, it also affected her tennis career. She says she had been misdiagnosed for years.Last week, in the aftermath of her returning in Washington, Williams posted a series of videos from exactly a year ago when she was undergoing an open myomectomy surgery to remove the fibroids and a large focal adenomyoma in her uterus, tissue from the lining of the uterus that had grown in her uterine wall.View image in fullscreenVenus Williams spoke about her health issues and desire to compete before the Cincinnati Open.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty Images“I was told I was inoperable,” she wrote. “I was told I could bleed to death on the table. I was told to get a surrogate and forget the hope to carry my own children. I was misdiagnosed. I went untreated for years and years and years.”As she has returned to the court, Williams has used the publicity around her return to shine a light on women’s medical issues. “I just remember after my surgery, I was feeling so much gratitude but I was able to have the resources to finally get through that, and I remember that was the biggest feeling that I had. And at that point, I was nowhere near playing professional tennis, but now a year later, I’m in a completely different space, and I have a clean bill of health, thank God, and I’m ready to play and compete.”The next competitive challenge for Williams will be the 22-year-old world No 51 Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro. On the day Bouzas Maneiro was born, 24 September 2002, Williams had already won four grand slam singles titles, reached No 1 and contested the previous three consecutive major finals against her younger sister, Serena.The elder Williams sibling said the US swing was the focus for her return and she is unlikely to compete after the US Open. The rest is unknown. “I’m very much in the moment,” she said. “I don’t think you should ever rule me out. That’s all I can say.”Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt like that I am going to be super busy. Me and my family thought it would probably be of best interest to not accept that. I was definitely a little shocked when my name was mentioned.

I will definitely show some exciting football, and we definitely will have success.”Tottenham need to find a way to capitalise on legacy of trailblazer Son | John DuerdenRead moreLAFC formally introduced their new forward Wednesday at BMO Stadium, where his likeness already looms over the main entrance gates and on video boards surrounding the stadium. The 33-year-old South Korean superstar is back on the Pacific Rim after a professional career spent in Europe, including the past decade at Tottenham.“What can I say? Dream come true. LA, what a city,” said Son, who will wear No 7 in black and gold.Son joined Los Angeles FC for a record Major League Soccer transfer fee, ending his lengthy stint at the Premier League club. Financial details of the transfer were not disclosed by either club but the Athletic reported LAFC paid a fee in the region of $26.5m.Son had suitors from around the globe after he decided to leave Spurs, and he said the decision to join LAFC initially wasn’t obvious. He came around to the idea of moving toMLSafter conversations with LAFC general manager John Thorrington, who sold Son on the eight-year-old club’s ambition to be an international brand and the most successful club in North America.“If I’m honest, it was not my first choice,” Son said. “But [from the] first call when I talked to John after the season finished, he just changed my mind. He changed my heart. He changed my brain. He showed me the destination where I should be. Right now, I’m here. I’m more than happy.”Son laughingly said he was also pitched aggressively by Hugo Lloris, his longtime teammate at Tottenham who is now LAFC’s starting goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min watches Los Angeles FC’s win at home to Tigres in the Leagues Cup on Tuesday.Photograph: Ringo Chiu/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockSon is South Korea’s most popular athlete, and he is widely considered to be the greatest Asian soccer player in history. He said he already feels at home in Los Angeles, which has the world’s largest ethnic Korean population outside Korea and a robust base of soccer fans from all backgrounds who appreciate his accomplishments.Son’s introductory news conference was attended by Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, South Korea’s consul general, several additional politicians, dozens of Korean journalists and dozens of drum-beating, singing fans from the LAFC supporters’ group famous for its relentless, raucous noise during matches. Son already got a taste of LAFC fans’ passion Tuesday when he attended the club’s Leagues Cup victory over Tigres.“On behalf of millions of Angelenos and soccer fans around the world – Sonny, welcome to Los Angeles,” Bass said. “This is a moment that will be remembered in the city for generations to come.”Son joins a lengthy list of soccer stars from European leagues who moved to Hollywood for a second act in their careers. Gareth Bale, Giorgio Chiellini and Olivier Giroud have all suited up for LAFC, while the crosstown rival LA Galaxy have welcomed even more European superstars, including David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robbie Keane and Marco Reus.Son did not appear to be in decline during the past season as Tottenham’s captain, and he said he is in good game shape after participating in Spurs’ summer tour of Asia. He did not set a date for his LAFC debut, but it could be this month.“I just felt like I need a new chapter, I need a new challenge, and I choose LAFC,” Son said. “I think we can say I’m old, but I still have a good physicality, good legs, and still have a good quality. I’m here to perform, but also I want to give some advice to the young players for improvement.

Chelsea stayed relatively under the radar for much of the Club World Cup – in part because of their relatively kind route to the later stages – but theircommanding 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germainin the final means they are again regarded as a potentially dominant European force and perhaps even as contenders for the Premier League title.That is ifChelseaare ready – mentally, physically and tactically – for the new season. By the time Chelsea played the Club World Cup final on 13 July, nearly every other Premier League side had started their pre-season. Since then, while Liverpool, Arsenal and co have been hard at work, the players have had three weeks off and returned on Monday, with two friendly matches, two days apart, scheduled before their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on 17 August. To say Chelsea are playing catch-up is a severe understatement.That said, this is probably the most exciting period for Chelsea since the Champions League triumph in 2021. With the exception of goalkeeper and possibly centre-back, Enzo Maresca has a claim to having two elite players in every position and he could yet add further depth with Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho heavily linked. Departures will be needed to trim the fat and balance the books – Chelsea were givena €31m (£27m) fine last month by Uefa for breaking financial rules– but few would argue against them having the deepest squad in the league and one of Maresca’s biggest challenges will be maintaining harmony and continuity, on and off the pitch. Last season, the Conference League was a useful chance to rest and rotate players. The Champions League will not be so accommodating.Past five seasonsThe managerAs recently as April, Maresca was at odds with the Chelsea fans and appeared to blame a negative environment at Stamford Bridge fora 2-2 home draw with Ipswichthat left top-five hopes fading fast. But five wins from the final six league games secured fourth place, saving Chelsea’s season and possibly Maresca’s job. “They were saying that we are too young, we are not good enough,” he said. “Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong. So in English, how do you say? Eff-off to all of them.” Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph – and the tactical masterclass by Maresca in the final to neutralise PSG’s front three and create pockets of space for Cole Palmer – means he will get a very different reception at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s league opener.View image in fullscreenThe Chelsea head coach, Enzo Maresca, will be a more popular man when he returns to Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureChelsea’s much-maligned financial gymnastics of recent years – the eight-year contract amortisation (a loophole closed by Uefa), the sale of their hugely successful women’s team (to their own parent company) and their rampant use of multiclub ownership and the loan system – have infuriated rivals and allowed them to assemble one of the deepest, youngest, most talented squads around. In the Todd Boehly era, Chelsea have spent more than £1.5bn and the club face an additional €60m fine from Uefa if they fail to comply with regulations over the next four years. A bigger stadium would help, but what Chelsea do with Stamford Bridgeremains unclear; the 40,044-capacity ground is not easily developed given challenges ranging from the freehold to a nearby railway line. A move to Earl’s Court has been mooted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 18-year-old’s performances at the Club World Cup – includinga brilliant strike for Palmeiras against Chelseain the quarter-final – suggests that the summer arrival is already world class.Players swooned over the teenager at the final whistlein Philadelphia – “I told Estêvão: ‘We are excited for you to join’ but he didn’t understand a single word I said,” Palmer said after swapping shirts with the £52m signing. Capable off both wings or as a No 10, the slender Estêvão will want to impress the former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, now of Brazil, before the World Cup next summer.Stepping up“He potentially can be a top defender for this club,” Maresca said of Josh Acheampong after the defender’s performances at the Club World Cup prompted whispers that several clubs in England and Europewere tracking the teenager. How the 19-year-old fits into Maresca’s plans remains to be seen, but his versatility, 6ft 3in stature and composure enabled him to enjoy a breakthrough year with 13 first-team appearances. Naturally a right-back or a centre-back but capable of playing anywhere across the backline, Acheampong joined Chelsea as an under-eight and signed a new five-year contract in 2024. “The clubs that were mentioned, they like Josh, but we also like Josh,” Maresca said. “The best plan for Josh is to be with us.”A big season for …Roméo Lavia. The 21-year-old’s quality is not in question. Chelsea are a better side with Lavia, more fluid and press-resistant, and he wassensational in a 3-1 win against Liverpool in Maywhen he completed 100% of his passes. Maresca even moved Moisés Caicedo to right-back to accommodate Lavia alongside Enzo Fernández at the back end of last season, but concerns remain over the Belgian’s fitness. After a first year when he managed 32 minutes in 2023-24, another injury-hit campaign followed, starting 11 league games. Another year on the sidelines could spell trouble, particularly as Chelsea have Caicedo, Fernández, Dário Essugo, the impressive Andrey Santos and perhaps Reece James competing for two spots in defensive midfield in Maresca’s preferred 4-2-3-1 formation.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26ChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

You know that phrase: ‘The game’s gone’? I think the game is genuinely going away. It’s excluding traditional supporters and the communities that built the clubs in the first place.”Clarke has just celebrated his 30th birthday and is coming off the back of a big season. As one of the four season-ticket holders behind the MCFC Fans Foodbank Support, Clarke has been active among the Manchester City fanbase and in the community since the pandemic. With the growing concern over the pricing and provision of tickets at his club last year, he helped coordinate protests by fans whose rivalries go back generations, but whose problems are increasingly shared. Supporters of Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United and others joined City fans under the banner “Stop Exploiting Loyalty” and in doing so became part of a new wave of supporter activism.Sexism and misogyny drive record levels of abuse at football games last seasonRead more“I know there’s all these things about multi-club ownership, private and state ownership, playing games abroad, accusations of killing the soul of the game,” Clarke says. “But, really, what is the game? It’s the communities that go to it, it’s the communities that have made the clubs who they are, going back four, five, six generations till their very inception.“The wider football supporter community are only just now cottoning on that we have so much more in common and if we don’t stand together the game is going to be gone before we know it. That’s all we have to do and all we can do. We just need to really keep up that momentum.”It already seems there will be reason for fans to take a stand once more this season. It is not the first time they will have come together to demand change, but for those with clubs at the top of the pyramid there is a sense the ground is shifting and the needs of fans is becoming an afterthought, if not an outright problem.At the heart is a concern that clubs want to move away from having matches filled with season-ticket holders towards something more casual, and more lucrative. Imagine every Premier League fixture becoming more like an Oasis gig, for ever.“The problems are different at different levels of the game,” says Tom Greatrex, the new chair of the Football Supporters’ Association, who drove the Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. “In the Premier League, and at the top of the Championship, Stop Exploiting Loyalty has helped to bring to the fore a set of issues that have been developing over a period of time.“We are seeing that parts of clubs’ fanbases, which have traditionally been loyal and go home and away, are now almost expendable to not all, but many of the people that currently run a number of those clubs. It’s gone beyond exploitation to expendability.”View image in fullscreenFootball fans are increasingly ready to take a stand against their club.Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty ImagesFans are suffering rises in ticket prices, the lowering or ending of ticket concessions and initiatives that require season-ticket holders to attend a certain number of games each season or risk losing their place, as examples of this trend. According to Greatrex, the effects are being felt in some grounds.“The number of people who are there almost to experience something which they’re not necessarily part of has tipped into a significant proportion to the extent that it undermines the thing they’re going there to experience,” he says. “There is a real danger that in a short-term push for increased revenue from matchday tickets and associated spend that clubs are in danger of actually undermining the whole ‘product’ they’re so proud of.”One topic that crystallises the anxiety over expendability is that of matches being selected for TV. There will be more televised games than ever this season, with Sky showing a minimum 215 Premier League fixtures. With each televised match comes possible rescheduling and a potentially challenging (or even impossible) journey for fans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think there’s been enough focus on things that could be done to mitigate some of the frustration that comes from those changes.” The FSA has called for a 12-week notice period on fixture rearrangements, the provision of more “football special” trains and the extension of the £30 cap on away tickets into the EFL.The Premier League has committed to giving six weeks’ notice of fixture adjustments on all matches until January, but last month had to apologise after failing to meet its own deadline of announcing all September adjustments by 9 July.It is striking that the mood among fans is so febrile at the time the government has passed legislation designed, in part, to give supporters more influence over their clubs. Fan consultation is a central requirement of the new Independent Football Regulator for the English men’s elite game and legislation is, in part, the result of long-term campaigning by the FSA.It is not a panacea and its influence is unlikely to take hold for some seasons yet, but Greatrex, a former Labour MP, believes it can form a platform for better understanding between fans, clubs and competitions. “More than ever, there is an appreciation – among some, it’s reluctant, but among others, it’s embraced – thatsupporters have a legitimate voicethat deserves to be heard and their views to be considered,” he says.“[The regulator] is actually the basis for a much more constructive approach, which means that if clubs are sensible you can prevent a lot of the flashpoints getting to the point at which they become high profile, because you’ve dealt with it sensibly ahead of that time.”Clarke would much rather have dialogue than protest. “I don’t want to be doing another protest all my life,” he says. “I know there’s no easy answers but a lot of this protest energy has come because people feel they’re not being listened to. That’s where the anger comes from.”Explore more on these topicsFootballFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On an evening when Viktor Gyökeres was meant to announce himself as the solution to all of Mikel Arteta’s problems, instead it was a figure from Arsenal’s past who stole the show.At £72m – £8m more than they may end up paying for the Sweden striker – Nicolas Pépé was an expensive Arsenal signing, a few months before Arteta replaced Unai Emery in 2019. Most of the fans who packed out the Emirates Stadium for this pre-season friendly will not have many fond memories of the Ivory Coast international’s spell in north London, but he clearly had a point to prove here.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 1: ArsenalRead morePépé’s early goal and strikes from Karl Etta Eyong and the former Tottenham loanee Arnaut Danjuma sealed an impressive win forVillarreal, and left Arteta with plenty of questions to resolve before Arsenal’s opening game of the season next weekend against Manchester United.Gyökeres, who is the headline act of a spending spreethat could exceed £200m, looked short of match fitness as he toiled up front for 62 minutes. Only the introduction of the 15‑year‑old Max Dowman for his first senior appearance at the Emirates Stadium could lift the mood as he won a penalty that allowed Martin Ødegaard to make the scoreline more respectable. But there were more reasons to be fearful for Arsenal’s fans as they aim to improve on finishing as Premier League runners-up for a third successive season.There had been a sense of anticipation in the late summer air as they queued patiently at the club shop before kick‑off, with several already sporting Gyökeres’s new replica No 14 shirt. Having made his debut last week as a substitute against Spurs in their 1-0 defeat in Hong Kong, the Sweden striker is still playing catch‑up having stayed away from pre-season with Sporting as he attempted to force through his move. But he was included in a strong starting lineup, with Ethan Nwaneri deputising for Ødegaard alongside the new signing Christian Nørgaard and Mikel Merino in midfield.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta (centre, in black) watches the penalty shootout against Villarreal.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe match programme featured pictures of all six of Arsenal’s summer arrivals on the cover, with Martín Zubimendi, Cristhian Mosquera, Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga on the bench. Arteta used his programme notes to express his belief they “will add quality and depth to the squad, which is what we are going to need throughout the season”.Arteta added: “We know what our targets are and what we want to achieve this season – there is a big belief in our ability to achieve that. We have been very, very close the last few seasons and the whole team is going to determine whether we achieve that or not.”It was Nwaneri, who has signed a new contract this summer, who caught the eye early on. A cross from Merino that was meant for the forehead of Gyökeres instead found Bukayo Saka at the back post and he could not direct the ball on target. But with only Gabriel Magalhães missing from his first-choice back four, Arteta will be concerned with how easily Villarreal established a 2-0 lead.Thomas Partey close to joining Villarreal in week of court appearanceRead morePépé, who joined Villarreal last year on a free transfer and is set to be joined by the former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey after he agreed an initial one-year deal, was unlucky when his shot came back off the post before he eventually forced the ball past David Raya when Arsenal failed to clear. The Spaniard was left fuming with his defence when Etta Eyong doubled the Spanish side’s lead just after the half-hour, although Nørgaard immediately pulled one back from a corner.Like last season when they struggled from a lack of creativity, that seemed to be Arsenal’s best chance of scoring as Gyökeres was forced to live off scraps before the break. Mosquera and Zubimendi were summoned for the second half and there was an immediate improvement. Gyökeres finally had a sight of goal when played in by Merino but his shot was well saved by Luiz Júnior.It needed Dowman, who has been hailed as a “special talent” by Arteta despite his tender years, to save some face after Danjuma had raced clear to make it 3-1, although Madueke missed the decisive penalty in a post‑match shootout.“Max is moving so fast – even last year when he was training with us, he was doing these kind of things and now he is doing them in the games,” Arteta said. “The efficiency he shows in every attacking action is incredible and he deserves more chances.”On Gyökeres, Arteta said: “Every day in training he is getting a really good feeling and connection with all the other players who are going to help him. He hasn’t trained for a team for two months and, on Saturday, he will take another step and be in a very good position.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalVillarrealfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Others have passed around contact details for the club’s official channels, urging people to complain.As Arsenal gear up to host Villarreal in a friendly on Wednesday, Lakhani described Partey’s potential signing as a stain on Villarreal, a club deeply intertwined with its home town of 52,000. “They’re seen as someone who isn’t like Real Madrid or Barcelona or the [Premier League’s] Big Six,” he said. “They’re the antithesis of that. They’re a club that has helped their community a lot, they’re seen as a family-run club.”Partey’s arrival would probably alter this image, Lakhani said. “Their name is now going to be associated with wanting to sign someone who has five [rape] charges over his head, rather than being known as a club that plays good football or punches above their weight.”More than 800 people have signeda petitionthat describes the move as a “slap in the face” to the club’s supporters and “all victims of sexual abuse worldwide”. The petition was launched by the online content hub Villarreal Report, which said this week that the signing would be “an act of pure betrayal of the highest order” against the club’s supporters and Villarreal’s values. “The darkest day in the club’s history is drawing closer by the second,” it said on social media.Villarreal did not respond to a request for comment.As Partey’s contract with Arsenal neared its expiry date, the club confirmed they were in talks over a new contract. After they failed to agree a new deal, it emerged that Partey, who has played for Atlético Madrid, Mallorca and Almería, was heading to Spain. He was charged not long after he left Arsenal, after an investigation that began in 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because in the end, the team may improve in the short term. But in the long term, this will do a lot of damage to our image.”Explore more on these topicsVillarrealLa LigaEuropean club footballArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The rest of the first-team squad had been put through their paces by Howe as they reconvened for the first time since stepping off atheir near 15-hour flight from Seoul shortly after 8am on Monday.Transfer trouble and boardroom bother: vexed Newcastle face a puzzled future | Louise TaylorRead moreIsak was absent from the pre-season tripto Singapore and South Korea as the Sweden forward attempted to force through a transfer to Liverpool. Although the club claimed that a minor thigh strain had prevented him boarding the private charter plane to south-east Asia, scans indicated no evidence of injury.Rather than train and/or receive treatment at Newcastle, Isak flew to northern Spain and his former club Real Sociedad, where he trained alone for much of last week. Howe said he learned of this expedition through the media and before leaving Seoul he said players exhibiting “poor behaviour” could forfeit the right to train with his squad.“You have to earn the right to train with us,” he said. “We’reNewcastle United. Players have a responsibility to be part of a team and a squad. No player can expect to act poorly and train with the group. You have to act in the right way.”View image in fullscreenA Liverpool fan shows shows his support for signing Alexander Isak, at a pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao this month.Photograph: Phil Bryan/ShutterstockLiverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak rejected, but Newcastle believe they will return with a higher offer once a suitable replacement has been found. That quest has proved frustrating, with their latest target, RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko,poised to join Manchester United.Isak was due to meet Howe at the training ground for talks on Wednesday, when his thigh was also scheduled to be inspected by the medical team.Regardless of whether he is reintegrated into first-team training, Isak seems unlikely to be involved in the Sela Cup at St James’ Park, where Newcastle face two La Liga sides, Espanyol on Friday night and Atlético Madrid on Saturday afternoon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have been backed by high-profile investors, including the American skiing icon Mikaela Shiffrin, who is from Colorado, and they have plans to move to a new 14,500-seat purpose-built stadium in 2028.Cushing won six major trophies, including two Women’s FA Cups, three League Cups, and Manchester City’s sole women’s league title to date during his six-year spell at the helm of the English club. He left in 2020 to take up an assistant role at MLS side New York City FC, where he was elevated to head coach in 2022. He returned to Man City as the Women’s Super League side’s interim head coach in March 2025, overseeing a fourth-placed finish after the sacking of Gareth Taylor.It is understood the chance to return to life and work in the United States with his family was something the 40-year-old particularly wanted, preferring this unique proposition from Denver over interest from other English clubs.Cushing said: “Denver Summit FC’s commitment to building a world-class soccer organisation really inspired me. We have a passionate, committed fanbase and we have to put a team on the field that replicates that. Our team will play an attacking form of the game that excites our stadium and makes things difficult for our opponents. We want to create a winning team as well as a great experience for all of Colorado.”Prior to Cushing’s appointment, the new club named Curt Johnson as their general manager. The former North Carolina Courage GM added: “In order to be successful right away, you need people that have experienced environments like this, have built organisations, and have had success. Nick brings world-class experience, a passion for player development, and a tactical vision that will excite Summit supporters.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 6 Aug 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.49 EDTShareJEFF’S COMING, YO!You come at the Stelling you’d best not miss, as the famous quote from The Wire’s Omar Little kind of goes. Feared by his enemies and loved by viewers, the scar-faced stick-up man’s advice suggests that anyone attempting to challenge the established order should be prepared for unpleasant consequences if their plan backfires. It is a lesson Hartlepool United owner Raj Singh is currently learning the hard way after sending a letter to each of Hartlepool’s fellow National League clubsasking them to ban Jeff Stelling– the TalkSport and former Soccer Saturday host, and national treasure – from their boardrooms and hospitality suites for the season ahead. In scenes that his chum Chris Kamara would almost certainly describe as “Unbelievable, Jeff!” (unless they in some way involved an Anthony Vanden Borre red card at Fratton Park), Stelling resigned from his role as president of Hartlepool in May, in protest at Singh’s handling of negotiations over the protracted non-sale of his beloved hometown club.Apparently still fuming over Stelling’s decision to step down from an honorary role in which he wielded the same amount of power as your average regimental goat, Singh recently embarked on a letter-writing campaign to call upon his fellow owners to deny Stelling any of the myriad lavish trappings of hospitality associated with cash-strapped non-league clubs when he travels to Hartlepool away games. Having initially made it clear that Jeff was not to be considered for any freebies specifically designated for club officials, Singh added: “In the unlikely event that Mr Stelling independently attends any Hartlepool fixture at your home ground, I’d further request that you consider to seat Mr Stelling separately to any HUFC dignitaries or staff.” And while nobody is denying Hartlepool has its dignitaries, it seems actual dignity is currently at a premium in their corridors of power.Football Daily doesn’t claim to be familiar with the nitty-gritty of the beef, but what we can say for sure is that we hope Stelling has another one of his charity walks teed up, so that he’ll be able to march off the excess blubber he’s certain to put on after National League clubs the length and breadth of the country fall over each other to defy what looks like a petty and sly act of vindictiveness. In calling for Stelling to be denied hospitality, Hartlepool’s owner has almost certainly guaranteed that the universally popular broadcaster will be subjected to the kind of extreme levels of corporate largesse unlikely to be witnessed in the fifth tier ever again unless Manchester City end up playing in it after the verdict on those 100-plus charges is finally announced.“I’m a lifelong supporter of that football club and if it came down to the fact that I travelled and stood with the Poolies, the Hartlepool supporters, wherever they are, then that’s fine,” a slightly baffled Jeff told his radio audience. “I’d already bought my ticket – we’re away to Yeovil on Saturday – to be with the fans, so I didn’t get the issue or why Mr Singh wanted to raise it. The other thing that I took offence to was in the statement he says in theunlikelyevent that I attend games independently. Well, I mean, last season I went to Aldershot, Eastleigh, Solihull, Southend, Sutton, Wealdstone, Woking, Dagenham and Redbridge, Ebbsfleet, Maidenhead and a few others as well, so, it’s not so unlikely that I’ll attend. I’ll be at Yeovil on Saturday and I’ll tell you what, I’ll say it right now – if Mr Singh is there, I’ll be happy to meet him and have a chat with him.” Meet him? If the Yeovil Town hierarchy have anything at all about them, Jeff will be sitting right beside the man he says he hasn’t seen in at least a year. It certainly sounds like it’s time for either a long overdue catch-up or 90 minutes of awkward silence.QUOTE OF THE DAYI’ve done one live performance which felt a bit weird – there was a live band playing the drums and I had to literally use it as an instrument, which felt crazy, but I enjoyed it.

It would be interesting to see,” said Nasser Majali, secretary general of the ISSA, who was speaking in London on Wednesday. “It depends on the appetite, it depends on what we are able to do based on sustainability. But having good quality sports competitions is always welcome.”Access to the event this year is limited to the 57 countries that make up the ISSA and which, in turn, are members of political grouping the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation. The ISSA includes countries from four continents and states with religiously diverse populations. Current members include Albania, Nigeria and the Caribbean state of Guyana, where muslims make up roughly 7% of the population, comparable to the 6.5% of population in England and Wales.Majali observed that athletes at the Islamic Solidarity Games could themselves belong to any religion or none. “The first Jordanian to win a gold medal at the 2017 games was a Christian, a spectacular swimmer,” he said. Majali added that while it was “currently” the case that the games were open only to ISSA members, “you don’t know how [participation] can be done in the future”.The Solidarity Games will be the first significant staging post on Saudi Arabia’s journey towards the 2034 World Cup and a possible Olympic bid. It will once again put an international spotlight on the Saudi capital of Riyadh, increasingly a magnet for major sporting events. The Games will see an athletes’ village built in the country for the first time and could feature events held outside stadia and in public spaces, as at the Paris Olympics last year.Majali, a former secretary general of the Jordanian Olympic Committee, said that the Saudi capital is now a “major” sporting destination. “You’ve got excellent quality competitions happening all the time there,” he said. “It’s become second nature to deliver such events and the quality is spectacular. From my point of view, it is a destination for sports events. And a major one at that.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 100-ball format is enshrined in the England and Wales Cricket Board’s domestic TV contracts with Sky Sports and the BBC until 2028 but the Guardian has learned that both broadcasters are open to switching to T20 next summer if requested by the newly formed Hundred board, which will be dominated by representatives ofthe eight franchises.TheECBfirst explored dropping the Hundred in favour of the global-standard T20 format two years ago in informal discussions, which drew a lukewarm response from Sky in particular. The broadcaster has invested heavily in marketing the Hundred, which has succeeded in attracting more diverse crowds to grounds and has a younger TV audience than other forms of cricket on the network, while the BBC also likes the format as it is easier to fit shorter matches into its schedules.The Hundred returns with star names, tech titans and an intruder who thrilled Lord’sRead moreThe sale of, in most cases, minority stakes in the eight franchises for £520m this year has altered the power dynamics, however, with the new co-owners expected to have a huge influence over the future of the competition given the collective size of their investment. Four of the joint owners are Indian Premier League franchises, two are Indian‑American consortiums, and two are US investment companies.Formal discussions will not take place until the Hundred board meets for the first time in October, but the issue of format is expected to feature prominently. The 20-strong board will be made up of four representatives from the ECB and two each from the eight host venues and new investors, which in effect puts the franchises in control.A source at one franchise said the IPL owners in particular want to switch to T20 to align with the other franchise leagues where they operate teams in India, South Africa, the US and the United Arab Emirates. The T20 format will also be used in the Olympics when cricket returns after 132 years at Los Angeles 2038, which is particularly significant given India are bidding to host the Games in 2036.The Hundred this summeris in effect a transitional tournament before the new owners formally come on board on 1 October, when the sales of Oval Invincibles and Trent Rockets are due to be completed.While Sky and the BBC have resisted ditching the Hundred until this point, there is a growing feeling that it would be better to relaunch the competition with a bang next year rather than make a series of incremental changes. There will be other significant innovations next year, including new team names at some franchises, new commercial deals and a fresh digital strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He scored 250 goals in 756 appearances with Bayern across all competitions, but his contract was not renewed after last season.At the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Müller scored five goals. He also scored five goals at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, winning the Golden Boot.Müller’s final match with Bayern came this summer at the Club World Cup, losing 2-0 in the quarter-finals to Paris Saint-Germain in Atlanta. He came into the match as a late substitute.Müller joined Bayern’s academy as a 10-year-old in 2000. He made his senior debut under Jürgen Klinsmann in 2008 and his breakthrough came under Louis van Gaal the following season.The club announced in a joint statement in April that it would be his last season. In a post on social media, Müller said he understood Bayern’s decision “even if this did not reflect my personal wishes.”“Thomas Müller is the definition of a Bavarian fairytale career; he grew in Bavaria and with Bayern,” club president Herbert Hainer said. “Nobody has won more Bundesliga titles, and 33 trophies in total so far speak volumes.

MLR commissioner Nic Benson said he thought the league could continue if reduced to just seven teams.News of Miami’s exit will concern executives at World Rugby, which has placed the men’s World Cup in the US in 2031, followed by the women’s event in 2033.Last month, speaking to reporters in Washington DC, World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said the governing body “believed … there needs to be a domestic professional league in the US that’s growing and thriving [and] we want MLR to be that”.Gilpin also indicated an openness to talks with international interests seeking to plant teams on US soil, including Super Rugby, the United Rugby Championship and the mooted R360 breakaway project.On Wednesday, the Guardian sought comment from Benson, Miami CEO Milagros Cubelli, and players’ representatives.Miami entered MLR in 2024 and reached the playoffs for the first time this year,losingthe Eastern Conference Semi-Final to New England Free Jacks, who went on to win their third successive title.There was an immediate irony in news of Miami’s MLR exit. Just two days earlier, Cubelli — the sister of Miami and Argentina scrum-half Tomas Cubelli — wasnamedMLR Major League Rugby Executive of the Year.In commentsreleased by the leagueon Monday, Cubelli said: “We are a new team at a starting level, so you have to be smart in how you use your resources.“I have a strong background in entertainment and production, so I think I brought this experience to the Sharks to have a good gameday experience and an interesting, attractive brand. I’m proud and very happy. And I love to win.”Cubelli also said sponsorship was “one of the big successes of 2025”, as the Sharks “grew sponsorship revenue to almost 20%”“There’s a professional rugby team in Miami that is doing things well, that is eager to share the fun of this sport with the people in the community,” she added. “The doors are wide open.”On Wednesday afternoon, the Miami website still advertised “Season 2026” as “Coming Soon”.“Come enjoy the Sharks experience,” it said.Martin Pengelly writes on Substack atThe National Maul, on rugby in the US.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Messi’s move to the United States had been long-rumored but often dismissed as wild speculation. The league was still a backwater compared to many in Europe and its clubs simply didn’t have the financial muscle of others vying for the Argentine’s services.YetMLShad moved heaven and earth to land Messi, and here he was, playing in front of celebrities, fans and millions of viewers at home and abroad. Deep into the second half of Miami’s match against Liga MX side Cruz Azul, Messi used one stroke of his left foot to transport everybody in attendance back to his glory days at Barcelona.His free kick propelled Inter Miami to victory that day, and his brilliance over the ensuing monthpropelled themto an eventual Leagues Cup title.To this day, Messi’s free kick remains an iconic goal in league history, and among MLS’ most widely-consumed ones (it’s currently the fourth most-viewed goal on MLS’ YouTube profile, behind Zlatan Ibrahimović’sdebut goalfor the Galaxy, Wayne Rooney’stackle and assist, and David Beckham’s Olimpico). At the time, it certainly felt like a watershed moment for the league, and a pivotal moment for Leagues Cup.Many who watched Messi’s masterstroke had never heard of Leagues Cup, MLS and Liga MX’s now-annual mid-season tournament. The joint venture was the latest in a long line of attempts by both leagues to capitalize on the long-simmering rivalry between Mexican and American clubs, and to capitalize on the massive market of Hispanic consumers in the United States.Now entering its third year, it feels fair to wonder who is actually asking for this thing.Its fundamental flaws became apparent last year, when an injured Messi was unable to participate and his presence could no longer mask them. The tournament takes place entirely in the United States, which leads to rightful questions about competitive balance and sometimes-empty stadiums. The value of the US-Mexico rivalry has also felt on the decline, appearing strongly only in matchups between the continent’s biggest clubs and, naturally, its national teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLionel Messi exits Inter Miami match v Necaxa with injury: ‘He did feel a pull’Read moreMLS and Liga MX have fixed a few of the tournament’s other critical issues, successfully tweaking the tournament’s format to require early matchups between MLS and LigaMX teams, only admitting competitive sides from each league, and eliminating draws entirely. There is real prize money at stake (thought to be around $2m for the winner), and a handful of berths to Concacaf Champions Cup, the region’s continental club championship and the entry point into the Fifa Club World Cup.MLS also no longer fully pauses its league schedule for the run of the tournament, giving eliminated teams a chance to soldier on in regular season play and offering fans who couldn’t care less about the tournament an opportunity to stay engaged with their clubs.But as the tournament evolves, the landscape around it has too. America has long been viewed as global football’s ATM, a massive country with a soccer-starved populous and unmatched spending power. For over a decade, clubs and sometimes entire competitions have migrated stateside in search of to raise capital and brand awareness. That exercise reached new heights of absurdity this summer with the arrival of the Club World Cup. The tournament wasa mixed bag– unquestionably exciting at times but also widely viewed as a purely commercial exercise. By the time Chelsea (and US President Donald Trump) hoisted the trophy, many viewers had already moved on.Three MLS clubs participated in the tournament, pausing an already-congested league schedule to measure themselves against legitimate international competition. It’s largely the same value that Major League Soccer argues they have created with Leagues Cup – that the tournament gives its clubs a chance to measure themselves against Mexican clubs that have long been viewed as the best in the region.Beyond all of this, there’s also the problem that MLS always faces, maybe unfairly: almost any new endeavor it attempts will be met with open disdain from consumers of the sport at home and abroad, labeled synthetic or tossed aside as a cash-grab. That criticism is impossible to avoid when you’re constantly reinventing yourself and constantly adjusting your product in search of profitability and relevance. Leagues Cup, created out of thin air, certainly fits that bill.It’s a point driven home perfectly by the dwindling relevance of the US Open Cup, which at this point is among the only truly authentic products in American soccer. As MLS has pumped resources into raising the profile of its own nascent tournament, the Open Cup has continued to fade further into the recesses of the public consciousness, even as it has the potential to reach more locales in the US than any other pro-level competition.It would be unfair to label Leagues Cup a failure before it finishes its third edition. A better time to accurately judge its success may be towards the end of this decade, after the tournament has had an opportunity to mature a bit and after the upcoming men’s and women’s World Cups have come and gone. MLS and Liga MX will surely continue to tinker with it in the meantime, aiming to make it something consumers in the US actually care about.It’s what MLS does best, after all. 30 years in, the league itself remains a work in progress, tinkering with its own formula in an attempt to finally thrust itself firmly into the collective consciousness. In some ways, it’s succeeded. It remains to be seen whether it can do the same for Leagues Cup.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsMexicofeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the spy chief’s agenda: moving vast amounts of top secret intelligence material into the US company’s cloud.Meeting at Microsoft’s headquarters near Seattle, a former chicken farm turned hi-tech campus, the spymaster, Yossi Sariel, won Nadella’s support for a plan that would grant Unit 8200 access to a customisedand segregated area within Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.Armed with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity, Unit 8200 began building a powerful new mass surveillance tool: a sweeping and intrusive system that collects and stores recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.Revealed here for the first time in an investigation by the Guardian with the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand Hebrew-language outletLocal Call, the cloud-based system – which firstbecame operational in 2022 – enables Unit 8200 to store a giant trove of calls daily for extended periods of time.Microsoft claims Nadella was unaware of what kind of data Unit 8200 planned to store in Azure. But a cache of leaked Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the company and Israeli military intelligence reveals how Azure has been used by Unit 8200 to store this expansive archive of everyday Palestinian communications.Quick GuideContact the reporters about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians.View image in fullscreenSatya Nadella speaks at a Microsoft event in New York on 26 October 2016.Photograph: Lucas Jackson/ReutersIntelligence sources with knowledge of the project said Unit 8200’s leadership turned to Microsoft after concluding it did not have sufficient storage space or computing power on the military’s servers to bear the weight of an entire population’s phone calls.Several intelligence officers from the unit, which is comparable to the US National Security Agency (NSA) in its surveillance capabilities, said that a mantra emerged internally that captured the project’s scale and ambition: “A million calls an hour”.The system was built to sit on Microsoft’s servers behind enhanced layers of security developed by the company’s engineers with Unit 8200’s instructions. The leaked Microsoftfiles suggest that a large proportion of the unit’s sensitive data may now be sitting in the company’s datacentres in the Netherlands and Ireland.Disclosures about the role of Microsoft’s Azure platform in the surveillance project come as the US tech giant faces pressure from employees andinvestorsover its ties to Israel’s military and the role its technology has played in the 22-month offensive in Gaza.In May, an employee disrupted a keynote speech by Nadellain an act of protest, at one point yelling: “How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”After the Guardian and othersrevealedin January Israel’s reliance on Microsoft technology during the war in Gaza, the company commissioned an external review of the relationship. The review, Microsoftsaid, had “found no evidence to date” that Azure or its AI products were “used to target or harm people” in the territory.A senior Microsoft source said the company had held conversations with Israeli defence officials and stipulated how its technology should be used in Gaza, insisting Microsoft systems must not be employed for the identification of targets for lethal strikes.View image in fullscreenA signal intelligence–gathering installation of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit responsible for collecting signals intelligence (Sigint) and code decryption, located on an observation point on the Israeli-Lebanese border near Rosh HaNikra crossing also known as Ras al-Naqoura crossing.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyHowever, Unit 8200 sources said intelligence drawn from the enormous repositories of phone calls held in Azure had been used to research and identify bombing targets in Gaza. One of the sources said that when planning an airstrike on an individual located within densely populated areas where high numbers of civilians are present, officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the immediate vicinity.The sources alsosaid use of the system had increased during the campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 60,000 people in the territory, the majority of whom are civilians, including over 18,000 children.Q&AHow many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?ShowAccording to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people.The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But the initial focus of the system was the West Bank, where an estimated 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military occupation. Unit 8200 sources said the information stored in Azure amounted toa rich repository of intelligence about its population that some in the unit claimed had been used to blackmail people, place them in detention, or even justify their killing after the fact.“When they need to arrest someone and there isn’t a good enough reason to do so, that’s where they find the excuse,” one said, referring to the information stored in the cloud.A Microsoft spokesperson said it had “no information” about the kind of data stored by Unit 8200 in its cloud. They said the company’s “engagement with Unit 8200 has been based on strengthening cybersecurity and protecting Israel from nation state and terrorist cyber-attacks”.“At no time during this engagement,” they added, “has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services, including through the external review it commissioned.”‘Tracking everyone, all the time’The driving force behind the cloud project – described by one source as a “revolution” within the unit – was Sariel, commander of Unit 8200 between early 2021 and late 2024. A career intelligence officer, Sariel was a strong advocate for projects of this scale.Following a 2015 wave of deadly so-called “lone wolf” attacks by young Palestinians, many of whom were teenagers unknown to the security services, Sariel had overseen a significant expansion of the volume of Palestinian communications that Unit 8200 intercepted and stored.His answer was to begin “tracking everyone, all the time”, said an officer who worked for Sariel at the time. Instead of traditional surveillance of specific targets, Sariel’s project relied on mass surveillance of Palestinians in the West Bank and used novel AI methods to extract insights.“Suddenly the entire public was our enemy,” said another source who worked on the project, which sought to predict whether someone represented a threat to Israeli security.One system developed in this period, sources said, scanned all text messages between Palestinians in the West Bank and assigned each message a risk rating based on an automated analysis of whether it included words deemed to be suspicious. Still in use, the system – known as “noisy message” – can identify text messages in which people talk about weapons or discuss wanting to die.View image in fullscreenNablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 1 November 2022.Photograph: Issam Rimawi/Anadolu via Getty ImagesWhen Sariel became Unit 8200 commander in early 2021, he prioritised forging a partnership with Microsoft that would give the unit the ability to go further and capture and analyse the content of millions of phone calls each day.At his meeting with Nadella later that year, Sariel does not appear to have explicitly stated his plan to store Palestinian phone calls in the cloud, referring instead to “sensitive workloads” of secret data, according to internal records of the meeting.But documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files, while some Israel-based Microsoft staff, including alumni of Unit 8200, appear to have known about what the unit hoped the joint project would achieve.“You don’t have to be a genius to figure it out,” one source said. “You tell [Microsoft] we don’t have any more space on the servers, that it’s audio files. It’s pretty clear what it is.”Microsoft’s spokesperson said: “We are not aware of Azure being used for the storage of such data.” They said Unit 8200 was simply a customer of its cloud services and Microsoft “did not build or consult with Unit 8200” on a cloud-based surveillance system.However, in early 2022, Microsoft and Unit 8200 engineers worked quickly and closely together to design and implement advanced security measures within Azure to meet the unit’s standards. “The rhythm of interaction with [the unit] is daily, top down and bottom up,” one document noted.Among Microsoft staff, the project was shrouded in considerable secrecy and engineers were told not to mention Unit 8200 by name. Under the plan, vast troves of raw intelligence material would sit in Microsoft’s datacentres overseas.View image in fullscreenA signals intelligence–gathering installation of Unit 8200 located near an observation point in Misgav Am, a kibbutz close to the border with Lebanon in northern Israel.Photograph: Eddie Gerald/AlamyFiles suggest that by July this year, 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data – equivalent to approximately 200m hours of audio – was held in Microsoft’s Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion was stored in Ireland. It’s unclear if all of this data belongs to Unit 8200; some may belong to other Israeli military units.According to the files, Unit 8200 informed Microsoft that it planned to move over timeas much as 70% of its data, including secret and top secret data, into Azure and was willing to “push the envelope” with the kind of sensitive and classified information that intelligence agencies normally held on their own servers. “They’re always trying to challenge the status quo,” one executive noted.Asked about Sariel’s meeting with Nadella, Microsoft’s spokesperson said it “is not accurate” to say the CEO provided his personal support for the project with Unit 8200. They said Nadella “attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting” and there was “no discussion” of the content of the data the unit planned to move into Azure.However, according to internal Microsoft records of the meeting seen by the Guardian, Nadella offered support for Sariel’s aspiration to move so much of the elite surveillance unit’s data into the cloud, described earlier in the meeting as including sensitive intelligence material.“Satya suggested that we identify certain workloads to begin with and then gradually move towards the 70% mark,” one record states. It adds that Nadella said “building the partnership is so critical” and “Microsoft is committed to providing resources to support.”‘The solution to our problems’Several months before meeting Microsoft CEO Nadella in 2021, Sariel had published a book about artificial intelligence under a pen name – revealed bythe Guardianto be the spy chief’s – in which he urged militaries and intelligence agencies to “migrate to the cloud”.Known within Israeli intelligence as a tech evangelist, Sariel valued what he characterised to colleagues as a friendly relationship with Nadella, according to a senior intelligence source. “Yossi bragged a lot, even to me, about his connection with Satya,” they said. (Microsoft denied that Nadella and Sariel had a close relationship.)“He sold [the partnership] internally and got a huge budget,” another former intelligence colleague said. “He claimed it was the solution to our problems in the Palestinian arena.”Sariel declined to comment and referred the Guardian’s questions about the project to the Israel Defence Forces. An IDF spokesperson said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on “legally supervised agreements”.They added: “The IDF operates in accordance with international law, with the aim of countering terrorism and ensuring the security of the state and its citizens.”After publication, the IDF issued a new statement. “We appreciate Microsoft’s support to protect our cybersecurity. We confirm that Microsoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.”For its part, Microsoft viewed the multiyear partnership as a lucrative commercial opportunity. Executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue and “an incredibly powerful brand moment” for Azure, according to the files.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators hold banners and signs as they protest outside the Microsoft Build conference at the Seattle convention center in Seattle, Washington, on 19 May 2025.Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images“[Unit 8200’s] leadership hopes to expand the mission-critical work tenfold in the coming years,” one executive noted.As Unit 8200 began to make use of Azure’s storage capabilities in 2022, intelligence officers rapidly grasped the new powers at their disposal. “The cloud is infinite storage,” one source familiar with the system said.Calls–which include calls made by Palestinians to international and Israeli numbers–are typically retained in the cloud for about one month, though storage can be scaled up, allowing the unit to keep hold of calls for longer periods of time when needed, several intelligence sources explained.‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targetsRead moreThis allows the unit to go back in time and retrieve the phone conversations of people who become of interest, they said. Previously, surveillance targets would need to be pre-selected for their conversations to be intercepted and stored.Several of the sources insisted the cloud-based system had prevented deadly attacks against Israelis. One said “saving lives” of Israelis was the principal motivation behind Sariel’s vision for the system. But it notably failed to prevent the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 in which nearly 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and 240 people were kidnapped.In the wake of the attacks, Sariel faced criticism for his apparent prioritisation of “addictive and exciting” technology over old-fashioned intelligence methods, which some critics said contributed to the disaster. Sariel resigned last year, accepting responsibility for “8200’s part in the intelligence and operational failure”.In the ensuing war in Gaza, the cloud-based system pioneered by Sariel has been put to frequent use alongside a series of AI-driven target recommendation tools also developed on his watch and debuted by the military in a campaign that has devastated civilian life and created a profound humanitarian crisis.Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s telecoms infrastructure has reduced the volume of phone calls in the territory but sources said theinformation held in thecloud remained useful. According to one, enthusiasm for the system had grown among intelligence officers working on Gaza as the war progressed and they saw the military is “heading towards long-term control there”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMicrosoftMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

Composer Jennifer Walshe reveals what fed into her epic opera, from low-gravity procreation to Shrek in spaceJennifer WalsheWed 6 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhy write an opera aboutMars? Because Mars isn’t just a planet. It’s a philosophy, an ideology. The way humans think about it changes over time, reflecting the unstable mix of assumptions, hopes, dreams and anxieties that define each historical moment.In 1965,Nasa’s Mariner 4probe flew past Mars and beamed the first closeup images of the red planet (or of any other planet) back to Earth. Prior to that flight, humans knew the planet only through telescopes, and it was thought that its surface would feature vegetation and that life may have evolved there. Mariner 4 revealed the truth: it was a rocky, cratered place seemingly devoid of life. PresidentLyndon B Johnson declaredthat “it may just be that life as we know it, with its humanity, is more unique than many have thought, and we must remember this”. The New York Times went further: “Mars, it now appears, is a desolate world.”One option for space pregnancy is to strap a woman into a subterranean centrifugeIf like me you were not then born, try to imagine what it would have been like to be alive in that summer of 1965. In June,Ed White becamethe first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk. (The Soviet cosmonautAlexei Leonovhad preceded him by just under three months.) White’s experience of the spacewalk was so deeply transcendent that he described re-entering the capsule as “the saddest moment of my life”. Life magazine devoted an issue to White’s “Glorious Walk in the Cosmos”: millions pored over the images. Only a few weeks later, Mariner 4’s images of Mars were broadcast on TV, showing its desolation. We started a summer floating in White’s cosmic bliss, believing that we might not be alone in the universe, only to end it with those hopes quashed.View image in fullscreenHistoric … the first all-female spaceflight crew, including Lauren Sánchez third from left.Photograph: Blue Origin Handout/EPAIn another summer, 60 years later, we are still immersed in news related to space and technology. Spring was already busy enough. April saw the launch of the first all-female spaceflight, led byLauren Sánchez– the then fiancee, now wife, of billionaire Jeff Bezos – in a rocket made by Bezos’s aerospace company Blue Origin. In May, Elon Musk, another billionaire with an aerospace company,stepped down from running Dogewhile wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt.In June, the billionaire venture capitalist,seasteadingenthusiast and early Trump adopterPeter Thielgave an interview to the New York Times in which he declared: “Mars is supposed to be more than a science project. It’s … a political project.” In July, scientists at the National Astronomy Meeting announced evidence of10,000 miles of ancient riverbedsin a part of Mars not previously thought to have featured water. ThenSotheby’s sold the largest Martian meteoritein existence to a private bidder for about $5.3m (nearly £4m) – and President Trump signed an executive order aimed at “preventing woke AI in the federal government”.Why write an opera about Mars? Because when we talk about Mars we are talking about ourselves – about our ideas of the future, and about the operations of power in the present.Watch a trailer for MarsSo, then,howto write an opera about Mars? You begin by choosing a librettist. The writer Mark O’Connell was the obvious choice. We both share an interest in technology, AI, Silicon Valley and a bundle of ideologies that may or may not be on the average person’s radar. These range from transhumanism and futurism through topronatalism– a movement, increasingly popular in Silicon Valley, that advocates for improving fertility and increasing birthrates to address demographic decline in western countries.Our research was far-ranging, taking what might be termed a hard science-fiction approach. We started with mundane details. How do astronauts exercise? Eat? Shower? Poop? Is it possible for a pregnancy to be carried to term in zero gravity, or Martian gravity, which is 38% of Earth’s? The answers range from the benign (using Ared, theadvanced resistive exercise device) to the not so benign (one option is to strap the woman into a subterranean centrifuge throughout the pregnancy).View image in fullscreen‘I turned to AI’ … Walshe and her co-director Tom Creed during rehearsals.Photograph: Ste MurrayThe distance between Earth and Mars – approximately 140m miles – means that real-time communication is an impossibility. We wondered how human relationships would be conducted if conversations could only occur via voice note. Everything we researched led to more questions. How might our understanding of ourselves, and of the universe, be changed if we were to discover life on another planet? Would the legal framework outlined in theOuter Space Treaty of 1967work? Would humans be doomed to repeat the horrific logic of colonisation, or is another way possible?Our opera centres on an all-female mission. Four astronauts – Svetlana, Sally, Judith and Valentina, named after the first four women to go into space – are on their way to Mars aboard the spaceship Buckminster, with only Arabella, the onboard AI, for company. Their mission is to search for water to enable the development of the commune that has already been established there.I analysed hours of celestial audio, including recordings of the toilet on the Space StationThe journey is long, and made more difficult by the fact that they only have Shrek the Third and a few seasons of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. As they prepare to land, they discover their mission has been the subject of a hostile takeover and that they now work for Shadowfax Ventures, a company helmed by libertarian billionaire Axel Parchment. They must now confront isolation, sinister ideologies, the prospect of alien life and a vibeshift toward corporate authoritarianism.As we staked out the plot, the next challenge for me was how to cover this broad territory sonically. I started by thinking about the actual sounds astronauts hear in the different environments they inhabit in space. The sonic overwhelm of a rocket launching; the whirr of fans inside the craft; the industrial clack and punch of machinery. I analysed recordings of the incredibly noisy ambient sounds of the different modules of the InternationalSpaceStation (ISS), and figured out ways to orchestrate and re-create these sounds.View image in fullscreenIrish National Opera’s production premieredat the Galway arts festival in July.Photograph: Pat RedmondI listened to hours and hours of space audio – whistles, auroral choruses, interstellar audio recordings made by Voyager 1, sonifications of the light curves of different exoplanets and Chris Hadfield’s recordings of the toilet on the ISS. I haunted theSpace Exploration Stack Exchange, where the community helped me with questions about how a double bass bow might behave in 38% gravity, how a trumpet or violin might degrade in a Martian habitat.Astronauts seem to have a thing for synth music. A look through Dutch astronaut’sAndré Kuiper’s ISS playlist shows an interest in Vangelis, Mike Oldfield and Brian Eno. I placed synthesisers within the orchestra and also in the spaceship itself. And for our villain, a character Mark described in musical terms as “bad EDM”, I turned to AI. It seemed apt to fight like with like, and I prompted the system with genre descriptions like “bro step” and “fashwave”.In the opera, the astronauts resist the hostile takeover of the future in their own way, no matter the risk. However dystopian the imaginings of Mark and myself, for our astronauts there is ultimately resistance and hope, defiance and even the possibility of joy – all realised through collective action. As our team worked over the summer, aware of the very real human challenges and horrors outside our rehearsal room – in a world that seems to be increasingly controlled by a small number of incredibly rich individuals imposing their will on the rest of us – I was insistently reminded of the fact that it is through coming together that we Earthlings have power and meaning.Mars is atAbbey theatre, Dublin, from 7 to 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicMarsSpaceAbbey theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pause it and you hear the sound of democracy in crisisRafael BehrPolitics is struggling to cope with the pace of technological change – and that is affecting every single one of usWed 6 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 07.43 EDTShareReturning from holiday, asked where I have been, I want to say “offline”. The more precise answer is France, where the internet is available. But I tried not to use it compulsively because there isn’t much point in getting away from it all if you carry it all with you on a phone and check it every few minutes.At some point in the past decade or so, the condition of vacation came to be defined more by detachment from the digital realm than departure from home. The break begins not in a departure lounge but with the act of logging off, setting the out-of-office email auto-reply, archiving work-related WhatsApp chats, deleting social media apps.The benefit isn’t immediate. The cacophony rings in your ears for a few days before you notice the stillness, the change in tempo. It is the difference between gliding on thermal currents of private thought and hurtling along rails, propelled by the burning urgency of other people’s opinions. The contrast is even starker in reverse, the roar of the tunnel as you go back to work, the jostle of notifications, the bowed head, scrolling the horizon away.I’m not an analogue nostalgist. I don’t prefer getting lost to having Google Maps. I don’t think people were better informed when they had fewer channels or were less vulnerable to superstition when clerical authority was absolute.We are now in the third decade of the first digital century. The revolution is irreversible and of unknowable duration. History has had a number of these explosive profusions of interconnectedness, driven by a radical innovation in communication technology. But not many. The writer Naomi Alderman calls them “information crises”, and argues that the present one is only the third. The printing press was the second. The invention of writing some time around the fourth millennium BC was the first.The comparison doesn’t have to be exact for us to marvel at the scale of what we are experiencing. It is immeasurable because we don’t know how far along the track we have travelled. AI is only getting started.Readers of theGutenberg Biblein the late 15th century had no means of anticipating the ways that movable type would transform European social, cultural, economic and political organisation. Are we better equipped to imagine the world after another 100 years of digital Reformation?My measly fortnight of technological temperance isn’t likely to afford much additional perspective. But it is a reminder that the transformation under way is operating at a cognitive level. When you switch the information flow off for a moment, or just dial it down a bit, you appreciate how intense and overwhelming it is the rest of the time.Our brains evolved to handle the relatively limited dataset of an immediate physical environment, tracking the bush for predators, eking a survival strategy from scarce resources. We are organic processing units. Our capacity for rational judgment is limited by the rate at which we can turn signals from our senses into a workable mental model of the universe, and choose an appropriate course of action.1:56App stores have 'huge disincentive' to remove pornography due to profits says eSafety boss  – videoIt is an extraordinary talent, but fallible, especially in conditions of sensory overload. That doesn’t mean we are incapable of handling perception of the world on an altered scale, or at much higher speeds. We can adapt to the tsunami of additional stimulus, just as we adapted to life in cities after centuries of rural subsistence. But such accelerated transitions are turbulent, stressful and usually violent. Information crises generate cosmological upheaval. They change the way humanity organises and views itself. Hierarchies tumble. Social norms are recoded. Morality is redefined. New philosophies are hatched. Gods are discarded.Under the circumstances, it isn’t surprising that democratic politics is struggling to adapt. How is one parliament on a small north Atlantic island supposed to impose new rules for the application of technology that spans the globe, dissolves national borders and vaporises the authority of analogue institutions?In the short period of my internet abstinence last month, long-delayed provisions of the Online Safety Act came into force.Social mediaplatforms and search engines are now obliged to restrict underage users’ access to content listed as harmful by the new statute – abuse, pornography, material promoting self-harm, terrorism and suicide.Tech companies have lobbied ferociously against the change. Donald Trump’s White House characterises it as an assault on free speech. Nigel Farage agrees andpromises to repeal the actif he ever forms a government. Labour ministers have said the Reform leader’s position aligns him with theinterests of paedophiles.As a law-abiding adult user of social media, I cannot judge whether the new restrictions perform their advertised function. The age-verification process is efficient, painless and feels no more or less sinister than any of the other personal data submissions we now routinely make as the price for a frictionless internet.There are reported cases of non-pornographic news and public health sites being blocked by accident. There are claims that the protections are easily circumvented with a modicum of digital knowhow. It seems plausible that risk-averse or lazy tech companies are applying ill-designed, overzealous filters. But the impact on political liberty – the impediment to free speech that might justify some of the lurid comparisons being made to totalitarian censorship – is probably still in the order of zero.Social media battles and barbs on both sides of Atlantic over UK Online Safety ActRead moreOf course, any instrument for policing flows of information contains the theoretical foundations of a more repressive agenda. A future government could redefine “harmful” content to include criticism of the government, for example, or anything that undermines traditional family values. Liberal defenders of the new law should not be complacent about its potential misuse.But its most vigorous critics,especially in the Trump administration, are not credible advocates of political liberty. The cause they advance is not free speech as a civic virtue. It is the commercial interest of companies that control much of the world’s digital information infrastructure. The system is awash with toxic material. Poison flows into the public realm and the pump’s owners deny responsibility, resisting regulation for the same reason that polluters have done since the Industrial Revolution. Because they can. Because their business is more profitable when someone else cleans up the mess.The Online Safety Act can be flawed and necessary at the same time. It is just a tiny skirmish in the early stages of the battle to decide how power is wielded and by whom in a world reordered by the information crisis. It is a faint but vital signal – a cry for help by analogue politicians drowning in digital noise.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInternet safetyOpinionInternetSocial mediaNigel FarageDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

But hope quickly turned to horror. Ming’s boyfriend had been secretly taking sexually exploitative photos of not just Ming and her female friends, but also of other women in other locations, then using AI technology to generate pornographic images of them.After Ming confronted him, he “begged for mercy” but became angry when she refused to forgive him, Ming reportedlytoldChinese news outlet Jimu News.Ming is just one of many women inChinawho have been covertly photographed or filmed – both in private and public spaces, including toilets – by voyeurs who have then circulated or sold the images online without consent. The sexually explicit pictures – often taken using pinhole cameras hidden in ordinary objects – are then shared online in massive groups.The scandal has left China reeling and raised questions about the government’s ability – and willingness – to crack down on such behaviour.Anger grows in China over reports of online groups sharing explicit photos of womenRead moreOne such group on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, is named “MaskPark tree hole forum” andreportedly had more than 100,000 mostly male members.“The MaskPark incident exposes the extreme vulnerability of Chinese women in digital spaces,” Li Maizi, a prominent Chinese feminist now based in New York, told the Guardian.“What’s even more insidious and shocking is the prevalence of perpetrators known to the victims: partners, boyfriends, even fathers committing sexual violence against underage girls.”The scandal has sparked fury on Chinese social media and triggered discussions on the challenges of combating online harassment in the country. Although Chinese regulators have the power to clamp down on sexual harassment and abuse online, the system is currently focused on restricting the flow of information deemed politically sensitive, says Eric Liu, a former content moderator at the Chinese social platform Weibo who is now a US-based editor at China Digital Times.Since the scandal broke, Liu has seen “large-scale” censorship of the MaskPark incident on the Chinese internet, where posts seen as having a social impact – including feminist content – are often scrubbed by censors.“If the Chinese government wanted to shut down the groups, they definitely could,” Liu says, referring to previous cases of Chinese authorities infiltrating online spaces overseas. “The scale of [MaskPark] is massive. I can’t think of a similar incident of this scale in recent years.But Liu says he is not surprised. “There’s always been this type of content on the Chinese internet.”In China, those who are found guilty of distributing pornographic content can be sentenced to up to two years in prison, while people who take photos without the subject’s consent can be detained for up to 10 days and fined. The country also has regulations protecting people againstsexual harassment, domestic violence and cyber-abuse.But advocates say the current legal framework is insufficient. Often the burden falls on victims to gather evidence to build their cases, which can be difficult to do for crimes that take place online, according to Xirui*, a Chinese lawyer in Beijing who specialises in cases of gender-based harm.“The behaviour itself also needs to meet certain elements of the crime, such as a specified number of clicks and subjective motives,” Xirui says.“There’s also the problem of the statute of limitations, which is only six months for public security cases. Once that’s exceeded, the police will not file the case.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This type of situation is generally treated as a privacy violation, subject to administrative detention, with victims seeking civil compensations,” Xirui says.To tackle the problem, the government could implement more specialised legislation, improve gender-based training of law enforcement officials and encourage courts to issue guidance that includes examples of relevant cases, the lawyer says.For Li, the recent incident reveals a widespread tolerance and lack of meaningful law enforcement on the issue in China. Rather than tackling the proliferation of sexist and abusive content online, authorities appear more focused on detaining female writers ofhomoerotic fictionand censoring victims of digital abuse, she says.“With the rise of deepfake technologies and rapid online circulation of surreptitiously filmed content, women’s bodies are being digitally exploited at an unprecedented scale,” Li says. “But I believe if authorities are truly willing, and invest the necessary resources, it’s entirely possible to trace and prosecute these crimes. We need to hold the Chinese government accountable.”* Names have been changedAdditional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomChinaSurveillanceAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And while that may not sound like a worthy subject for Pushing Buttons, bear with me.I am now 54 – and so officially in my mid-50s – and I still write about video games for a living. I play video games every day; I work in a home office where I’m surrounded by video games. When I’m not playing them, I’m probably thinking about them. But at times like this, I think: maybe should I stop someday? Is there an upper limit on how long someone can do games journalism? Certainly I only know of a handful of people my age who are still writing about games on a full-time basis. Some of my friends outside the industry still play games, but usually only one or two a year –EA Sports FC, maybe, the latest blockbusting narrative adventure, Nintendo with the kids. If you’re not careful, life has a way of shepherding you away from your interests.I now find it difficult to keep up with some areas of the industry. The world of esports feels utterly alien – the multitude of leagues and competitions, the emerging superstars, the controversies. Following it all is a full-time job, one that is more suited to a sports writer. I’m also way behind on influencers and content creators – I don’t watchKai Cenat,LazarBeamorQuarterJade, though I have a vague sense of who they are and how important they have become as arbiters of taste. When I go on press trips to see new games, I’m old enough to be a parent to most of the young writers and creators I meet.The thing is, I’m still obsessed with how games work and how they’re made. I belong to a generation that assumed games would always be for kids, but they’re patently not now. From the nostalgic adventureLost Records: Bloom and Rage, which deals with middle-aged regret to theGod of Warseries with its study of parenthood and legacy (and part of the“dadification of games”trend, which started when a certain generation of developers started to have kids), video games now tell stories that span a whole lifetime. So we need journalists of all ages to write about them. Consider film journalism. Roger Ebert wrote about film for the Chicago Sun-Times until his death in 2013; the Observer’s late, great film critic Philip French officially retired at 80 but kept writing about cinema until he died two years later. They never stop watching and enjoying movies, so why should they have stopped writing about them?View image in fullscreenNostalgic adventure … Lost Records: Bloom and Rage.Photograph: Don’t NodI now have a longer history in games playing than a huge majority of the younger writers I read, commission and admire. I played Pac-Man when it first arrived; I owned aCommodore 64and aMega Drive; I reviewed a game on the Virtual Boy, for god’s sake. At the risk of this becoming a self-indulgent take onRoy Batty’s closing speech, I’ve seen things you peoplewouldbelieve, but perhaps didn’t actually witness. If history has taught us anything, it’s that first-hand experience is vital in understanding sociocultural impact. And while, today, anyone can load up Space Invaders on an emulator, the experience ofseeingthat game in 1978, in its context of disco, the early home computing revolution and Star Wars mania, has a kind of emotional patina that is hard to conjure in 2025.I often say how vitally important it is to keep playing – whether you’re playing video games, chess, football or historical battle re-enactments. It’s also important to keep asking questions about the world and the things we enjoy. And when you’ve been doing that long enough, you get to know how the stories often end. Currently, we’re worried about censorship in games, thanks to the machinations of payment processing companies. But I’ve been here before – I’ve been throughMary WhitehouseandJack Thompsonand a 100 tabloid moral panics. It’s reassuring to know that this too shall pass.You are always an active part of what you enjoy – the books you read, the teams you support, the gigs you go to. Life is a network of experiences between which we get to draw our own connections and conclusions, and create our own maps of the vast, dizzying cultural landscape we live in. This is as true at the age of 95 as it was at 16, or in my case, at age 54.In short, you’re stuck with me. The game, I hope, is far from over.What to playView image in fullscreenRetro … Gradius Origins.Photograph: KonamiAs I’m in a nostalgic mood, I would like to recommend the retro collectionGradius OriginsfromKonami and developer M2, the undisputed expert in updating classic titles to modern machines. Origins gathers all six instalments in the revered arcade shoot-’em-up series, including Gradius 1-3 and the spin-off Salamander titles, including Japanese, North American and often prototype versions, and it adds an impressive new addition, Salamander 3.These are superlative side-scrollers with cool spacecraft, excellent weapon power-up systems and surreal biomechanical landscapes and bosses. Enemy attack patterns are intense yet beautifully choreographed, the action precise and unforgiving (although you do get to save your progress this time round, unlike the originals). Alongside the games, there are tantalising digital galleries including arcade flyers, concept art and guides to all the enemy ships. It’s a wonderful blast down memory lane.Available on:PC, PS5, Switch, XboxEstimated playtime:20 hours-plusWhat to readView image in fullscreenBreaking the fourth wall … Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.Photograph: Kojima productionsI enjoyedthis articleby Maddy Myers aboutDeath Stranding 2’s fourth-wall shattering moments.

Is it market fatigue, tech shifts, or something else?”There are a number of reasons, I think. In a similar way to how certain movie genres continually disappear and return, partly it’s do withgenerational cycles of influence. A game developer who loved a genre as a child may, as an adult, seek to re-create it – part of the reason we’re seeing so many low-poly survival horror games now is that the creators grew up playing Resident Evil on the original PlayStation.There’s also acultural,even sociopolitical element– developers are inspired by the world around them and it could be that some contemporary events or themes are best realised by specific game genres. So we may see a sudden boost in military real-time strategy games during periods of global instability and conflict. I think there aretechnical influences, too. When a new console or graphics card is released, there is a rush to produce classic genres on that platform, because veteran players who fondly recall those game types like to see them reinvented.Then there’s theinterplay between nostalgia and innovationin the rediscovery of old genres. In a market where everyone is making Souls-likes, hero shooters and deck-building games, there’s value in producing a new take on, say, a 1990s-style interactive movie game, or a graphic adventure, or a button-bashing multi-sports sim – this way, you’re producing something a little different while still harking back to much-loved archetypes. It’s a win-win situation.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dmitri Weideli, an executive producer at the company, has a hard time replying to this question at first, and then settles on an answer that seems rather broad. “We want to make games that matter and that give players a great story that allows them to go through different kinds of emotions,” he says. “We try to diversify the kind of games we create, but at the same time, keep the same spirit.”There’s certainly something to this idea of diversification. Since its founding in 2008, the French outfit has made action-adventure games about memory, narrative games involving magical college students, and a role-playing game about a Georgian vampire. Recently, it released Jusant, an ecological sci-fi fable that was also a refreshingly realistic take on rock climbing.Aphelion, the team’s latest, does have a little in common with Jusant, at least. It is another science-fiction game, but one with a glitteringly hard edge. It’s based around a mission to the edge of the solar system where an icy world called Persephone has been discovered. Somewhat inevitably, the crew crashlands on the planet, and what follows is a journey of exploration, survival and stealth in a harsh alien climate.View image in fullscreenA long way from Jusant … Aphelion.Photograph: Don’t NodIt’s not hard to look at the trailer with its grappling hook and walls of climbable ice and view this as a spiritual successor to Jusant. This is not the case, according to Weideli. The team working on the new game actually came directly from another project, the episodic supernatural game, Tell Me Why.The emphasis is different, too. Aphelion’s climbing is simpler than Jusant’s, which could get very technical in places, and it’s not the central preoccupation this time around. Several developers who worked on Jusant have joined the Aphelion team in the last few months, however, and have shared their experiences dealing with rope physics and vertical level design.The real inspiration for Aphelion largely came from movies such as Interstellar, The Martian, Ad Astra and Arrival. “We wanted to create a great story-driven game,” says Weideli. “But we wanted to go within another genre, that led us to a more action-adventure oriented game.”View image in fullscreenVertical level … Aphelion.Photograph: Don’t NodIntriguingly, everywhere you look in Aphelion there’s the presence of real science. Persephone itself is based onPlanet Nine, a hypothetical large planet that many astronomers believe orbits the sun far beyond Neptune where it is patiently awaiting discovery.But Planet Nine is only the starting point for the fiction here. “Planet Nine was an important source of inspiration,” Weideli says, “and an interesting scientific grounding for an adventure featuring astronauts who explore a new planet. [But] we then added our own lore, imagination, and most importantly, human drama.”Aphelion is also pitched as a collaboration with theEuropean Space Agency. “The ESA team gave us access to space experts and scientists, with whom we could discuss and challenge our ideas about the story of the game,” Weideli says. “For example, our narrative team could discuss the scientific aspects of a space or extraterrestrial mission, review the vocabulary of a space mission, how astronauts talk to each other during a mission. They also offered to review and give advice regarding the technology.”The design team won’t be playing things entirely straight, however. Alongside exploration and survival, there’s that final element: Aphelion is also a stealth game. Weideli isn’t ready to talk about it yet, but something has survived out in the ice of Persephone, and it doesn’t seem entirely friendly.Whatever lurking horrors await, it’s nice to see Don’t Nod back making complex, hard-to-classify video games, after a recent round of redundancies. With so many people working in games at the moment engaged in an awful real-world spin on the survival genre, it’s thrilling to see a team still turning to the stars.Aphelion is released next year on PC, PS5 and XboxExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsAstronomyEuropean Space AgencyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When things go wrong, official news ignores the setbacks. When problems cannot be downplayed, Mr Putin is portrayed as the wise corrector of errors made by underlings.Foreign perceptions of Mr Putin havebeen shapedby this image. It has been boosted online by Kremlin influence operations and embraced by nationalist politicians who admire the Russian president’s methods of domestic control and contempt for the rule of law.Until recently, Donald Trump was the most powerful figure in that category. The US president is no convert to democratic pluralism but he has become notably more suspicious of Russia and less effusive in his admiration for its president. He has threatened Moscow with tightened sanctions if there is not progress towards a ceasefire in Ukraine by the end of this week. Steve Witkoff, the White House special envoy, met Mr Putin on Wednesdayfor talks. The substance of the discussion was unclear.Uncertainty also shrouds the reasons for Mr Trump’sshifting stanceand its durability. June’s Nato summit appears to have been critical in nudging the president towards greater appreciation of the alliance and scepticism about Mr Putin’s claims to want peace.The presidential ego is also a factor. Mr Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the Ukraine war and imagined it could be done swiftly. His initial method was to sidelineand bullyVolodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, while offering sweeping territorial concessions to Russia. That was a disgraceful betrayal of an embattled democracy and a reward for unprovoked military aggression. It was a gift for the Russian president. Yet Mr Putin was not satisfied and instead intensified the onslaught.Mr Trump has no record of sympathy with Ukraine’s plight, but he is notoriously sensitive to a snub. Mr Putin embarrassed him by refusing to do a quick deal.The Russian president’s motives are also obscure. He may be betting on the US staying keen to secure a ceasefire on a land-for-peace basis, and so grabbing more land before White House patience runs out altogether. But he is also trapped by his own maximalist demands. He has senthundreds of thousands of young Russiansto their deaths on the grounds that the nation is locked in an existential struggle with the west. He has cast Ukraine as a rogue province to be reintegrated into the greater Russian motherland. He has geared the country’s economy for perpetual war. His image as a great military leader is in jeopardy if Mr Zelenskyy is still the president of a viable sovereign country when the guns fall silent.There seems no brilliant plan behind Mr Putin’s determination to continue a brutal war of attrition. He does it through inertia and paranoia. He appears afraid to end the fighting on terms that risk ordinary Russians fully grasping the horrific pointlessness of the whole bloody business.History will surely record Mr Putin’s conduct in Ukraine as the action of a delusional murderer. The myth of the Russian president as some kind of mastermind is just another weapon of propaganda. Its function is to project strength where there is weakness, and make victory seem inevitable when the facts of the war describe a litany of Kremlin failure.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump’s team is taking advantageWed 6 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 10.01 EDTShareWithTexasRepublicans rushing to fulfil Donald Trump’s wish to gerrymander to the max, many Americans are no doubt wondering why there isn’t some referee to stop this hyperpartisan race to the bottom that is poisoning our democracy. The supreme court should be the referee that puts a halt to this ugly, undemocratic mess, but in a shortsighted, 5-4 ruling in 2019, the court’s conservative majority essentially told state legislatures that anything goes when it comes to gerrymandering. Their message was: no matter how extreme the gerrymandering, we’ll look the other way.Writingthe majority opinionin that case, Rucho v Common Cause, chief justice John Roberts declared that gerrymandering was a political matter that federal courts shouldn’t intervene in (unless it involves racial discrimination). Many legal experts said the conservative justices were defaulting on the court’s responsibility to prevent absurdly unfair, undemocratic elections, where the fix is in even before people vote. In aprescient dissent, justice Elena Kagan warned that the huge permission slip the court was giving to gerrymandering would encourage “a politics of polarization and dysfunction” and might “irreparably damage our system of government”.Trump and his team have been shrewd enough and shameless enough to seek to take maximum advantage of that ruling, and in doing so, they’re showing how right Kagan was. Trump and company are seriously damaging our system of government and our democracy by seeking to insulate Trump from the majority’s will, an expected Democratic-leaning vote in the 2026 congressional elections. Trump and team are also ratcheting up the “polarization and dysfunction” Kagan warned us about. Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas to prevent a GOP power grab, while Texas governor Greg Abbott hascalled for their arrestandremovalfrom office.Gerrymandering further fuels polarization because November elections become largely irrelevant for choosing candidates. With gerrymandering, what counts are the party primaries, and there, the extremes, rather than moderate swing voters, determine who the winning candidate is. This in turn leads to increasingly polarized, dysfunctional legislative bodies, like the House of Representatives, where there’s plenty of performative, partisan showboating and very little legislation passed.In Rucho, the conservative majority declined to overturn a gerrymander in which the North Carolina GOP had rigged congressional districts so that Republicans would win 10 of the state’s 13 House seats even when the GOP won a bare majority of the statewide vote. (The case also involved some flagrant gerrymandering by Maryland’s Democrats.) It’s thanks to Roberts and the conservative justices’ indifference to gerrymandering that a person close to Trump could say that the administration’s attitude was“Maximum warfare, everywhere, all the time”.Seeking to maximize the chances of maintaining Republican control of the House, where the GOP has a mere three-seat majority, many Republicans also want GOP-led legislatures in Missouri, Florida, Ohio and Indiana to gerrymander to the max. In Texas alone, Trump hopes the GOP can pick up five House seats through redistricting. Even though Trump beat former vice-president Kamala Harris by 56% to 42% in Texas in 2024, the newly unveiled gerrymander aims to guarantee Republicans 30 out of Texas’s 38 House seats (a 79% to 21% ratio). Democrats accuse Trump and the Texas GOP of cheating, and it should be no surprise that they want to respond to fire with fire, with the Democratic governors of California, Illinois and New York saying that they, too, will push through gerrymanders.The whole purpose of Trump’s gerrymandering power grab is to prevent the people from having power over himThis unseemly electoral arms race results directly from the supreme court’s dodging of responsibility. In Rucho, chief justice Roberts shrugged at gerrymandering, saying that redistricting shenanigans were part and parcel of US history. Pointing to examples of gerrymandering from the 1780s and early 1800s, Roberts pooh-poohed this phenomenon, writing: “Partisan gerrymandering is nothing new. Nor is frustration with it.” He also voiced skepticism and snark about judges’ use of standards and election experts’ predictions to determine when partisan redistricting crosses the line into unconstitutional gerrymandering that violates the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause.In contrast to Roberts’ who-cares casualness, justice Kagan was an I’m-warning-you Cassandra. In a stinging dissent joined by justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, she correctly predicted that terrible things would result from Roberts’s decision. She wrote that his opinion showed “a saddening nonchalance about the threat that such [extreme] redistricting posts to self-governance”.Kagan didn’t mince her words about how Roberts’s decision threatened our democracy and undermined the ability of Americans to elect a government of their choosing. “For the first time ever,” she wrote, “this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities. And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives. In so doing, the partisan gerrymanders here debased and dishonored our democracy, turning upside down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people.”In Rucho, Roberts wrote that the constitution neither expressly bans gerrymandering, nor points to a standard to determine when partisan redistricting is so unfair that it becomes unconstitutional. He suggested it would be a grievous, arbitrary wrong to select some legal or mathematical standard to determine when gerrymanders are illegal. Roberts wrote: “There are no legal standards discernible in the Constitution for making such judgments, let alone limited and precise standards that are clear, manageable, and politically neutral.”Today’s headlines make clear that Roberts and his Rucho decision have left us with a far more grievous wrong. It has encouraged ultra-partisan gerrymandering that is sabotaging our democracy and the majority will – in this case with an eye to preventing Democrats from winning back control of the House and serving as a check on Trump, the most authoritarian president in US history. If Texas Republicans prevail and enact their gerrymander, despite Democratic lawmakers’exodus from the state, then the votes of millions of Texas Democrats will become meaningless, their votes in effect erased by the Trump/GOP gerrymander juggernaut. The same thing will happen to many Republican voters in states where Democrats gerrymander.Roberts was dismayingly myopic in failing to realize how his Rucho decision would someday lead to a push for maximum, hyperpartisan redistricting and how new electoral and computer models would make gerrymandering far more sophisticated – and sinister. Roberts was flatly wrong when he wrote that there can’t be “clear, manageable, and politically neutral” standards that define when redistricting crosses the line from mere partisanship to over-the-top, undemocratic, grossly unfair ultra-partisanship.One study put forward a smart standardthat says gerrymandering crosses the line into illegality when a certain, high percentage of votes are wasted, deliberately rendered meaningless through partisan redistricting.What we’re seeing right now in Texas is one political party seeking to squeeze every last drop out of a filthy gerrymandering sponge – fair play and democracy be damned. Foreseeing ugly episodes like this, Kagan cited the vision of James Madison, the main author of the constitution, who once wrote that the “power is in the peopleover the Government, and not in the Government over the people”.The whole purpose of Trump’s gerrymandering power grab is to prevent the people from having power over him and his increasingly unpopular government. Unfortunately, Roberts gave Trump a green light for such a power grab.Like Trump, Roberts hates admitting mistakes, but it’s not too late for him to admit how shortsighted and harmful his Rucho ruling was. Nor is it too late for the chief justice to get the court to set some sane, healthy limits on gerrymandering to safeguard our democracy as well as Madison’s vision that the “power is in the people over the Government”.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionJohn RobertsElena KaganTexasUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet I can see what led to Trump’s riseWed 6 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 12.24 EDTShareIwas born on 24 June 1946, 10 days after the birth of Donald John Trump, 12 days before the birth of George Walker Bush, and 56 days before the birth of William Jefferson Blythe III, whose name was later changed to Bill Clinton.I did not become president. but among my earliest memories is my grandmother, Minnie Reich, telling me that Iwouldbecome president. I think she was trying to reassure herself that despite my being a runt, fully a head shorter than other little boys, I’d make her proud.When Trump first ran as a candidate for president in 2015, I viewed him as an anomaly, a cartoon caricature of a conman trying to gain political power. He spent most of his life bullying others – employees, contractors, vendors, women, tenants, lawyers, bankers, politicians, producers. He was and is a bully’s bully – vulgar, chaotic, angry, uninformed, impulsive, vindictive.I have seen the harm bullies cause, and I have spent much of my life trying to stop them. I fought schoolyard toughs who teased and harassed me for being short. I was protected by a teenager who subsequently was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan for trying to register Black voters in Mississippi. I marched for civil rights, protested the Vietnam war, and worked to elect Minnesota senator Eugene McCarthy, the anti-war candidate for president. As labor secretary to Bill Clinton, I tried to protect workers who were bullied by employers.I always believed America was not a nation of bullies. We protected the vulnerable, comforted the afflicted, gave refuge to those fleeing violence and persecution, and gave voice to those who otherwise would not be heard. I found these ideals in the declaration of independence, the constitution and the Bill of Rights, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, Emma Lazarus’s poem affixed to the Statue of Liberty, FDR’s second inaugural address, and Martin Luther King Jr’s “free at last” sermon at the 1963 March on Washington.With Trump wreaking havoc, a question for the US Democrats: when will you ever learn? | Timothy Garton AshRead moreMy parents and grandparents espoused these ideals and my teachers expounded them, connecting me with previous generations of Americans and the sacrifices they endured to preserve our democracy and achieve a greater good. Throughout my lifetime I cherished these ideals and hoped to pass them on.When I was secretary of labor, I had an office near the US Capitol from which I had a closeup view of the Capitol building’s large, majestic dome. When I worked late, which was most nights, I’d look up from my desk and see its hulking beauty lit up like a great monument to the idea of American democracy. I was often exhausted, sometimes discouraged, but the sight of that great dome filled me with the sense that I was taking part in something hugely important. It seemed to illuminate everything I was trying to do and vindicate the frustrations I felt, trying but often failing to keep the economic bullies at bay.Yet Trump was elected president in 2016 and then – after losing re-election in 2020 and encouraging a coup and an attack on the US Capitol, on US democracy itself – he was re-elected in 2024. And on 20 January 2025, he took the oath of office for a second time, right under the great dome of the Capitol.I asked myself how a plurality (albeit a razor-thin one) of American voters could possibly choose to put him in the Oval Office again and trust that he would abide by his oath when he betrayed it the first time.There are many explanations, but for me the most convincing began to unfold more than four decades ago when I noticed that most Americans’ incomes were flattening even though the economy continued to grow. Since then, the lion’s share of economic gains has gone to the top.Most Americans, especially those without college degrees, have felt very little improvement in their lives and their jobs have grown less secure. Vast swathes of the country have been abandoned by industry.The basic bargain used to be that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you’d do better, and your children would do even better than you. But since the late 1970s, that bargain has become a sham. The middle class has shrunk. About $50tn has been siphoned from the bottom 90% of Americans to the richest 1%.Many Americans feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger, although he directed it at scapegoats who did nothing to cause it – undocumented workers, the “deep state”, transgender people, “communists” andDemocrats. And he did nothing whatsoever to address the underlying cause. In fact, he gave two big tax cuts to the wealthy.Through these years, I watched as other Republican presidents also cut taxes on the wealthy, arguing that the government should allow the so-called “free market” to operate without constraint – perpetuating the “trickle-down” myth that great wealth in the hands of a few will benefit the many as the rich make the nation more productive. But as I came to understand, the “free market” is a misnomer and little or nothing has trickled down.Many Americans feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger, although he directed it at scapegoats who did nothing to cause itMeanwhile, I watched Democrats abandon the working class. John F Kennedy was the last Democratic president to depend on the votes of working-class Americans while losing the votes of white, college-educated Americans by two to one. Sixty years later, Joe Biden depended on the votes of college-educated Americans while losing the votes of the white working class by two to one. Kamala Harris lost the working class by an even larger margin.I saw Democratic leaders embrace free trade. I witnessed them deregulate finance and allow Wall Street to become a high-stakes casino.I was there when they let big corporations gain enough market power to keep prices and profit margins high. I saw them look away when corporations busted unions and slashed payrolls.I had a front-row seat when they bailed out Wall Street because its gambling addiction threatened to blow up the entire economy, but they never bailed out homeowners who lost everything. I saw them welcome big money into their campaigns and deliverquid pro quosthat rigged the market in favor of big corporations and the wealthy.To his credit, Joe Biden redirected the Democratic party back toward its working-class roots, but many of the changes Biden catalyzed were easily reversed. Kamala Harris’s brief, bright campaign had enormous energy but was on a perilously short runway, and she was not able to address why so many Americans were working harder than ever yet still struggling economically.Over the decades, I urged Democratic candidates and lawmakers to tell Americans why their pay continued to be lousy and their jobs less secure: certainly not because of immigrants, the “deep state”, transgender people, “communists” or any other bogeyman, but because of the power of large corporations and the rich to rig the market and siphon off much of the economy’s gains.Now’s the time for Democrats to hammer Trump on the economy | Lloyd GreenRead moreI asked Democrats to stop doing the bidding of big corporations and the wealthy and instead champion the working class: demand paid family leave, Medicare for all, free public higher education, stronger unions, and higher taxes on great wealth, and create the biggest boom in residential home construction since the second world war.I argued that corporations must share their profits with their workers and limit CEO pay, that stock buybacks should be illegal, that corporate welfare (subsidies and tax credits unrelated to the common good) should be stopped and giant corporations busted up.I warned that widening inequality and the corruption that accompanied it would eventually invite a demagogue who’d exploit the powerlessness and rage of Americans who felt economically bullied.It’s possible that the arguments I’ve made over the decades have been wrong and my warnings alarmist. But they have been based on what I have seen and experienced. And now that the nation has re-elected exactly the kind of demagogue I portended, there is added urgency in reversing the staggering inequalities and legalized bribery that characterize today’s America.I love America and am proud of much that this nation has accomplished over my lifetime. I remain doggedly hopeful about the long-term future. But, undeniably, we and much of the world now face a brutal set of crises, headed by the decline of democracy and deterioration of the rule of law.A previous generation won the second world war and created the most powerful economy and strongest democracy the world had ever seen, populated by the largest and most prosperous middle class in history. My generation and I then failed to create the decent, sustainable and just society that was within our grasp.In this regard, I’m sorry to say, we all came up short.Adapted from Robert Reich’s bookComing Up Short: A Memoir of My America, out on 5 August.

We cannot forget the power Dr King saw in the right to voteWed 6 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 06.12 EDTShareIn a moment when we should be celebrating one of the most important pieces of legislation in American history, we are in fact at a worse place as a nation than when it was passed. Those of us fighting to protect the right to vote find ourselves against a movement that doesn’t want to take us back to 1965. They want to create an America that more closely resembles the one of 1865.Sixty years ago, in a rare and profound act of consensus, Congress passed a law to end the centuries-old rigging of American democracy. Yet today the system is as rigged as ever, with the battered Voting Rights Act on life support.The erosion of our rights is playing out before our eyes. Purged voting rolls have helped to install a regime that arrests undocumented people and American citizens alike. A loss of faith in the system led many people to stay at home on election day; now they live in fear of walking outside their door. Empowering states to create restrictive laws has yielded less access to not only the right to vote, but to healthcare, jobs and home ownership.Republicans are quietly trying to disenfranchise millions of voters | Alexis Anderson-ReedRead moreAt the center of this isDonald Trump– a man whose legacy as president is marked by rampant voter disenfranchisement. This is a man whose claim to fame is fame itself, who views voting as nothing more than a popularity contest that he’s terrified to lose. It’s why he questioned the integrity of our democratic network in 2020 instead of graciously accepting that 7 million more Americans preferred Joe Biden over him.Trump’s campaign against voting rights marches on, as he fills the courts with judges who will continue to kill civil rights through a thousand cuts. Barriers to voting and the silence of those still able to cast ballots has emboldened and empowered him to bully media conglomerates into complacency and corporations into abandoning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Free of fear from the voters, Trump has gone full bore in desecrating the legacy of the civil rights movement – going so far as to use government files on Dr Martin Luther King Jr to distract from his own political headaches.But we cannot in this moment forget the power King saw in the right to vote. In his 1957Give Us the Ballot speechat the Lincoln Memorial, King declared to 25,000 people that with the vote: “We will no longer have to worry the federal government about our basic rights.”Yet today that fear persists, perhaps stronger than ever. We have indeed come full circle from March 1965, when the nation was rattled by the images of a young John Lewis and dozens of peaceful protesters getting their heads cracked open and their organs bruised on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The national outrage of Bloody Sunday that sparked mobilization toward passage of the Voting Rights Act has been replaced by a numbness to Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, the arrests of elected officials and the snipping of social safety nets.The solution to it all remains the right to vote. A week after the brutal beatings in Selma, King declared voting “Civil Right No. 1” in the New York Times. He called it the “foundation stone for political action”, one we must build upon today. Within five months, Congress bravely voted to end racist literacy tests, enable federal examiners to protect voter registration, and fight the ugliest forms of voter suppression.America was stronger for a generation, until the election of her first Black president sparked a conservative backlash that is today at its peak. The opening salvo came in 2013, when the supreme court gutted the law’s core federal pre-clearance provisions in Shelby county v Holder. It chipped away more eight years later, giving states further authority to enforce stricter voter ID laws, purge voter rolls, and reverse early and absentee programs meant to expand access to the polls. In short, Shelby v Holder opened the door for a manicured version of Jim Crow.It is for these reasons that we will lead a March on Wall Street later this month. The 28 August demonstration, held on the anniversary of the March on Washington, will send a message to Trump and his Maga allies in Congress. You may restrict our ability to vote in the president, the senators and the Congress members we support. But you cannot restrict how we vote with our dollars. Black voters have a skyrocketing buying power expected to hit $1.7tn by 2030. We must use it to make sure those we support stand by us.Until we get to a day when the integrity of voting is restored, when we can finally pass the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, we will use the power we have. Trump may use the bully pulpit of the White House to influence companies’ investments in Black America, but we have the ability to hit their bottom line.Celebrating this anniversary of the Voting Rights Act means honoring the sacrifices of those who shed their blood and laid down their lives for our most fundamental freedom and recommitting ourselves to the struggle by tapping into the unwavering hope and persistence that fueled the civil rights movement. To settle for anything less would be unconditional surrender to the segregationists against whom King, congressman Lewis, Fannie Lou Hamer and the other great civil rights leaders stood.Rev Al Sharpton is an American Baptist minister, civil rights activist and radio talkshow hostExplore more on these topicsUS voting rightsOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsUS CongressActivismProtestcommentShareReuse this content"

So why is it cowering before Trump like a mouse?Alexander HurstWith its woeful trade deal, Europe prostrated itself before the president. We need a leader who will tell him where to shove itWed 6 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 08.19 EDTShareWho remembers the spate of “introduction videos” that emerged during the first Trump administration – a series of tongue-in-cheek clips about European countries to introduce them to Donald Trump? The viral video trend wassparked by the Dutch comedian Arjen Lubach, who endedhis segment on the Netherlandswith: “We totally understand it’s going to be America first, but can we just say the Netherlands second?” It seems that Europe’s leaders remember the videos all too well; that they internalised the caustic message a little bit too much.Afraid of rocking the boat during its trade negotiations with Trump, the EU decided to pre-emptively sink itself. Instead of strategic autonomy, it will spendhundreds of billionsof dollars on American weapons; in place of future climate goals, it will pour hundreds of billions into US natural gas; instead of a mutual tariff reduction, it will take a huge unilateral hit to EU exporters; instead of self-respect, humiliating prostration.The new trade “deal”announced byTrump and Ursula von der Leyen last month left a five-year-old’s worth of whys to ponder. Why does the EU, a colossus, think it is a mouse? Why is it content to merely nibble at the edges of power? Will it ever respect itself as much as China, which met Trump tariff for tariff until he backed off? Why don’t its politicians understand that voters want leaders who will defend them, and that, as for Canada’s Mark Carney and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there are actually electoral rewards to be reaped by doing so without reserve? Why, even after Brexit, do they ignore the lesson that these same voters prioritise identity and emotion over cold economic rationality?The EUcouldhave called Trump’s bluff; the problem is that, asEmmanuel Macron remarked, the EU isn’t “feared enough”. And yet, it has far more leverage than China does against the US economy. If deployed, the EU’santi-coercion instrumentwould enable it to flatly end the future manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors in the US by shutting off exports, turningTrump’s $500bn Stargate AI projectinto an intergalactic bridge to nowhere. It could obliterate long-term US tech dominance by taxing the Silicon Valley behemoths, blocking their market access and removing their intellectual property protections. It could severely disrupt Americans’ supply of Ozempic and Wegovy for good measure.Would this spiral? Undoubtedly – but as the weaker tech player, the EU arguably has less to lose and ultimately more to gain. Plus,Europeans hate Trumpand would probably unify in the face of a full-blown trade war, whereas Americans – half of whomalso hate Trump– would not.We tend to take the EU for granted, but there is anger brewing amid latent pride. The first European politician to tell Trump where to shove it – in a crude, unapologetic and very public way – is going to surf a wave of never-before-seen emotion and support.Is this far-fetched and unrealistic? Probably. Buteverythingabout Trump is far-fetched and unrealistic. Why are we willing to accept – expect, even – boundary-pushing, shocking behaviour from the US, but not from ourselves? Surrendering to Trump’s demands is the act of an entity that still believes the US is a wayward friend to appease, cajole and fear, all while the US under Trump sees and treats Europe as a weak, naive thing to manipulate and exploit. Well, congratulations, Europe proved it right – and all but ensured that Trump and his ilk will come back for a second round of ransom demands and threats. In fact, they already are, with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick,going after EU tech regulationsfollowing the deal.Europe might not like it, but the world has changed. In this new era, Russia, China and the US all want a return to spheres of influence and the rule of power in place of the rule of law, just with varying appetites for chaos (Russia) versus stability (China). Within this fuzzy picture, Trump is a genius at twisting emotion to his purposes, but he is also deeply ignorant, intellectually incoherent and follows mafioso-style instincts about how to wield the power he has, with the end result of undermining it more quickly.The EU is the only significant force left with a deep desire for a world that abides by the rule of law. That doesn’t mean it’s theonlyactor that wants this – it’s joined by the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and, especially when it comes to climate, a host of other nations potentially led by Brazil.For decades, though, Europe has been enthralled with the story the US spins. As a result, it’s now in thrall to an America spinning a dark story. That’s a bad place for Europe to be. Not just economically, but geopolitically, because its dependence on the US (and fear that Trump will drop Ukraine into the deep end) leaves it in a place of hypocrisy in relation to would-be global partners: unwilling to uphold international law against Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza all while rightly exhorting it in response to Vladimir Putin’s relentless bombing of civilians in Ukraine.There is an inflection point looming – or perhaps it has just arrived – where Europeans will have to ask themselves, what is the purpose of an EU for ever consigned to can-kicking half measures, choosing the lowest common denominator among its internal divisions, and repeated capitulation? The far-right nationalists have an answer: no real union at all, and a future of vassalage and endless bickering for the scraps of global irrelevance.What is the federalist answer? This is not just a nice intellectual exercise. I don’t want to live in a world where aggressors grab land when they want, where genocides go unchecked, where the climate crisis spins out of control and where far-right autocracy takes root.The answer has to be that the EU starts to actually believe in itself, rather than the narrative the US so deftly spins. That means an end to being enthralled by GDP per capita as a measure of prosperity. It means including the climate crisis as context in every economic discussion, for the same reason that a nutrition label that made no mention of sugar content would make no sense. Europe-based economic activity is amongthe least carbon-intensive in the world; the World Trade Organization is broken, so why not reorganise global trade – among the willing, and excluding the unwilling – around a price on carbon, using the EU’s existing emissions trading system as a starting point?It means removingthe far-right’s complaintthat countries “send” money to the EU by replacing national contributions with a common corporate tax rate for its members, along withwealth taxesandtaxes on big tech. It means getting over the internal allergy to spending internationally insignificant sums of money, because almost every sphere in which the EU feels inferior to the US boils down to a willingness to spend – or not. The EU is jealous of the US’s big tech firms, but there is no secret sauce here beyond investment. Take space for example, where, again, the US is dominant. How could it be anything other when Nasa’s2023 budget was $25bnand the European Space Agency’swas €7bn? Time instead to roll out a budget worthy of a true geopolitical power, and invest in long-term economic, environmental and political success.And finally, it means copying one thing from the Trump playbook: DGAF. Or, for the polite pages of the Guardian, “caring less”. As in, if a von der Leyen spokesperson is reading this, the next time you hold a press conference, you might shoot back at all the public criticism: “The European Commission president might not be a great negotiator, but at least she’s not a sexual predator or a convicted felon.”Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeUrsula von der LeyenDonald TrumpGlobal economyInternational tradeTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

I have not seen such deep poverty since I grew up in a mining and textiles town blighted by unemploymentWed 6 Aug 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 14.14 EDTShareFrom 1945 to 1951, a Labour government, struggling to pay down Britain’s war debts in what became known as the “age of austerity”,created Britain’s welfare state, pioneered a free National Health Service and implemented family allowances. In the 1970s, facing an oil shock and rising deficits, Labour introducedchild benefitfor 7 million families. By 2010, despite a global financial crisis, the government had raisedtax creditsfrom zero in 1997 to £30bn, taking millions of pensioners and children out of poverty.It is to the credit of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves that within days of entering office, they set up thechild poverty reviewwith a remit to ensure an “enduring reduction in child poverty in this parliament”. Now, for a fraction of that £30bn spent in 2010, they can resume Labour’s historic role and ultimatelytake 500,000 children out of povertywithout dropping manifesto commitments.As a former chancellor who understands why it matters to balance the books, I sympathise with Reeves’s fiscal inheritance. This autumn, as growth is hit by tariffs and trade restrictions, and the fiscal position weakens as we come to terms with defence requirements, a history of low productivity and steep interest payments, the window for long-promised social improvements might appear to be closing. But having been invited to respond to the government’s consultations on both child poverty andgambling taxation– and following recent reports from theSocial Market Foundationand the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) – it’s clear that we can identify sources of revenues to fight the war against child poverty. The first step is raising billions by taxing the extraordinarily profitablegambling and betting industry, without affecting lotteries or bingo.There is an urgent need to act. I have not seen such deep poverty since I grew up in a mining and textiles town where unemployment was starting to bite hard. Now, each night,1 million childrenin the UK try to sleep without a bed of their own. Two million households livewithout cookers, fridges or washing machines, and many are withouttoothpaste, soap or shampoo. It is heartbreaking that3 million childrengo without meals because their families run out of food. The decisions of previous Tory governments have pushed4.5 million childreninto poverty. This is a national scandal and a stain on our country’s soul. Britain is now enduring the worst levels of child poverty since modern records began, even worse than in the Thatcher-Major years, and far worse than in most European countries. Yet without action to improve family incomes, the numbers will, on the government’s own definition of poverty, rise to a wholly unacceptable4.8 million children by 2029.These are austerity’s children, the victims of 14 years of Tory rule, an era whose most vindictive act was to treatnewborn third and fourth childrenas second-class citizens, depriving them of all the income support available to their first and second siblings. By next year, every other child in cities such as Manchester and Birmingham will be condemned to poverty. In 2010, the Trussell Trust ran35 food banksin the UK. Now, along with independent ones, there are 2,800. Since the election, the number ofhomeless childrenin temporary accommodation in England has risen by 17,510 to 169,050.This summer, Dickensian levels of poverty have beenreported by the children’s commissioner. If we look into the eyes of these young Britons, we won’t like what we see: instead of a generation filled with optimism about the future, we’ll see among too many a deep, impenetrable sadness reflecting a loss of hope. Yet without action the government will have little chance of meeting its well-publicised target that75% of childrenwill be ready for school at age five.0:33Keir Starmer says he wants to cut child poverty before next election – videoThe child poverty review, when it is published, will deserve credit for proposing more breakfast clubs, free school lunches, family hubs and additional childcare. Moving thousands into better-paid jobs will also help. Sadly, however, none of these measures will prevent child poverty continuing to rise. School lunches are worth £12 a week per child, and breakfast clubs £9 a week, but under thetwo-child benefit capfamilies have lost £66 a week for their third child. If they have a fourth child, the total is £132 a week.The Conservative party cultivated the myth that poverty is the fault of work-shy parents and a culture of dependency. Yet70% of children in povertylive in families where someone is working but on pay too low to make ends meet. Many of the rest are single parents unable to work because they cannot afford childcare or are coping with illness in the family. Abolishing the two-child rule – what the children’s commissioner says has to be “the foundation for all else” – would cost£2bn in 2025-26and £2.8bn by the end of the parliament. As theResolution Foundationhas shown, almost 500,000 children can be lifted out of poverty by 2029-30 at a total cost of £3.5bn.Inaction will cost more. Currently, local authorities and the NHS are picking up huge bills for ill health, homelessness and the cost of supporting children in care. For every 100,000 children, each 1% increase in child poverty forces anadditional fiveof them into care. Each child looked after by the care system costs an estimated£1.2min terms of lost productivity and their use of public services.Excluding the lottery, betting and gaming was an £11.5bn sector last year that incurred only£2.5bn in tax. As much as £3bn extra can be raised from taxing it properly. Remote gaming duty (effectively the tax on online slots games) is about35% in the Netherlands,40% in Austria, 50% inPennsylvaniaand 57% in tax haven Delaware, two of the few US states where it is legal. Yet the same activity is taxed at just 21% in the UK, raising only £1bn. Applying a 50% levy – much less than the80% tax on cigarettesand the70% tax on whisky– would raise £1.6bnmore. Raising the general betting duty on bookmakers’ profits from 15% to 25% could generate an additional £450m, after returning£100m as additional supportto boost the horseracing industry.To achieve parity with their online equivalents, machine game duty payable on the revenue from in-person slot machines should also increase from 25% to 50%. According to IPPR estimates, this would raise an additional £880m.The government could then start to reduce child poverty. Unlike almost all other businesses, most gaming and betting is exempt from VAT. Its most addictive practices are responsible for social harm that costs the NHS and other public servicesmore than £1bn a year.Gambling levies aren’t the only source of revenue that could pay to alleviate child poverty. But this should be one straightforward budget choice. The government can fulfil today’s unmet needs by taxing an undertaxed sector.Gamblingwon’t build our country for the next generation, but children, freed from poverty, will.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So it was not a shock when late last week he came for statistics – or, more pointedly, the person in charge of the economic statistics.On Friday,the US’s Bureau of Labor Studiesreleased the July US employment figures. They were not good. Just 73,000 non-farm jobs were added and annual employment growth was the worst it has been since the GFC years (excluding the pandemic):If the graph does not display click hereIn response, Trump did what any autocrat would do when told bad news: he shot the messenger – at least only figuratively. Trump argued that Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics, had faked bad figures purely to hurt him.And so he fired her.But this should not be dismissed as “oh that’s just Trump”, nor should we just sigh and say we have been in afact-free era fornearly a decade.Reality might be hanging on to the political debate for dear life, but this move threatensto fling it off the cliff.The BLS data is vital for understanding not just what is going on in the USA but to guide other nations – like here in Australia. For example, Australia is doing very well compared with the US. Unlike the US, our employment rate is higher now than it was before the pandemic:If the graph does not display click hereThese comparisons can influence future policies. For example, we did very well during the GFC; the US did not. We also did much better during the pandemic than the US.They also give insight into the future. The US is still the world’s biggest economy and – as we have seen with inflation – what happens there, often happens here, in Australia:If the graph does not display click hereIf Trump doesn’t like weak employment growth numbers, you think he’ll be happy with inflation data that shows his tariffs are causing higher prices? And this is not just some academic exercise. US welfare payments are indexed to inflation, so the official data vitally affects the livelihood of many people.Trump thinks when he closes his eyes the rest of the world disappears. But not measuring inflation or unemployment orglobal temperaturesdoesn’t disappear the problems. And loss of trust in official data will affect business investment decisions, borrowing costs and – as with all attacks on institutions – faith in democracy.For example, in Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed that in the past yearthe cost of livingfor all households except “self-funded” retirees rose faster than did inflation:If the graph does not display click hereThis is not the greatest news for the Australian government – no politician likes data that says things might be worse than what they previously argued.Cost of living, unlike inflation, includes mortgage repayments. Despite falling interest rates, repaying a mortgage is still around 4.4% higher than it was a year ago, and since March 2022 mortgage repayments have accounted for nearly half of the increase in cost of living:If the graph does not display click hereDoes it help the Australian government for the ABS to reveal this? Not really. It could blame our Reserve Bank, but generally governments are blamed for high interest rates.It certainly doesn’t help the government for the ABS to release figures that some journalist like me can use to show that the value of wages are 8.6% lower than they were in March 2021 when you use cost of living rather than CPI:If the graph does not display click hereThat type of information makes life hard for the government – but so it should!In a democracy you have to face your critics, argue your case and convince voters you have the best plans and way forward. Political parties are already working hard to make you question reality. But at least till now, even in the US, where Trump would like there to be a new kind of maths where prices can fall by more than 100% (1,000%, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300!!), reality has been counted and presented.The end of impartial economic data would not just be another case of Trump “flooding the zone”. It would be a fundamental attack on democracy, designed to ensure those who are suffering from his polices are not able to demonstrate that things are worse – either for them or for the nation.They are the actions usually associated with authoritarian regimes, and we should not shy away from making that clear.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGrogonomicsBusinessAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

This was an ideological ploy from which we have yet to recoverWed 6 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.28 EDTShareThe housing problem in the UK has become so pervasive that it can sometimes seem natural and eternal, the ever-present background to British life. But it’s important to remember that specific political projects and policy choices brought about the housing crisis – and continue to maintain it.A newreport from the thinktank Common Wealthtallies up some of the continuing costs of one of the culprits: the right to buy, Margaret Thatcher’s signature social policy. It demonstrates that the right to buy has amounted to a massive giveaway of public resources, and one of the largest privatisations in British history.Focused on England, the report’s figures show the enormous scale of the public assets that local government was forced to give away. Since the policy’s introduction in 1980, 1.9m English council homes were sold at an average discount of 44% of market value. Common Wealth calculates that the discount resulted in councils giving up £194bn in equity. More than 40% of the homes sold under the right to buy are now privately rented.The history of the right to buy illuminates the political logic underlying it. Thatcher didn’t invent the idea – councils had been able to sell the public housing they owned to their tenants on a discretionary basis since 1936. But it was the Thatcher government that made it central to its strategy and brand.The 1980HousingAct systematised and expanded the existing procedures for selling council houses to tenants. It obliged councils to allow discounted sales and required them to offer deposit-free mortgages to facilitate these sales. Local authorities were allowed to keep half of the proceeds from right-to-buy sales but were in effect prevented from spending it on replacing lost public housing.The right to buy managed at once to satisfy a number of rightwing political constituencies. Traditional conservatives favoured it as a way to expand owner-occupation. Neoliberals saw it as an opportunity to foster the entrepreneurial spirit and push back against municipal socialism. Above all, the right to buy was intended to encapsulate the Tory ideal of a property-owning democracy, which dated from the 1920s but featured prominently in the 1979 Conservative manifesto.There’s no question that many households benefited from the policy, which remains broadly popular. But uptake has been very uneven, disproportionately benefiting more affluent tenants living in more valuable locations and housing types.More serious has been the impact of the right to buy on the housing system as a whole. Its goal was to undermine public housing and lessen its role in British life. And in this, it has unfortunately been successful. The policy drove a structural shift in British housing tenure. Before the policy was enacted, social housing of all types made up 31% of overall housing tenure in England. Today it is 16%. As a result, council housing waiting lists and homelessness have surged.In addition to its impact on existing housing, the right to buy also made building new council housing less viable. Asone council officer put it: “It makes us all more cautious about growing our stock.” If councils must sell at a discount any social housing units they build, then doing so becomes a risky venture.Rules about spending right-to-buy proceeds have been tweaked, but they still restrict the construction of new public housing. One councilhas calculatedthat it would need to sell six homes through the right to buy to generate enough funding to build one new home. The policy amounts to, in the report’s words, a “decision to de facto ban new social housebuilding”.To be sure, the issue is not just the right to buy, but the whole suite of housing policies that accompanied it. This included the deregulation of housing finance, the creation of the buy-to-let mortgage market and other support for landlordism and private home ownership. Through stock transfers, estate regeneration and other mechanisms, this housing policy trajectory has been upheld by Labour governments as well as the Tories. But the right to buy set the initial direction.In addition to its quantitative impacts, the policy had long-lasting ideological and political effects. For one, it strengthened the ideology of home ownership. It equated owner-occupation with independence, ambition and success while stigmatising and denigrating households that did not own property. Just as significantly, it helped sever the link between housing and social citizenship. The British state never fully institutionalised a right to housing, but for a few decades in the 20th century, public housebuilding was a sign of successful governance for both major parties.Today, it is clear that the property-owning democracy was a mirage.Social housingand owner-occupation are on the backfoot. Private landlordism and elite multiple property ownership are expanding. Rents and house prices are rising. The result is a housing crisis, precarity and inequality.Thatcher’s motto that “there is no alternative” was never an empirical claim so much as a normative ambition. The right to buy has been an exercise in trying to make this ambition a reality in the housing sphere, by eliminating existing alternatives to the private housing market.Critics have been calling for the policy’s abolition since it was introduced. The policy was already scrapped in 2016 in Scotland and 2019 in Wales. Shelterestimatesthat fully suspending the right to buy would save on average more than 10,000 social homes a year. If the right to buy council housing were to be eliminated, asocial tenants’ deposit schemeor other offsetting policies could be established to compensate tenants without undercutting social housing as a whole.If Britain’s housing problem is ever going to be solved, it will require fully ending the right to buy. But that alone is insufficient. The way out of the housing impasse is by privileging occupancy over property rights, flattening the tenure hierarchy, expanding social housing and building other decommodified housing alternatives. Resolving the housing crisis depends upon reversing and replacing the changes to the British housing system and society that the right to buy helped to bring about.DavidMadden is associate professor of sociology and director of the Cities programme at the London School of EconomicsExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingHousing marketRenting propertyLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

I mean, apart from ants, obviously. With their long snouts and even longer sticky tongues, they trundle around, slurping up insects like milkshakes. They have handsome, bushy tails, which they wrap around themselves at night like a blanket. And they’re excellent parents. Giant anteater mothers allow their young to cling to their backs, rucksack-style, for periods of up to a year.Indeed, the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí was so taken with the giant anteater that he once took one for a walk through the streets of Paris. And before you ask, no, this wasn’t a cheese dream. There isphotographic evidence.As if that weren’t enough, a recent study published in the journalEvolutionhas found that mammals have evolved into anteaters not once, not twice, but 12times since the demise of the dinosaurs some 66m years ago. Anteaters, it seems, are a recurring trend. The finding prompted the study’s lead author, Thomas Vida from the University of Bonn, to tellSciencemagazine: “Things keep evolving into anteaters, somehow.” Which raises the question: will humans one day follow suit?By “things”, Vida means mammals, and by “anteaters” he includes the four species of anteater from Central and South America, the pangolins and aardvarks of Africa and Asia, and the echidnas of Australia. Different animals, on different continents, that all practise myrmecophagy, also known as the consumption of termites and ants. If you were a parent of young children, you’d call them fussy eaters. If you were an evolutionary biologist, however, you’d point out that they’re not being deliberately difficult. Instead, they have evolved to fill a very particular ecological niche.That niche is provided by the world’s extensive population of ants and termites, some 15,000 species, whose collective biomass is more than10 times greaterthan that ofallwild mammals. At least a dozen times in evolutionary history, mammals decided that if you can’t beat them, eat them, and began to consume the crunchy delicacy.Such an abundant food source can act as what biologists call a “selective pressure”. Characteristics that enabled animals to eat more ants and termites – and thus survive better – are more likely to be passed on. Over millions of years, animals from all three major groups of mammal life, including marsupials and the egg-laying monotremes, evolved to have long, sticky tongues, reduced or missing teeth and strong forelimbs for busting into insect nests.It’s a powerful example of convergent evolution, the phenomenon by which different species, in different places or times, independently evolve similar characteristics. Faced with the same problem – how do I eat these ants? – they all arrived at a similar solution. So, though they’re not closely related, they possess features that are superficially similar.Convergent evolution is how echolocation (the ability to determine the location of objects using reflected sound) evolved separately in bats and dolphins, camera-like eyes evolved in octopuses and vertebrates, and opposable digits evolved in primates, koalas and chameleons. Powered flight has evolved independently at least four times – in birds, bats, pterosaurs and insects – and venom production more than100 times, while crustaceans have evolved the classic, crab-like body planat least five times. Known ascarcinisation, it has spawnedcrabby memes aplenty.The evolutionary biologistSimon Conway Morrishas used convergent evolution to argue that evolution is both deterministic and predictable. Rewind the tape of life, play it over again and similar-looking lifeforms would evolve, he says.This means that in theory, with enough time (many tens of millions of years), the appearance and retention of the requisite genetic mutations and, critically, thesameselective pressures that shaped the emergence of former ant-eating animals, some mammals – including maybe us –couldevolve gummy mouths and sticky tongues. Forget the history books, it’s the cookery books that would be rewritten.Only there’s a fly in the ointment. We’re wrong to presume that because myrmecophagy has evolved multiple times, it is the pinnacle of some evolutionary tree. There are, after all, many more mammals that have not evolved into anteaters than have started breaking into termite mounds. The fact that convergent evolution occurs does not necessarily make it the default pathway.In addition, evolution has a way of pulling the rug. It canbe predictable, but it can also be quirky and erratic. In his 1989 book, Wonderful Life, another titan of evolutionary biology, Stephen Jay Gould, argued for the importance of random events. These can be anything from lightning strikes to asteroid impacts: any unforeseen occurrence that derails the prevailing trajectory of evolution and sends it along a different path. In other words, “sliding doors” moments that have been influencing evolution for as long as there has been life on Earth.So, just because things kept “evolving into anteaters” in the past, doesn’t mean that history will repeat itself. Which is a shame. Anteaters and aardvarks don’t typically eat all of the ants or termites in a nest, but leave some behind so the colony can rebuild itself. This makes them the epitome of sustainable living. If we can’t evolve into them, we can at least learn from them.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author of Bring Back the King: The New Science of De-Extinction and Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on EarthExplore more on these topicsEvolutionOpinionAnimalsBiologycommentShareReuse this content"

But his medical details do not diminish his suffering, or that of other children in GazaWed 6 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 08.51 EDTShareBetween April and mid-July this year, more than 20,000 children inGazawere admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition, 3,000 of whom were severely malnourished, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global initiative whose members include UN agencies such as the World Health Organization, World Food Programme and Unicef, as well as NGOs and research institutes.Over this period, and in the weeks since, the Guardian has published many images of hungry children, among them at least 20 shown in an emaciated condition. (It does so working to an editorial code that gives special protection to children, publishing on matters that may intrude into their welfare only when there is a strong public interest to do so.) Butone photograph, which appeared on the homepage of the website on 23 July and on the front of the print edition the next day, prompted fierce controversy.The picture was powerful and pitiful: an 18-month-old boy, Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq, cradled in his mother’s arms; his bare back skeletal, his diaper a black plastic bag. This image, as well as others of the same child, were published widely by major news organisations.Freelance journalist and antisemitism campaigner David Collier accused the media that published the photos of doing so “to push a lie about famine”. He saida May 2025 medical report he had seen stated the boy had cerebral palsy. This was not the face of famine, Collier wrote in hisblogposton 27 July, but a child who “has needed specialist medical supplements since birth”.“What we can see from [unpublished] pictures is that both Mohammed’s mother and his older brother look healthy and are not suffering from any type of starvation that would be necessary to cause the thinness suffered by Mohammed,” he said.A reader who contacted me directly decried the image as “a fake”. Another said: “Definitely this poor child is suffering. But is it from starvation? It is from several medical conditions Muhammad was born with … You need to make sure your readers know the real ‘WHY’ behind this picture.”It seems unarguable that readers want to know the “real why” in whatever they are seeing. But its availability is not always as straightforward. War is chaotic and individual circumstances invariably complex.Foreign journalists are barred by Israel from entering Gaza, meaning they rely on local journalists, including photographers, working in difficult and dangerous conditions. The Guardian receives about 1,000 images a day from Gaza, provided by or via major picture agencies. The pictures of Muhammad came through Getty Images from the Turkish state-run Anadolu agency.In the wake of the accusations, Anadolu publishedan articlethat quoted Suzan Marouf, a doctor treating the boy at the Patient’s Friends hospital in Gaza City, saying doctors there had diagnosed him the previous month with “moderate malnutrition on top of congenital health problems, including brain complications and muscle atrophy” but that these issues were “not significantly affecting his weight” until the hospital’s nutritional supplements became depleted. Since then, he had developed severe malnutrition, she said.Separately, Anadolu distributed an image from Muhammad’s bedside showing a picture of him before he lost weight. Muhammad’s mother said he dropped from 9kg to 6kg in recent weeks.The Guardian was not aware until after it published the images (the first was in a picture gallery on 22 July) that the boy had other medical conditions. Should they have sought to ask? The relevant editors I have spoken to here each told me that seeing his wasted frame did not stand out as unusual; they had “consistently seen similar pictures for months”.In a hunger crisis, they point out, experts attest to how children and those with existing medical conditions are among thosemost at risk. According to the WHO, of the 63 malnutrition‑related deaths recorded in July, 24 were children under five. That is 38%, when under-fives make up around 15% of the total population of Gaza.Children with developmental disorders can have special nutritional needs. One paediatrician, speaking to me for background, said diagnosis was frequently challenging in settings without access to early identification tools, which meant that with cerebral palsy, for example, definitive diagnosis is sometimes not made until the age of two.Editors say reference to Muhammad’s existing health issues would have been included if known – and the picture captions have now been amended – but they consider that the images still stand, saying a sick child who is starving is “not any less deserving of our attention than any other child”, asprevious reportingfeaturing malnourished infants with underlying feeding conditions has demonstrated. In other words, the face of malnourishment is most often the face of the already vulnerable.For my part, I agree that the missing information was relevant to a fuller reading of the picture. But the Guardian has not, as some claim, relied on this image alone to illustrate reporting of what the IPC days later termed (though Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejects the assessment) an “unfolding” famine. And if we recognise that it is the most vulnerable who are most impacted by lack of food and health services, publication of this picture of real suffering did not, in my view, act to deceive.Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian’s global readers’ editorguardian.readers@theguardian.comThe subheading of this article was amended on 6 August 2025. An earlier version referred to the child having cerebral palsy; as the article indicates, this was a claim but not a diagnosis stated by doctors treating him in recent weeks in Gaza City.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Pause it and you hear the sound of democracy in crisisRafael BehrPolitics is struggling to cope with the pace of technological change – and that is affecting every single one of usWed 6 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 07.43 EDTShareReturning from holiday, asked where I have been, I want to say “offline”. The more precise answer is France, where the internet is available. But I tried not to use it compulsively because there isn’t much point in getting away from it all if you carry it all with you on a phone and check it every few minutes.At some point in the past decade or so, the condition of vacation came to be defined more by detachment from the digital realm than departure from home. The break begins not in a departure lounge but with the act of logging off, setting the out-of-office email auto-reply, archiving work-related WhatsApp chats, deleting social media apps.The benefit isn’t immediate. The cacophony rings in your ears for a few days before you notice the stillness, the change in tempo. It is the difference between gliding on thermal currents of private thought and hurtling along rails, propelled by the burning urgency of other people’s opinions. The contrast is even starker in reverse, the roar of the tunnel as you go back to work, the jostle of notifications, the bowed head, scrolling the horizon away.I’m not an analogue nostalgist. I don’t prefer getting lost to having Google Maps. I don’t think people were better informed when they had fewer channels or were less vulnerable to superstition when clerical authority was absolute.We are now in the third decade of the first digital century. The revolution is irreversible and of unknowable duration. History has had a number of these explosive profusions of interconnectedness, driven by a radical innovation in communication technology. But not many. The writer Naomi Alderman calls them “information crises”, and argues that the present one is only the third. The printing press was the second. The invention of writing some time around the fourth millennium BC was the first.The comparison doesn’t have to be exact for us to marvel at the scale of what we are experiencing. It is immeasurable because we don’t know how far along the track we have travelled. AI is only getting started.Readers of theGutenberg Biblein the late 15th century had no means of anticipating the ways that movable type would transform European social, cultural, economic and political organisation. Are we better equipped to imagine the world after another 100 years of digital Reformation?My measly fortnight of technological temperance isn’t likely to afford much additional perspective. But it is a reminder that the transformation under way is operating at a cognitive level. When you switch the information flow off for a moment, or just dial it down a bit, you appreciate how intense and overwhelming it is the rest of the time.Our brains evolved to handle the relatively limited dataset of an immediate physical environment, tracking the bush for predators, eking a survival strategy from scarce resources. We are organic processing units. Our capacity for rational judgment is limited by the rate at which we can turn signals from our senses into a workable mental model of the universe, and choose an appropriate course of action.1:56App stores have 'huge disincentive' to remove pornography due to profits says eSafety boss  – videoIt is an extraordinary talent, but fallible, especially in conditions of sensory overload. That doesn’t mean we are incapable of handling perception of the world on an altered scale, or at much higher speeds. We can adapt to the tsunami of additional stimulus, just as we adapted to life in cities after centuries of rural subsistence. But such accelerated transitions are turbulent, stressful and usually violent. Information crises generate cosmological upheaval. They change the way humanity organises and views itself. Hierarchies tumble. Social norms are recoded. Morality is redefined. New philosophies are hatched. Gods are discarded.Under the circumstances, it isn’t surprising that democratic politics is struggling to adapt. How is one parliament on a small north Atlantic island supposed to impose new rules for the application of technology that spans the globe, dissolves national borders and vaporises the authority of analogue institutions?In the short period of my internet abstinence last month, long-delayed provisions of the Online Safety Act came into force.Social mediaplatforms and search engines are now obliged to restrict underage users’ access to content listed as harmful by the new statute – abuse, pornography, material promoting self-harm, terrorism and suicide.Tech companies have lobbied ferociously against the change. Donald Trump’s White House characterises it as an assault on free speech. Nigel Farage agrees andpromises to repeal the actif he ever forms a government. Labour ministers have said the Reform leader’s position aligns him with theinterests of paedophiles.As a law-abiding adult user of social media, I cannot judge whether the new restrictions perform their advertised function. The age-verification process is efficient, painless and feels no more or less sinister than any of the other personal data submissions we now routinely make as the price for a frictionless internet.There are reported cases of non-pornographic news and public health sites being blocked by accident. There are claims that the protections are easily circumvented with a modicum of digital knowhow. It seems plausible that risk-averse or lazy tech companies are applying ill-designed, overzealous filters. But the impact on political liberty – the impediment to free speech that might justify some of the lurid comparisons being made to totalitarian censorship – is probably still in the order of zero.Social media battles and barbs on both sides of Atlantic over UK Online Safety ActRead moreOf course, any instrument for policing flows of information contains the theoretical foundations of a more repressive agenda. A future government could redefine “harmful” content to include criticism of the government, for example, or anything that undermines traditional family values. Liberal defenders of the new law should not be complacent about its potential misuse.But its most vigorous critics,especially in the Trump administration, are not credible advocates of political liberty. The cause they advance is not free speech as a civic virtue. It is the commercial interest of companies that control much of the world’s digital information infrastructure. The system is awash with toxic material. Poison flows into the public realm and the pump’s owners deny responsibility, resisting regulation for the same reason that polluters have done since the Industrial Revolution. Because they can. Because their business is more profitable when someone else cleans up the mess.The Online Safety Act can be flawed and necessary at the same time. It is just a tiny skirmish in the early stages of the battle to decide how power is wielded and by whom in a world reordered by the information crisis. It is a faint but vital signal – a cry for help by analogue politicians drowning in digital noise.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsInternet safetyOpinionInternetSocial mediaNigel FarageDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

So why does the British Museum still think it’s OK to display human remains?Paul DaleyBodies and body parts have long been part of collections of imperial plunder over the years – but museums must understand that attitudes have moved onTue 5 Aug 2025 23.24 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 01.46 EDTShareI went to theBritish Museumwith my youngest adult daughter and her partner recently – and we were all shocked.I’d been to the institution many times when I lived in London until two decades ago, and let’s just say there had never been any shortage of imperial plunder to shock and anger me. But the notable thing about our shared reactions when visiting on a recent late spring day was that the collection that so disconcerted us had not greatly bothered me on my last visit in 2003.Times change. So, too, do people. Human sensitivities evolve with age and self-education and understanding. Unlike some institutions, however, which seem to remain largely intransigent.What shook us all on the recent visit were the collections relating to (in theBM’s own words) “Egyptian death and the afterlife: mummies’’. Yep, the mummies. Dead people shrouded in cloth, some in open sarcophagi. The skulls, mandible, ribs and other body parts belonging to ancient people of the Nile valley were also on display.The mummy rooms, as they are known, were certainly popular. Perhaps the busiest rooms we visited, to judge from the hordes of mums, dads, kids and schoolchildren scrambling to get up close and personal to the glass cabinets for a better look – and photograph each other with – were those that contained the dead.“Mum – get a picture of my head right next to his.’’The British Museum is among many institutions globally that still display human remains, although advances in museological ethics and approaches to how collections of the dead are curated (not to mention repatriation policies) mean the number is dwindling. It is clearly cognisant of the now rapid evolution in attitudes on institutional holdings and display of the dead as evidenced by itswebsitewhich stresses “the Museum ensures that the human remains held in its care are always treated and displayed with respect and dignity’’.The mummy rooms, with all those people struggling for selfies with dead people, did not entirely exude respect and dignity. Call me old-fashioned. No wait – call me progressive. Actually, no – just call me a regular human with more than a passing unease at the dead ending up anonymised into collection items and how they might have felt about this when they were alive.I’ve written extensively about collections of human remains inAustralianand overseas institutions, not least at theSouth Australian Museumwhere body parts belonging to some 4,600 individuals (most of them Aboriginal people) have at times been stored – though not recently displayed.As a kid my dad would take me to the Melbourne Museum. I remember the mummies on display there. I was ghoulishly fascinated – though not shocked. Today I find displays of dead people shocking – and not at all fascinating – even if museums still advance the purported scientific benefits of holding such specimens. As specious as that argument is (advanced, for example, in the explanatory note about the decay of the teeth on skulls from the Nile valley, on display in the BM mummy rooms) it remains to be seen how it is served by the public display of such body parts.Like the SA Museum, which no longer displays remains and has gone to lengths to repatriate and re-bury the dead from its collections where provenance can be determined, a growing number of institutions globally are choosing to no longer display human remains at all.In the UK, anall-party parliamentary grouphas proposed that the public display of human remains, including the mummies in the BM, be stopped.The chair of the parliamentary groupBell Ribeiro-Addymade the argument succinctly: “I would like people to imagine taking the remains of our monarchs to another country and putting them on display. Even if they kept them in their coffins, would we think that was acceptable?’’Good question.Many remains (perhaps thousands) belonging to Australian Indigenous people are still in overseas collecting institutions. Anthropologists from across the globe sought them in the 19th century to advance their perverse racially scientific theories (not least the pseudo-science of phrenology, which fallaciously proposed that racial characteristics, intelligence and personality might be determined by skull shape). Some were the victims of colonial massacres. Others were stolen from morgues and hospitals.Even one of the world’s most confronting public collections of human remains, theMütter Museumat the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, is facing along-overdue reckoningabout the future of its gruesome collection (including at one time the skull of an Australian soldier to which I broughtglobal attention in 2017).Times have changed, even if some globally revered organisations haven’t.It’s beyond time for public collecting institutions, which claim to operate ethically and respectfully, to remove all human remains,including Egyptian mummies, from public display and, where possible, to repatriate them.It isnever OKto have them on public view as objects of entertainment.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsMuseumsOpinionBritish MuseumIndigenous AustralianscommentShareReuse this content"

We speak to the director of Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, a film about the journalistJulian BorgerWed 6 Aug 2025 11.46 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.47 EDTShareIsrael has sought to pursue its campaign of annihilation against Gaza and its people behind closed doors. More than 170 Palestinian journalists have been killed so far, and no outside reporters or cameras are allowed in.The effects of this policy of concealment – which the Guardianmanaged to pierce this week with a shocking aerial photographthat made the front page – are to ensure that the outside world only catches sight of Gaza’s horrors in small fragments, and to stifle empathy for those trapped inside by hiding them from view, obscuring their humanity. But a new documentary film, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, seeks to open a window to the unfathomable suffering inside Gaza.A wasteland of rubble, dust and graves: how Gaza looks from the skyRead moreIt focuses on the life of a single young Palestinian woman named Fatma Hassouna, known as Fatem to those close to her. She is 24 years old when we meet her, and has such a broad smile and enthusiasm for life that she compels attention from her first appearance, a few minutes into the film.We see Hassouna’s life through the screen of a mobile phone belonging to the director, Sepideh Farsi, and most of the film is made up of the conversations between these two women as they develop an increasingly strong personal bond over the course of a year.The director knows all about conflict and oppression. Farsi is Iranian-born and was a teenager at the time of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. When she was 16 she was imprisoned by the Islamic Republic regime, and she left the country for good two years later, settling in France. She was on tour with her film The Siren, a feature-length animation about the Iran-Iraq war, when theGazaconflict erupted in October 2023. As the civilian death toll mounted, she found herself unable just to sit on the sidelines, watching endless debates that did nothing to stop the slaughter.View image in fullscreen‘She was very special’ … director Sepideh Farsi at a film festival this summer in Mallorca.Photograph: Tomas Andujar/EPA/Shutterstock“The common denominator was that there was never the Palestinian voice there,” Farsi says. “We had different points of views: the American, the European, the Egyptian, the Israeli, but never the Palestinian. It started really bothering me, and at some point I couldn’t live with it any more.”In spring last year she flew to Cairo with the idea that she could somehow find a way across the Gaza border to film the war firsthand. That quickly proved a naive and futile mission, so she began filming Gazan refugees in Egypt. One of them suggested to Farsi that if she wanted to talk to someone inside, he could put her in touch with his friend Fatma in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City.We first see Hassouna the way Farsi meets her, on her little phone screen, materialising with green hijab, big glasses and her broad white strip of a smile. They clearly delight in each other’s presence from the outset.“From the first call, I felt that she was someone very special, and that something clicked between the two of us immediately,” Farsi says. “As soon as we connected, I would be smiling or laughing, and she was the same on her side.”There had been no guarantee the two would get along. Farsi is significantly older, with a daughter Hassouna’s age, and she is a cosmopolitan, sophisticated woman who has travelled the world, while Hassouna has been restricted to Gaza all her life. Hassouna is devout while Farsi is profoundly sceptical of any religious talk and challenges her new young friend over what kind of god would allow innocent people to suffer so painfully.However there is far more that draws them together, in ways that are harder to define. “She had this energy, this shining thing. She was solar,” Farsi says. “That’s the adjective that fits her. Her natural smile. There was this mutual fascination, sorority, comradeship – a mixture of all of these things – and we were happy as soon as we connected.”Farsi makes her phone a portal through which Hassouna recounts her story and the tragedy of Gaza. She talks about her family and introduces her shy brothers to Farsi. She has already made herself a photographer and poet by the time they meet, and Farsi coaches her into being a film-maker and to send out video of the ruination around her.Hassouna is supremely, naturally talented. Her pictures capture the everyday effort of her neighbours trying to survive in the rubble, while her use of language – in her poems and in conversation – is every bit as evocative. The film’s title is taken from her passing description of what it is like to venture outside: “Every second you go out in the street, you put your soul on your hands and walk.”In another conversation, struggling to make sense of what is happening, Hassouna asks: “We live a very simple life, and they want to take this simple life from us. Why? I’m 24 and I don’t have any of the things that I want. Because every time you reach what you want, there’s a wall. They put up a wall.”The film should not work. It is determinedly rudimentary, filmed largely on one phone pointed at another. The image of Hassouna sometimes freezes and buffers as the internet connection ebbs and flows. But these glitches draw us in and make us experience the precariousness of their connection.View image in fullscreenSome of Hassouna’s messages to Farsi about children believed killed in Gaza.Composite: Rêves d’Eau/ 24images“That’s why I decided to keep this low resolution and not to use a regular camera,” Farsi explains. “I wanted it to be very low-key technically, to match the connection problems with her, to match the disparity of life here and there.” She had originally attempted a cleanly edited version with all the disconnections cut out. “It was lacking soul. It didn’t breathe. So we put it back in – this brokenness of image and sound.”The sweetness of the relationship at the core of the film is made bittersweet by the constant threat of death around Hassouna. Every so often she reports the death of relatives, or neighbours whose eviscerated homes she points to out of her window. It feels like the encircling darkness is in a direct struggle with Hassouna’s smile and her instinctive optimism.Anyone who does not want to know which triumphs in the end should stop reading here.Towards the end of the film, Farsi calls Hassouna to give her the happy news that the film has been selected to be screened at Cannes. They excitedly talk about Farsi obtaining a French visa that might allow Hassouna to get out of Gaza temporarily to attend the festival. While they are talking, the young Palestinian sends the film-maker a photo of her passport.That was 14 April this year. The next day, a Tuesday, Farsi could not get through to Gaza to give Hassouna an update on preparations. “So I said, ‘OK, we’ll do it on Wednesday,” the director recalls. “On Wednesday, I was working on the film on my computer with my phone beside me, and all of a sudden I saw a photo pop up. I opened the notification and saw her photo with a caption saying she had been killed. I didn’t believe it. I started calling her frantically, and then called a mutual friend, the one who introduced us, and he confirmed it was true.”In the middle of the night, two missiles fired by an Israeli drone had pierced the roof of her building and burrowed through before detonating, one of them exploding in the family’s second floor apartment, the other just below.Fatma Hassouna was killedalong with her three brothers and two sisters. Her father died later of his wounds leaving her mother, Lubna, as the sole survivor.The investigative group Forensic Architecture studied the missile strike and declared it a targeted strike aimed at Hassouna for her work as a journalist and witness. Farsi has no doubt. “She was targeted by the IDF,” she says. “There were two missiles dropped by a drone on her house. It means they found out where she was living, planned a drone with missiles to go through three storeys of that building and explode on the second floor. It’s amazingly well planned in order to eliminate somebody who just does photography.“I still can’t believe it,” Farsi says, speaking from Bogotá, where she is touring with the film, which is now Hassouna’s legacy. “It’s three months now, a bit more, and it’s still quite unbelievable. For me, she is somewhere out there and I believe I will meet her someday.”In their conversations, Hassouna talked about all the places in the world she dreamed of seeing, while insisting she would always return home to Gaza. Shortly before she died, she told Farsi: “I have the idea that I must keep going and I must document everything, to be part of this story, to be me!”She imagined passing on her experiences to her children, but instead they have been captured for a cinematic audience, and Hassouna’s arresting personality has been preserved at the same time, a portrait of a unique individual among the 60,000 dead.Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August.

One waitress had been there for 44 years. I photographed it empty as a metaphor for people having been kept apart by the pandemic’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 6 Aug 2025 10.16 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.43 EDTShareWhen I moved to Brooklyn in 2005, I noticed people building restaurants and bars that looked like 1950s diner-style restaurants, with soda fountains and lunch counters. I’m from Canada and I don’t think there’s a period that Canadians look back on with such nostalgia. I grew up on Vancouver Island watching old US movies and thinking, as I looked across the water towards America, that they showed what the country must look like.But our idea of those times is not firsthand, and I got really curious about that, and the fact that those days were not better for most people, only a few. That false, nostalgic feeling has become dangerous, with Trump’s “make America great again” rhetoric.In 2013, I started to drive around smaller towns inPennsylvaniato look at places that remain from the 50s. There are towns where maybe the mine closed, or the highway moved, and so – unlike the diners in New York, which keep getting renovated and extended – these places stayed as they were. It feels like the past and the present are somehow taking place at the same time. It’s really beautiful.In 2015, I started an Instagram account calledAmerican Squares, which is moreaboutnostalgia than it is nostalgic. When I look at these prefabricated diners that rolled off assembly lines, so beautiful in their details, I think about how the people who invented them would be shocked that we’re looking back now in this way. They were trying to get to the moon: they were future-oriented people.There is a conspicuous absence of people in this series – making for almost postapocalyptic scenesI first came across this particular hot dog joint in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, called the Very Best, in around 2016. I noticed that it had a lovely Vitrolite storefront and a great typographic sign. It had closed the year before, having originally opened in 1921. But then a local took it on, restored it beautifully and reopened it in September 2019. When I passed by again in 2021, the owner was following social distancing guidelines, which is why it was so quiet.I’m often looking to give a sense of time and place to my photos, and one clue is the image of Hall and Oates on the jukebox. Daryl Hall is from Pottstown and John Oates grew up in the same county. The vintage arcade game Centipede was developed byAtariand co-designed by Dona Bailey – one of only a few female game programmers in the industry at the time. It was one of the first arcade games with a significant female player base.I was working on a series that eventually became my bookLunch Poems, in which this image appears. I focused on communal settings, or “third spaces” outside of home and work. We lost those spaces for a period during the pandemic and we all suffered for it in ways we maybe haven’t fully acknowledged yet.The melancholy of an empty American diner – in picturesRead moreThe Very Best was a beloved third space in this town, where you could stop and chat, where everyone was super-friendly. There was at one time a waitress who had worked there for 44 years. But I chose to photograph this business empty. What photographers leave out of the frame often influences the final meaning as much as what we include. There is a conspicuous absence of people in the pictures in this series and that’s a construct, a metaphor for having been kept apart by the pandemic, driven to despair and divided by politics. I wanted to show the separateness and the emptiness. When we look at these pictures we might ask, “What happened here?” or “What will happen next?”The Lunch Poems photographs paint an almost postapocalyptic scene. Not all the pictures in the book were made during the pandemic, but that was the prism through which I began to look at the finished images, and it shaped the editing process.I frame my photographs carefully to explore what I want to communicate. For this series, if a space was crowded, I waited for people to leave. Or I arrived just as it was opening or closing. I do wonder whether that was always responsible, as I’m guessing the business owner doesn’t want their restaurant to be captured as melancholic and empty. But rather than an actual place as it is in reality, I’m photographing anideaI’m thinking about, and that I hope others may understand and reflect upon.Leah Frances’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Alert Bay, British Columbia, Canada.Trained:Self-taught; then an MFA from the Tyler School of Art & Architecture, Philadelphia.Influences:‘For this series,Bruce Wrighton, Birney Imes,William Eggleston.

We know Cohen for her deranged self-consciousness, splaying across the stage, in song and standup, the babbling inner voice of the self-obsessed millennial. How would such a persona process this medical emergency? As an opportunity to advertise their uniqueness, of course! And so Cohen considers her stroke in relation to once being labelled (horror of horrors!) “a normal girl” by a casting director, and as a vindication of a lifetime’s health anxiety. “I wasn’t a hypochondriac,” she trills, “I was a prophet!”Andrew Doherty: Sad Gay Aids Play review – twice the satire from Gay Witch Sex Cult comicRead moreIn a beautifully constructed hour, we’re led from Cohen’s experience of suffering her stroke, via flashbacks to her “migraines with a visual aura” in childhood, to her stint in hospital (“honey, we’re gonna need a gayer nurse!”). With Frazer Hadfield on piano, an array of songs (about her need for “complete control”; about the many foibles for which a stroke might be divine punishment) suggest how Cohen is processing this event emotionally.Not that the spoken parts of Broad Strokes are emotionally guarded. Far from it: Cohen conceals precisely nothing of her attention-seeking inner life, the whole misadventure being rendered in her usual cascade of overshares, sassy asides, and glamorous or goofy voices – none funnier than the sultry femme fatale she becomes when addressing her surgeon Dr Love. Two final songs, meanwhile, both minister to and subvert our expectation that some learning might arise from this odyssey. This is such a rich, perfectly formed show from one of the most can’t-take-your-eyes-off-them acts in comedy.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)FestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its hugely elaborate, joke-packed return sees its star on wonderful formSarah DempsterWed 6 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 19.24 EDTShareHark! ’Tis the peal of baleful bells, for a new semester has befallen Nevermore Academy, and freshly minted celebrity Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) is, naturally, having none of it. “I liked it better when I was feared and hated,” she monotones as a flock of awestruck fellow students scrabbles around her ankles, autograph books a-flap.Alas, her newfound fame is inescapable. “You’re kind of a big deal now after the whole saving the school from the demon pilgrim thing”, “It girl” Bianca (Joy Sunday) explains, as much to the viewer as to Wednesday, who is perhaps too busy administering icily efficient death-stares to her swooning fanbase to fully appreciatethe ramifications of last season’s finale. The demon pilgrim thing? Ah, yes. The demon pilgrim thing. This, you may recall, was the climactic first-series kerfuffle surrounding one Joseph Crackstone, a bloodthirsty 17th-century pilgrim resurrected by dastardly botany teacher/beastmaster Marilyn Thornhill (Christina Ricci). Having already manipulated barista/actual monster Tyler Galpin (Hunter Doohan) into killing a series of pupils, police and local therapists, Thornhill planned on using the reanimated Crackstone to help her snuff out everyone else. Anyway, thanks to Wednesday the evildoers are now either exploded (Crackstone) or banged up (Thornhill and Galpin) and Nevermore, finally, is safe. Let joy – or at least guarded relief – be unconfined.And now? Peace descends and the second series of this most deliciously macabre of smash-hit murder-mystery/high-school comedy dramas – or at least the four episodes available prior to the second half of the series being launched in September – can proceed in orderly fashion. Or not, as the case may be, because – ruh-roh – here comes another baddie! Specifically, here comes the Kansas City Scalper, a serial-killing, doll-collecting professional dog groomer in a velour tracksuit played, with much oleaginous glee, by Haley Joel Osment (ofThe Sixth Sense fame). In a breakneck pre-title sequence, we learn that Wednesday has spent her summer vacation tracking down the Scalper, being tied up by the Scalper, turning the tables on the Scalper, relieving the Scalper of his scalp and, finally, delivering the Scalper to justice. The ultimate significance of all this is moot (certainly the incident is, at least in this first episode, not referred to again) although only a berk would bet against the scalpless sod popping up at a later date and putting everyone off their Weetos.It is, all in all, a veryWednesdayintroduction to the new season of Wednesday. That is; a hugely elaborate and wildly entertaining thing that happens very quickly and at great budgetary expense only to be promptly buried under the demands of a more immediately pressing plot strand. Which is, in this instance, Wednesday’s mystery stalker. Having emerged at the end of the last series, he/she/it has decided that our peerlessly nihilistic heroine must pay for something or other and has begun to leave her a series of increasingly shouty cryptic notes demanding she DO SOMETHING or other ABOUT THIS. Who is this irate foe? And what, precisely, is the nature of his/her/its beef?Further unusualness abounds. A local private investigator is pecked to death by a distinctly murderous murder of crows. Wednesday has horrifying visions of ditzy roommate Enid (Emma Myers)’s imminent demise.Nevermore, meanwhile, has an enthusiastic new principal in theNed Flanders-y form of Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi, complete with statement knitwear and a moustache that follows you around the room). Dort is a Bruce Springsteen fan and is Not To Be Trusted.Also straddling the tantalising first-episode divide between “seems quite nice, actually” and “is almost certainly a shapeshifting necromancer” is wispy new music teacher Isadora Capri (Billie Piper, clearly having a blast).Similar fun is to be had in the return of Catherine Zeta-Jones’s woozy, pillowy Morticia Addams if not in Luis Guzmán’s lumpy, grinning Gomez, whose character, as ever, seems oddly unfinished, as if he’d abandoned rehearsals halfway through, having been distracted, perhaps, by a scotch egg.Minor quibbles aside, the season opener is wonderfully skittish and dense with jokes and plot. Tim Burton’s brisk direction ensures any embryonic wibbles of seriousness or sentimentality are swiftly squished by a shot of a rotting corpse, say, or a scene in which a flotilla of CGI caterpillars assemble themselves, apropos nothing, into the legend “BUG OFF”.In the middle of it all, meanwhile, is Ortega’s Wednesday, whose charisma could power a thousand hearses. Not that she’d appreciate our enthusiasm. “Do not put me on a pedestal,” she warns her besotted schoolmates during her guest of honour speech at the disastrous inaugural Nevermore gala. “The only place I will lead you is off a cliff.”The sensible among us are already preparing our parachutes.Wednesday season two is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsJenna OrtegaTV reviewTelevisionTim BurtonChristina RicciSteve BuscemiWednesdayBillie PiperreviewsShareReuse this content"

This show was I Was Sitting on My Patio This Guy Appeared I Thought I Was Hallucinating. Wilson and the choreographer Lucinda Childs appeared in a Hockneyesque stage picture, unlike anything previously seen in Sloane Square, the home of new British playwriting: a minimalist, austere design of a telephone, a telephone wire and a gauze over the front of the stage with projected images on it.What was it about? This was a question Wilson never countenanced. He created what the New York Times critic Mel Gussow called “a cosmos of the arts”. The enigmatic Wilson, who has died aged 83, claimed that he gave audiences time and space in which to think. What they thought about was none of his concern.View image in fullscreenEinstein on the Beach, Avignon, 1976.Photograph: Philippe Gras/AlamyWith the composerPhilip Glass, his great friend and collaborator, in their first work together, the five-hourEinstein on the Beach(1976) staged at the Avignon festival, and the Met in New York, he expanded his early ideas of plotless tableaux, in a text, with no dialogue, covering nuclear power, space travel and Einstein’s enthusiasm for playing the violin.Wilson’s major extraordinary work, KA MOUNTAIN AND GUARDenia TERRACE, which became a cause celebre in 1972, played for 168 hours, with a cast of hundreds, over seven days on an Iranian mountaintop at the pre-revolutionary Shiraz arts festival, and embraced poetic surrealism, backlit silhouette, community involvement and audience endurance to an unprecedented (and still unsurpassed) degree. It was all about pushing the boundaries of the art form.Wilson’s first company in 1960s New York was formed, lived and worked in his SoHo loft, while his later work emanated from – and was often installed in – the Watermill Center for the arts, founded by Wilson on Long Island.He was an unashamed opponent of Method theatre and Stanislavski naturalism. “To see someone try to act natural on stage,” he told the New York Times in 2021, “seems so artificial. If you accept it as being artificial, in the long run, it seems more natural, for me.”This attitude stemmed from his early life, when he was sent by his parents, Diugiud Mims Wilson, a wealthy lawyer, and Velma Loree (nee Hamilton), to study dance to correct his fierce stammer and lack of self-confidence. The patterns of repetitive statement as defiant argument coloured his life work.Born in Waco, Texas, he went to Waco high school, then the University of Texas at Austin in 1959 to study business administration, and began working at the Austin State Hospital for the Mentally Handicapped, where he helped patients express themselves through art. This was his second major formative experience and, again, influenced all his subsequent work in theatre.He went on to study architecture and interior design at the Pratt Institute in New York, and designed puppets for Jean-Claude van Itallie’s America Hurrah, which played at the Royal Court in 1965 (it was banned by the lord chamberlain for crude satirical remarks about the US president Lyndon Johnson, but was performed for club members).Wilson returned to Texas, where he fell out with his deeply religious parents (he was gay and worked in theatre) and, after a suicide attempt, was institutionalised for six weeks. Back in New York, he supported his writing with teaching.View image in fullscreenMiranda Richardson in Orlando at the Royal Lyceum theatre, Edinburgh, directed by Wilson, 1996.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn 1968, he got involved in an altercation between a police officer and a young black boy, Raymond Andrews, who was deaf and speech-impaired. He went on to defend Andrews in court and, with the agreement of his parents, to adopt him; Andrews was his collaborator on his first silent epic, Deaf Man Glance (1971), which ran for seven hours at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.Two Edinburgh festival visits, serious treats, stick in the memory. In 1993 Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights was a perfect posthumous alliance with Gertrude Stein, a beautiful, marionettish shadow play of quiet misery – funny and surprising – based on Stein’s long forgotten 1938 technological variation on the Faust legend: trance and repetition, an iterating pulse of spare and beauteous incantation, a world of sighs and dreams.And in 1996 Orlando was an exotic melange of light, sound and music, with an unforgettable Miranda Richardson at its sideways-on gestural centre, and text by the American poet and novelist Darryl Pinckney, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s iconic account of a transsexual time-traveller from the court of Elizabeth I to the late 1920s, in the overlapping styles of Ronald Firbank, Algernon Swinburne and Oscar Wilde.Other collaborations included The Black Rider (1990), with Tom Waits,William BurroughsandMarianne Faithfull, which played at the Barbican Centre in 2004; Schubert’s Winterreisse withJessye Normanin 2001; and, with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Willem Dafoe, Daniil Kharms’s The Old Woman, a hypnotic, surreal, clown-like Beckettian scenario, translated by Pinckney, which went to theManchester international festivalin 2013.Among Wilson’s later, chamber-scale forays into the classical repertoire, I most enjoyed his version of Heiner Müller’s Hamletmachine (based on a short 1977 play) at the Almeida in Islington in 1987; and a stunning reappraisal of Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape – Wilson as a shock-haired, white-faced, petrified inhabitant of an archive, not just the tape-recorder – in a terrifying thunderstorm, which visited the first Enniskillen Beckett festivalin 2012, andthe BarbicanCentre in 2015.From 2013, Wilson produced a ream of video portraits of famous performers – Lady Gaga, Brad Pitt, Winona Ryder, Renée Fleming and Alan Cumming – in historic roles. These have been screened in 50 museums and galleries around the world.Wilson never ceased pushing boundaries or conjoining whatPeter Brook, late in life, described as the now defunct avant-garde with the latest in technology and popular culture.He is survived by Andrews, and by his sister, Suzanne.Robert Mims Wilson, director, designer and performer, born 4 October 1941; died 31 July 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatrePerformance artDesignPhilip GlassobituariesShareReuse this content"

What allegations of racist language? Despite firing its hosts, the BBC food show seems to be pretending there is no problem here …Hannah J DaviesWed 6 Aug 2025 09.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 6 Aug 2025 11.52 EDTShareTo say that this year’s MasterChef UK has been an unmitigated calamity for the BBC feels like an understatement. In early July, Gregg Wallace was fired from the show after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, including one accusation of unwanted touching (45 out of 83 claims against himwere upheldfollowing an official report), leaving the BBC with a headache over whether to broadcast the latest series, which was filmed last autumn. It then emerged that the report into Wallace’s behaviour had also highlightedan accusation of racist languageon the part of his co-host of 20 years, John Torode. The BBC swiftly dispensed with him, too, despite him saying that he doesn’t believe the incident happened.The corporation confirmed in late July that it wouldbroadcast the series anyway; one contestant,Sarah Shafi, was so appalled by the decision that she agreed to be edited out. Meanwhile,the broadcasting union Bectusaid: “If [the BBC] are serious about addressing this industry-wide problem, broadcasters should not reward bad behaviour with primetime coverage.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, no advanced screeners were offered to the media; the first three episodes landed unannounced on BBC iPlayer on Wednesday morning, ahead of its 8pm broadcast on BBC One.And so to the programme itself. Would the first episode be full of jarring jump-cuts, introduced to minimise the presence of Torode and Wallace? Would it seem as though the pair had just happened to wander on to the set now and again?It began like any other series of MasterChef, with the narrator,India Fisher, introducing the latest “battle for the ultimate culinary prize” between 60 new contestants, over some characteristically tense music. As in previous series, Wallace and Torode featured prominently in the opening montage, alongside nervous contestants and lingering shots of plates buckling under the weight of jus and garnishes, with Torode saying: “This is the sort of stuff that dreams are made of,” and Wallace describing one dish as “a cracker of a job”.MasterChef contestant edited out after asking for new series not to be broadcastRead moreAs usual, the first challenge was “basic to brilliant”. As usual, Torode and Wallace introduced the conceit (contestants have to zhoosh up a workaday grocery item of their choosing). The duo stood and salivated at the prospect of digital marketing manager Thea’s gorgonzola risotto and recruiter Gon’s take on the Thai dish kaphrao. But there wasn’t as much in the way of witty repartee between the hosts and the contestants, unlike the previous series, which opened with one participant declaring that they “[couldn’t] wait to meet John and Gregg and hoping that Wallace would give their dish a “phwoar” of approval.Nonetheless, both were definitely, firmly hosting the show. Wallace was limited to asking questions rather than offering up punchlines, but he delivered his usual gushing critiques. Speaking of business development manager Gemma’s mackerel-heavy take on the Malaysian national dish, nasi lemak, he said: “I could dip bread in this all day.” Torode quibbled over whether vocal coach Beth’s chocolate and orange ganache tart was, in fact, merely a chocolate tart. Overall, very much business as usual.Gon and Shaun, a digital marketing manager, received the first aprons and progressed to the next round. Then it was on to the mystery box challenge, with the amateur cooks charged with fashioning a dish from any or all of trout, beetroot and chocolate. As always, there was some light chat from Torode and Wallace about the sort of mistakes the contestants might make, with comments that seemed far from truncated. “We have a trout-off!” declared Torode as four contestants reached for the fish. Wallace quizzed writer Penelope about her skills with invention and asked whether her couscous was likely to turn into porridge.The critiques were largely effusive, even if Torode did have to console an overwhelmed Thea with the words: “It’s a big thing, isn’t itMasterChef?” Those words would take on a greater meaning in the months after filming. Thea was booted off alongside Gemma, with Penelope and Beth bagging the next two aprons.In the final round, the four remaining contenders cooked for the 2024 champion, Brin Pirathapan, and the finalists Chris Willoughby and Louise Lyons Macleod. As the hosts fawned over Gon’s Thai-influenced steak tartare and risotto and Shaun’s scissor-cut noodles, it was just like old times.Pirathapan, Willoughby and Lyons Macleod took centre stage as the food started to appear, but not in a way that seemed out of the ordinary for the show’s guest judges. Still, their presence was surely a boon to Banijay, the producer of the show, which could give over a huge chunk of the episode’s final 20 minutes to their discussions about what makes a good tartare and whether fish and apples should ever be on the same plate.But there was still much time given over to Wallace and Torode, speaking with their mouths half-full, raving over a chicken dish that Wallace said he could have eaten by the kilo. By the time the names of the three contestants advancing to the next stage of the competition were announced over a bed of uplifting plinky-plonk music, it was easy to forget that there had ever been a national controversy.It was always going to be a challenge to be faithful to the series while also editing out the two people at the centre of it, but if episode one is anything to go by, it seems the BBC and Banijay have decided essentially to ignore the problem and hope that putting out more or less the same show as ever will suffice. Maybe further chopping the contributions of Wallace and Torode would have felt ludicrous, but it might also have been the right thing to do. Instead, the BBC is getting to have its chocolate ganache tart and eat it. Still, you imagine the ratings will be astronomical. Phwoar indeed.This article was amended on 6 August 2025 to clarify the circumstances in which Sarah Shafi was edited out of the MasterChef series.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefTelevisionGregg WallaceFood TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You have licence in an otherwise extremely hierarchical society to just express yourself.”This is something the 41-year-old Pakistani-American singer, songwriter and composer hopes to create himself. Though he’s also a writer – be that his acclaimed 2009 novel, The Wish Maker, or contributions to publications such as the New Yorker – music became somewhere Sethi could be accepted, especially as a queer person growing up in Lahore. “I think music has this shamanic function in south Asian culture,” he says, “where things you cannot say in lay language you say in the love language of music.”Sethi’s stratospheric, shiver-inducing voice dissolves cultural divides. Take Intiha, his sublime 2023 experimental album of Sufi poetry with Chilean-American musician Nicolás Jaar, or 2022’s Pasoori, a bombastic raga-meets-reggaeton track which has surpassed a billion streams on YouTube Music, making it easily the biggest song to come out of Pakistan this century. When we speak, Sethi is about to release his debut solo album, Love Language, which builds on Pasoori’s thundering, Technicolor global pop. Working with producers like Brockhampton’s Romil Hemnani and Colombian musician Juan Ariza, it’s exuberant and almost oversaturated, flecked with 00s R&B, Bollywood, drill rap, slinky flamenco, even a skit on the children’s game “akkad bakkad”, all of it underlined with hallmarks of north Indian classical.View image in fullscreen‘The appropriate response is to troll them back’ … Sethi.Photograph: Fujio EmuraNot everyone is pleased. Sethi trained under two of the greats of classical music, Ustad Saami and Farida Khanum, and his initial career was in that more traditional world; some fans yearn for “the old Ali Sethi”. Though he’s adamant about using south Asian ragas rather than western chord progressions to inform the melodies for his songs, Sethi recounts how even the esteemed Ustad Saami asked him whether his music lately is fusion or, simply, confusion. “But I think in today’s completely monstrous world, what could be a better reflection than confusion?” Sethi laughs.The work of Pakistani musicians, including Sethi, has been banned and removed from streaming services in India, where fans are forced to access the music via VPN due to escalating tensions between both countries. “If you’re looking at it from the point of view of ideologues, music is the one thing that has kept the populations of India and Pakistan deeply connected to one another,” he says. “Every time the walls go up, the borders get re-erected but some song slips past, and there’s an instant [release of] fellow feeling … this unspoken connection.”The brief outbreak of conflict between the two nations earlier this year has worsened the cultural divide. The opening track on Sethi’s album was initially a duet with a well-known Bollywood singer, but a film industry body threatened that any Indian artist collaborating with a Pakistani artist would be blacklisted. The song is now censored, cut through with screams and distorted industrial textures. Sethi has also been unable to get a visa to enter India in nearly a decade. “Ever since I started releasing music, my biggest audience has been in India, and it’s the one place I’ve not been able to go,” he says.Ever since I started releasing music, my biggest audience has been in India, and it’s the one place I’ve not been able to goHe wryly notes that the themes of “forbidden love” he explores in his music are “already in place” thanks to the travel ban. Inspired by Pakistani revolutionary poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Sethi’s lyrics read like love songs, but they’re layered with double-meanings about ethno-nationalism, Islamophobia, war, queerness and exile. On Bridegroom, he subverts a 13th-century qawwali sometimes sung at weddings, his untethered, gliding voice delivering coy lyrics that translate to “don’t ask about my husband”. This follows “pretty rigorously orchestrated fake news” two years ago, falsely claiming Sethi and his partner, the Pakistani painter Salman Toor, had breached local law and married.He didn’t know how to react, until the answer came in the form of this song. “I realised the appropriate response is to troll them back with what they think of as semi-sacred music, saying, ‘I refuse to give up my traditions.’”Sethi may laugh in defiance, but his words are tinged with sadness. “These last few years have been a whirlwind, not always in the nicest ways,” he says. “There’s a lot of angst and despair, a lot of ruing the loss of a milieu, the loss of home – but also revelling in new homes, temporary shelters, finding community with other musicians in places like Los Angeles, London and New York.”View image in fullscreenThe cover artwork for Love LanguageHe says the success of NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is revitalising; the way he “squares that distance between all these different communities.” Love Language, then, is Sethi’s attempt at the same: a “diary of displacement” with the accompanying tour set to be “a variety show for the end times”. Mainly, he wants the music to be a refuge, and to capture his and his audience’s multiplicities.“I’m hoping it comes across as a work of synthesis rather than a work of assimilation,” Sethi says of his album, an attempt to make hybrid music without “simplifying or diluting” any of its constituent parts. “I feel equally rooted in Punjabi bhangra and hyperpop, equally conversant with queer club anthems and Sufi poetry; and, actually, I see all these connections all the time, because they dwell within me.”Love Language is out now on Zubberdust Media/The OrchardExplore more on these topicsMusicPakistanSouth and central AsiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

We expect another genre spoof from an act with an adroit ear for send-up. But that’s not what we get – because the show doesn’t just send up sad gay Aids plays (such as they are), it tilts at Arts Council England funding as well.The conceit is that Doherty wants to make a trashy comedy about reality TV, but ACE won’t fund it. If he wants their cash (and he needs it, because moneyed mum and dad have withdrawn their subsidy) he has to make something grittier, burlesquing his own marginal identity and exaggerating any personal trauma he may (or may not) have suffered. Hence the sub-Angels in Americadrama he’s now workshopping for us, and keeps adjusting according to live feedback from his ACE paymasters.There’s no denying that the voguish vicissitudes of arts funding – and its bias against comedy – are ripe for mockery. But Doherty’s satanic ACE caricature misses the mark here. It also obliges our host to play himself, a hapless supplicant performer, rather than the self-congratulatory alter ego that so amused audiences last year, and at the start of this show.There’s still plenty to enjoy in his play within a play, which rehashes gay life in the early 1980s. We see protagonist Harry Manlove, spurned by his homophobic mum, form a found family with friends including Freddie Mercury. It is, briefly, a carefree time – until Harry develops a cough, and starts wondering about “that last batch of semen I just took”. Doherty is a fantastic performer, and the comedy is potent in this mismatch of solemn subject matter with egotistical and ignorant actor/host. But when Doherty steers us away from that, towards his more effortful satire at ACE’s expense, the delight slightly dissipates.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Playing the psychedelic theatre troupe made up of hippies and drag queens, these eight performers are magnetic, conjuring up a cabaret wildness between them.They sing, dance and sashay out from beyond a red curtain in outre outfits.Allen and Adcock’s costumes are stone cold fabulous: a storm of fishnets, feathers, kooky dresses, long socks and bodices. There are Sgt Pepper jackets twinned with ballerina tutus and a dazzle of sequins. The choreography by Paul McGill is cheeky, quirky, cute. It is all so imaginative, and winning.The one – significant – setback is that there is just not enough to Rae Binstock’s skimpy book. The Cockettes get together, make it big in San Francisco and are booked for New York, but their opening night is a flop, so they go back home.You get a sense of what this LSD-taking troupe stands for and that they become their own chosen family. But there is no filling in of the details so you do not learn much about their avant-gardism, and that they endeavoured to put their lifestyle on stage.There is a central tension between Hibiscus (Andrew Horton, whose song, A Crab on Uranus, is a highlight) and Sylvester (Gregory Haney, just as good with his song, There’s a Lady on the Stage). The former refuses to go to New York but this fallout is not carried through. Hibiscus merely makes a return by the end of the play when all is well again.View image in fullscreenCharacterful … Baylie Carson as Sweet Pam in Midnight at the Palace.Photograph: Damian RobertsonThe bigger political anxieties of the time waver in the background via “read all about it” news-stand summaries, from the Vietnam war to the assassination of Martin Luther King, race riots and National Guard violence against protesting students. It’s broad-brush and, at times, the sense of anarchy on stage trips over into confusion. Under the direction of McGill, it is not always immediately clear what is going on. This is not helped by a sound system that seems to over-amplify voices so that lyrics are occasionally hard to discern. The singing is still sparky, with Baylie Carson, who plays Sweet Pam, especially characterful.We hang on for Brandon James Gwinn’s songs as well as the dance and glitter of the performances. And despite the dearth of story, there is such zest and infectious joy to the show that it enlivens you, mayhem and all.AtBig Yin at Gilded Balloon Patter House, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatreDragreviewsShareReuse this content"

Smith’s follow-up show mirrors Gilbert in a different way, by addressing an issue the Welshman became associated with in standup and documentary: infertility. Foot Spa Half Empty is about Smith’s low sperm count, discovered as he and his partner start trying for a child. It arranges a suite of humiliating stories and manic overthinking comedy around the more substantial tale of our host’s visit to a clinic to have his sperm tested – in Smith’s hands, it’s as surefire an anecdote for self-abasing standup as it’s possible to imagine.Give or take a weak ending, it’s a killer stage return from a man now increasingly recognisable from your TV screens. Not that fame has gone to his head; Google (“people also search for Robert Mugabe”) has seen to that. He did briefly worry that success might defang a comic style rooted in anxiety and failure. But lo, big-time Smith still sweats the small stuff, and very funnily. See his section about being mocked for being a poor skier, another deconstructing the phrase “wrong place, wrong time”, and a memorable set piece about a gull with a steak knife in its beak harassing punters in a beer garden.These are big-impact routines, all the funnier for their tone of voice, which combines a relish for the absurd, an inability to let things go and an adhesive relationship with indignity. All come into play as the 36-year-old relates his fertility journey, which finds him buying a magic spell from Amazon (“And if that worked, I’m scared of that baby …”), roadtesting old wives’ tales, and pontificating on the milestones that signal we’re getting old – which include, in Smith’s case, a father-son tutorial in extra-strong mints.You can bet that phrase “extra strong” gets a workout from Smith: not a man to leave a casual figure of speech un-interrogated. It may be wearisome to possess, but Smith’s worrisome personality is catnip for comedy lovers. With him at the mic, laughs, at least, go forth and multiply.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsComedy (Culture)Rhod GilbertreviewsShareReuse this content"

Andreas Constantinou sits in an armchair, naked, silently listening. He has told us that, during the Covid pandemic, his father died and so did his mother five weeks later. He recorded conversations with them and these are played in sometimes repetitive ways, caught between the fuzz of radio tuning.You do not get a sense of Constaninou’s mother but his father’s voice is key. He speaks of his “disappointment” over his son’s sexuality, of wanting him to be a real man and of his dismay when Constantinou, as a child, started to play with dolls.The voices pour out of a TV set, radio and gramophone on stage: they serve as the equipment for this medium-like encounter, the words of the dead for ever living in the air and looping inside Constantinou’s head. His recorded voice tells us anecdotally of other gay men he has asked about their difficult relationships with their fathers.It is a deeply personal and experimental show, evolving slowly and going nowhere particularly. Constantinou includes recorded exchanges with a therapist, and there does seem to be an intimate, therapeutic element to it.But there is beauty and artfulness too: the set is suffused in washes of colour. Giant screens feature a wrestling match between two men that leaves the ring for ocean waves and meadows. They are arresting images, the bodies of the men filmed close up, the aggression in their fight slowly giving way to something more gentle, balletic and erotic.There are moments in the father’s homophobia that leave you breathless for this son. The ending speaks of acceptance and feels too tidy, but it does make the point that there is a choice to reject or accept on both sides – for son as well as father, even posthumously.AtPentland theatre, Pleasance at EICC, Edinburgh, until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

The radio announcer who appears in our living room; the movie star we see on a screen; the relative’s voice we hear on a phone: they all mix up our sense of the real and the imagined.So it is with artificial intelligence. A poem generated instantly by ChatGPT feels as magical to us – and as magically wrong – as the first printed books must have done to an illiterate population, unschooled in mystical Latin. How to account for something that communicates like a human being, yet is not physically present?It is an uncertainty that haunts the AI-themed plays on this year’s Edinburgh fringe. It also accounts for their apocalyptic mood. Do we even have a future, they all seem to ask, or are we bequeathing it to the machines?View image in fullscreenA kind of female Hamlet … Alfrun Rose’s Dead Air is more about processing grief than the limits of digital technology.TakeDead Air, in which playwright Alfrun Rose stars as Alfie, a kind of female Hamlet. Like Shakespeare’s vacillating hero, she communes with her dead father and grows furious with her mother for hooking up with a new man, John, an old boyfriend. As Alfie sees it, John is in line to become her stepfather with unseemly haste.The difference with Hamlet is that her dad is no ghost but an AI simulacrum, powered by a service called AiR.For as long as she pays the subscription (no easy feat), Alfie can hang on to her dead dad and hang on, too, to her sense of survivor’s guilt and unfinished business. The online service, with its chirpy operatives and Stayin’ Alive hold music, supplies her with a nearly-but-not-quite reproduction of the real man. If something feels off, she can switch the temperature controls to turn him from mechanical to fanciful. Whether he is a comforting replacement or a cynical means of data mining is a moot point.The question Rose raises in an absorbing storytelling show is less about the limits of digital technology and more about processing grief. Alfie’s fury with her mother and rage about John is little to do with them (they seem as perplexed by her outbursts as Gertrude and Claudius are by Hamlet’s) and a lot to do with her miscarriages. Conflating the death of her father with the loss of her children, she is frozen into inaction. Having a virtual father only prolongs her inertia. Whatever this AI father is, however lifelike, he can never be the real thing.The AI chatbot played by Elisabeth Gunawan inStampin’ in the Graveyardalso purports to have our interests at heart. She is there, she explains, authentically stiff-jointed, to ease our transition to the end of the world. Her name is Rose and if she starts hallucinating, as AI is wont to do, a rose graphic flashes up on screen.Through an interface that is all glitches, network errors and messages saying “Not applicable is not applicable at this time”, she polls the audience to guide her through optional storylines. Each show plays out with a different combination of scenes in a tech-savvy production co-created with movement director Matej Matejka for Kiss Witness.Hard to say what the story adds up to – it is a catastrophic tale that begins with a couple seeking marriage guidance from a vending machine and ends with forced separations and closed airports – but it is fascinatingly done with the audience tuning in on headphones and Gunawan playing a steampunk synth-accordion hybrid created from recycled electronics. If this is the future, we are in for a world of computer errors and digital indifference, a hostile place for our messy human interactions.View image in fullscreenFreakily realistic … AI: The Waiting Room – An Audiovisual Journey at Studio at C Arts, EdinburghPhotograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianTackling the technology even more directly, New York’s Angry Fish Theater and the Ally Artists Group use AI to generate a bespoke script for each spectator. Before the start ofAI: The Waiting Room – An Audiovisual Journey, you fill in a questionnaire, truthfully or otherwise, about your ambitions, loved ones and legacy. By the time you are in the theatre, there is a custom-built story ready to play out in your headphones, delivered by a freakily realistic voice.The sections unique to you are folded into a bigger tale, experienced by everyone, about societal breakdown and hi-tech rejuvenation. Nobody else will ever hear my yarn about a sugary moon, a bag of gold and 61 statues. This is a good thing, much as I enjoyed the novelty of hearing a romantic story about me and the family cat.All this takes place as we move freely around a studio, watching a monochrome animation (perhaps also artificially generated) and following instructions intended to make us play characters in our stories. These demands for audience participation seem forced – especially a misjudged prompt to “dance party?” – but it is a quirkily intriguing attempt to be humanly creative with this inhuman technology.Dead Air is atPleasance Courtyarduntil 24 August.

Radu Jude, Aki Kaurismäki, Miguel Gomes, Sarah Friedland, Joshua Oppenheimer and Cherien Dabis were among the first to sign the letter, first published byVarietyon 30 July. More followed, including the Israeli directors Ari Folman (Waltz with Bashir) and Nadav Lapid (Synonyms, Ahed’s Knee); Amalia Ulman, whose second featureMagic Farmwas released by Mubi earlier this year; and Alex Russell, whose debut featureLurkerwas acquired by Mubi out of Sundance for release later this month.The backlash stems from an announcement in May thatMubi– which recently went on a buying spree at the Cannes film festival, acquiring the rights to Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson movie Die My Love – had secured $100m in funding from Sequoia Capital.The Silicon Valley-based investment firm has poured money into a range of companies, from Apple to Google to Cisco, but Mubi marked a rare foray into entertainment. At issue is its investment in and continued ties to Kela, a defense tech firm founded by four veterans of the Israeli military in July 2024, more than six months after Israel’s invasion of Gaza, which has killed more than 60,000 people and led to humanitarian catastrophe.Kela is currently developing a battlefield operating system enabling militaries to integrateAIwith commercial technology. According to Sequoia’s website, it led Kela’s $10m seed funding last year. This spring, Kela secured an additional $60m in a funding round led by Sequoia, Lux Capital and In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the CIA.View image in fullscreenDemi Moore in The Substance.Photograph: AP“Mubi’s financial growth as a company is now explicitly tied to the genocide in Gaza, which implicates all of us that work with Mubi,” the letter reads. “We too believe that cinema can be powerful. And we know that we can’t always control how audiences will respond to our work, and whether or not it will move and inspire them. But we can control how our work reflects our values and commitments – ones that are wholly ignored when our work is brought into alliance with a genocide-profiteering private equity firm.”It continued: “We don’t believe an arthouse film platform can meaningfully support a global community of cinephiles while also partnering with a company invested in murdering Palestinian artists and film-makers.”Mubi has yet to respond publicly to the letter. In the wake of social media backlash over its ties to Sequoia, a message on the company’s social media channels said the rationale for the investment was to “accelerate our mission of delivering bold and visionary films to global audiences”, and that the venture firm had a “50-plus year history of partnering with founders to help turn their ideas into world-changing businesses”.“Over the last several days, some members of our community have commented on the decision to work with Sequoia given their investment in Israeli companies and the personal opinions expressed by one of their partners,” it said. “The beliefs of individual investors do not reflect the views of Mubi.”Signatories of the letter called on Mubi to take the three steps demanded by Film Workers for Palestine, an international collective that claims to represent more than 9,000 industry workers: publicly condemn Sequoia Capital for “genocide profiteering”; remove Sequoia partner Andrew Reed from Mubi’s board of directors; and instate an ethical policy for all future Mubi investments. The signatories also called on Mubi to respect guidelines on programming and partnerships set by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel).The letter follows international backlash to Mubi’s ties to Sequoia, with multiple venues and programming partners around the world announcing the end of their partnerships or the cancellation of events. Glasgow’s Centre for Contemporary Arts, Mexico City’s Cineteca Nacional and the Cinemateca de Bogotá all pulled out of Mubi Fest, a multi-continent film festival initially planned to take place in 12 cities. Last week, the Valdivia film festival in Chile said it would not screen any film distributed by Mubi, with the festival director attributing that decision to funding from Sequoia.“We realized that Mubi has truly voided the position it once held as a bastion for independent creatives and audiences in the industry,” the organization Girls in Film said of their decision to end a seven-year programming partnership with Mubi. “Mubi as a company has considered the trade-off between commercial growth and the livelihoods of the marginalized and downtrodden, and chosen growth.”Additionally, the film-maker Eddie Huang said in an Instagrampostthat Mubi had “shelved” his documentary, Vice Is Broke, after he spoke out against the Sequoia investment. The director claimed that Mubi wanted to make an “example” out of him after he protested about its ties to the destruction of Gaza and decided to sit out Mubi’s promotion of his film. In response, a Mubi spokesmansaidthat the film was not shelved, and that the company was in “constructive discussions” with Huang on its release.The backlash comes as the situation in Gaza haspassed several milestones, with many Palestinians facing mass starvation. Last week, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a panel of experts from the UN and other aid organizations, confirmed that “the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” due to Israel’s continuedsevere restrictions on aid, leading to “catastrophic human suffering”.The Guardian has reached out to Mubi for comment.Explore more on these topicsMubiIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC website was highlighting the show under the category of “new and trending”.Nandy told BBC Breakfast: “It’s absolutely not for me, as the culture secretary and a member of the government, to tell broadcasters what they can and can’t broadcast.”Asked what she thought as a viewer, she said: “As a viewer, I won’t be watching it.”She added: “I’ve watchedMasterChefon and off over the years, but I certainly won’t be watching this series.”Its hosts,Gregg Wallaceand John Torode, were sacked last month after a report into conduct on the show upheld allegations against them.A report into Wallace substantiated 45 allegations made against the former BBC presenter, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. An allegation that Torode had used a severely offensive racist slur was upheld.Last month, theGuardian reportedthat Sarah Shafi, one of the contestants in the latest series, had been edited out after she objected to it being broadcast because of the sustained allegations made against Wallace and TorodeIn other comments about the BBC, Nandy repeated her call for the broadcaster to “get a grip” after rows over thelivestreamed Glastonbury performancefrom the punk rap duo Bob Vylan and the documentary that featured the son of a Hamas official.Pressure from Nandy has resulted in Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, having toinsist he is still the right personto lead the corporation, after a succession of controversies that have led the culture secretary to accuse him of overseeing a “series of catastrophic failures”Asked on BBC’s Today programme on Wednesday morning whether she wanted to express confidence in Davie, Nandy replied: “Let me be really clear about this because there has been a lot of reporting around what I have or haven’t said about Tim Davie in particular.”“It is not my role to determine who works for the BBC. That is a matter for the board. That is set out in the charter. That is part of the independence of the BBC and that is really important.”Pressed on whether she had pulled back from her previous criticism, she said: “I absolutely believe that the BBC board has to get a grip on the very many failures which they have said to me themselves … the chairman of the board described them to me a catastrophic failings and he was right.”“When it comes the Gaza documentary and the errors that were made around that, the lack of due diligence,” she added, referring to a BBC documentary about children in Gaza, which was found to havebreached the corporation’s editorial guidelinesfor accuracy by failing to disclose that its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.“When it comes to the decision to livestream an act at Glastonbury that was flagged already very high risk and to broadcast antisemitic death chants to the nation for several minutes on a Saturday afternoon – yes, these are catastrophic failures.”Explore more on these topicsMasterChefLisa NandyBBCGregg WallaceTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

I am well!”Local media had reported that Coppola, 86, was admitted to Policlinico Tor Vergata, a public hospital, on Tuesday morning for an operation related to heart issues that had long been scheduled, but had experienced a mild cardiac arrhythmia before the operation and doctors had placed him under observation.However his representative specifically disputed these reports as “not true.”Francis Ford Coppola unveils Megalopolis graphic novelRead more“There was not an emergency. He went to the hospital in a car,” the US representative said.The Oscar winner is a frequent visitor toItaly, and in mid-July attended the Magna Graecia film festival in the southern Italian region of Calabria to present his latest film, Megalopolis. He had also been spending time scouting for locations in Italy for a new production due to begin filming in the autumn, Ansa reported.On Friday, Coppola completed a six-city US tour to promote Megalopolis, according to Hollywood Reporter. It is unclear when he returned to Italy.Speaking to the audience at the film festival in Calabria, Coppola, the winner of five Oscars, said: “Young people say the world is a disaster, but I reply that there is no problem man can’t solve.”Megalopolis, his sci-fi epic starring Adam Driver, cost $120m that was largely funded through the sale of his vineyards. But reviews have been mixed, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw calling it a “bloated, boring and bafflingly shallow film”.Coppola, however, appeared to have no regrets about his passion project. He said: “There are many people, when they die, they say: ‘Oh, I wish I had done this, I wish I had done that’. But when I die, I’m going to say: ‘I’ve got to do this and I’ve got to see my daughter win an Oscar and I’ve got to make wine and I’ve got to make every movie I wanted to make.”The director, whose wife, Eleanor, died in April last year, added: “And I’m going to be so busy thinking of all the things that I’ve got to do that when I die, I won’t notice it.”With ReutersExplore more on these topicsFrancis Ford  CoppolaItalyThe GodfathernewsShareReuse this content"

Or, rather, an equalisation: a much-needed rebalancing after 150 years during which, we were told, everything was driven by males strutting, brawling and shagging, with females just along for the ride. This reckoning has finally arrived at language.The origins of our species’ exceptional communication skills constitutes one of the more nebulous zones of the larger evolutionary narrative, because many of the bits of the human anatomy that allow us to communicate – notably the brain and the vocal tract – are soft and don’t fossilise. The linguistic societies of Paris and London even banned talk of evolution around 1870, and the subject only made a timid comeback about a century later. Plenty of theories have been tossed into the evidentiary void since then, mainly by men, but now evolutionary biologist Madeleine Beekman, of the University of Sydney, has turned her female gaze on the problem.Her theory, which she describes as having been hiding in plain sight, is compelling: language evolved in parallel with caring for our “underbaked” newborns, because looking after a creature as helpless as a human baby on the danger-filled plains of Africa required more than one pair of hands (and feet). It needed a group among whom the tasks of food-gathering, childcare and defence could be divided. A group means social life, which means communication.The evidence to support Beekman’s theory isn’t entirely lacking, though a lot of it is, necessarily, circumstantial. We know that the compromise that natural selection hit upon to balance the competing anatomical demands of bipedalism and an ever-expanding brain was to have babies come out early – before that brain and its bony casing were fully formed.One of the discoveries of the newly feminised wave of evolutionary science has been that alloparents – individuals other than the biological parents who contribute parenting services – played a critical role in ensuring the survival of those half-cooked human children. Another is that stone age women hunted alongside men. In the past it was assumed that hunting bands were exclusively male, and one theory held that language arose to allow them to cooperate. But childcare was another chore that called for cooperation, probably also between genders, and over years, not just hours or days.Luckily, the reconfiguration of the head and neck required to accommodate the ballooning brain had a side-effect of remoulding the throat, giving our ancestors more precise control over their utterances. With the capacity to generate a large range of sounds came the ability to convey a large range of meanings. To begin with, this was useful for coordinating childcare, but as speech became more sophisticated, alloparents – particularly grandmothers – used it to transmit their accumulated knowledge, thereby nurturing infants who were even better equipped to survive. The result of this positive feedback loop wasHomo sapiens, the sole survivor of a once diverse lineage.Alas, Beekman takes a very long time to get to this exciting idea. She spends about half the book laying the groundwork, padding it out with superfluous vignettes as if she is worried the centre won’t hold. Once she gets there, she makes some thought-provoking observations. Full-blown language probably emerged about 100,000 years ago, she thinks, but only in our line – not in those of our closest relatives. “We may have made babies with Neanderthals and Denisovans,” she writes, “but I don’t think we had much to talk about.”And whereas others have argued that language must have predatedHomo sapiens, because without it the older speciesHomoerectuscouldn’t have crossed the forbidding Wallace Line – the deep-water channel that separates Asia and Australasia – she draws on her deep knowledge of social insects to show that communication as relatively unsophisticated as that of bees or ants could have done the job.Having made a persuasive case for the role of alloparents in the evolution of language, Beekman concludes that we did ourselves a disservice when we shrank our basic unit of organisation down from the extended to the nuclear family. Maybe, but historians including Peter Laslett have dated this important shift to the middle ages, long before the Industrial Revolution where she places it, and the damage isn’t obvious yet. Language is still being soaked up by young children; it’s still a vehicle for intergenerational learning. It may take a village to raise a child, but as Beekman herself hints, a village can be constituted in different ways.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That movie’s reputation has only grown over the years – it’s basically the thinking and anxious person’s Independence Day – but the Wells text has been revisited repeatedly since its publication at the tail end of the 19th century. 2025 seems as good a time as any for another update. And if ever any viewers yearned to see a new War of the Worlds beset with the constant pinging of a Microsoft Teams chat, Prime Video has a real treat in store.How KPop Demon Hunters became the surprise Netflix smash of the summerRead moreYes, hovering towards the top of Prime Video’s movie charts is a new War of the Worlds, which arrived with little fanfare on the service at the end of July. In it,Ice Cubeplays Will Radford, a Department of Homeland Security official who monitors an array of feeds for terrorist threats. Despite a belated heads-up from his Nasa pal Dr Sandra Salas (Eva Longoria), he (somewhat bafflingly) fails to pay much mind to a series of mysterious gathering storms, until it’s too late: meteor strikes occur worldwide, and from the meteors emerge alien tripods that quickly lay waste to buildings and people everywhere. Will has been distracted by the hunt for a hacker called “Disruptor”, as well as by spying on his grown-ish kids Faith (Iman Benson), who is expecting her first child, and Dave (Henry Hunter Hall), a gamer Will thinks is wasting his life.In a novelty that turns into a hindrance almost immediately, most of this unfolds on Will’s computer screen at his mostly empty office, where he’s working what’s described as a “graveyard” shift despite it being, you know, daytime. Actually, it’s more accurate to say that it unfolds near Will’s computer screen. Unlike past “screenlife” movies like Unfriended, War of the Worlds is not exactly rigorous about adhering to its self-imposed limitations. Though Will’s face is often display on screen as part of various video calls (which is how Unfriended and others have worked actors’ faces into a screen-only framework), the movie also flat-out cuts away to traditional shots of Will that are framed vaguely like a Zoom call but clearly take place outside of Will’s computer. This makes sense. After all, when you’ve got an actor as expressive as Ice Cube, you want unmotivated closeups that can capture every single cocked-eyebrow scowl. How will the audience know how to feel if they can’t see Ice Cube scowling at his computer screen?That’s probably not fair to Cube, who has been quite good in plenty of other movies. The man has presence. What he does not have is the kind of subtlety or emotional range that benefits from de facto solo occupation of the screen. Really, every actor in War of the Worlds feels like they’re performing in a Zoom-style vacuum – and seemingly not as a commentary on the coldly disconnected world of digital communication. In fact, quite the opposite: in this movie, everyone video-calls everyone all the time, to better show off some of the worst visual effects ever seen in a movie bearing theUniversal Pictureslogo out front. No amount of handheld phone-camera or grainy news footage can disguise how terrible the alien ships look. They wouldn’t pass muster on a whimsical Snickers ad.So how did this happen? How did this D-grade reimagining of a public-domain property wind up going from major studio to major streaming service to the top of the charts?It should have been a fortuitous confluence of events. Film-maker Timur Bekmambetov remains high on the screenlife format, a variation on found footage, where stories are told entirely through activity on device screens. He’s produced several successful film series based on that tech: the aforementioned horror film Unfriended and its sequel, and a pair of less bloody companion thrillers, Searching and Missing. All of these movies make innovative use of their central gimmick, and War of the Worlds came out as a pandemic-inspired variation. It was announced in the fall of 2020 as a spectacle-driven sci-fi movie that could nonetheless unfold in a series of contained environments, with actors all filming their parts separately.So the reason War of the Worlds feels not just like eavesdropping on a Zoom call but like a movie pieced together through Zoom is that it more or less was. More technology was involved, but that’s barely clear from the final product, which has the rushed jankiness of something that should have come out a month or two after filming and been marketed as a quickie experiment. Instead, the movie seems to have sat on a shelf for literally years before it was sold off to a streaming service. Weirdly, it’s not the only 2020-shot Universal-produced sci-fi movie to get that treatment:Long Distance, a space survival movie starring Anthony Ramos, recently debuted on Hulu despite filming wrapping before the end of 2020. Even a lengthy post-production would mean that it spent three years on the shelf, and couldn’t even rate a release in the aftermath of the 2023 strikes. (Long Distance looks and acts more like a real movie compared with War of the Worlds. This is also true of many network TV shows and some big-budget ads.)The simplest answer to why the hell these movies have remained in limbo, then, seems to be Covid-era buyer’s remorse. Studios were panicking about how to keep their pipelines moving during an unprecedented disruption, and didn’t wind up having room on the release schedule for these smaller projects. The real question is how audiences have made it through an unconvincing cheapie like War of the Worlds – a sci-fi epic that seems to take place in real time yet features a vast and coordinated worldwide mobilization of multiple armed forces – without shutting it off in disgust (it boasts a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes).Maybe they haven’t. Streaming viewership is notoriously sketchy to measure, and most services rely on total minutes watched, which means watching five minutes of an awful movie and then flipping to something else can add to its total. War of the Worlds seems to have been made for its Covid-era convenience, and cynically capitalizes on surveillance paranoia and government secrets without actually saying anything coherent about, well, anything. But Amazon – which figures into the plot so embarrassingly that it seems like a plea for a Prime Video pick-up – stumbled upon the perfect streaming product: a cheap piece of junk with a recognizable title and stars, just enough for millions of people to hit play. Maybe some of them even watched through the end; the movie certainly doesn’t compete with second-screen phone-scrolling, in the sense that your scroll is likely to eventually hit upon something vastly better than the movie’s own toggling between chat windows. Amazon has plenty of experience helping consumers find junk, so War of the Worlds wound up in a fitting home – at least until Temu starts its own streaming service.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction and fantasy filmsIce CubeUniversal PicturesHG WellsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was part of the plan, a teasing trailer that only told a small part of the story and a swaggering title that promised something grander than we could initially see, and that might be why I found the reaction to be a little alienating. It was showered with euphoric praise upon release and first-time writer-director Zach Cregger, whose background is in comedy, was immediately heralded as a new king of the genre. For me, it was more trick than treat, a sizzle reel that showed Cregger to be a film-maker of considerable skill but also one who papered over the cracks of an exasperatingly illogical and uninspired script with flashy gimmickry.Freakier Friday review – puppyishly uninhibited Jamie Lee Curtis saves body-swap sequelRead moreThere’s been an inevitable shift in the hype machine for Cregger’s follow-up, the bigger, bolder and, thankfully, better Weapons, buzz that began when his spec script caused a talk-of-the-town auction months after Barbarian overperformed. Industry rumourssuggestedthat Jordan Peele was so determined to land the project that when his company lost out to New Line, he parted ways with his management. There’s since been over two years of anticipation – Cregger comparing the project to Magnolia, stars such as Julia Garner and Josh Brolin signing up, an all-out assault of a marketing campaign – and so second time around, it’s virtually impossible not to see this one coming. Credit to the Warner Bros marketing team for still holding something back though, the jolting string of trailers highlighting enough of the standard WTF imagery without really revealing all that much beyond the striking premise.Seventeen children from the same class are missing. They all got out of bed at 2.17am and ran off into the darkness. The police are baffled and the parents are furious, aiming their anger at teacher Ms Grady (Julia Garner). She’s one of many alternating viewpoints, which also include a parent (Josh Brolin), a cop (Alden Ehrenreich), a small-time criminal (Austin Abrams) and the one kid who didn’t run away (Cary Christopher), slowly building a picture of what really happened that night.It’s a tantalising set-up, pitched somewhere between Stephen King and the Brothers Grimm, and Cregger’s careful slow build keeps us in thrall for the most part, eager to see just how the puzzle-pieces fit. The POV-shifting allows for his excellent cast to each get their moment, from Garner’s nervy, vodka-swilling hate figure to Ehrenreich’s quick-tempered philanderer, although Cregger’s characters are all rather thinly drawn, resembling less the protagonists of thoughtful short stories and more the bodies one inhabits in a video game. They are in service of a magnetic drip-feed mystery plot that unravels so compellingly that it takes us a while to notice how empty it all is. On the one hand, it’s a relief that unlike so many of his genre peers, Cregger isn’t all that interested in the dirge of trauma horror and while those who wish to look for it might still find a deeper allegorical read of Weapons (probably the same few who laughably claimed Barbarian was a powerful #MeToo statement), it’s mostly an engine of brute force, similar to a schlocky paperback you can’t put down on holiday. But it’s also crucially lacking something, an added element of surprise or sophistication.It reminded me of Denis Villeneuve’s lurid missing children thriller Prisoners and while it’s mercifully not as undeservingly self-serious, it’s similarly handsome, high-end packaging for something that’s incredibly silly and straightforward. The tricksy structure and repetition of scenes from different viewpoints would have one believe there’s a labyrinthine plot to be uncovered but Weapons is far hokier and, frustratingly, dumber than it would seem, relying on staggeringly incompetent police and wilfully ignorant citizens. Cregger remains a remarkably confident and alluringly immersive director, constructing some wonderfully rattling shocks and moments of seat-clenching unsureness. His canny mood-conjuring grips us in the moment (the film is a fun, reactive experience with a big audience) and he draws a fantastically scary and nightmarishly odd performance from a late-arriving actor whose name would be a spoiler to reveal but his storytelling crumbles even before the lights come up. The finale might up the violence to a wince-inducing level but it doesn’t cut anywhere near as deep as it could have, chaos without meaning.Cregger might be expanding and improving his arsenal, using his skills more effectively than he did in Barbarian, but there’s still something missing. Something sharper.Weapons is out in Australia on 7 August and the UK and US on 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsJulia GarnerJosh BrolinThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

You can even spot the real-life ferris wheel that hints at the fairground finale to come.Greaseisn’t the first musical to be given Secret Cinema’s signature immersive treatment – there was a Moulin Rouge in 2017 – but it is the most ambitious, with a live cast performing all of its memorable numbers in what is essentially a hybrid show.The original movie plays on overhead screens, with occasional footage intercut from a black-and-white stage feed, and a (fabulous) band provides the live soundtrack. It takes a chaotic quarter-hour to get your head around what you’re watching. The actors aren’t lip-syncing their lines, so if you’re following the screen it looks like clunky dubbing. The dialogue regularly gets lost behind the music: perhaps the sound mix will get better over the course of the run. Perhaps it’s not important – this is, ultimately, a full-costume karaoke night, the chance for folk to belt out Hopelessly Devoted to You and Greased Lightnin’ without any fear of being removed by an usher.View image in fullscreenFaithful rendering … Grease: The Immersive Movie MusicalAs for the 30-strong cast, none of them would shame the West End. Stephanie Costi is a sweetly voiced Sandy, while Lucy Penrose reconfirms that Rizzo is easily the show’s most compelling character. Some of the performances feel impressionistic, and Jennifer Weber’s choreography riffs only gently on the original, but you wouldn’t expect anything else of a production dedicated to the faithful rendering of the movie’s world. Matt Costain’s direction does spring a couple of genuine surprises; it also co-opts those who have paid for VIP tickets as willing extras.The charismatic Waylon Jacobs provides a linchpin role, transforming the film version’s narcissistic TV presenter Vince Fontaine into an all-purpose MC and entertainment director. He leads the crowd in conga lines around Tom Rogers’ meticulous sets, from the Frosty Palace that serves up real ice cream sundaes to the gym floor where the audience can join in the iconic dance contest.

It’s both in Jessica Barton’s new clown show, which won her the best newcomer gong atMelbourne’s comedy festival. Dirty Work finds Barton in bonneted and buttoned-down guise as Mary Floppins, here to tutor us in tidiness – and sweep away her own demons to boot. Ifher near-namesakecould put a room to rights with just a snap of her fingers and a catchy song, Barton does so, be warned, with the participation of her audience. Specifically men, who are most in need of her housework advice.This is one of those shows, then, that derives its comic charge from putting members of the public through their paces on stage. It’s one of those shows, too – there are many under the clown banner – where repetition and doe-eyed charm are deployed to pad out simple visual routines to the brink of their natural lifespan. But at least Barton has that charm in spades, and a fine disciplinarian line too, that can keep an errant volunteer in line with just a peremptory flash of the eyes. And so her stooges ascend the stage to fold bedsheets with her, separate clean and filthy linen, and perform a dance derived from routine domestic chores.View image in fullscreenCharm in spades … Jessica Barton.Photograph: Charlie AshfordThere’s a singalong skit too, in which Barton shows off her Julie Andrews-alike pipes. Presently, a strand is introduced into Dirty Work suggesting that our host’s mania for neatness is linked to a bad breakup, of the kind that might lead you to, say, hurl your partner’s possessions out of the house and into chaotic disarray on the street. In an entirely silent show, this hinterland is glimpsed but not explored on an upstage screen, while back in the here and now, we’re left watching two volunteers laboriously tidy Barton’s stage.At such moments, it can feel like the show’s ideas have been stretched fairly thinly to fill this fringe hour. But no denying that, as host and performer of this paean to pristine, Barton brings a befitting sparkle and shine.AtUnderbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalClownsMary PoppinsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t until she was in her 60s, living in Mparntwe, that her aunt Margaret Smith taught her how to weave her first tjanpi basket in 2018.Anderson is now living full-time in a renal hostel in Mparntwe and is at her happiest when creating: “I have a smile on my face when I’m weaving. I just pick out nice colours and weave them to make nice big baskets.”View image in fullscreenTjanpi Desert Weavers artist Julie Anderson with a work in progress: a woven police car.Photograph: Emma FranklinAnderson is one of more than 400 women in theTjanpi Desert Weavers, an Indigenous-run social enterprise that empowers women across 350,000 sq km of central Australia to earn an income through fibre art. When it first started in 1995, the collective’s fibre art focused on more traditional practices, such as making baskets. It has since expanded to 26 remote communities and evolved into more contemporary art and sculptural works, exhibited in Australia and around the world.Each tjanpi piece holds stories of country, culture and daily life. The often brightly coloured works are woven together with raffia, emu feathers, seeds, gumnuts and twine.View image in fullscreenTjanpi Desert Weavers dogs, pictured in the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“Each basket or sculpture is more than just an artwork,” the Darwin Aboriginal art fair’s artistic director, Simon Carmichael, says of the Tjanpi Desert Weavers. “It’s a way of keeping culture strong, passing on knowledge, and staying connected to Country. Through weaving, people come together to connect, share, create and continue something that’s been done for generations.”The Tjanpi Desert Weavers launched in Papulankutja, Western Australia, as a series of basket-making workshops facilitated by theNgaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara Women’s Council(NPYWC). It wasn’t long before the women, searching for meaningful and culturally appropriate employment on their homelands, started sharing the artform with their loved ones.View image in fullscreenTjanpi Desert Weavers artist Cynthia Burke in Warakurna, Western Australia.Photograph: Jade BrockleyView image in fullscreenCynthia Burke dyes raffia.Photograph: Jade BrockleyAnderson’s aunt Margaret Smith, who is the NPYWC chair, says the project has multiple benefits: “We are making it with our own hands … Collecting grass for our artwork means collecting bush food, camping out and going out into country.”It also helps women make money to cover essential expenses such as groceries, powercards and fuel – and it can also “settle the mind down from all the worries”, she says.Anderson’s niece Justine is also in the Tjanpi Desert Weavers. Based in remote Aputula (Finke) in the Northern Territory, she first started learning in 2010 at a workshop in Amata, an Aboriginal community near the border betweenSouth Australiaand the Northern Territory.Justine’s sculptures often depict local animals with fanciful details, such as life-like saddles on the backs of her kamula (camels), or the tongue and whiskers of a panting papa (dog). Vibrant wool and raffia stitching is also a distinctive characteristic of her work.Weaving keeps her “happy and busy”. “It’s a way for me to keep food on the table and make my kids happy,” she says. “My boys go to school down in Adelaide, so my weaving means they have some spending money too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, artist Sylvanna Kenny shows her granddaughter Lateesha Binell how to make a tjanpi echidna at a workshop in Pukatja, South Australia.Photograph: Ruby Henderson-LeconteJustine passed her skills on to family members including her sister, who is also a Tjanpi weaver; Cynthia Burke, another Tjanpi weaver, learned by watching her mum and aunty during the group’s early years.Sitting together as a collective, laughing and joking while weaving, is an important part of the enterprise, she says.“When you sit down at home on the weekend or go somewhere to other places, sometimes for sorry business, ladies always take their raffia so they can sit down and do their weaving together,” she says. “I feel proud when I sell my work and work for Tjanpi.”Smith emphasises the benefits of passing on skills and cultural knowledge to younger generations. “All my daughters know how to make tjanpi. They love it. It gives our young people pride,” she says.View image in fullscreenTjanpi Desert Weavers in Papulankutja with the Tjanpi Toyota that won top prize at the 2005 Natisaas.Photograph: Thisbe Purich/NPY Women’s CouncilWhile the women of Tjanpi Desert Weavers speak openly about the cultural, financial and emotional benefits of their work, they have also made significant strides in the art world over the past 30 years. In 2005, a group of Tjanpi artists won the major prize in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (Natsiaa) for their giant woven Tjanpi Toyota. In 2015,a collaborative work between the Tjanpi Desert Weavers and artist Fiona Hallwas exhibited at the Venice Biennale. Two years later, Tjanpi works were a major feature of the exhibitionSonglines: Tracking the Seven Sistersat the National Museum of Australia, which subsequently toured to the UK, France and Germany; it will travel to India later this year, followed by China in 2026.One of the group’s sculptural installations,Kungkarangkalpa (Seven sisters), is a centrepiece of the exhibition65,000 Years: A Short History of Australian Artat the Potter Museum of Art in Melbourne. The co-curator Judith Ryan describes the work as a “palpable, fully three-dimensional manifestation” of the creation myth, “spectacular in its scale and presence”. “I believe this is the Tjanpi Desert Weavers’ magnum opus,” she adds.But not all their works are grand. In August, Justine is exhibiting a new work at Darwin Aboriginal art fair: a lampshade made from brightly woven raffia and tjanpi. She just wants people to enjoy her work: “I hope my artwork makes them feel homey wherever they put it, and reminds them of me,” she says. “It’s good to see my art out there, you know?”View image in fullscreenJustine with her lampshade in Aputula.Photograph: Ruby Henderson-LeconteExplore more on these topicsAustralian artIndigenous artSculptureCraftArtIndigenous AustraliansNorthern TerritoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gaining height, the land thickens with oak forests and a Hermann’s tortoise makes a slow, ceremonial turn on to a sheep track at the edge of the asphalt. And then, just as the road briefly levels out before corkscrewing down the other side, a glittering lake appears beneath me – a brilliant blue eye set in a socket of steep mountains. I can’t even begin to count how many times I’ve crossed the pass into the Prespa basin on my way home from trips into town, but the sight of shimmering Lesser Prespa Lake – often striking blue in the afternoons and silvery at sunset – takes me back to the summer of 2000 when I saw it for the first time.Prespa lakesA little over 25 years ago, my wife and I read a glowing review of a book about the Prespa lakes region. In the north-west corner of Greece and an hour’s drive from the towns of Florina and Kastoria, the two Prespa lakes straddle the borders of Greece, Albania and North Macedonia in a basin of about 618 sq miles. We’d never heard of Prespa until then, but the review of Giorgos Catsadorakis’sPrespa: A Story for Man and Naturegot us thinking about a holiday there, imagining a week or two of walking in the mountains, birding around the summer shores and enjoying food in village tavernas at night.View image in fullscreenFootbridge to Agios Achilleios island on Lesser Prespa Lake.Photograph: Julian HoffmanWhen the book finally arrived at our London flat, at a time when we were talking seriously about living somewhere else, it took just a single evening (and, to be fair, a couple of bottles of wine) to decide to leave the city behind. Not for a holiday, but to try to make a home for ourselves in the Prespa national park. Twenty-five years later, we’re still in the village we moved to – Agios Germanos.These two ancient lakes, thought to be 3-5 million years old, are almost entirely encircled by a bowl of mountainsI park the car near the pass and walk further into the hills on a path worn smooth by shepherds and their animals. It’s high summer and there’s a languor to the landscape. Clouds of butterflies drift on the hot air and a hoopoe raises its magnificent crest in an oak. From up here I can now see Great Prespa Lake as well, separated from its smaller neighbour by a wide and sandy isthmus. These two ancient lakes, thought to be in the region of 3-5 million years old, are almost entirely encircled by a bowl of mountains, making it feel a world apart when you cross into the basin. Although the water levels in the lakes have dropped significantly because of climate change in recent decades, Prespa remains a place of extraordinary vitality.Looking north over the rolling oak forests, I can see the rough point in the lake where Greece, Albania and North Macedonia meet. Prespa is a crossroads not only of countries but of geologies too, resulting in an extraordinary profusion and abundance of wild species – almost three times as many butterfly species (172) can be found on the Greek side of Prespa than in the whole of the UK (59).View image in fullscreenThe scarce swallowtail is one of many butterfly species in the Prespa region.Photograph: Julian HoffmanI look up as a mixed group of Dalmatian and great white pelicans lowers towards Lesser Prespa Lake. Seeing these birds in flight, carried across the mountains on wings that can have a total span of more than three metres, it feels as if you have been given a glimpse into the age of the dinosaurs. Until we read the book that brought us here, I had no idea that pelicans could even be found in Greece, let alone nest on these lakes in large numbers, but then Prespa is full of surprises. In some winters, Lesser Prespa Lake can freeze solid enough to walk across – and there are far more brown bears in the region than bouzoukis. While Prespa is a popular winter destination for Greek visitors, in part because of a ski-centre halfway between Florina and the basin, it’s the quieter spring and summer seasons when the place comes into its own for walking and nature tourism.There’s a mosaic of cultural riches to explore here too: the remarkable ruins of the 1,000-year-old Byzantine basilica on the island of Agios Achilleios; the lakeside cliffs on Great Prespa Lake, studded with centuries-old hermitages and monastic cells, reached by hiring a boatman from the fishing village of Psarades; the churches screened by sacred groves of immense juniper trees, found on some of the manymarked walking trails.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A steel-blue dragonfly unzips the air and I can hear sheep bellsBesides the abundant nature and mountain walking that prompted us to move here, what also makes this place so special is the food and hospitality. There are welcoming, family-run guesthouses in many of the villages and excellent tavernas serving regional specialities, including slow-baked beans in a rich tomato sauce with oregano, fresh carp and sardine-sizedtsironiafrom the lake, grilledflorinelacheese brushed with red pepper marmalade, and wild greens calledhortadoused in lemon juice and olive oil.I stop to watch the cross-hatchings of light on the lakes as the hum of insects deepens with the heat. A short-toed eagle turns into the wind ahead of me, briefly motionless as it hunts for snakes in the forest clearings. Then it steers northwards and away across the mountains. Beyond those peaks encircling Prespa are the beautiful, traditional market towns of Korҫë in Albania and Bitola in North Macedonia, which, together with Florina and lakeside Kastoria just outside the basin in Greece, help make the entire region one of endless fascination for me.View image in fullscreenThe Byzantine basilica of Agios Achilleios.Photograph: Julian HoffmanThere are plans to re-open the long-closed crossing between Greece and North Macedonia within the Prespa basin in the next few years, an opportunity to build further bridges between communities and make movement for tourists easier. Another project will establish a cross-border walking route between our village and the neighbouring mountain village of Brajčino in North Macedonia; it will celebrate the cultural and natural heritage of the common watershed while highlighting the importance of low-impact tourism to local economies, particularly at a time when climate change is making itself felt around the lakes and threatening agricultural livelihoods.It’s almost time to return along the path and head home, but first I sit in the shade of an oak, its leaves rustling in the warm breeze. A steel-blue dragonfly unzips the air and I can hear sheep bells somewhere in the hills. The sound shifts and swirls, just as on the saint’s day festivals of summer, calledpanigyria, when the wild, soaring music of clarinets and raucous Balkan brass rises into the mountain nights as people gather with food and drink to circle-dance in village squares.I’ve never thought of Prespa as anything but a shared place, where human cultures and wild species come together and co-exist, a place best experienced slowly and with care. And although Prespa has been my home for a quarter of a century now, when I see that blue water glimmering beneath me as I cross the pass, it still so often feels like the first time.For more information visitSociety for the Protection of PrespaandVisit PrespesJulian Hoffman is the author of Lifelines: Searching for Home in the Mountains of Greece published byElliott & Thompson (£18.99).

Don’t. Raid the fridge and fill it with all manner of scrumptiousnessTom HuntWed 6 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareSome recipes, such asthe gnocchi featured here last week, require only the fluffy insides of a baked potato, leaving the skins behind. Plenty of people leave the skins of their jacket spuds uneaten, too, though heaven knows why: it’s easily the best bit. These humble leftovers are an opportunity to make one of the most indulgent savoury treats known to humankind: loaded potato skins. I love them with just sea salt and a dollop of mayonnaise or soured cream, but they’re also gorgeous piled high with whatever bits and pieces you have to hand, turning scraps and leftovers into something that’s totally scrumptious.Fridge-raid loaded potato skinsThis recipe is about being inventive and making the most of whatever you have in the house. I grill my loaded skins, rather than baking them, both to save energy and to speed up the cooking, which still achieves that perfect crunchy skin.Feel free to experiment with flavours and textures. Some of my favourite combinations include broccoli, bacon and blue cheese; crumbled sausage with cream and sage; and tomatillo salsa with black beans and a cooling dollop of yoghurt. When I made these skins, I had some leftoveraubergine curry, a nub of grana padano, yoghurt, the end of a jar of chilli jam and some mint leaves, and they all came together beautifully.By embracing leftovers and simple pantry staples, this recipe shows how easy it is to make a show-stopping snack or meal from ingredients that might otherwise be forgotten or thrown in the food compost.Serves2Leftover potato skins, ideally with a little flesh still left on – aim for 1-2 skins per personOil, for brushingSea salt andblack pepperOptional toppings and fillings (to taste; you’ll need between 1 and 3 tbsp in total per potato skin)Leftover cooked or raw vegetables– steamed greens, roast veg, cherry tomatoesCooked protein or pulses– bacon, lentils, drained cooked beansLeftover cooked stew or meat– chilli con carne, bolognese, crumbled cooked sausage, shredded chicken20g cheese, such as cheddar, feta or blue cheese, crumbled or gratedSauce– tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, pestoA creamy element– yoghurt, creme fraiche, hummusA fewfresh herb sprigs– parsley, mint, chives, spring onionsCondiments to finish– mayonnaise, mustard, hot sauce, chutney, lemon juice, pickle brineBrush both sides of each leftover potato skin lightly with oil and season with sea salt. Put the skins cut side up on an oven tray and grill for five minutes, until they’re starting to crisp up. Flip and grill the other side for another five minutes, until golden and blistered, then serve with mayo or soured cream, or with yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon, or load with your own choice of toppings.To load the skins, start with one to two tablespoons of any wet ingredients such as cooked or raw vegetables, then top with a tablespoon of cooked pulses or protein or leftover meat or stew such as chilli con carne or bolognese. Scatter on 20g crumbled or grated cheese per skin, then return to the grill for five minutes, until hot and bubbling. Finish with a spoonful of salsa, chutney or pesto, or with a tablespoon of something creamy. Garnish with chopped herbs or spring onions and a drizzle of hot sauce, lemon juice or pickle brine for welcome sharpness, then serve hot.Explore more on these topicsPotatoesWaste notFoodFood wasteSnacksMain courseVegetablesMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I’m sad, stressed or out of sorts, it’s my mum’s Filipino food that I crave. As a whole, Filipino food has sometimes unfairly had a reputation for being overly sweet, overly meaty and deep-fried, but with more than 7,000 islands rich in culinary traditions, there are, of course, thousands of dishes to enjoy. Bringing it back to the UK, though, when we dust off the barbecue, picnic blankets and cool bags, there’s nothing better than incorporating these sweet, sour, spicy and salty flavours for parties (or fiestas as they’re called in the Philippines). And if you’re after a sweet, refreshing treat, look out for ube ice-cream, which is gaining popularity in UK. Ube is a sweet purple yam native to the Philippines.Sweet potato fritters with red onion and sweet chilli dipping vinegar (pictured top)My mum didn’t teach me how to cook so much as how not to waste, which is why fritters are something we make weekly to use up any leftover veg. My daughter adores sweet potato, but this would also be delicious with carrot and potato. The dipping vinegar is something we make in a big batch and use all week to brighten up leftovers such as fried rice, or to dress cabbage slaw or chicken salad.Prep15 minCook30 minMakes20 small frittersFor the fritters400g sweet potato, unpeeled and grated2 large eggs4 tbsp flour– I used buckwheat, but plain flour works, too1 medium red onion, peeled and finely dicedSea saltand black pepperCoconut oil or avocado oil, for fryingFor the dipping sauce1 small red onion, peeled and finely diced2 tbsp maple syrup6 tbsp apple cider vinegar2 tbsp fish sauce, or vegan fish sauce1 red chilli, deseeded and sliced in rings or half-moonsIn a bowl, mix the sweet potato, eggs, flour, red onion and some seasoning, then set aside for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce by combining all the ingredients in a second bowl.Put a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, then drop in a little of the sweet potato batter and taste it for seasoning. Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, drop two tablespoons’ worth of batter per fritter into the pan and cook on a medium-high heat for three to five minutes, until golden brown. Flip the fritters over (they should turn easily), press down on the cooked side with a spatula, then continue frying for another few minutes.Transfer the cooked fritters to a large plate lined with kitchen paper, then scrape out any bits in the pan so they don’t burn. Repeat with the remaining batter. Be sure to space out the fritters when you fry them; if they are overcrowded, they might steam rather than go crispy-edged. Serve hot with the dipping sauce on the side.Grilled aubergine, mango and tomato saladView image in fullscreenThis is inspired byensalada talong(ensalada meaning salad and talong aubergine). I love this salad chunky and on the side of a barbecue or steamed whole fish, but I’ve also enjoyed it roughly blitzed as a dip for plantain crisps.Prep10 minCook25 minServes81 medium aubergine, or 2 Chinese aubergines1 ripe mango,peeled2 handfulscherry tomatoes, or medium tomatoes1 bunchspring onions, trimmed, or 1 small sweet red onion, peeled1 handful fresh coriander, chopped, to garnishFor the dressing2 tsp tamari or soy sauceJuice of 2limes1 tbsp apple cider vinegar2 tsp maple syrup, or coconut sugarSalt and pepperHeat the grill to medium and pierce the aubergine with a fork half a dozen times. Grill the aubergine for four to six minutes (depending on its thickness), until the skin is charred, then rotate and repeat until it’s charred all over. Set aside to cool.Meanwhile, dice the mango, tomatoes and spring onions, and mix in a bowl. Add all the dressing ingredients and mix again to combine.Once the aubergine is cool enough to handle, halve it lengthways and scoop the flesh into the mango bowl.
