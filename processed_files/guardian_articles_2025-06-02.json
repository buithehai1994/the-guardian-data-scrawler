What next for him … and the show?Martin BelamMon 2 Jun 2025 06.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 07.43 EDTShareAt the weekend, Doctor Who attempted to pull off the holy grail of a surprise regeneration, with Billie Piper appearing to step into the shoes of the departing 15th DoctorNcuti Gatwain a move that, unless you are constantly online in the fandom rumour mills, would have come as a shock. Gatwa’s exit gives him one of the shortest ever tenures in a role that has been a fixture of British television for more than six decades.Fresh from making waves in Sex Education, 32-year-old Gatwa is young and beautiful in a way that the Doctor has not always been. His incarnation of the Time Lord delivered scenes it is hard to imagine most of the other actors inhabiting – whether that was him clubbing, pulling off a 1960s dance number, using a glitter cannon to fly through space, or saying “babes” a lot.View image in fullscreenGlitter cannon in space! … Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor.Photograph: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC StudiosThe first Black man to lead the show, his era of Doctor Who sensitively explored him visiting periods of Earth’s history where his skin colour would have an impact, such as the south of the US in the segregation era inLuxwhere he was not welcome, and Lagos in Nigeria during playwright Inua Ellams’The Story and the Engine, where he said he felt he very much was.The show was also uncompromising about this Doctor being queer, almost instantly falling for Jonathan Groff’s character in Bridgerton tributeRoguein a way that the unrequited love of Mandip Gill’s Yaz for Jodie Whittaker’s 13th Doctor only awkwardly tiptoed around.But perhaps the thing that most characterised Gatwa’s Doctor was his open displays of emotion – showing on screen that he was not afraid to cry. However, the device was probably overused.View image in fullscreenNo tiptoeing here … the Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) hits it off with Rogue (Jonathan Groff).Photograph: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC StudiosSeeing the self-styled “last of the Time Lords” cry over the death of a character we have barely met, as happened with Sasha 55 inThe Robot Revolution, was meant to show the audience she was important to him, but it felt as if the frequent tears cheapened the other times we have seen the character weep.Part of the Doctor’s character is that they need to sometimes feel dangerous to the audience. This is to make it clear that while they may appear human and enjoy the company of humans, they are also close to being an omnipotent immortal being, who usually chooses to use those powers for good, but not always.Doctor Who: The Reality War – season two finale and Ncuti Gatwa era recapRead moreHis howl of despair at the racist society in Dot and Bubble not wanting to be saved by him was raw, and we also got to see those kinds of scenes from Gatwa inThe Interstellar Song Contest. Despite having the lightness of internet viral sensationDugga Dooin it, it was a dark story from Juno Dawson with a message about genocide and terrorism that featured scenes of the Doctor torturing Kid (Freddie Fox).View image in fullscreenShowing his dark side … Gatwa with Varada Sethu in Intergalactic Song Contest.Photograph: Lara Cornell/APThe show sometimes feels stuck between a rock and a hard place in the modern era. It has to compete in a streaming environment where grownup fans also watch shows such as Andor or The Last of Us and compare it directly with those. The BBC though is also still trying to make a show whose primary purpose is to be broadcast on Saturday evening on BBC One for a communal multigenerational family audience gathered around the TV. And that is an audience that is increasingly vanishing in houses with multiple screens and multiple viewing options.Gatwa’s era also seemed to be riding two slightly conflicting horses. Russell T Davies returned as showrunner with the nostalgia rush of havingDavid Tennant and Catherine Tate back in the Tardisfor three 60th anniversary specials, then promised a softish reboot with the aim of picking up new audiences and starting afresh as “Season one” with a new Disney+ international distribution deal. But he also opted to bring back companions from the 1960s and 1980s, and have the return of niche villains and enemies that necessitated flashbacks to episodes from the 1970s, which didn’t exactly scream “accessible”.‘An audible gasp’: Doctor Who fans shocked by Billie Piper returnRead moreThe eight episode series length is also causing pacing issues. If you accept that the first and final two episodes make up the bulk of the series arc, then you only have five episodes to play with. Once you have done a couple of experimental “bottle” episodes, and one Doctor-lite episode, there really isn’t much time to get to know a Doctor and their companion simply hanging out having adventures in time and space.View image in fullscreenNot enough adventures in time and space … Gatwa.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonAnd a single misfiring episode – last year’s finaleEmpire of Deathwas widely regarded in fandom as not having stuck the landing – is an eighth of the season. Two misfiring episodes is a quarter of the season. There is no room in the present format for mid-tier Doctor Who stories.It always feels as if it is too soon to say goodbye to an incarnation of a Doctor, but we only got 19 episodes with Gatwa, and of those he sharedThe Giggle– and his clothes – with Tennant, and in three of them (73 Yards,Dot and Bubble,Lucky Day) he barely appeared at all.He also becomes the first Doctor since Paul McGann – whose main appearance wasthe one-off TV movie in 1996– not to face the Daleks, the most iconic Doctor Who monster of all. Gatwa’s Doctor was fun, flirty and full of joy, but it is difficult not to conclude that we hadn’t seen enough of him in the role, and now we never will.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoTelevisionFantasy TVNcuti GatwaRussell T DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sir Keir summons hard power for hard timesJohn CracePM’s defence review reveal mixes fighting talk with wide-eyed wonder at promise of a war dividendKeir Starmer vows to make Britain ‘battle-ready’ as he unveils defence spending plansMon 2 Jun 2025 12.52 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareIt’s War-War.Keir Starmer had come to the Govan shipyard to get us battle ready. The threat was real. The threat was now. His sweaty fingers hovered over the nuclear button. Any minute now he could authorise a first strike. Possibly by mistake. The world had never been more dangerous. It had taken all his self-restraint not to come dressed in uniform. Cosplaying a military commander is usually the point of no return for global leaders.Keir’s message was stark. England expects that every man – and every woman – will do their duty. A war was both imminent and likely. This was no time for old people to moan about having their winter fuel allowance taken away. Rather they should be asking what they could be doing for their country. Joining the Home Guard. Knitting socks for fighter pilots.This was no time for hard-up parents to demand that the two-child benefit cap be removed. Rather they should be getting their kiddies battle-ready. Buying them toy drones with miniature nuclear warheads. No one is too young to fight. Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.In the new world order there would be no such thing as a civilian. Apart from the 650 MPs. They would play a vital role in the war effort by staying safely at home and telling the rest of us how we should die. It was a tough job but someone had to do it. A few even might get to make a few quid on the black market. Not to mention handing over food coupons and weapons contracts to cronies. Because they were worth it. Covid had been a good training ground for politicians.Peace through strength. At times the language bordered on the Orwellian. But Starmer had a message he was desperate to get across. We were in the fight of our lives. No one was safe. To imagine otherwise was to be in denial. Even as he spoke, the Russians were plotting our downfall.Don’t be fooled that the Russian economy was no bigger than Spain’s. Don’t be fooled that Putin thought he could take the whole of Ukraine in a matter of weeks and was still bogged down in a land and drone war more than three years later. Don’t be fooled that the Russian military is already overstretched. The Russians have just been lulling us into a false sense of security. Lithuania could be next. Then Germany. Then us. First he takes Manhattan. Then he takes Berlin.Not every shipyard worker who had been enlisted as a backdrop for Starmer’s strategic defence review speech on Monday morning looked suitably impressed. Two stood stoney-faced and resolutely arms-crossed. Refusing to applaud either at the start, in the middle or at the end. Put them down as peaceniks at best. Traitors.Keir, though, was not to be blown off course. It was his sacred duty as prime minister to maintain the country’s security. And we were now all on the frontline. So here was the deal. With the 2.5% of GDP he had already committed to defence spending by 2027, we could get all sorts of exciting new “kit”. He and the military seemed to regard weapons as Toys for Grown-Up Boys. Twelve new conventional nuclear-powered subs. Loads of drones and long-range weapons stuff. Loads more warheads. Six new munitions factories. Ploughshares into swords. A military 10 times more lethal than now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Remember the peace dividend? Well, the new war dividend was going to make us all even better off. With the whole country now devoted to making and eating weapons, we were all going to have more money than we knew what to do with. There was money for all of us in weapons of mass destruction.Starmer ended with a promise. He knew it was often tempting for world leaders to want to see what all this hardware could do. But he would do his level best not to use it. It was there more as a reminder of our capabilities. That we weren’t to be pushed around or taken for granted. But hell, it would be quite fun to launch the occasional drone attack. Just to see what happens. After all, what was the point of all this kit if it just lay around for years in a warehouse?Then came the questions. If the world was really as dangerous as Keir made out, how come it wasn’t a priority for the government to up the ante to 3% of GDP as soon as possible? Rather than just making it an ambition for 2034? Just think of what we could do then. We could conscript everyone on benefits straight into the army. A navy on permanent patrol in the Channel. If illegal immigrants knew they were all liable to be used as live target practice, then maybe they wouldn’t be quite so keen to come here. Starmer just shrugged. The time for foreign aid was over. Soft power was so last decade. The only language foreigners would understand now was war.Starmer’s speech was met with predictable despair and contempt from the other parties. He hadn’t gone nearly far enough. Why couldn’t we have more weapons? Nigel Farage was already on a spending spree to make Liz Truss look frugal. One hundred billions pounds of unfunded cuts? Watch his beer. And his cigarettes. He would spend at least 3% of GDP now. Paid for by invading the Americans on the Chagos Islands and nuking Mauritius.That just left Robert Jenrick. He too would outspend anything that Keir came up with. Paid for by killing fare dodgers. Most of all he wanted a war. A war against foreigners. Even Nato isn’t safe from Honest Bob. He wanted to protect good, old-fashioned British values. Like supporting the right to incite crowds to set fire to hotels with people in them. Like the right to exploit your expenses. Like the right to grant planning permission to your mates.

The drones had first-person view, or FPV, technology that allowed them to be operated remotely, probably from Ukrainian territory.Drone carrying lorryAttempting to launch drones from Ukraine would have been much harder, as they would have had to cover huge distances and avoid Russia’s air defences.A photograph from Ukrainian security officials showed the containers, which were disguised as wooden sheds.

It was a lonely time, but a lovely summer and I decided to do something uplifting and joyous. There were a bunch of records I loved listening to on a sunny day – Dusty Springfield’s I Only Want to Be With You, The First Picture of You by the Lotus Eaters, You on My Mind by Swing Out Sister, which has Bacharach key changes and strings. I wanted to make a piece of music that gave me the buzz those songs did.I didn’t want to worry about an album or sleeve artwork or how the video was going to go. I just wanted people to hear the song and feel like the sun had come out. I needed strings for the demo and found a fellow who was advertising samples in Loot magazine – this was 1994, before you could get anything you needed on your laptop. I remember going round to his flat and waiting for hours while he copied them on to a floppy disc.I spent an afternoon with Kirsty MacColl, who really loved what I’d done – but wanted to change everythingThere was never a plan to sing the song myself. I’d been writing with Julianne Regan, who was in All About Eve, so she was the first person to have a crack at writing a melody and lyrics. After she went her own way, Geoff Travis at Rough Trade played the demo to Morrissey, who asked for a meeting – we ended up playing pinball. A week later, I got a letter from him that just said: “Dear Bernard, I’m sorry, I can’t.” Then I spent an afternoon with Kirsty MacColl, who really loved what I’d done but still wanted to change everything.Someone suggested I go and see David McAlmont playing at the Jazz Cafe. During his first song, the drummer Makoto Sakamoto came on and started smashing the shit out of his drums – it was the greatest sound I’d ever heard. Then David started singing and I was like, “Well, there it is.” I knew I needed both of them. I gave David a tape of the instrumental and two days later he came round to my flat with what he’d written. He only had words for one verse. I said: “Just sing it twice. We’ll worry about that later.” But we never got around to it and people don’t seem to notice. I love the message of the lyric: it’s a big “fuck you”, but delivered in the most positive way.We recorded the strings then spent a couple of days in producer Mike Hedges’ chateau in Normandy. We set the drums up in the old stone cellar – Mako didn’t speak English but I directed him with my arms and remember the room shaking as he produced that eruption you hear at the start of the record. David recorded his vocals in the ballroom – he seemed to find the key-change leap effortless. I was standing 10ft away thinking: “This is going to be great.”Yes is my favourite out of all the records I’ve ever made. To make a song that people put on to feel good is just magic. Years after it came out, I was at a fireworks display with my kids. They always finished the night with a banger. That year, they closed with Yes. That just blew my mind.David McAlmont, singing, backing vocals and songwritingKnowing three artists before me had been given the option to do something with this great piece of music was very motivating. Bernard had evoked Motown, Burt Bacharach and Dusty Springfield, but he’d added a rocky thing. I wanted to try something simple.Initially, I came up with something quite T Rex but my flatmate said: “It’s a bit one dimensional, dear.” I remember sticking my finger into my vinyl pile, touching the soundtrack to Judy Garland’s version of A Star Is Born, and thinking: “What would Judy do?” Lyrically, it was such a punt. I’d been dating somebody who I really liked, but he’d just kind of ghosted me. I was thinking: “What would I say to him if I became famous?” I just started singing: “So you want to know me now?” It was delusional, really. Before Yes came out, a friend asked me: “What kind of a song is it?” I said: “It’s an I Will Survive for the 90s.”Women have told me they left abusive relationships thanks to YesI remember getting to the climactic point after the second chorus where the song builds and builds and I sing: “I’m better, better, Ye-e-e-e-es!” I was thinking I was done, but then Bernard said: “We need something for the end, a kind of refrain.” I thought: “Smokey Robinson!” And I used my falsetto to repeat: “I feel well enough to tell you what you can do with what you got.” The recording actually uses varispeed to pitch that part a semitone out of my comfort zone, so I was much happier performing the song with a live band onLater With Jools Hollandthan I was singing along to the backing track on Top of the Pops.Over the years, I’ve met women who have told me they left abusive relationships thanks to Yes. After our second Top of the Pops appearance, the sister of the show’s producer came over to say she’d been unable to walk and the song had helped her to get up. It has a power I can’t account for. After it had reached the Top 10, I went to see Jimmy Somerville live – and the guy who inspired the lyric was there. He said: “Oh my god, David, you’re doing so well!” I was standing there biting my lip, thinking: “You have no idea.”Butler, Blake & Grant play Cambridge Junction on 6 June before touring the UK.

Marriage was never my goal, and I don’t have children. Since college, there’d been a steady pattern of long-term, wonderful relationships. I’m lucky; I’m a woman who’s been loved.Then came my early 50s – during Covid – and everything stopped. So, I quit online dating, stopped doing awkward blind dates and declined virtual networking events. Instead, I focused on doing things I enjoy, like seeing live music, going to sporting events and traveling, with people I care about.How do I stay healthy in my 50s?Read moreBut on a trip to my hometown last year to watch a football game with friends, I ran into a college classmate in the airport. I hadn’t seen him in more than 30 years. We talked for a few minutes and politely agreed to keep in touch.After one short meet-up in New York City, we started spending a lot of time together. We lived in different cities but both traveled for work, so coordinating locations was fun. Whether it was walking around different cities together, going to restaurants, making dinner at his house – he did all the cooking – or just texting and talking on the phone at all hours, every day, I was surprised at how effortless it was.I was attracted to his intense ambition and grit – but mostly his compassion. Despite his punishing work schedule, he took time to meet with my best friend’s daughter, who was in her early 20s, struggling to find a job. What was supposed to be a quick coffee ended up being a full pancake breakfast on a weekday morning where he listened, gave advice and boosted her confidence.He had experienced a tremendous amount of loss in the previous few years. Once, he told me he was “completely alone in the world” – not lonely, but alone – which was sad. At times, he was arrogant and insecure: he had worked very hard to be financially successful, but needed people to know it.He was such a good man but, in retrospect, a hard person to really know.He pushed things faster than expected, saying “I love you” after just a few weeks. It was a lot for me, but he seemed like a great guy, and it felt like we already had some shared history.After three months, I assumed we were already beginning a longer-term, more serious thing, so I was in no way prepared for our story to end so abruptly.He ghosted me.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’It happened fast. For about a week, I noticed he wasn’t texting or calling like he normally did. We both have intense jobs, so I figured he was having a stressful time at work. When I called him after about a week to check in, he didn’t seem like himself, and I sensed something had shifted.I couldn’t think of anything that had happened between us to cause this, but after that call, I decided to give him space and wait to hear from him. When another week went by without any contact from him, it felt like he was just gone, as suddenly and unexpectedly as he had shown up that day at the airport.I had two theories about what happened. Applying Occam’s razor, the simplest was that he just didn’t like me. I’m a confident person, but self-aware enough to accept that this just happens sometimes. But my second theory was about bad timing: you meet people where they are in life, and that can make all the difference.View image in fullscreen‘I’ll never know what happened with him, but I’ve decided my ghost story is a comedy, which feels empowering’Photograph: Maureen HeffernEither way, my instinct was to leave him alone since he was barely responding to me. But I remembered researcher and author Brené Brown’s Ted Talk on vulnerability, where she described it in the context of shame, and the idea that human connection and empathy require us to be vulnerable.I was also thinking about one of my favorite columnists, and author of The Road to Character, David Brooks, who hasmade a case for prioritizing “eulogy virtues”(like kindness and compassion) instead of “résumé virtues” (ambition and achievement). Vulnerability and kindness had never been my strengths, but as I got older, I’d tried to be better at both. Aftermy sister died in the opioid crisis, my biggest regret was that I wished I’d been kinder to her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(I didn’t want him to feel alone in the world.) It was a short message: no digs; no question that required a response. I just put it out there sincerely. Two days later, I received an antiseptic response about how busy he was, and he “hoped I was well”, like we had just met at a corporate retreat in the Catskills.Vulnerability sounded much more empowering when Brown talked about it.After that, I deleted all his texts, except one saying: “I love you” – to prove to myself I didn’t imagine the entire thing. I can accept being ghosted, but I refuse to be gaslighted.One of my first jobs after college was teaching English at an elite prep school in New York City, a world unknown to me, the daughter of a waitress and a Vietnam combat veteran from western New York.After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the griefRead moreWhile I was not prepared for these precocious, worldly students , I loved teaching short stories, because it’s how we live our lives: one story stacked on another, then another, some running in parallel. Everything all at once. In some stories, you might be the protagonist – in others, just a supporting role. But in all of them, we intertwine with people living in stories of their own.I’ll never know what happened with him, but I’ve decided my ghost story is a comedy, which feels empowering. I tell it with humor, and people always respond with laughter and empathy. No matter how old we get, one of the best parts of dating is telling friends your stories. I have an amazing group of women from home, whom I consider “million-dollar therapy”. We support each other, deal with life’s absurdities together and laugh about how we are now the same age as The Golden Girls, but with better hair.Looking back after almost a year, I don’t regret what happened – even though I felt so humiliated at the time. I took a risk trying to connect with someone I cared about, and it didn’t work out. But in the end, I tried to be kind – and there’s power in that, not shame.Most importantly though, I’m hopeful again and looking forward to my next story.Kelly O’Connoris a Partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in WashingtonDCand a patient advocate and aTEDx speaker about the opioid crisis.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyDatingAgeingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he wants to give his football career ‘one last push’Mon 2 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 14.33 EDTShareJordon Ibe was not supposed to go to the park that day. He reiterates the point several times when recalling the events of 17 June 2008. Ibe’s mum had forbidden his attendance at Tabard Gardens in Southwark, south-east London, but he went anyway; a kickabout was too much of a draw for the then 12‑year‑old. That day Ibe witnessed his friend David Idowu being stabbed through the heart. A few weeks later, Idowu died.“I’d not even seen a butter knife,” Ibe says. The cadence of his voice has slowed, his words so soft they are virtually inaudible. “To see that happen in front of me … my friend wasn’t about that life. He got stabbed because he had the wrong school uniform on. I saw it and ran out of the park, ran home. I remember seeing myself on the news on the CCTV.“You don’t really know what to do. It wasn’t like I was going to say anything to my mum because I wasn’t supposed to be there. She didn’t know I’d witnessed a death. I told her a few years later.“I don’t think I really processed it until I was a bit older. I’d not even been in a school fight, but I’d witnessed something like that. It’s something I’ll never forget, but I’ve never really spoken about it. Being so young, you’re not really going to be processing trauma like that.”Ibe was not intending to speak about the tragedy, nor does he raise it to stir sympathy. It comes up naturally during a broad and open conversation on mental health and anxiety, Ibe segueing to his childhood after describing being robbed at gunpoint at the age of 20.He had been tailed from a London hotel one morning and, as he reached Surrey Quays, his car was bumped. It was lunchtime, broad daylight. “I got out not noticing who was in the car,” he says. “They had balaclavas on. One put a machete to my chest and said: ‘If you move, I’ll stab you.’ Everything happened so fast but slow at the same time. My silly arse tried to get away and the passenger pulled a gun out.”The two incidents are touchstones in Ibe’s life. Their effects are impossible to measure, although he recalls hiding in bushes as a child to avoid running into the wrong people and hired security after the robbery. However, they have not detracted from his trust in humanity or his desire to be a good person.Take a little-known story about the winger’s time atBournemouth, for example. Ibe got chatting to a homeless man who had split with his wife and lost contact with his kids. Ibe took him home, stuffed several bags full of clothes, checked the guy into a hotel for a few weeks and bought him a mobile phone so he could contact his children.View image in fullscreenJordon Ibe in action for Bournemouth against Manchester City in March 2019.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersIt was also while on the south coast that Ibe’s mental health hit crisis point. Shortly before the pandemic, Ibe had bought a family home. But after splitting from his partner “it became a home for me”. He was still able to see his young daughter, but it was not the same as living together. Family is everything to Ibe, his little girl his world.“There were a lot of dark times. The house was too big. Being by myself was difficult,” he says solemnly.Many speak of being able to hide their inner demons, of putting on a brave face in public. Not Ibe. “People could see it in me. I was a bit in denial at first, but deep down I knew.”It reached a point that Ibe was having “thoughts that human beings shouldn’t be having – you want to live, not be on the other side. If it wasn’t for my path in life with God, especially my daughter, I don’t know what the future would have been.”Ibe will eternally be grateful for the intervention of Eddie Howe, his manager at the time. “He helped me during the hard times – letting me go to rehab, taking time off football, going to see a psychiatrist.”Howe is one of the good men according to Ibe, “a real family guy. Every time I message him, he replies within a day or two. And you know managers are busy.”Ibe recently returned to public consciousness via the Baller League. He is not a former footballer, but a current footballer, even if he has played only 11 minutes professionally – for Derby and Ebbsfleet – since his Bournemouth contract expired in June 2020.Still only 29, Ibe was a child prodigy. Aged 15 years and 244 days, he made his debut forWycombein the League Cup. A few months later, in October 2011, he scored on his first start. At school the following Monday his science teacher showed the highlights during class.“Everything came so quick,” Ibe says. “I was in year 10, playing League One. It was crazy.”It does not take long in Ibe’s company to conclude that he would have found that spotlight awkward. But the lights only brightened. Among several Premier League suitors wereLiverpool. He initially turned them down. “It wasn’t out of disrespect, but I’d never been out of London,” he says. “Going to the north felt very foreign to me. I wanted to be with my family. It wasn’t ‘no’ – it was: ‘Could we speak about this in a year’s time?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Premier League debut came under Brendan Rodgers in May 2013, with Ibe assisting Philippe Coutinho for the winner. Later that night he was back in London for a kickabout with his friends. “I love football and I told them I’d be down,” he says matter-of-factly.Loans at Birmingham and Derby followed, the latter spell coming under Steve McClaren, and Ibe did so well that he was recalled by Liverpool in January 2015. The mention of McClaren visibly lifts Ibe.“I felt like I was at Real Madrid at Derby,” he says, grinning. “I was gutted when I left – he’s the best I had. He gave me freedom to play. I was just happy with him. A lot of Derby fans have said if I’d stayed … well, I just loved it there.”That May Ibe signed a long-term Anfield deal and within weeks Raheem Sterling – a mentor for Ibe despite being exactly a year older – joined Manchester City. “I thought it was my time regardless,” Ibe says when asked if he felt that further opened the door. “I was determined to get on the pitch, whether he, or other players, were there or not. I knew I could rise to the standard.”Ibe was flying andafter Rodgers’s October sackinghe featured regularly under Jürgen Klopp. But the following summer, in a demonstration of just how quickly the football sands shift, everything flipped. “I was kind of pushed out the door,” Ibe says. His reluctance to reveal further details until his career is done is understandable. All Ibe is willing to say is that there was a “lot of politics” that he “didn’t really understand at the time”.View image in fullscreen‘Football is not the main accomplishment in my life. I have a deeper purpose; being a dad; being a great human being; being a brother; being a son.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“I just had to pick up all my boots and make my way down to Bournemouth.” Did it feel wrong? “Yeah. I don’t regret Bournemouth but I’m very sensitive. I’ve always been that way. I didn’t think it was right. But life is not like that.”Ibe was Bournemouth’s record signing; a £15m starlet expected to make a huge impact. That is not how it transpired and come the last 18 months of his four-year contract he felt ostracised. An extension was on the table but his refusal to sign it – he wanted the control of being a free agent – meant he was, if not entirely excluded, pushed out.“They’d spent a lot of money at my age and needed to recoup something. It’s a business. I’m not disrespecting anyone, but I was killing it in training. It wasn’t making sense. But I knew the reason.”Last season, Ibe turned out for the non-league sides Hayes & Yeading and Hungerford. For him it was all about feeling part of something again, smelling the grass, being in the dressing room. As for what comes next, Ibe is clear but also coy. “Continue football; reach the levels I know I can hit; give it that one last push,” he says.“I wouldn’t say I regret what’s happened. It’s changed me for the better. Football is not the main accomplishment in my life. I have a deeper purpose; being a dad; being a great human being; being a brother; being a son. More meaningful stuff in life.”Ibe is in conversation with several clubs. “Hopefully everything goes my way,” he says. And with that he is off to spend time with his little girl.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

He argued on a visit to the BAE Systems shipyard at Govan, in Glasgow, that defence had to come above other public services.Growing threats, new weapons, more troops: key points of UK’s defence reviewRead moreDrones have transformed the battlefield in Ukraine, with Moscow and Kyiv’s forces now making heavy use of attack and surveillance drones several miles beyond the frontline, causing an estimated 70% of casualties.On Sunday, Ukraine launched coordinated attacks from remotely piloted drones hidden inside trucks aimed at airfields deep inside Russia. Kyiv claimed it had destroyed or damaged 41 Russian aircraft in the innovative long-range attack.The strategic review said drones had become “an essential component of land warfare” and the army needed to invest in a mix of attack drones, surveillance craft and counter-drone technology.But critics said remotely piloted drones risked increasing the chance of conflict. Chris Cole, of the research group Drone Wars UK, said that drones “lower the threshold for the use of armed force” and so could “encourage war as the firstrather than the last option”.Starmer said the 140-page defence review was “a blueprint to make Britain safer and stronger, a battle-ready, armour-clad nation with the strongest alliances and the most advanced capabilities”.The prime minister reiterated that the UK would spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2027, but declined to set a firm date on when that would increase to 3%. Labour has committed to a further increase during the next parliament.The review concluded that Britain faced “multiple, direct threats” to its security for the first time since the end of the cold war – and that to deter conflict in the future the UK must be “ready to fight and win”.But while the review team described the government’s 2.5% target as “good news”, it said a reversal of the hollowing-out of the armed forces would take about 10 years on current budget forecasts. “As we live in such turbulent times, it may be necessary to go faster,” the team said.The target size of the British army will be increased from 73,000 to 76,000 in the next parliament as funding becomes available,Healeytold MPs. But he added that the immediate priority was to reverse falls in personnel numbers. Last week, the total number of soldiers had dropped to a low of 70,860.The review also commits the UK to:Explore the possibility of reintroducing air-launched nuclear weapons by discussing with the US and Nato the possibility of buying F-35A fighters equipped with US B61-12 bombs.Spending £15bn to develop new submarine-launched nuclear warheads – and committing to build 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines in Derby and Barrow, starting in the 2030s.Investing £1bn in air and missile defence, £6bn on munitions during this parliament and opening at least six weapons factories to increase military stockpiles, which currently may last only a few days in a crisis.Developing a home guard, modelled on the army reserves, to ensure the protection of airports, communications sites and other parts of the critical national infrastructure in a major crisis.On Monday, Starmer said he was not “as the prime minister of aLabourgovernment, going to make a commitment as to the precise date” as to when defence spending would increase to 3%. “I don’t believe in performative fantasy politics, and certainly not on defence and security,” the prime minister said.That prompted the Conservatives to accuse Labour of underfunding the new plan. James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, said the prime minister had been unable to set a date for the 3% target “because the Treasury haven’t approved a plan to pay for it”.Starmer is due to join western leaders at a Nato summit this month. NATO members are expected to agree to a proposal from Mark Rutte, the alliance’s secretary general, that member states agree to spend 3.5% on defence by 2035 and a further 1.5% on cyber defences and other military-related infrastructure.Donald Trump, the US president, has demanded that Nato members lift defence budgets to 5% of GDP while Washington has indicated it would reduce its focus on Europe. No American troops are expected to participate in a “reassurance force” designed to ensure peace in Ukraine if a long-term ceasefire is agreed.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryDrones (military)British armyJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

He said an agreement had also been made to return the remains of killed service personnel, but added that this would take careful preparation.Zelenskyy did not take part in the talks but was speaking during a visit to Lithuania, where he called for stronger sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire.He said his negotiators had given their Russian counterparts a list of nearly 400 abducted Ukrainian children that Kyiv wanted Moscow to return home, but that the Russian delegation agreed to work on returning only 10 of them.Ukrainian officials said that the focus of the prisoner exchange should be the wounded and sick as well as young soldiers between 18 and 25 years old. Russian officials confirmed that “all” sick and wounded prisoners would be swapped, and that the exchange would involve at least 1,000 PoWs.View image in fullscreenThe Russian negotiating team in Istanbul’s Çırağan Palace.Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty ImagesMonday’s negotiations took place at the Çırağan Palace, a vast 19th-century Ottoman edifice on the banks of the Bosphorus that is now a luxury hotel. In one of its expansive conference chambers, the two delegations – each about a dozen strong – sat at long tables facing each other, about 10 metres apart. The Russians all came in dark suits, while the Ukrainians were mostly in military uniform. The whole meeting took less than two hours.After the talks, Ukraine’s head negotiator and defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said the return of the abducted children “is a fundamental priority for us”.“If Russia is genuinely committed to a peace process, the return of at least half the children on this list is positive,” Umerov said.The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed only that it had received a list of 339 names of people Ukraine wanted returned, but did not comment further.The international criminal court in The Hagueissued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putinand a senior aide in 2023 for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children.View image in fullscreenThe Ukrainian negotiating team.Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty ImagesAt Monday’s meeting in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said that the Russians rejected Kyiv’s call for an unconditional ceasefire of at least a month, but had instead handed over a written proposal , which the Ukrainians said they would need more time to study before responding. They suggested the talks should reconvene towards the end of June.The Russian state news agency, RIA, said the Russian document proposed two options for a ceasefire, one of which would require Ukraine to begin a complete withdrawal of its troops from four of its regions occupied by Russia. RIA described the second option only as a “package” containing a number of unspecified conditions.Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said meanwhile his government wanted to arrange a summit between Zelenskyy and Putin.“My desire is to bring Putin and Zelenskyy together in Istanbul or Ankara – also to invite Trump to this meeting as well,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara. “We will take steps for this meeting after the latest talks.”View image in fullscreenVadym Skibitskyi, Ukraine’s deputy defence intelligence chief, addresses the media alongside Rustem Umerov, the minister of defence.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesZelenskyy has repeatedly said he is ready to meet Putin and on Monday Umerov restated Kyiv’s desire for a summit.“We believe that all the key issues can only be solved at the level of leaders … with the possible involvement of other leaders such as the president of the United States,” the defence minister said.Heorhii Tykhyi, the Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “If Putin says he is ready to meet tomorrow, our president Zelenskyy is ready to meet him tomorrow.”Last month,Zelenskyy challenged Putinto meet him in Ankara for a summit suggested by Donald Trump. However, the Russian leader did not respond and sent mid-level officials to the talks instead.View image in fullscreenVladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, briefing the press after the talks.Photograph: Yasin Akgül/AFP/Getty ImagesBriefing reporters after Monday’s talks, Medinsky said that the memorandum given to the Ukrainian delegation included proposed “steps towards a full ceasefire”. He added that Moscow had suggested short ceasefires of two or three days at some parts of the front “so that commanders can collect the bodies of their soldiers”. But he did not specify where Russia was proposing such local truces should take place. The Ukrainian side did not respond publicly to the proposal.Both sides stepped up their military operations before the Istanbul talks. Ukraine carried outa complex drone strike on targeting Russian bomber planeson four military airfields across Russia, as far away as Siberia.Operation Spiderweb: a visual guide to Ukraine’s destruction of Russian aircraftRead moreUkrainian officials said that Sunday’s remote-controlled drone operation, codenameOperation Spiderweb, had been 18 months in the planning, and had succeeded in damaging or destroying 41 planes including Tu-160 and Tu-22 bombers, as well as Tu-95s used to launch cruise missiles against Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence put the total of Russian material losses at $7bn (£5.2bn).Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, called it a “very accurate military operation”, adding that as long as Russia rejected a ceasefire and continued to carry out attacks on Ukrainian civilians, Ukraine could continue to develop new ways to hamper Russia’s capacity to carry out missile or drone attacks.“Innovative technologies played a really crucial role in this operation, and these technologies now are the game-changers on the battlefield. And I believe that Ukraine has many other ideas, technologies, how to move ahead,” Shmyhaltold the France24 television channel. “We are working constantly to do our best to [restrict] Russian possibility to attack Ukraine … We continue to clear our sky from Russian bombers, and we will do the same in other spheres, including on the ground.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That could see Iran in turn launch reprisals.Faced by such a catastrophe, Iran is likely to temper its response to the US plans so that further talks are possible.The best compromise available would be a US statement that Iran in principle is permitted to enrich uranium but in practice will not do so, at least inside Iran, for an indefinite period.The US has said it would allow Iran to join a Middle East consortium to enrich uranium,in conjunction with Saudi Arabia, but this could not take place on Iranian soil. A regional consortium for a civil nuclear program would require huge trust between the countries involved and continued external inspection.At one point it seemed that Donald Trump would allow Iranian enrichment at low levels so long as US inspectors – not just UN teams – were given access to Iran’s nuclear sites, but that solution seems to be fading.But on Monday evening, the US president said Iran would not be allowed to enrich any uranium under a possible nuclear deal.“Under our potential Agreement – WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” Trump said on social media, in response to a report in the Axios news outlet that said his administration’s offer would let Tehran enrich some of the nuclear fuel.Speaking on a visit to Cairo, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi revealed little about the progress of the talks, but said Iran would be replying to the US proposals shortly.Iran did suspend enrichment for two years from November 2003, but in 2005 it rejected the European plan to use imported low-enriched nuclear fuel for its reactors.In Egypt Araghchi met Raphael Grossi, the director of the UN nuclear inspectorate the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), expressing his displeasure at a draft IAEA report prepared for the agency’s next board meeting that highlights how Iran has continued to enrich uranium at high levels of purity contrary to the agreement the nation signed in 2015.France, Germany and the UK intend to use the report to press for a board vote leading to UN sanctions being reimposed in September.The Iranians claim the draft IAEA report contains nothing surprising or new, but accuse the west of pressurising the inspectorate to develop an increasingly propagandistic tone.The report found that Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the UN nuclear watchdog at three locations that have long been under investigation.Araghchi said: “western pressures should not affect the IAEA and the IAEA must maintain its independent and technical identity. Some countries want to put pressure on Iran through the IAEA, and we hope that the IAEA will not fall into this trap.”He added: “Iran’s enrichment is completely peaceful and a scientific achievement that we have achieved through our scientists. The Iranian nation has paid heavy prices to achieve this achievement, andthe blood of a number of our nuclear scientists has been shed for this issue.“If the goal of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran does not seek to obtain nuclear weapons, we can reach an agreement in this regard, but if unacceptable and unrealistic goals are pursued in this regard and the goal is to deprive Iran of peaceful nuclear activities, there will definitely be no agreement.”Ebrahim Azizi, the head of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission, said: “If a proposal is based on ignoring the principle of enrichment, it is not at all presentable, not acceptable, not admissible, not worthy of attention, and not negotiable.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranMiddle East and north AfricaInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)OmannewsShareReuse this content"

Videos on social media appeared to show the aftermath of what was said to be the location of al-Aishiya school.Announcing the strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, without providing evidence or naming the school, it had bombed a site “used by terrorists” in the area, claiming it had taken steps to reduce civilian harm.Al-Aishiya school was among a series of school buildings used as shelters identified by the IDF as targets in recent weeks, according to military sources.Four further school buildings have been marked as potential targets to be bombed, according to the sources.The locations identified as potential targets include four schools: Halawa, al-Rafaa’i, Nusiba and Halima Sa’dia. All four are in or near Jabaliya in the north of Gaza.It was not immediately clear whether these buildings were also being used as shelters. Two of the schools appear to have been damaged by airstrikes at earlier stages in the offensive.According tolatest UN assessments, 95% of Gaza’s schools have sustained some level of damage to their buildings. Approximately 400 schools were classified as having suffered a “direct hit”.1:19Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza – video reportOn 25 May, an Israeli strike killed at least 54 people sleeping at the Fahmi al-Jarjawi school, according to local officials, whotold the BBCthat severely burnt bodies, including those of children, were recovered from classrooms that had been set ablaze.The IDF claimed it had “struck key terrorists who were operating within a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre embedded in an area that previously served” as the school.Over the past two months, school buildings, hospitals and municipal buildings have been categorised by the IDF as “heavy centres”, which it believes are being used by Hamas militants alongside civilians, according to three military sources.The sources said airstrikes had been authorised against such sites in circumstances in which only low-ranking militants were present despite knowing that civilians could be killed.Juliette Touma, the director of communications at Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, said schools “must always be protected and must never be hit or used for military or fighting purposes”.“Very sadly, schools have been struck over and over for the past 20 months. It’s a grave violation of international law and of children’s rights,” she said.Asked about its planned operations against school buildings, a spokesperson said the IDF “operates exclusively on the grounds of military necessity and in strict accordance with international law”.The spokesperson claimed that Hamas unlawfully “exploits schools” for military activities by “building military networks beneath and within schools … launching attacks towards IDF forces from them, and imprisoning hostages in them”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Coskun had argued his criticism was of Islam in general rather than its followers but McGarva said he could not accept this.Coskun’s legal fees are being paid by the National Secular Society and the Free Speech Union, both of which criticised the ruling and said they intended to appeal “and keep on appealing it until it’s overturned”.The advocacy group Muslim Engagement and Development quoted the judge’s sentencing remarks on X,commenting on the ruling with the hashtag #hatespeechisnotfreespeech.The ruling has prompted comment from figures in Westminster. The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment on the case but said there were no blasphemy laws inEnglandnor were there plans to introduce any.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said on X that the case “should go to appeal”. “Freedom of belief, and freedom not to believe, are inalienable rights in Britain,” she said. “I’ll defend those rights to my dying day.”McGarva, who issued a fine of £240,rejected the idea that the prosecution was “an attempt to bring back and expand blasphemy law”.In his ruling, he said burning a religious book and making criticism of Islam or the Qur’an are “not necessarily disorderly”, but added: “What made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They raised their concerns at the world’s largest cancer conference in Chicago, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco).Dr Fumiko Chino, a cancer researcher and assistant professor at MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston, Texas, co-authored a paper presented in Chicago that said cancer misinformation had “acutely worsened in the past decade”.With more people being diagnosed amid a growing and ageing global population, misleading or false information about cancer had become a significant public health concern, the study said.While most people trusted doctors, the paper found, more than half of those surveyed said experts seemed to contradict one another. One in 20 had no trust in scientists to provide cancer information. “We’re losing the battle for communication. We need to regain that battlefield,” Chino said.Dr Julie Gralow, Asco’s chief medical officer, said: “Several patients of mine wanted an all-natural treatment approach after I had explained my treatment recommendations. They go online and search for something natural and they find a clinic in Mexico which promises an all natural treatment for cancer, which includes caffeine colonics, vitamin C infusions and other things.”Instead of scolding patients for shunning surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, Gralow said she tried to win their trust by still offering support.“In several cases, they came back after three months and didn’t feel any better. And then they stayed in our clinic and eventually we could gently ease them into more evidence-based treatments,” she said. “A few times, they didn’t come back. And then I would learn within nine months they tragically had died.”Liz O’Riordan, a retired breast surgeon who was diagnosed with breast cancer, shares evidence-based information with her thousands of followers on social media.She said: “There is a huge amount of cancer misinformation online. Every day I get messages from scared women who want to know if they need to stop eating dairy, soy, flaxseeds. Do they need to stop wearing underwired bras, using deodorants? Is it true that juicing can cure cancer? What about miracle supplement cures like mushrooms and CBD?”O’Riordan wants more doctors to engage with patients online. “But this is hard as it takes a lot of time to script, film, edit and publish content as well as the effort needed to grow a community to get your voice heard above the noise … And when you don’t have a million followers, it’s impossible to get traction,” she said.“What we’re saying isn’t sexy or exciting – we can’t promise a cure. The drugs we give have side-effects and some people still die.”Speaking at Asco, Dr Richard Simcock, the chief medical officer of Macmillan Cancer Support, said misinformation was “very worrying” as it had “exponentially increased the problem” of misconceptions about cancer.“I have recently seen two young women who have declined all proven medical treatments for cancer and are instead pursuing unproven and radical diets, promoted on social media,” he said.“A person is perfectly entitled to decline that therapy but when they do that on the basis of information which is frankly untrue or badly interpreted, it makes me very sad. It’s clear that we have work to do to build back trust in evidence-based medicine.”Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said: “Social media can provide a supportive community for people faced with a cancer diagnosis but at the same time, we’re also seeing an alarmingly high level of misinformation on some of these platforms.“I would urge people to be sceptical of any ‘miracle cures’ you may see on social media around cancer and use trusted, credible sources like the NHS website or your care team to verify anything you are unsure of – because these fairytales aren’t just misleading, they can be harmful.”Explore more on these topicsCancerCancer researchMedical researchHealthAlternative medicineHealth & wellbeingHomeopathynewsShareReuse this content"

Originally from Poland, she had last made contact with family on 28 August 2010.She lived in Princes Street, Normanton, after arriving in the UK in 2009. Police said they had concentrated their search at an address on the same street where human remains were found in the garden.Formal identification is yet to take place but police believe that the remains are those of Zablocka.In the past week, two women, 39 and 43, and a 41-year-old man were arrested in connection with the investigation. Police said a 39-year-old woman who was arrested on suspicion of murder was rearrested on Monday. They remain on police bail pending further inquiries.Police have offered a £20,000 reward for information that leads to the conviction of someone in the case of Zablocka, who is understood to have worked at the former Cranberry Foods chicken and turkey factory in Scropton.DI Kane Martin, who is leading the investigation, said: “Izabela’s family are at the forefront of our minds following this discovery and, whilst formal identification has not yet taken place, it is our belief that these remains do belong to Izabela.“As such, we have spoken with Izabela’s family in Poland, and they are aware. Our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time.“Identification of the remains is likely to be a lengthy process, but we will issue updates when we are able.“I know that reports of these findings will send shock waves through the local community, and I understand the concern of residents.Officers will remain in Princes Street in the coming days, and anyone with concerns is encouraged to speak with them.“A dedicated team of detectives are continuing to piece together information about the days prior to Izabela’s death.“Izabela had friends in Derby, socialised in Derby, and worked in Derby.“We know that someone out there will have information about Izabela that may help us understand what happened to her, and urge anyone who saw, spoke to, or heard anything about Izabela in July or August 2010 to come forward.“You may hold the key piece of information that we need to understand the full circumstances of Izabela’s disappearance, and to give her family answers on what happened to their loved one.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsDerbynewsShareReuse this content"

The fact is that it’s not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?”This year’s fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues.Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. “What excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,” he said.For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to theKeep it Fringefunding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe’s honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts.Lankester said he had numerous conversations that “reaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there’s a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It’s something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It’s still on an incredible number of people’s bucket lists.”He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her “enormously valuable” intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: “The message landed.”Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least £1.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city’s ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents.The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. “What we don’t want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people [who] drive a big chunk of that revenue,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festivalEdinburghScotlandOasisAC/DCFestivalsFringe theatrenewsShareReuse this content"

The 2025 Giro d’Italia was the exception, appositely as the biggest loser was an actual Mexican, Isaac del Toro, with the unassuming LancastrianSimon Yatesthe two-wheeled equivalent of the bandit who skips off with the loot, while two other bandits – in this case Richard Carapaz and Del Toro – stare each other down waiting for the other man to blink.Yates’s second career Grand Tour win,forged on the Colle delle Finestre on Saturdayafternoon in a peerless display of courage and cunning, and sealed 24 hours later in the streets of Rome, will go down in cycling’s annals as one of the most improbable heists the sport has witnessed.Britain’s Simon Yates seals Giro d’Italia in Rome for second grand tour titleRead moreThe endless joy of the Grand Tours – Spain, France, Italy – is that they throw up all kinds of delightful scenarios, but there have been few, if any, where the decisive plot line was a frozen stalemate between the cyclists in first and second places, each waiting for the other to move while a third man skipped away to victory. This was probably the most bizarre act of self-immolation in a Grand Tour since 1989, when Pedro Delgado wrecked his race on day one by getting lost en route to the start of the prologue time trial.To understand how this happened, the first key element is Yates himself. Now 32, his career has been marked by two qualities: patience and sang-froid. His ability to wait for the right moment, and to seize that moment, has been the hallmark of his best wins, going back to his earliest triumphs: his 2011 stage win in the Tour de l’Avenir, his 2013 world title in the points race on the velodrome in Minsk, and his Tour of Britain stage win later that year.When he threw caution to the winds, at the Giro in 2018, it backfired spectacularly at the end of the three weeks, in no less a place than the Colle delle Finestre; when he won the Vuelta a few months later, he had learned the lesson and bided his time. That it has taken so long for him to take a second Grand Tour can be largely summed up in one word: Slovenia. Seven years ago, no one would have predicted the rise and rise of Tadej Pogacar and Primoz Roglic. Yates first looked like a potential winner on the day that Del Toro took the race lead, the gravel‑road stage into Siena, and he had ridden the perfect race since then, never losing enough time to rule him out, never putting his cards on the table.View image in fullscreenRichard Carapaz (left) and Isaac del Toro let the race slip away.Photograph: Luca Bettini/AFP/Getty ImagesIt took more than guts and patience; it needed the other pieces of the tactical jigsaw to slot into place. His team, Visma‑Lease-a-Bike, did what they had to do best: sending a satellite rider ahead in the day’s main escape in case of need.Most days, the pawns had had limited impact; here, the strongest and most versatile, the Belgian Wout van Aert, was in the perfect position to help Yates to mess with Del Toro’s and Carapaz’s minds.Neither the Mexican nor the Ecuadorian had a teammate in place alongside Van Aert, an egregious blunder, because if either man had had anequipierto hand at the key moment – at the foot of the descent off the Finestre with 36km remaining when Yates was still just about within reach – it could well have tipped the balance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the event, the Ecuadorian was unable to dislodge the Mexican, but their violent acceleration achieved something more insidious: it burned off Del Toro’s teammates, who had defended his lead impeccably for 11 stages. By the time they rejoined Del Toro, Yates was long gone.Once Yates had flown the coop at the foot of the Finestre, it was Del Toro’s job, as the race leader, to pursue the Lancastrian, whether or not he had any teammates with him. But he knew that to do so would expose him to a late attack from Carapaz, who had started the day only 43sec behind. And Carapaz was equally aware that if he chased, Del Toro might be the beneficiary. It needed either to seize the initiative, or for one team manager to issue an ultimatum to his rider. Without that, the upshot was the absorbing but unedifying spectacle of the pair freewheeling as Yates forged ahead with Van Aert – unedifying that is, unless you were a Visma team member, a British cycling fan or a connoisseur of the bizarre twists that bike racing unfailingly produces.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaSimon YatesCyclinganalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s the sort of TV that doesn’t ask much of you, only that you raise an eyebrow, nod along, and say yes, that is an interesting fact about bananas, I’d never thought about that before. The statistics are plentiful and free-flowing, so much so that without them being breathlessly relayed every few seconds, you suspect it could have been a 20-minute show. Even so: 3m bananas! Which must be stored at exactly 14C (57F), so they don’t ripen too soon!Dover is the UK’s biggest ferry port. According to the film-makers, 10 million passengers pass through it every year, as does a third of Britain’s trade with the EU. During the summer, upwards of 10,000 freight vehicles and 15,000 passenger vehicles make use of it daily. It’s a busy place, with multiple purposes, and many different teams, attempting to form a gigantic sort of interlocking puzzle.The show borrows from various sections of the jobs-based reality-documentary toolbox. As a result, it feels like a bit of a hybrid of many other programmes. It’s Border Force meets Traffic Cops meets Inside the Factory, with a tiny splash of late-90s series Airline, though sadly it is nowhere near as camp as that minor classic. It begins with the Border Force element. The Port of Dover has its own police force, of “nearly 40” officers, in charge of the safety and security of passengers. We see two of them patrolling the white cliffs, to check, excitingly, whether anyone is carrying out “hostile reconnaissance”. They might be a famous tourist attraction and a renowned beauty spot, but the cliffs also offer a view of the entire port, perfect for bad actors to do some spying. It does make you wonder if making television viewers aware of this is in the best interests of national security. But there are no spies today, merely some evidence of alcohol consumption.They stop a man driving to Europe from Birmingham, because he’s got eight people in the car, three of whom are children not wearing seatbelts, and when they check his documents, that turns out to be the least of his worries. Then the radios crackle with a message that a freight driver is claiming to have a gun and is “irate”, and everyone runs. It looks like the camera crew has struck gold. This is properly exciting. But it turns out to be a misunderstanding involving flashcards, and the driver gets escorted away for the day, with a slap on the wrist.Minor dramas bubble up to the surface, then pop, and dissipate gently. On a national security level, it’s reassuring that there is so little threat here, even though it does make for steady television. Michelle, the duty operations officer, has got a busy day ahead: she needs to figure out how to get a convoy of six coaches on board the ferry to Dunkirk, without blocking the lanes. She manages to pull it off without a hitch.We get to meet the ferry’s head chef, Paolo, who caters to the coach passengers, and has a run on fish and chips. I am no logistics mastermind, but if you asked me what six coach-loads of passengers of a certain age, travelling to Dunkirk, might want to eat, fish and chips wouldn’t be an outside bet. I am also surprised to learn that ferries have head chefs, after recently travelling on a ferry myself – not this company, I should add – and eating what can only be described as the most beige meal that has ever been plated up, and paying £25 for the privilege.We learn that to compensate the residents of Dover for the fact that 3.8m vehicles pass through the town every year, and traffic can occasionally get a bit much, the Port of Dover throws an annual regatta for locals, to give back to the community. Unfortunately, on the day, it is very windy, but it goes quite well. That’s all there is to it.Running a busy port sounds like a difficult task, but everyone here seems pretty competent, and on the basis of this documentary, it all looks as if it’s going well. Again, reassuring, in terms of that safe pair of hands, if not the most lively television you’ll ever see. Apart from the bananas, that is. They arrive on a boat so big that it needs tiny boats to help it dock. It requires remote-controlled cranes to offload the endless crates of bananas. One of the cranes gets stuck. The weather starts to turn. The cargo ship must leave quickly, before the tide goes out. The music is dramatic, the stakes are high. I’ll leave you to guess how it all turns out.Dover 24/7: Britain’s Busiest Port is on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The SUVs are black, tinted, sleek. The jets are private. The egos are large, the staff sprawling and mostly unseen, the decor both sterile and unimaginably expensive. This is the distinctive milieu ofSuccession, the HBO juggernaut which turned the pitiful exploits of a bunch of media mogul failsons into Shakespearean drama for four critically acclaimed seasons. It is also the now familiar aesthetic of a range of eat-the-rich satires plumbing our oligarchic times for heady ridicule, if increasingly futile insight – The Menu, Triangle of Sadness, Knives Out: Glass Onion, Parasite, The White Lotus and the recent A24 disappointmentDeath of a Unicornto name a few. (That’s not to mention countless mediocre shows on the foibles of the wealthy, such as this month’sThe Better SisterandSirens.)Impossibly frustrating: why Mission: Impossible 8 was a major letdownRead moreSo suffice to say, I approachedMountainhead, Succession creatorJesse Armstrong’s first post-series project about four tech billionaire friends gathering for poker as one’s AI innovation wreaks havoc on the globe, with a sense of pre-existing fatigue. The market of ultra-rich satire is, to use the logic of Armstrong’s characters, saturated. (Or, to use their language: “I would seriously rather fix sub-Saharan Africa than launch a Sweetgreen challenger in the current market.”) There’s more than a whiff of Argestes, the second-season Succession episode at a billionaire mountain retreat, to these shots of private cars pulling up to a huge chalet hugged by snowcapped peaks. And though Armstrong, who solely wrote and directed the film, continues his avoidance of easy one-to-ones, there’s more than a whiff of Elon Musk to Venis (Cory Michael Smith), an AI company CEO and the richest person in the world with a tenuous grasp on reality, a stupendous sense of nihilism and unrepentant need to assert his own virility (the landscape, he notes, is “so beautiful you can fuck it”).In some ways, it’s a relief to see tech bros, especially AI entrepreneurs, reach full, unambiguousmovie-villain status. Already, there is a competently made movie for the Doge era, and Armstrong, as ever, can nail hairpin turns of phrase on the sentence level. But as much as I hate to contribute to the “anti anti-rich content” discourse, on which much ink has already been spilled, I can’t say Mountainhead refuted any expectations of reality fatigue; watching Venis, host Soup (Jason Schwartzman, playing the least rich of the group, and thus nicknamed after a soup kitchen), Marc Andreessen-esque venture capitalist Randall (a miscast Steve Carell), and fellow AI wunderkind Jeff (Ramy Youssef) brainstorm plans for the post-human future as more of a slog than if I were high-altitude hiking with them.To be honest, I’m not sure any classic satire – as in, using irony or exaggeration to highlight hypocrisies, vices and stupidity – could work for the second Trump administration, at once dumber and more destructive than the first, nor the release of generative AI on the public. Both require a level ofhypernormalizationand devaluing of reality that make the idea of enlightening ridiculousness feel, well, ridiculous. Even the most inventive writers and performers will struggle to craft humor out of beyond farcical political figures and norms degraded beyond recognition (see: Mark Ruffalo’s effete and grating parody of Trump in Bong Joon-Ho’sMickey 17).Succession, which ran from 2018 to 2023, soared on its “ludicrosity”, to borrow a made-up term from its billionaire patriarch Logan Roy, with a precise critical distance from reality. The deeply cynical, psychically fragile, acid-tongued media conglomerate family loosely based on the Murdochs were just far enough removed from the real Fox News timeline. Its inverted morals, barren decadence and high irony the right angle of fun-house mirror to become, in my view,the defining show of the Trump era, without ever mentioning his name.But we are in a different era now, and the same tools feel too blunt to meet it. Mountainhead shares much of the same DNA asSuccession, from Armstrong to producers to crew, to trademark euphemisms (why say “murdered” when you can say “placeholdered”?) It was completed on an extraordinarily fast timeline – pitched in December 2024, written (partly in the back of cars while scouting locations) this winter, filmed in Park City in March and released by end of May – giving it the feel of a streaming experiment for the second, more transparently oligarchic Trump term. How fast can you make an HBO movie? How can you satirize current events moving at a speed too fast for any ordinary citizen to keep up, let alone be reasonably informed?“The way it was shot naturally simulated Adderall,” Yousseftold the Atlantic, and it shows. Mountainhead plays out less like a drama between four tenuously connected, very rich friends, and more like a random word generator of tech and finance bro jargon – decel (deceleration, as in AI), p(doom) (the probability of an AI apocalypse), first principles. (Armstrong, by his own admission, binged episodes of the All-In podcast, which features prominent investors and Trump’s AI/crypto czarDavid Sacks.) The backgroup of this billionaire conclave are series of escalating crises from Venis’s guardrail-less AI that feel themselves AI generated – women and children burned alive in a mosque, a deluge of deepfakes that imperils governments in Armenia, Uzbekistan, Japan, Ohio. Italy defaults on its debt. Should they take over Argentina? Buy Haiti? “Are we the bolsheviks of a new techno world order that starts tonight?”View image in fullscreenSteve Carell in Mountainhead.Photograph: Macall Polay/APThe deluge of contextless, characterless chaos – Succession’s Kendall would call this dialogue “complicated airflow” – succeeds in highlighting the depersonalizing effect of Silicon Valley’s many innovations. None of this feels real, because none of thisisreal to these characters. Millions of No Real Persons Involved. But that is undercut by a pervasive sense of self-importance. Like the irksome climate-change satireDon’t Look Up, directed by Succession executive producer Adam McKay, the exaggerated hijinks of Mountainhead reveal a deep self-assurance of its politics that border on smug. It’s not that it doesn’t, like Succession, attempt to humanize these figures – each billionaire has an Achilles heel of morality or mortality, though by now the fallibility of Musk-like figures is far from a revelation. It’s that the drama between these billionaires felt frictionless – mostly unchallenged by secondary figures and impervious to other perspectives, at once predictable and insufferable to watch.Every human has their unique foibles and contradictions, but Mountainhead found itself too enthralled by figures who are no longer interesting, if they ever were. I found myself longing for more than two minutes with the girlfriend, the ex-wife, the assistant, the board member, let alone one of the many staff at the house – anyone to de-center a perspective that has already claimed far too much oxygen in the public sphere. For a Real Person to get involved. But that may be beyond this flavor of satire, now in an era of diminishing returns.Explore more on these topicsJesse ArmstrongUS televisionHBOSuccessionSteve CarellTelevisionUS television industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Russell Grant, Keith Floyd and Robin Cook – remember them? Bremner does, and remembers the jokes he once told about them too. Prompted by onstage interlocutor Fred MacAulay, he summons them back to life here, in An Evening With … format that includes standup and sketch alongside chat-show banter and questions from the crowd.It’s perfectly entertaining, especially for those of us who were there first time around. (MacAulay makes a running joke of the confused 17-year-old in the front row.) Bremner is nothing if not a slick raconteur. Too slick, arguably: I sometimes wished he’d answer a question from the heart rather than from his mental Rolodex of well-buffed anecdotes. He does that once, when prompted to discuss his ADHD, and his commitment to destigmatising the condition. Elsewhere, it’s smooth repartee about schmoozing the king, struggling with Noel Edmonds’ voice, and prank calls he once made in character as Nelson Mandela.There are treats for the locals in his native city: a cameo from Gavin Hastings and a Trump gag about the Fife village of Lower Largo that would bewilder audiences elsewhere. With little new to say about the US president, there’s too much Trump in the standup portion of Bremner’s show. It’s not the only instance of our host treading familiar ground (on Rees-Mogg: “he’s like something out of a previous century”, as if that’s not been frequently observed). But there are choice moments, too: a fine quip about the names of the ex-Member for North East Somerset’s kids; another about concussion protocols and the high recent turnover of British PMs.You end with an impression of a satirist with little fire left in his belly, his anecdotes suggesting cosy camaraderie with the public figures he lampoons onstage. But he remains witty, well-informed (see the set piece in which voice-of-horseracing Peter O’Sullevan commentates on modern politics) and able with a twist of those vocal chords to spring the innocent, distant past irresistibly back to life.AtGala Durham, 3 June;then touring.Explore more on these topicsComedyRory BremnerreviewsShareReuse this content"

No.What has it changed to?Are you familiar with the “holy airball” trend?I’m an adult with real-world responsibilities, so of course I’m not.OK, so the TikTok kids are saying “Holy airball” whenever someone underestimates them. For example, the professional swimmer Alexia Sotomayor posted a video that said “told him i’m a swimmer, he said ‘i used to swim in the summer, i can probably beat you’”. Then there was a clip of her preparing for the world championship, and the word “Holyfrickenairball”.Oh, gross.Yes, it’s a wildly ostentatious boast. But now the nepo babies are doing it.Give me an example.Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe’s daughter, Ava, just posted a TikTok that read: “I told him my mum’s a lawyer, and he said, ‘Oh what firm does she work at?’” Theholy airball momenthere was a photo of her mother in Legally Blonde.Any others?Martin Scorsese’s daughter, Francesca,got in on the act(“I told him my dad is a film-maker.

It’s one thing to brag about your own accomplishments, but it’s far uglier to brag about accomplishments you had nothing to do with and only benefit from. The subtext of all these TikToks is essentially: “Look how rich I’m going to be when my parent dies.”I’m not sure that’s the case.And the format of the videos is offputting too. God forbid anyone asks you a follow-up question when you’re boasting about your mum.So I shouldn’t show off about my parents online?Not unless you want everyone to think you’re incapable of standing on your own two feet without them, no.Do say:“TikTokers are bragging about generational wealth.”Don’t say:“Their parents must be so proud.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesCelebritySocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I spent hours there when I was young, researching black servicemen in the first and second world wars, as part of a bigger project about multicultural London. (Newsflash– it’s been multicultural since for ever.)The archives are incredible, and the staff could not have been more helpful, yet every day, ambling past the giant death machines at the doors of the museum, past the flying injury-bringers that hang from the ceilings, I couldn’t help but think: pick a lane, guys. Either war is a bad thing, featuring real humans who lose their comrades, get hurt and killed, or if not, are changed for ever, in the service of an idea that later turns out to be some imperialist bullshit. Or, war is a good thing, because look at all this mighty equipment. It can’t be both.Maybe the ambivalence wasn’t the museum’s, maybe it was my own, because I continued to go there until I took the kids when they were about seven and nine, and found myself having to explain the significance of Colin Self’s Beach Girl (1966), in which the artist used a mannequin, blackened and mutilated, to convey the likely physiological impact of a nuclear attack. They both started crying, which maybe I should have predicted.Anyway, they are older now, but not old enough for its current exhibition,Unsilenced: Sexual Violence in Conflict, because none of us are. You may have the broad outlines of disparate atrocities in your head – the sex slaves taken by the Japanese imperial army between 1932 and 1945 as “comfort girls”, the rape of German women during the Soviet liberation, and the kidnapping and rape of Yazidi women in northern Iraq just over a decade ago. You may even know (though I didn’t) about the rape of Ukrainian men by soldiers of the Russian federation in this current war. In your lifetime, you will have lost count of how often you have passed war memorials, to unknown soldiers, to RAF bombers, to animals, but you probably won’t have seen sexual violence set in stone, which absence gestures towards one recurring theme in the code of silence: no society wants to look directly at this crime, because its details are hideous. I don’t ever want to think again about the use of the bayonet in Boer war sex crimes.“Code of silence” sounds simple, but would run to a thousand sub-clauses: there is social squeamishness, survivors’ shame, an understandable sensitivity about the children who are born of rape. It’s well known that if you make your testimony and aren’t believed, the brutality is revivified; the jeopardy of saying this aloud to a postwar society that didn’t want to hear it would have been immense. At the end of the account of one victim – a Welsh woman married to a Belgian man, she had been raped by German soldiers while heavily pregnant, and lost her baby shortly afterwards – there’s a note from the recording official: “A decent little woman and quite reliable. No exaggeration attempted.” There’s something so revolting about the thought that your own decency would have to be adjudicated before you could be heard, that exaggeration would be assumed unless some random guy deemed it absent, and that you probably only made the cut because you happened to be Welsh, not Belgian.Threading through the exhibition are academic voices, describing the complex interplay between militarism, humiliation, barbarism and the patriarchy, but just to be really ham-fisted and painfully straightforward about all this: war is the pre-condition, the portal from civilisation into cruelty.This morning started with a thrum of news, from theUkraine-Russia peace talksto thedefence spending review, and it feels as though none of these conversations should be allowed to happen without first taking a minute to observe that war turns some soldiers, enough soldiers, into something less than human, and the results of that stain history for ever. It feels like the casual dehumanisation of military aggression gets lost in the margins of territory, strategy and percentages.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We would climb up the winding concrete stairs in a Soviet-era apartment block and be greeted with a warmth that felt like family. Over piping hot bowls of Uyghurchay, mum would talk to them for hours while my brother and I listened. I always assumed they were relatives of ours, until mum told me that they were the parents of her friend Örkesh Dölet, and they had not seen their son for over 20 years. As a child, I didn’t know who Örkesh was, but my heart broke for his parents, who clearly loved and missed their son so very dearly.Growing up in Beijing, dad used to take us to Tiananmen Square on weekends to fly colourful swallow-shaped kites. Due to censorship, I never knew that the pristine, neatly paved tiles beneath the soles of my sparkly light-up sneakers were once carpeted with the corpses of brave pro-democracy student protesters. I never saw the famous photo of “tank man”. I never knew the date “4 June 1989” had any significance for the city that I called home.3:11Exiled pro-democracy activist on being Uyghur during Tiananmen Square protests - videoWhen I first learned about the Tiananmen Square protests, I was in disbelief. I could not even imagine a Beijing where young people would dare to dream of and fight for a betterChina. In the repressive China that I grew up in, a movement like that of 1989 seemed like fiction from some distant, unrecognisable timeline.But the student movement was real, it was impactful, and it was led by a young Uyghur man named Örkesh Dölet.I interviewed Örkesh remotely from his home in exile in Taiwan as part of an upcoming book project, titled Uyghur Resistance. Now, as the anniversary of the 1989 massacre approaches, Örkesh reflects on his lifelong dedication to the fight for democracy, and on that one summer 36 years ago that would irreversibly alter the course of his life.Australia exposed to modern slave labour imports and many businesses ‘ignoring the facts’, commissioner warnsRead moreIn April 1989, Örkesh was a scrawny, charismatic 21-year-old student at Beijing Normal University. He descended on to Tiananmen Square with thousands of fellow students, who bravely protested for democracy and human rights. Over 50 days, Örkesh stepped up as a leader of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation and represented students in televised negotiations with Chinese Communist party leaders. Then,on 4 June 1989,the tanks rolled in. The People’s Liberation Army mowed down the blossoming civil society movement that Örkesh had helped build, but it could not extinguish the powerful sense of justice that continues to burn within the soul of this lifetime activist.After the massacre, Örkesh found himself on China’s most wanted list and escaped into exile under cover of darkness, as did the other high-profile protest leaders. However, unlike his fellow exiled Han Chinese protest leaders, Örkesh has not once been allowed to return to China, nor has the Chinese Communist party granted his parents the documents necessary to travel overseas. During one of our visits, Örkesh’s father said he had sent one handwritten letter to Chinese government officials every week since June 1989, imploring them to let him see his son. I know every stroke of every Mandarin character on every one of those 1,800 unanswered letters is chiselled with longing.Desperate to see his family, Örkesh tried to turn himself in to China on four separate occasions without success. “I was most wanted by the Chinese government, but then all of a sudden when I turn myself in, when I offer myself to them, I became the most unwanted.” Örkesh is a really strong person who has seen and survived extraordinary hardships, but even the staunchest, most assertive political dissident is still human: “I miss my family. I want to see them. Even if that meeting has to take place in the form of a prison visit, I still want to have an opportunity to see my family.”View image in fullscreen‘I will always look up to Örkesh. He is the human embodiment of the fighting spirit that lives within every Uyghur person.’Photograph: Sam BiddleThirty-six years in exile is a pain that I can only imagine. For me, it has been 10 years since I’ve been to East Turkestan and seen my loved ones. These past 10 years have been pure agony. But Örkesh has borne this pain since before I was even alive. I think of the vacuum left by his absence, which was palpable in his parents’ apartment. Then I think of the 500,000 members of the Uyghur diaspora and the void we ourselves have left in the homes of our loved ones. Then I think of the millions ofUyghursin arbitrary detention and the hollowness that haunts the homes of their loved ones.The pain of Örkesh and his family was once exceptional, yet now it has become a defining feature of the Uyghur experience – the pain of seemingly interminable temporal, emotional and physical space between us and the people whom we love the most.Yet no amount of discrimination could drive a wedge between Örkesh and his Uyghur-ness. He attributes his continued advocacy to the foundational Uyghur values that he was taught as a child: “As Uyghurs, we were brought up always being taught to be courageous, to be brave. I think that has played an important role in 1989 for me to take the step up and become one of the early leaders of the movement. When I am presented with an opportunity to say something, I believe that I should say what I think is right, not what is safe. As Uyghurs, we do the right thing, not the safe thing.”Generations of Uyghur activists like Örkesh have laid the groundwork for Uyghur advocacy today. To be a young Uyghur activist is to follow a path of resistance that has been paved by our forebears, to draw inspiration from their tenacity, wisdom from their experience and strength from the knowledge that we are joined in this fight by all those who have come before us and all those who will come after us. To be a young Uyghur activist is also to know that this path never has been and never will be an easy one.I will always look up to Örkesh. He is the human embodiment of the fighting spirit that lives within every Uyghur person – this spirit is the reason why a vibrant culture of Uyghur resistance persists to this day.Nuria Khasim is a Uyghur advocate living in Naarm.

The race was a showdown between two candidates who represent the country’s stark political and ideological divide: Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the far-right opposition party, Law and Justice (PiS), and Rafał Trzaskowski, the liberal and strongly pro-European mayor of Warsaw representing the Civic Platform (PO) party of the prime minister,Donald Tusk. The razor-thin victory for Nawrocki, who secured just over 50% of the vote, is a domestic setback for Tusk, but it also threatens wide and gloomy repercussions within the EU and beyond.Tusk’sreturn to poweras prime minister in 2023, after previously serving from 2007 to 2014, was widely seen as a bid to re-anchor Poland within the European project. His government promised reforms, especially in restoring the rule of law, after years of confrontational policies under PiS aimed at undermining theindependence of the judiciary and the constitutional court. Those ambitions now face a significant institutional roadblock. While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, the president has significant powers: they can veto legislation and influence domestic, foreign and defence policy. The outgoing president, Andrzej Duda, who is also aligned with PiS, used his veto toblock Tusk’s reform efforts. With Nawrocki now set to occupy the presidential palace, such obstruction is expected to intensify rather than ease.The implications of this election are potentially immense. Political deadlock between a pro-European government and a Eurosceptic president could stall Poland’s reform agenda and weaken the country’s standing within the EU. It also risks undermining the unity of the European response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Poland has played a leading role here, providing humanitarian and military aid and acting as a key diplomatic force on the EU’s eastern flank. Nawrocki, though, could inject a new unreliability into that equation, as became clear during the campaign when he repeatedlypitted Poles against Ukrainian refugees. His victory could place additional strain on Europe’s cohesion at a time when the US has already rolled back military, humanitarian and diplomatic aid to Kyiv.The comeback for PiS that this outcome represents also reflects a broader global trend of political polarisation. While far-right parties have recently lost ground in countries such as Canada, Australia and Romania, where the pro-European Nicușor Dan convincingly defeated the far-right presidential challenger, George Simion, Poland is shifting towards the conservative and nationalist camp. The Polish election signals a reconsolidation of the far right.Nawrocki’s win is a morale boost for the international movement surrounding Donald Trump. After a string of defeats for Trump-aligned candidates, Poland’s result gives renewed momentum to the global wing of the “make America great again” agenda. At CPAC Hungary, a gathering of conservative and far-right politicians held days before the Polish vote, the US secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, urged Polish votersto choose“the right leader” and attacked Trzaskowski as “a train wreck”. This kind of overt election interference is increasingly common in the Trump era and illustrates how closely Europe’s far right is now tied to Trumpism.This also reveals a paradox: while Trump undermines the credibility of multilateral institutions such as Nato through his inflammatory rhetoric, he is able to mobilise a different kind of internationalism – one for leaders across Europe who emphasise national sovereignty and identity. His implicit message, that Europe is on its own and can’t rely on the US to defend it, serves not only as a warning but reinforces nationalist instincts.Earlier this year, Trump again declared that Nato countries “don’t pay enough” and that theycould no longer count on US support, a comment that sparked near-panic in European capitals. For centrist leaders, it reinforced calls for stronger European defence cooperation. But on the political fringes, it was seen as confirmation that nations must rely on themselves. The defeat of Tusk’s favoured candidate in Poland symbolises a larger battle over the political narrative. Trzaskowski’s pro-European message, rooted in cooperation, shared values and the rule of law, failed to convince enough voters that it could protect Poland from geopolitical threats. Nawrocki’s message of national control and sovereignty resonated more.The long-term threat from revanchist Russia, combined with Trump’s unpredictable leadership, has shaken Europe’s decades-long strategic reliance on US military protection. The continent now faces the urgent task of rethinking its own security architecture. Ironically, Trump’s unpredictability is what may accelerate this process. But it requires political will, not only in Brussels but in the capitals of EU member states. As long as parties such as PiS maintain a grip on national institutions, Europe’s strategic shift remains fragile.Poland’s election outcome therefore serves as a warning to pro-European politicians. Without a compelling narrative on security, social protection and national identity, pro-European parties will struggle to retain voter support. The future of Europe will not be decided in Brussels alone; it hinges just as much on the electoral choices made in Warsaw, Bucharest and other capitals. The real impact of Trump in Europe, whether as a force that strengthens or weakens the European project, will ultimately be determined not in Washington but in the voting booths of Europe itself.Catherine De Vries is Generali chair in European policies and a professor at Bocconi University in MilanExplore more on these topicsPolandOpinionEuropeDonald TuskThe far rightDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

The plan includes increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with aspirations to reach 3% in the next parliament.The government’s narrative suggests that increased military spending will enhance national security and stimulate economic growth. However, this perspective neglects the immediate threats facing UK citizens: underfunded public services, a strained National Health Service and the escalating climate crisis.Redirecting substantial funds to military projects, such as nuclear submarines and warheads, is likely to divert resources from essential sectors that directly affect citizens’ daily lives. Investments in healthcare, education and renewable energy not only address current societal needs but also contribute to long-term national resilience. Globally, on average more than24,000 people die of hunger dailyand cutting our aid budget will worsen this tragic situation.The UK’s defence procurement history is marred by inefficiencies and mismanagement. The government’s hugely ambitious strategic defence review is an exercise in hope over experience. For many years big defence projects have been delayed as a result of unforeseen technical problems partly caused by overoptimistic military planners and advisers influencing gullible ministers. Defence officials are highlighting the plan for a big increase in the number of nuclear-powered attack submarines, yet the cost of the existing, and much-delayed, Astute class submarine fleet, has already increased from an estimated£4.3 bn to more than £11bn.Meanwhile, spending on nuclear weapons has increased significantly more than anticipated and serious problems remain over the project to build a new fleet ofDreadnought nuclear missile submarines. Although the government suggests that priority should be given to the defence of Europe where, it says, the main threat to Britain’s security lies, it invests in expensive and vulnerable aircraft carriers for deployment elsewhere, including the far east.The government’s review risks repeating past mistakes by committing to large-scale projects that have led to wasted resources and unmet objectives. Furthermore, while theUK spends more on defencethan all but five other countries in the world already, evidence indicates that military build-up actuallyincreases the likelihood of conflict.Keir Starmer has also argued that defence projects will stimulate the economy. Yet investments in sectors such as renewable energy and public infrastructure have demonstrated more consistent returns and broader societal benefits.The review claims that the defence strategy will support 400,000 UK jobs, including 25,000 in Scotland. While job creation is vital, the number, quality and sustainability of these jobs warrant scrutiny. There is likely to be a net loss of jobs as a result of shifting funding from other sectors.Analysis for the Scottish governmentshowed that military spending has one of the lowest “employment multipliers” of all economic categories, ranking 70 out of 100 in terms of numbers of jobs generated. Much of the defence spending will probably be on weaponry from the US.Furthermore,recent researchis clearly showing that global boosts in defence spending will worsen the climate crisis. A2020 report by Scientists for Global Responsibility and Declassified UKfound that the UK military-industrial sector already produces greater quantities of carbon emissions than 60 countries. While the Ministry of Defence acknowledges the environmental impacts of its operations, its proposed solutions, particularly increased biofuel and nuclear, even where lower in carbon emissions,still threaten ecosystems, biodiversity and human health. In the light of these concerns, it’s imperative to consider alternative strategies that prioritise human security and sustainable development.A group of academics, trade unionists and campaign groups has drafted analternative defence review, a civil society response to the government’s SDR. We call for a radical break with successive UK governments’ failed security and defence policies, which distort Britain’s national priorities, fuel global instability, undermine international law, harm the environment and divert investment from public services and social infrastructure towards subsidies for the global arms industry. Our ADR suggests that most of this increased spending appears to be linked to policy influence by international arms companies.By reallocating resources towards healthcare, education and climate resilience, the UK can address immediate domestic challenges while contributing to global stability. Such an approach not only enhances national security but fosters economic growth through the creation of sustainable jobs and industries.The strategic defence review presents an opportunity to redefine the UK’s security priorities. However, by focusing predominantly on military expansion, it risks neglecting the pressing needs of its citizens and repeating past procurement failures. It’s time for the UK to embrace a holistic security strategy that truly addresses the challenges of the 21st century.Karen Bell is professor of social and environmental justice at the University of Glasgow.

Yet denying people safety, belonging and the right to vote for a decade amounts to the exact oppositeMon 2 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 10.35 EDTShareThere are many lies told by politicians when it comes to immigration in the UK, but none is bigger than the claim that it’s all too easy. Too easy to enter Britain; too easy to be given handouts; too easy to acquire citizenship. The UK is presented as an inert country, passively receiving future Britons that it does not charge, test or, indeed, invite. The government’s latest raft of policies to deal with the“failed experiment” of “open borders”is heavily influenced by this lie, as it is intended to make things harder for immigrants. One of those policies went broadly under the radar, a small technicality amid Keir Starmer’s unsettlingrhetoric, but it will have serious consequences.That policy is extending the period you’re required to be settled in Britain before you can get permanent residency, and then citizenship,from five years to 10 years. As someone who became naturalised under the five-year route, my stomach sank when I saw the news.There is no automatic route to citizenship in the UK for foreigners, not through marriage to a British citizen or even birth on British soil to non-British parents; there has long been a residency requirement component.The “settlement” route to citizenshipis – or was – open to those who have worked and lived in the country legally for five continuous years, and their dependants. After that five years, one can apply for “indefinite leave to remain” (ILR). After a minimum of a year on that status, one can apply for naturalisation, and then a British passport.If thegovernment’s new policiescome to pass, the route to settlement will now take a minimum of 11 years, not including any timespent in Britain as a student or on other visas that don’t count towards the settlement component. I know from experience that five years is already one long trial of keeping jobs against all odds and fighting sudden changes in the law. Doubling that time has ramifications that encompass everything from professional security to that supposed holy grail of immigration anxieties, “integration”.The panic about settlement is misinformed by temporary patterns and faulty premises. After Brexit and the pandemic, the need to support struggling health and care sectors led to a short-term increase in work visas. And what counts towards immigration numbers includes category errors, such as students, as well as an underlying assumption that all those who enter on long-term visas with a potential for settlement will remain. Areportfrom 2023 indicates that, of those on work routes in 2018, only 38% still had valid or indefinite leave to remain five years later.By this measure, not all workers and their families, not even half, are likely to remain in the UK and apply for citizenship – the punitiveness of the extension is disproportionate to the pain it will inflict. It is particularly gratuitously cruel as the 10-year limit will be applied retroactively. Those who came to the UK based on the understanding that naturalisation was an option, and made big life arrangements on that basis, now find themselves literally unsettled.The least ‘integrated’ part of British society isn’t the immigrants – it’s the elite | Andy BeckettRead moreOnce the proposed new rules were announced, I received a flurry of correspondence and calls.“I feel it is unfair,” Christine (not her real name), a skilled worker who was one year away from securing ILR, told me. “Moving to a new country is not a life decision that anyone takes lightly,” she said. These are people who are keenly aware that they have no recourse to public funds and risk having to pack up and leave if they lose their jobs. Christine understood that uncertainty was part of the deal – but thought it could be weathered if she followed the rules, with the promised reward at the end of being “accepted into British society”.Vulnerability is a point that recurred in conversations. Even for those happy in their work, the prospect of being in bondage to their employer for double the anticipated time seized them with a sense of precariousness. Workers’ visas are tied to their employers. They can’t just leave or look for another job, unless the new employer is willing to take on the cost and effort of sponsoring them. The new rules limit career prospects, and will expose people to the whims of bosses and employers. Every bad day at work becomes not just that, but a worry that your whole life in the UK may be over. Long-term sickness becomes not just a health calamity, but an existential one.Then there is the cost and administrative burden. Each extension or renewal of a visa can cost upto almost £2,000, in addition to the£1,035 annual NHSsurchargethat migrants need to pay (on top of national insurance contributions). Over a period of 10 years, a family of four could pay almost up to £35,000 in health surcharges alone. There are other potential cascading costs. Children without ILR, for example, will enter the university system as overseas students, and may be treated as such for fees purposes.Many of these human consequences have not been thought through. We know this because one chilling aspect of the new policies is the lack of specificity beyond the headline summary. The extension comes with the caveat that some people will qualify “sooner based on criteria yet to be decided”, and that there will be a “consultation” later this year. To anyone who has dealt with the Home Office, this working-it-out-as-you-go-along language augurs the sort of unclear process that one immigrant in the throes of challenging a Home Office error once told me was akin to “climbing a crumbling staircase”.Above all, the rule changes show how little our politicians really care about integration. They constantly cite it as the epitome of what earns the right to be in the country and accuse immigrants of not holding up their end of the bargain.But being stuck on work visas for year after year amounts to the opposite of integration. It means you can’t vote, cannot have recourse to public funds if needed, cannot fully lean in to British society and participate with a sense of safety and belonging, as you’re constantly trying to minimise costs in case a change in circumstances means relocating. The policy creates a tier of second-class worker, a sort of migrant labourer welcomed for their work and paying of taxes, but shut out from the privileges enjoyed by British nationals.That’s the real cost of this shortsighted and heartless change. Thosewho come to the country and build a life, have or bring children, become part of the fabric of society, and work continuously throughout their naturalisation time might soon be prevented for more than a decade from having a relationship with the British state that is defined by anything more than fear and anxiety. If there were ever a “failed experiment”, this is it.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionKeir StarmerLabourMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The grandmother, 69, islying in a hospital bedin central London, perilously close to death after 245 days on hunger strike. She could still survive, but it will depend on the UK government taking strong action.Soueifstopped eating to try to save her son, the imprisoned British-Egyptian national Alaa Abd el-Fattah, an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience and winner of the 2024English PEN writer of courage award. He has spent more than a decade in an Egyptian jail cell because of his writings on democracy. Soueif wants more than anything else to reunite him with his own son, 13, who lives in Brighton and has barely been able to spend time with his father.Soueif’s hunger strike has been fuelled by her frustration with both her governments: the Egyptian government that heartlessly refused to release Abd el-Fattah at the end of his most recent five-year sentence, imposed because he shared a Facebook post about thetorture of a prisoner; and the British government, which has not been able even to visit Abd el-Fattah and has been regrettably timid in pushing for its citizen’s freedom.This is the second time this year that Soueif’s hunger strike has led to her beingadmitted to hospital, but the danger to her life is far greater this time after so long without food. Her blood-sugar levels are shockingly low and her family spend each day hoping she can make it through the next night. Her doctors say it is a miracle that she is still alive.The pressure on Egypt to release Abd el-Fattah has been growing. The UN working group on arbitrary detention last week issued alandmark opiniondetermining that he is unlawfully detained and that under international law Egyptian authorities must release him immediately.Given the overwhelming and urgent threats to Soueif’s life, and Egypt’s repeated insults to the British government and international law, the UK must now ramp up the pressure on Egypt to release Abd el-Fattah. Keir Starmer has rightlyraised his casewith the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, but we know this Egyptian government will not respond to words alone: the last three prime ministers also tried discussing the case without success.I have beenworking on Abd el-Fattah’s caseas part of a new all-party parliamentary group campaigning for British nationals who are arbitrarily detained, and I find the lack of respect shown by Egypt for the UK’s rights in relation to a British citizen alarming. With my colleagues, I recentlysubmitted evidenceto the foreign affairs committee inquiry noting that the UK has not taken any action, including sanctions, against any Egyptian authorities responsible for Abd el-Fattah’s continued detention beyond the end of his five-year sentence. That position should be urgently reviewed.This week I joined the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson, the former Foreign Office minister Peter Hain and the campaigner Richard Ratcliffe in calling on the government tochange its travel adviceto “caution against travel to Egypt”. In light of what we have learned from Abd el-Fattah’s case, the British government must make clear that a UK citizen who falls foul of the police state in Egypt cannot expect fair process or normal support from the British government. Hundreds of thousands of UK citizens travel to Egypt each year, making a major contribution to the country’s economy, and the truth is we can’t guarantee their rights. The Egyptian government will undoubtedly take notice if its failure to abide by the rule of law starts affecting hotel bookings for the winter season.Alongside this, the UK should be holding off any new trade and investment cooperation with Egypt until Abd el-Fattah is released. The British government should not be signing trade deals with countries that are arbitrarily detaining our citizens. Any plans for the conferenceannounced by the Egyptian governmentlast year to “pump British investments” should be shelved immediately and there should be no discussion of UK support forfinancial packagesto Egypt.Finally, the British government should look to take this matter to the international court of justice. The Egyptian government’s continued refusal of consular access to Abd el-Fattah amounts to a clear breach of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and Britain should seek to claim its rights at the world court. France has recentlytaken this stepin relation to two of its nationals held in Iran.Soueif’s bravery and fortitude is astonishing but if her son’s case is not solved urgently, the consequences for her and her family are too terrible to contemplate. Our government has a duty to use every tool available to secure his release. The time for relying solely on polite diplomacy is long past: the prime minister must demonstrate his strength and resolve in this case.Helena Kennedy KC is a Labour peer and was chair of the Power inquiry into the reform of democracyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Tory MPs know the future looks direHenry HillFairly or unfairly, the party is thinking not whether there will be a leadership challenge, but whenHenry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeMon 2 Jun 2025 07.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 12.29 EDTShareBack in 1997, the former minister and famous political diaristAlan Clarkidentified a potentially fatal flaw in the Conservative party’s leadership system. No, not the controversial membership vote – William Hague did not introduce that until 1998. For Clark, eloquent reactionary that he was, the problem was giving MPs the vote and formal mechanisms to challenge the leader when the old “magic circle” was abolished in the 1960s.The problem, as Clark saw it, was that it would turn the question of the leadership into a pageant without end. The press would always be able to speculate about a contest, and MPs looking to puff themselves up would have an easy way to do so. Over time, the party’s old norms of internal discipline would, said Clark, be worn away.A quarter of a century on, events lend credence to his depressing thesis. It was once said of the Conservative party that loyalty was its secret weapon; nobody says that today. In the 1990s, Clark could write of the foolishness of leadership hopefuls who missed their chance, waiting for a better shot at a job that had only fallen vacant a handful of times since the second world war; as it stands, David Cameron was the last Tory leader to remain in post for an entire parliament.There is surely no disputing that the Conservative party has become a highly unstable institution, and few institutions benefit from being unstable. But there is a compelling counter-argument: which of the recently deposed Tory leaders did not deserve to go?Boris Johnson fell because he could not command enough support from his MPs to staff a government; Theresa May because she could not steer the government through Brexit; Liz Truss because she tanked the party’s economic reputation (and its polling).Whatever you think aboutPartygate, orBrexit, or themini-budget, in each case the leader was failing at their most essential function: delivering victory for, or failing that securing the survival of, the Conservative and Unionist party.This is the context in which the current, increasingly feverish speculation aboutKemi Badenoch’s leadershipis taking place. Her supporters can fairly claim that the Tories have made a vice of leadership contests, and that their woman has not yet been in the job a year. Her critics can, equally fairly, make the case that she is failing at the mostbasic jobof any Conservative leader: survival.Last month’s local elections were a shattering rout. Overall, the party losttwo-thirds of the seatsit was defending; in several counties, it went from near-hegemonic control to single-digit shares of the vote. That has shaken complacent MPs out of the notion that if they held on in 2024, they had a “safe seat”; many have also just lost the councillors who formed the core of their local activist base.Were next year’s elections to play out the same way, the Conservative machine would be disembowelled across another broad swath of England. Worse still, it could suffer humiliating reversals in Edinburgh and Cardiff. Across much of mainland Britain, the Tories would suddenly be in a potentially fatal position: no longer being the most plausible rightwing option on the ballot paper.Badenoch’s allies insist that she needs time to turn the ship around. That was always an argument with a clock on it, but it has been worn thinner still by the brutal fact that theConservativeshave actually started goingbackwards. In May, the party actually under-polled last year’s (already catastrophic) general election performance.The polls also tell their own story. Prior to the conclusion of the leadership contestin November, the Tories’ share was rising as Labour’s fell. Almost immediately afterwards, its polling went into a nosedive – with Reform UK the main beneficiary.Fairly or unfairly, the balance of opinion inside the party seems to be not whether there will be a challenge to Badenoch’s leadership, but when.The most obvious opening is in November, when she marks her first anniversary as leader: the point at which the party’s rules stop protecting a new leader from being challenged. The window of maximum danger runs from then until next May’s local elections and their aftermath; if she survives that, it’s harder to imagine MPs finding the will to depose her later.But the Conservative party’s internal rules are much more flexible than Labour’s. That one-year immunity from challenge? It’s just a rule of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, and they can change it. If the parliamentary party gets its heart set on removing a leader, it can.With such a shrunken parliamentary party, the threshold of letters to the 1922 chairman needed to trigger a contest is lower than it was in the comparative salad days of the last parliament. Yet both wings of the party took heavy punishment at the general election, and the current balance of the parliamentary party favours neither.Badenoch won last November by consolidating her own supporters with the anti-Robert Jenrick vote. The key question is whether that second group will decide to move, either because of a plausible challenge from one of their own (James Cleverly 2.0?), or because Jenrick starts to look like the lesser of two evils – a possibility Badenoch increases every time she inches towards his positions on issues such as the European convention on human rights.Whether a new leader will save the party is another question entirely. The Tory party was once described as an absolute monarchy moderated by regicide; today, it increasingly resembles a state of absolute regicide.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet the promised rise in defence spending – from2.3%to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027 – suggests something less than full-scale mobilisation. Thestrategic defence reviewis systematic and detailed, but it remains an exercise in tightly bounded ambition. It speaks of daily cyber-attacks and undersea sabotage, but proposes no systemic institutional overhaul or acute surge in resilience. Given the developing dangers, it is surprising not to spell out a robust home-front framework.Instead, it is a cautious budget hike in the costume of crisis – signalling emergency while deferring real commitment for military financing. The review suggests that the more ambitious spending target of 3% of GDP, still shy of Nato’s3.5% goal, is delayed to the next parliament. The plan is not to revive Keynesianism in fatigues. It is a post-austerity military modernisation that is technocratic and geopolitically anxious. It borrows the urgency of the past without inheriting its economic boldness.The review marks a real shift: it warns of “multiple, direct threats” for the first time since the cold war and vows to reverse the “hollowing out” of Britain’s armed forces. But in an age of climate emergencies and democratic drift, UK leadership should rest on multilateralism, not pure militarism. Declaring Russian “nuclear coercion” the central challenge, and that the “future of strategic arms control … does not look promising”, while sinking £15bn into warheads, risks fuelling escalation instead of pursuing arms control.Given the war in Ukraine, there is an ominous warning about changing US “security priorities”. This calls into question the wisdom of being overly reliant on America, which is now internally unstable and dismantling global public goods – such as theatmospheric datathat drones rely on for navigation. Left unsaid but clearly underlying the report is the idea that the old defence model is no longer sufficient – for example, when maritime adversaries can weaponise infrastructure bysabotaging undersea cables, or where critical data systems are in commercial hands. It cannot be right that Ukraine’s sovereignty depends on the goodwill of the world’s richest man. But the private satellite network Starlink keeps Ukrainian hospitals, bases and drones online, leaving Kyiv hostage to the whims of its volatile owner,Elon Musk.The menace ofhybridwarfare – includingdisinformation, cyber-attacks, economic pressure, deployment of irregular armed groups and use ofregular forces– intensified in the last decade. This should see Britain forge deeper institutional ties with European partners, not just military but in infrastructure and information technologies. This would allow for a sovereigndigital strategyfor European nations to free them from dependency on mercurial actors.Though the review gestures toward greater societal involvement, it stops short of articulating a whole-of-society doctrine likeNorway’s. This, when some analysts say thethird world warhas already begun with a slow, global breakdown of the post-1945 institutional order. The defence review should be about more than missiles and missions. It must also be about whether the country can keep the lights on, the gas flowing, the internet up and the truth intact. This review sees the threats, but not yet the system needed to confront them. In that gap lies the peril.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now their champions are fighting backMon 2 Jun 2025 14.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 19.25 EDTShareAboost to Sure Start-type investment in local children’s services is expected to feature in next week’s spending review – even while a more comprehensivechild poverty planhas been put off until the autumn. Solid evidence, as well as a mountain of anecdotes, support the reputation of New Labour’s flagship early years policy. But Sure Start was not New Labour’s only way of targeting communities based on need. The channelling of about £2bn to 39 of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England under the New Deal for Communities was another key strand of the Blair and Brown governments’ anti-poverty programme.Unfortunately, the idea behind this – that ministers should tackle “left-behind” communities with dedicated funding – was discredited by its association with levelling up. So central was this brand to Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit premiership that a government department was renamed after it. But his promisesmostly weren’t kept, and the title was dropped last year. Since then, it is fair to say that geographical inequalities have taken a back seat to priorities including health and housing.Champions of locally led renewal have now regrouped. The Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods has not yet come up with a catchphrase to replace levelling up. But Reform UK’s648 new council seatshave injected an increased sense of urgency into discussions about the places and voters that are proving most receptive to Nigel Farage’s populist, anti-migrant message. Later this month, the commission will publish new research on how English neighbourhoods have fared in recent decades. Hopes have risen that the spending review will see more resources directed towards those that the commission calls “mission‑critical” due to their high position on a tailor-made index of deprivation.Such funding is, of course, not a panacea. Because community development initiatives are more diffuse – typically seeking to improve health, education and employment outcomes, and reduce crime – they are harder to describe and measure than a project like Sure Start. But Labour’s New Deal broughtsignificant improvements, much of which were then reversed by a decade of austerity. Today, about 1 million people in England live in neighbourhoods – many of them in coastal or ex-industrial towns – where the commission believes targeted investment could help arrest a further slide into decline.Micromanagement from Whitehall was part of the reason forlevelling up’s failure. This is a mistake Labour must not repeat. Regeneration is best done with communities – not to them. It is simply not possible to direct granular neighbourhood improvements from London. If new funding is announced, local authorities and mayors must be empowered to oversee how it is spent without the hurdles of overly complex bidding systems. If that means a role for Reform UK councillors, as well as local Labour MPs, then so be it. The alternative is the corrosive favouritism ofpork-barrel politics.Different approaches attract different champions. AsGordon Brownpointed out last week, removing the two-child limit would have a far more dramatic effect on family finances than any number of local family hubs (currently the closest thing to Sure Start). The impact of place-based spending must be considered alongside other investment. But while allocating budgets to struggling neighbourhoods does not sweep their problems away, it does have advantages. Labour should bury the disappointments of levelling up and reclaim the initiative.Explore more on these topicsRegenerationOpinionLabourInequalityTony BlairPovertyGordon BrownKeir StarmereditorialsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he could only watch on helplessly as his opponent threaded four outlandish winners to break his serve to love.It was that kind of evening for Draper, the fifth seed in Paris, who was thoroughly outplayed by a stupendous performance from the unseeded Alexander Bublik. The Kazakhstani held his nerve in front of an ­ebullient Court Suzanne Lenglen crowd to close out an immense 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win and reach a grand slam quarter-final for the first time in his career.Djokovic brushes Norrie aside to reach record 19th quarter-final in ParisRead moreInstead of a tough, attritional battle with Alex de Minaur, the ­highest‑ranked seed in his section, Draper found himself against the enigmatic 27-year-old, who dramatically toppled De Minaur from two sets down in the second round. Bublik has been as high as No 17 in the rankings – he is now No 62 – and on a good day he is an incredibly dangerous and unpredictable player. This was a miraculous day.He said: “I have a certain skill set to play tennis, and it worked marvellously today – 100% one of the best days of my life and one of the best matches I have ever played in my life. That was as simple as that.”From the beginning, Bublik showed just how good he can be as he rolled through his early service games with a mixture of pinpoint serving, destructive shot­making off both wings and, most strikingly, a relentless stream ofperfectly weighted drop shots.The first set, however, progressed just how many thought it would. ­Bublik is as well known for his ­unstable temperament and ­wavering focus as he is for his undeniable ­talent. In the tight moments, Draper’s superior return of serve, movement and point-by-point focus earned him the first set.The start of the second set was ­similarly unsurprising. Still reeling from the abrupt end to the first set, Bublik handed over a service game with a series of ill-advised drop shots. Just as it seemed like Draper had the match under control, however, it all fell apart.Bublik immediately forced himself back into the match with a spectacular exhibition of varied attacking tennis. He served brilliantly, keeping Draper out of his service games, pounding his excellent two-handed backhand and he continued to suffocate the left-hander with sickly sweet drop shots from all parts of the court.View image in fullscreenAlexander Bublik falls to the floor as the emotion engulfs him after beating Jack Draper.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesAgainst an opponent who seemed to be able to do anything he wanted with the ball, Draper just could not keep up. As his first serve crumbled, he lost confidence in his forehand and retreated into his shell.Bublik has shown throughout his career that he can play quality tennis, but sustaining such an ­incredible level across the best of five sets against one of the leading players in the world is another question altogether. Somehow, he just kept on going. “I don’t play many matches where I feel like it’s almost out of my control what’s going on, and he made that happen today,” Draper said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They make you feel extremely uncomfortable, and they make you feel like you can’t do much. He did that today.”Bublik finished the match with 37 drop‑shot attempts, hitting 12 clean winners behind them alone. He also struck 68 winners compared to 37 from Draper. “He missed hardly any [drop shots],” Draper said. “They were all incredibly good. It’s tough, because you know that’s coming, but yet he can unload on the forehand as well. You just don’t know what to do.”Considering the momentum Draper had built and positivity surrounding him in Paris, this will be an incredibly tough defeat for him to digest. He sees himself competing for these titles, not merely reaching the second week. However, after starting this season simply seeking his first breakthrough on red clay, he ended this period having won numerous matches, beaten quality players and established himself as a true threat. This loss will simply form another part of his development.“I’m hurt, and for sure I’m really disappointed,” the 23-year-old said. “I had an opportunity today, and I missed my opportunity, for sure. I struggle to put things in perspective, but I think I am proud of the effort I’ve done on the clay. I think I’ve really improved. I think last year I was leaving here, first-round loss, being 40 in the world and very disappointed with my tennis and not sure, you know, where I was going with it. This year I’m ­leaving No 5 in the world.”Bublik’s next opponent is none other than Jannik Sinner, the Italian world No 1, who continued his bid for a fourth grand slam title with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 victory against the Russian 17th seed Andrey Rublev.Explore more on these topicsFrench OpenJack DraperFrench Open 2025TennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a victory for a team built with a coherent vision, and a rebuke to those who believe the game is just about collecting the biggest names. It was avictory for Luis Enrique, a very fine coach who has suffered dreadful personal tragedy. It was a victory for forward-thinking, progressive, fluent football.But it was also a victory for sportswashing.If you could divorce the game from its context, it was mesmerising. PSG were brilliant and although Inter were awful, at least some of that awfulness was provoked by the relentless energy of PSG. The five-goal margin was the widest in any European Cup or Champions League final and it’s hard to believe any final has been anywhere near so one-sided (at least until the next day’s Concacaf Champions Cup final, won bythe same 5-0 scoreline).Four times before, there had been a four-goal margin in the Champions League final. There was Real Madrid’sfabled 7-3 victoryover Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park in 1960, the game that so inspired the future Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. But part of the fascination there was that Frankfurt were also an exceptional side. They had beaten Rangers 12-4 on aggregate in the semi and they were good enough to take the lead – even if their second and third goals came as part of a four-goal flurry between the 71st and 75th minutes.Our Champions League team of the season: a teen sensation to a marauding GunnerRead moreBayern beat Atlético 4-0 in 1974, but that was in a replay. WhenMilan beat Barcelona 4-0 in 1994, it was a shock, and a huge tactical victory for Fabio Capello over Johan Cruyff, but until the fourth went in there was still a sense that Barcelona might come back. Milan’s 4-0 win over Steaua Bucharest in 1989 was perhaps the closest to Saturday; they were emphatic winners and Arrigo Sacchi said it was the closest any of his sides came to achieving his ideal of football.Even whenBarcelona outplayed Manchester Unitedin 2011, United had enough resilience to restrict them to three, even to force an improbable equaliser. It was not the capitulation of Inter.Barcelona must have watched Saturday’s final with disbelief; how had theylost the semi-finalto that Inter? How had they allowed themselves again and again to be undone at set plays and on the counter?The sense is that Saturday will be a defining victory. This is a young PSG side. TheChampions Leagueis a notoriously difficult tournament to retain for everybody apart from Real Madrid, but there’s no reason why this can’t be the first Champions League of many. After the years of the club as a celebrity circus, one which admittedly helped establish their brand, they have a rational recruitment policy and an intense and gifted manager. And they are undoubtedly fun to watch.Which is what makes sportswashing so insidious. On the pitch PSG are what a football club should be. But the fact remains that they are owned by Qatari Sports Investments, and that state support gives them an enormous advantage over other clubs financed by more traditional means. QSI invested in PSG six months after the meeting at the Élysée Palace in November 2010 – a month before Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup – between the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president of Uefa, Michel Platini, and Tamim al-Thani, the crown prince of Qatar – now the emir. PSG was just part of wave of Qatari investment in France, although it should be stressed that Platini maintains he had already decided to vote for Qatar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inter are one of the big three in Italy. They have won the European Cup/Champions League three times. For a long time, they were sustained by the wealth of the Moratti family. They are not minnows in any sense. And yet, according to Deloitte, their annual revenue is less than half that of PSG. Among PSG’s sponsors are Qatar Airways and the Qatar Tourism Agency; state support can oil a lot of wheels.Qataris a countryin which workers are routinely exploited, women are subject to male guardianship laws, same-sex relations are outlawed and freedom of expression severely restricted. It is also the country that hosted thegreatest World Cup final of all timein 2022 and that owns the best team in European (and therefore world) football. Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of PSG, is also the chair of the beIN media group, a major player in the broadcasting of football, and is head of the European Clubs Association, in which role he was seated on Saturday next to the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin. He is enormously influential and is answerable, ultimately, to QSI, of which he is chair.Inter have lost in two of the last three Champions League finals. Both defeats have been to state-owned clubs. This is modern football, the stage for geopolitical manoeuvring. It used to be easy to laugh at PSG, who had spent a fortune on ageing stars who reliably collapsed under pressure. This latest iteration looks more like a football team. It is admirable in many ways. The football is both thrilling and successful. But it is still sportswashing.On this day …View image in fullscreenGiorgio Ferrini, centre, is sent off by the British referee Ken Aston during Italy v Chile.Photograph: APBefore the BBC screened highlights of Chile’s 2-0 victory over Italy at the 1962 World Cup, the presenter David Colemanwarned viewersthat what they were about to see was, “the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of the game”.He wasn’t wrong. The first foul was committed after 35 seconds and matters had got so out of hand by the eighth minute that Italy’s Giorgio Ferrini was sent off for a foul on Honorino Landa. He refused to leave the field, leading to a melee that was only ended by the intervention of police. In the confusion, Chile’s Léonel Sánchez landed a left hook on Humberto Maschio, breaking his nose. As the mayhem continued, Sánchez got away with cuffing Mario David in the face, but David responded a couple of minutes later with a flying kick to the head for which he was sent off. Chile wonwhat became known as the Battle of Santiago2-0.The violence had been provoked by critical articles written by two Italian journalists as they covered the draw in Santiago several months earlier.

And you see as the years go on, and more and more players have done it, and then now we’ve got all the Arsenal girls as well, it’s just fantastic for us as an England team and us as a country, to have so many more players who are doing great things and achieving great things.”The Arsenal quintet of Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Alessia Russo, Chloe Kelly and Lotte Wubben-Moy all featured in the 1-0 win against Barcelona on 24 May, alongside Arsenal’s Spain midfielder Mariona Caldentey, who was full of praise for Sarina Wiegman’s team on Monday, said: “They have won already the Euros and have played big games already, and of course when you win you feel stronger and have more confidence. That’s always dangerous.We could see against Portugal[on Friday] how they won that game with six goals and they are one of the best teams in the world. We know and respect that, but we have confidence in ourselves as well.”View image in fullscreenMillie Bright is taking a break for her mental health and to recover from the domestic season with Chelsea.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesEngland have been without Bronze’s Chelsea teammate Millie Bright in this international camp while the centre-back takes a break for her mental health as well as to allow her body to recover after the domestic season and, speaking for the first time about Bright’s decision, Bronze said: “She’s missed. We’ve all spoken to Millie during the week. We’ve just offered her our support. Both physically and mentally, it’s been a long season for everyone but, having spent every day with Millie, I know she’s someone who’s quite tough and maybe just holds a lot in, so I think it’s been quite brave for her to come out and speak. And just from a friend’s perspective, I just want her to be OK, and give her as much time as she needs to feel OK again.”Spain, who will be without the Manchester City left-back Leila Ouahabi owing to an ankle injury, were 5-1 winners in Belgium on Friday to stay at the top of Group A3 of the Nations League, with England in second spot, before the decider on Tuesday, with only one team progressing to the semi-finals in October. This is the final fixture before Wiegman names her 23-player squad for the European Championship on Thursday and she says she is nearly ready to make her final decisions.Asked how many more selections she had to make, she said: “We’re pretty close. Of course you still want to get through the game [against Spain] and then make the final decisions, but we are pretty close.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, short-term, trying to win that game, and a little longer-term, a bit long-term, it’s preparation for the Euros, which of course is the bigger picture.“If a player has a little injury and is a risk for the Euros then I wouldn’t play her. That’s one difference.

Based in Cardiff, where bums on seats can be a challenge, and lacking Welsh representation on the field, they have been the butt of a few jokes during the tournament’s short history.But for Sanjay Govil, an IT entrepreneur and the owner of Washington Freedom in Major LeagueCricket(MLC), the appeal of “one team, one country” was too great, likewise the “chemistry” during talks with the top brass at Glamorgan. Though he was on a plane when the auction took place, he secured a 49% stake in Welsh Fire, later raised to 50%, that valued the team at £84.6m, more than Trent Rockets or Birmingham Phoenix.County cricket: Lancashire, Sussex and Somerset lead way in T20 BlastRead moreAs Govil outlines his vision for Welsh Fire the most eyebrow-raising remark arguably comes when discussing the future of the Hundred at large and whether, like a number of observers, he believes the 100-ball format is simply one too many for an overstuffed sport.“I absolutely see it the same way,” he says. “The Hundred should at some point follow the T20 format because you already have one-day cricket, you have T20, you have Test cricket, right? And just having one more variation, which is off from any other strategy … from a longer-term perspective it would just be better as a T20. But that is something for the future. And [the counties] already have a T20 tournament.”Govil is reluctant to call himself an owner just yet, with the new model not kicking in until 2026 and investors still to sign the contracts with the England and Wales Cricket Board. The delay, he says, comes down to the number of lawyers involved, even if the sticking points reportedly centre onbroadcast money, sponsorship and representation on the Hundred’s governing body.This impasse is expected to be resolved soon, after which Govil, a tech magnate who made his fortune founding Infinite Computer Solutions in the US will formally become a major player in English cricket. Born in Canada and raised in India, Govil says that alongside a love of Test cricket –plus India’s era-defining World Cup win in 1983– he grew up following county cricket scores in the newspapers. “Being associated with the Hundred is a dream come true,” he says.This investment in Welsh Fire is a passion project, it appears, but Govil stresses that passion has always underpinned his work. As for the lack of Welsh players in the two squads – and the fact that the last England men’s player produced by Glamorgan was Simon Jones more than 20 years ago – he says he has “not given it much thought” due to his focus on getting the deal done. More broadly, he prefers to leave the cricket to the coaching staff and take a “back seat”.That said, as the owner of Washington Freedom, a team coached by Ricky Ponting and featuring Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell during last year’s title win, the vision for the men’s team is clear. In time Govil wants to marry up the two “WF” franchises – the initials are a happy coincidence, he says – and secure players to feature in tournaments that currently run back-to-back.View image in fullscreenWelsh Fire’s women’s team before their match against Birmingham Phoenix at Sophia Gardens last August.Photograph: Harry Trump/ECB/Getty Images“Smith is playing for Welsh Fire this summer, so that is the first player from Washington Freedom,” says Govil. “We have tremendous talent in our [Washington] team and they have expressed great interest in playing in the Hundred. With MLC and the Hundred so close to each other, we have an opportunity to sign up players for multi-league. It is important to build local talent also but these things don’t change overnight.”The notion of tournament-hopping players flags the broader direction of travel for the sport and as a self-professed Test cricket lover one would assume Govil to have concerns. There are only 12 months in a year and the squeeze created by the franchise world’s tractor beam means something will have to give. “Cricket might go the way of football in Europe, where they play for the clubs but then play for the country when required,” he says. “There is still going to be Test cricket, but maybe – again, I’m just thinking through it – it is played just three months a year in two blocks of six weeks. Then X amount of time for the IPL, MLC, the Hundred etc. And not all players overlap. But I see the calendars evolving.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs well as the broader plan, what comes across is just how collegiate the Hundred team owners are despite four coming from established Indian Premier League teams and four relative newcomers. They are rivals, clearly, but Govil says they are also “a family” who happily offered him guidance when first setting up his MLC team. It makes sense. A rising tide lifts all boats.It will be interesting to discover whether Govil’s view on the 100-ball format is shared by others; whether they have simply bought stakes in English cricket and plan to shape what this means at a later date. Another question is whether TV rights for the Hundred will be sold separately in future. The current deal has the English summer bundled up as one product and means Test cricket – still the No 1 format in the UK – could even be subsidising the thing that threatens to strangle it.“You will only know if they are split up, right?” says Govil. “I am a very firm believer in the market determining your price. And so I believe the TV contract should be separate. Or we’re guessing. Maybe it is correct that Test cricket is subsidising the Hundred. But maybe it is the other way around. The TV money [from Sky] went up when the Hundred came in, no? But I like objectivity. Everything should be simple.”A laudable sentiment – although when it comes to the Hundred, a tournament that has split opinions and looks likely to change, simplicity has been a rarity.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The world champion knows it and on Mondayhe admitted as muchwith something of a mea culpa on social media. Yet it also must be considered that it is part and parcel of what makes Verstappen so competitive, albeit in this case in an entirely unedifying and self‑defeating fashion.Angry and frustrated at a sequence of events in Barcelona, including having to cede a place to Russell, Verstappen surrendered to his baser instincts. Having pulled over to give the place to Russell, he clearly then felt a point had to be made and accelerated back up the inside to collide with the Mercedes.‘Not right’: Verstappen issues veiled apology for Russell crash at F1 Spanish GPRead moreHe took a 10-second penalty, dropping him to 10th, putting him 49 points behind the championship leader Oscar Piastri, with three points added to his licence. One more penalty and he will receive a one-race ban.He conceded on Monday that he was “frustrated”, his emotions were running high and that the move was “not right and shouldn’t have happened”.Clearly he had had time to cool down and gain some perspective from what was a moment of madness, but even given the chain of events – which were hardly rage-inducing stuff – this was still shocking from an F1 veteran at 27 years old and a four‑time world champion.It was the purposeless anger that really caught the eye, rather than the severity of the action itself.The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described it as “incomprehensible” and his interpretation of it in the immediate aftermath bears repeating. “The great ones, whether it’s in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level,” he said. “That’s why sometimes these greats don’t recognise that actually the world is not against you, it’s just you who has made a mistake or you’ve screwed up.”Verstappen has displayed this attitude in the past, while hisRed Bullteam have at times positively cultivated the “us‑against‑the‑world” stance, with their contention they have never been quite taken seriously because they are backed by an energy drink manufacturer.Verstappen has also been clear in the past that he believes the rules around overtaking are over‑prescriptive and this too doubtless fed into his frustration. He was similarly aggrieved in Mexico last season when he was penalised twice for two rash manoeuvres on the same lap against Lando Norris. “What is allowed, what isn’t, is not very natural,” he said on Sunday, in reference to the regulations.Even given that antipathy, it is hard not to sense that the driver who can be as controlled and composed as they come, who will grind out a result from nowhere, who has been dragging his recalcitrant car by the scruff of the neck to the front of the grid this season, can sometimes simply succumb to a base, emotive response that is really beneath him but which he cannot seem to quite suppress.That is disappointing, because Wolff is also correct in identifying Verstappen as one of the greats. He may be flawed but he is without doubt an exceptional driver, a generational talent. His uncompromising attitude, drive and competitive spirit inform part of what makes him so good and so hard to beat – but on Sunday those attributes went unrestrained to his cost.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen pictured in the paddock at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday.Photograph: Jayce Illman/Getty ImagesThe Dutchman shares those ultra‑competitive traits with others, perhaps notably Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna, but there is also a fundamental difference. When Schumacher ruthlessly and deliberately clashed with Damon Hill at Adelaide in 1994 and then Jacques Villeneuve at Jerez in 1997, he had a specific purpose in mind – the moves were with the intent of winning the world championship. Similarly, Senna taking out Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990. Cynical, ruthless, ugly and unsportsmanlike, without doubt, but notably with purpose.Nigel Mansell recalls that Senna’s uncompromising attitude was aimed expressly at intimidating other drivers. Verstappen’s wild lunge at Russell in Spain was none of these things. It served no end other than to vent his own anger and has left his title hopes hanging by the slenderest of threads.Worse still it coloured what has otherwise been an enormously impressive season in which he has stayed with the McLarens with immense determination and consistency, taking every opportunity and returning the maximum when he had none.This moment of madness was a pointless flailing that rendered those efforts all but futile and while he maintains he was never really in the title fight, his fearsome efforts thus far this season belie that claim because for all the rightful opprobrium from Sunday, Verstappen is better and more than the driver who gave in to his emotions. His legacy as a potentially great champion depends on him proving that.Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportRed BullanalysisShareReuse this content"

Similar trips are on the agenda for next year.PFA chief Molango voices concern over effects of post-season tours on playersRead moreTuchel is working with the FA’s medical and sports science departments on strategies to mitigate the effects of high temperatures and he is keen to give the players as much exposure to extreme conditions as possible. The German intends to pay particular attention to the physical condition of the players when ­attending gamesat the Club World Cup this month, while the FA will send operational staff to the tournament in the US to scout for World Cup training bases and hotels.Tuchel is understood to have expressed a preference for a pre‑World Cup training camp in Miami before England move to their tournament base. The location of the base will depend on the December draw.A long-haul trip for warm-weather training ­during the March international break may be unpopular with club managers concerned about potential burnout before the Premier League and Champions League run-in, but that will not concern Tuchel.After his first game in chargeagainst Albania in March, he warned top-flight managers that he intended to pick his strongest side whenever possible. The 51-year-old also questioned Mikel Arteta’s decision to select Declan Rice for the second leg of Arsenal’s Champions League last-16 tie against PSV Eindhoven the previous week, given they had won the first leg 7-1.Tuchel will have the freedom to take his side away next season ifEnglandwin their World Cup qualifying group to avoid the playoffs. The FA would normally stage two ­lucrative matches at Wembley before a ­summer tournament but will support plans to go away if he concludes it is the best preparation for the World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 25‑year‑old’s talent has flickered at times and he scored whenMaresca’s side beat Real Betisin the Uefa Conference League final last week.Yet Sancho, who struggled after joining Manchester United from Dortmund in 2021, was unable to hold down a regular starting place last season and it is understood that Chelsea have misgivings over buying him. They can pay a £5m exit fee to terminate the agreement with United and sources have said that the London club are edging towards that option. Chelsea think Sancho is talented and have been impressed with his attitude but fear he is not consistent enough. There remains a possibility that ­Chelsea could decide to sign Sancho if he agrees to a lower salary in line with the club’s wage policy.Returning to United would leave Sancho, who has lost his place in the England squad, in an awkward position. The attacker cut an unhappy ­figure after moving to Old Trafford four years ago and joined Dortmund on loan afterclashing with Erik ten Hagin August 2023. Sancho had joined Chelsea by the time United fired Ten Hag and hired Ruben Amorim last November. It remains to be seen if Amorim would want to look at Sancho in pre-season. United are looking to refresh their squad and sell unwanted players after missing out on European qualification.Gittens, who joined Dortmund from ­Manchester City’s academy, plays in Sancho’s position and is expected to cost £50m this summer. He scored 12 goals in 48 games in all competitions last season. Chelsea, who arepoised to sign the Ipswich striker Liam Delapfor £30m, have also tracked Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams, who is likely to prove too expensive, and were interested in United’s Alejandro Garnacho in January. There were concerns at the time over Garnacho’s attitude. They have been linked with RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons.View image in fullscreenChelsea are weighing up whether or not to permanently sign Jadon Sancho from Manchester United after an inconsistent loan spell by the winger.Photograph: Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Uefa/Getty ImagesIt is set to be another busy summer at Stamford Bridge, with Maresca also hoping to sign a new centre-back after leading his side into the Champions League and winning the Uefa Conference League. It remains to be seen if the arrival of Delap will be followed by Maresca targeting another striker. Chelsea like ­Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike but see him as too expensive at £84m. There is long‑term interest in RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, who is wanted by Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson’s future will be up in the air if two strikers arrive. Chelsea confirmed the signing of midfielder Dário Essugo from ­Sporting on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The England winger joined from PSV Eindhoven in January 2023 and scored 11 goals in all competitions last season but there is a feeling the 23-year-old’s ­development has stalled. Christopher Nkunku and João Félix, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Milan, are other attackers up for sale. Benfica are trying to sign João Félix on loan before the Club World Cup.The goalkeepers Robert Sánchez and Djordje Petrovic are on the market. Renato Veiga, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi are out of favour in defence and Wesley Fofana’s fitness problems mean suitable offers for him will be hard to turn down. Chelsea tried to sell Trevoh Chalobah last summer.Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Carney Chukwuemeka and Lesley Ugochukwu are available after making little impression in midfield and Raheem Sterling, who has two years left on his £325,000 a week contract, has no future at the club after a disappointing loan at Arsenal.Explore more on these topicsChelseaTransfer windowBorussia DortmundnewsShareReuse this content"

I will bring with me a huge amount of enthusiasm, dedication and ambition and look forward to a positive future together at such a fantastic club.”At the age of 33, Mason becomes the youngest head coach in the Championship and the move ends his seven-year coaching career at Tottenham.Mason, who progressed through Spurs’ academy to play 70 times for his boyhood team, was forced tocut short his playing careerin 2018 after he sustained a fractured skull in a Premier League match for Hull at Chelsea a year earlier.Mason held talks with the Belgian club Anderlecht in October before a mutual decision was made to remain at Spurs, which enabled him to play his part in the club’s first trophy since 2008.After two previous caretaker stints at Tottenham, including leading the club inthe 2021 Carabao Cup final, Mason has long been tipped for a future in management.Mason initially started coaching at youth level for Spurs upon his playing retirement before being promoted to Antonio Conte’s coaching staff three years later, not long after a seven-game spell as interim boss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are deeply frustrated that it has not been possible to reach agreement on this with Mr Abramovich so far,” the statement read.“While the door for negotiations will remain open, we are fully prepared to pursue this through the courts if required, to ensure people suffering in Ukraine can benefit from these proceeds as soon as possible.”The Guardian first reported in March thatthe government was considering this move, with the hope that resolving questions over the Chelsea money could be separated from a broader debate over how to free up Russian assets frozen by sanctions.Abramovichannounced his decision to sell Chelseafollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022. The billionaire oligarch, who had owned Chelsea for nearly 19 years, said he would put any proceeds from the sale into a charitable foundation “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”.A little more than a week after this declaration, however, Abramovich wassanctioned by the UK government, measures which remain in place. While the sale of Chelsea was allowed to go through, the proceeds could only be distributed when a licence was granted by the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation. That licence, in turn, depended on the creation of a foundation, which has yet to be set up with the Charity Commission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he would seek a parliamentary vote to confirm his majority.The dramatic move highlights the government’s difficult position as it comes to terms with the consequences of losing the race for the presidency.Populist Nawrocki’s triumph threatens Poland’s place at Europe’s top tableRead moreTusk leads an ideologically diverse and politically fragile alliance of pro-European parties, from agrarian right to social democratic left, which promised to reverse the erosion of democratic checks and balances that had marked the eight-year rule of the Law and Justice party (PiS).After 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the outgoing president and PiS ally, Andrzej Duda, the government had hoped Rafał Trzaskowski, a pro-European Warsaw mayor, would win the election and lift the threat of a presidential veto on progressive legislation.But Sunday’s defeat will make it very difficult for the government to deliver on its promises, extending the political stalemate.Nawrocki, who received public backing from senior members of the Trump administration, is fiercely critical of the EU and likely to ally himself wherever he can with other Eurosceptic leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. This risks divisions within the bloc at a time when it faces challenges including US tariffs and the war in Ukraine.While the role of president is largely ceremonial, with some influence over foreign and defence policy, it carries the critical power to veto laws, which can be overturned only with a 60% majority in parliament, which Tusk’s coalition does not have.No date for the vote of confidence has been set, but it could take place as early as this week because parliament is scheduled to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday. Unless there is a rebellion, the ruling coalition has enough votes in parliament to win.A clear win would also quash any talk about a potential alternative majority emerging on the right should some government MPs defect to the opposition camp.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has denied any involvement in her disappearance.The Sun reportedthat searches are to be carried out this week.A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “We are aware of the searches being carried by the BKA (German federal police) in Portugal as part of their investigation into the disappearance ofMadeleine McCann.“The Metropolitan police service is not present at the search. We will support our international colleagues where necessary.”The area near the Barragem do Arade reservoir had previously been searched in 2008, when Portuguese lawyer Marcos Aragao Correia paid for specialist divers to search it after he claimed to have been tipped off by criminal contacts that Madeleine’s body was there.Later, in 2014, British police were given permission to examine scrubland near where she vanished.Last month Madeleine’s family marked the 18th anniversary of her disappearance, describing her as “beautiful and unique” before her 22nd birthday and expressing their determination to keep searching.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The city hosted Eurovision in 2023, which generated £54m in direct economic impact.If a £1- to £5-a-night levy were introduced in Greater Manchester, it could raise between £8m and £40m a year, which could go towards infrastructure projects such as the regeneration of Old Trafford or airport development, the mayors said.The mayors said funds raised through a visitor levy would be ringfenced for local reinvestment, and said the government needed to act urgently, as devolved governments in Scotland and Wales are moving ahead with their own tourism levies, leaving English regions at risk of falling behind.“The Liverpool city region is a global icon of creativity, culture and character – attracting more than 60 million visitors every year and supporting a £6.25bn visitor economy,” Rotheram said. “That’s something to be incredibly proud of – but it also comes with pressures on our infrastructure and services.“A small charge on overnight stays – the kind most of us wouldn’t think twice about when travelling abroad – would give us the power to reinvest directly into the things that make our area so special.”Burnham added: “At a time when national resources are under real pressure, a modest visitor levy – something we all pay in other parts of Europe – offers a fair and sustainable way to support our local services.”McGuinness said: “A local tourism tax is so mainstream across the rest of the world you barely notice it, so it should not be a big step here in the UK.”Last year, areport from the landscape charity Friends of the Lake Districtmade a similar call. The organisation’s chief executive, Mike Hill, said: “In most of the places around the world that we’ve looked at that have brought in some sort of tourism levy, tourism numbers have actually increased, because the place gets better.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandTax and spendingLiverpoolManchesterSteve RotheramRachel ReevesLisa NandynewsShareReuse this content"

The new president will face major challenges including a slowing economy, President Donald Trump’s America-first policies and North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats.The election commission says voting began at 6am at 14,295 polling stations nationwide that will close at 8pm. Observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight.More than 15 million people already have cast ballots during a two-day early voting period last week, accounting for nearly 35% of the country’s 44.4 million eligible voters.In his final campaign speeches Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. He urged the people to vote for him, arguing that a win by Kim would allow Yoon’s “rebellion forces” to return.“If they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people’s human rights, the normalisation of martial law and our country’s downfall into a backward, third-world nation,” Lee told the crowd gathered at a Seoul park.Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament.Lee “is now trying to seize all power inSouth Koreaand establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,” Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan.Lee, who led the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, has been a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics for years. He faces multiple criminal trials, including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal, with South Korea’s supreme court recently ordering a retrial of an election violation case after overturning his acquittal, with instructions for conviction.Courts have agreed to postpone further hearings of ongoing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remain unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution.Should he win though, legal questions remain over whether presidential immunity would halt his ongoing prosecutions, as opposed to simply preventing new charges, potentially setting up another constitutional crisis.As a former child labourer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country’s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country’s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on a political division and backpedals on promises too easily.On foreign policy, Lee has not made any contentious remarks recently and has steadfastly vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has called South Korea’s alliance with the US the foundation of its foreign policy and promised to solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that is not much different than the position held by South Korea’s conservatives.Experts say there aren’t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump’s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the US military presence, as well as North Korea’s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and Kim avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, archaeologists using AIdiscovered hundreds of new geoglyphsdating back more than 2,000 years, predating the famous lines in the sand.“They are trying to rub out history,” said Ana María Cogorno Mendoza, president of the Maria Reiche International Association, a non-profit created to protect the Nazca Lines. “The area that is being separated is exactly where some of the oldest rituals took place, according to our research.” Maria Reiche was a German-born mathematician who pioneered research on the Nazca Lines in the 20th century.Archaeologists use AI to discover 303 unknown geoglyphs near Nazca LinesRead moreCritics of the move say it will weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve toinformal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak.Peru’s culture ministry, which decided on Friday to reduce the Nazca reserve from about 5,600 sq km to roughly 3,200 sq km, said the decision was the result of a 20-year study and consultation and did not affect the Unesco World Heritage destination or its buffer zone.“There has not been enough study to say it has no cultural or archeological value,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who has closely followed the decision-making in the case.“This area, which belongs to our ancestors, requires real protection and not just political expediency.”Luis Jaime Castillo, a former culture minister and an archeologist who has studied the geoglyphs said the protected area was already “infested with illegal mining and mineral processing plants”.Sidney Novoa, the technology director at NGO Amazon Conservation, who has mapped the site, said the area now excluded from the protected archeological zone amounted to more 2,000 sq km and was overlapped by some 300 concessions owned by miners on a controversial registry of informal miners purportedly in the process of formalising their operations, known as REINFO.Ipenza said the registry allowed illegal mining to continue with impunity and without state oversight, adding that the government favours mining over environmental protection.The move “exposes [the reserve] to a very serious risks and cumulative damage”, said Mariano Castro, a former environment minister. “The ministry of culture is not considering the expansion of hundreds of extractive mining activities that will cumulatively impact the existing sensitive archaeological zones in Nazca.”“This update responds to the need to more accurately reflect the relationship between the geoglyphs and the physical features recorded in the area, ensuring their protection and preservation,” Fabricio Valencia, Peru’s culture minister, told national radio on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The public fought hard for these protections, and we won’t stay silent while they’re dismantled.”The NPR-Alies about 600 miles north of Anchorage, and is bordered by the Chukchi Sea to the west and Beaufort Sea to the north. It is the largest single area of public land in the US, the Times reported.It was created at the beginning of the 20th century as an emergency fuel reserve for the military, and expanded to full commercial development in 1976 by an act of Congress. Lawmakers, however, ordered that land conservation measures and wildlife protections should be given prominence.Trump’s efforts to turbocharge drilling in Alaska, however, have not been as popular as he would have liked. Despite a promise to“open up” the 19m-acre Arctic national wildlife refuge, a proposed auction of leases in January, authorized by the previous Congress but a crucial plank of the incoming president’s energy strategy, did not attract any bidders.“There are some places too special and sacred to exploit with oil and gas drilling,” Laura Daniel-Davis, the acting deputy secretary of the interior department,told the Times.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationAlaskaDonald TrumpUS politicsEnergyBiden administrationJoe BidennewsShareReuse this content"

They are extremely dangerous.The explosive activity “had transitioned to a lava fountain”, INGV said, with the plume of ash expected to dissipate towards the south-west.View image in fullscreenOfficials are keeping a close watch on the volcano but say there is no danger to people at present.Photograph: Giuseppe Distefano/APThe president of the region of Sicily, Renato Schifani, said experts had assured him there was “no danger for the population”, with the flow not having passed the Valley of the Lions, an area frequented by tourists.Videos posted on social media appeared to show tourists hurrying down the side of the volcano, some taking photos, but AFP could not determine their authenticity.“The partial collapse of the south-east crater, which generated an impressive eruptive cloud several kilometres high and a pyroclastic flow, is a phenomenon that we follow with extreme caution,” Schifani said.High heels and risky selfies: Etna eruptions cause despair among mountain rescuersRead moreThe head of the regional civil protection unit, Salvo Cocina, recommended that tourists avoid the area “in consideration of the potential evolution of the phenomenon”.A red alert issued for aviation authorities said the height of the volcanic cloud was estimated at 6.5 kilometres (more than four miles).The nearby Catania airport was still in operation.Explore more on these topicsVolcanoesItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

All four UK nations recorded their highest mean temperature for the season, according to the Met Office.Alec Hutchings, WWF’s chief climate adviser, said: “This new Met Office data is a stark warning that climate change is no longer a distant threat – it’s here now and it needs immediate action.”The British spring is usually cool and wet, a season of umbrellas and raincoats. But since the end of February, high-pressure systems, often from the Azores or mainland Europe, have lingered over the British isles, blocking the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts that bring damp weather.UK twice as likely to have hot summer this year, says Met OfficeRead moreThe result was not only the sunniest spring on record, but with only three summers sunnier since 1910, the fourth sunniest season overall since records began.The Met Office recorded 653.3 hours of sunshine – 43% above average – over spring, beating the previous high in 2020 by more than 27 hours.Sunshine did not just bring heat on land: there was an unusual heatwave in the sea, with waters around the UK reaching record temperatures for April and May. Some areas were up to 4C warmer than usual.Lack of rain left farmers and gardeners struggling. By mid-May, the UK was experiencing its driest spring for a century. Recent rainfall has eased conditions slightly but this spring still ranks as the sixth driest since 1836. The 128.2mm (5in) of rainfall was about 40% below the long-term average.Emily Carlisle, a Met Office scientist, said: “This spring shows some of the changes we’re seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent.“The data clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th-century average, although natural variation will continue to play a role in the UK’s weather.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Lord Hayward said: “Without full disclosure, the risk is that any donation could be buying access or influence election results.”Announcing the new initiative, Reform said the team would start to go through all council expenditure, beginning with Kent county council, to identify wasteful spending in the manner ofthe unit set up by Muskunder Donald Trump with the aim of cutting wasteful spending.It said it would use artificial intelligence, advanced data analysis tools and forensic auditing techniques to “identify wasteful spending and recommend actionable solutions”.It said all council officers should hand over all documents requested, including internal investigations or whistleblowing reports relevant to financial matters.It added: “Should you resist this request, we are ready to pass a council motion to compel the same and will consider any obstruction of our councillors’ duties to be gross misconduct. We trust this will not be required.”The instruction was signed by the council leader, Linden Kemkaran; the party chair, Zia Yusuf; and the Reform leader,Nigel Farage.Announcing the scheme, Yusuf said: “For too long British taxpayers have watched their money vanish into a black hole. Their taxes keep going up, their bin collections keep getting less frequent, potholes remain unfixed, their local services keep getting cut. Reform won a historic victory on a mandate to change this.“As promised, we have created a UK Doge to identify and cut wasteful spending of taxpayer money. Our team will use cutting-edge technology and deliver real value for voters.”Farage told GB News that all of those involved were doing it on a voluntary basis. He said: “This is day one of Doge. The Doge team has gone into County Hall in Maidstone inKentthis very morning, a team of young tech entrepreneurs who are not being paid. They’re doing it of their own free will, and we’re going in to have a look at Kent, have a look at the contracts, to have a look at the expenditure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, Doge is active, up and running as we speak.”John Merry, the deputy mayor of Salford who chairs the Key Cities group of 24 councils across the UK, said Doge was “absolutely the last thing local authorities need right now”.He said: “I hear daily from members facing mounting pressures across vital services like Send [special educational needs and disabilities], social care and homelessness. In this context, it is difficult to see how Reform’s Doge initiative offers any meaningful solution. What councils need now is not inefficient cost-cutting at the margins, but a serious commitment to long-term funding reform – one that aligns grant allocation with local needs and supports a resilient foundation for economic growth.”Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “If you’re looking at Elon Musk’s Doge and thinking that is how we want to have our bins collected and potholes filled, you might be learning the wrong lesson.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKKentLocal politicsNigel FarageArron BanksElon MuskLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Buyers included people linked to sanctions, or facing serious allegations, or with warrants out for their arrest. In December,the EU revoked the visa-free travel agreementbecause of its concerns over the scheme.Tate’s citizenship was said to have been granted in December 2022, according to NXT Citizen, the agency that submitted the application, OCCRP reported. That month, Tate and his brother, Tristan, 36, were arrested by Romanian authorities on charges of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Andrew Tate was also accused of rape. His passport was issued in January 2023 while he was still being held in pre-trial detention, it has been claimed.The Tate brothers, who grew up in Luton in the UK, have been under criminal investigation in Romania since April 2022. It is not clear when Tate applied for citizenship for Vanuatu, which does not have a formal extradition arrangement with Romania.Tate’s spokesperson said he would not comment on the Vanuatu reports. The Guardian has also contacted Tate’s lawyers in Romania and the US.The Tate brothers have denied the allegations in Romania, and an appeals court said in December that a human trafficking case could not proceed because of legal and procedural irregularities. The case has been sent back to prosecutors.The Tates faced further allegations in Romania last August, including accusations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering, all of which they deny.The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.UK prosecutors confirmed last weekthey had authorised 10 charges against Andrew Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain. The charges are connected to three alleged victims. Tristan Tate faces 11 charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking, all connected to one alleged victim. They deny the charges.The brothers would return to Britain to defend themselves, their UK lawyer said last week.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaVanuatuSouth PacificPacific islandsAsia PacificEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was the DWP that caused it … I’m sorry, I’ve got to say it.”A coroner, Clare Bailey, recorded a conclusion of suicide which, she said, had been precipitated by the mistaken withdrawal of benefits by the DWP.Afterwards Dove said it was not a one-off failing by the DWP. “The way they have treated some of their most vulnerable claimants is absolutely disgraceful.”She added: “It should not have taken an eight-year fight for justice to get where we are today. It has been an uphill battle to get answers and accountability.”Merry Varney, a solicitor for Leigh Day, representing Whiting’s family, said the cause of death was the same for many other families: “The DWP.”View image in fullscreenJodey Whiting.Photograph: Family handout/PAWhiting, a mother of nine, was 42 and housebound – unable to walk even a few steps – when she took her own life, the inquest heard.It followed the stopping of her employment and support allowance because, the DWP said, she had failed to attend a medical assessment. She was deemed fit to work and was told she would also lose her housing and council tax benefits.Dove said the reason why she had not attended was because she had been in hospital with pneumonia at the time. She recalled seeing her daughter “shaking and crying”, feeling ashamed and embarrassed and saying she had lost hope of ever getting her benefits back.Dove said she was sure that the stress of losing her benefits was the trigger for her daughter to decide to take her own life. “I know my daughter and I know it was [that].”The first inquest into Whiting’s death lasted 37 minutes, her family said, and heard no evidence relating to the DWP decision.Dove has fought a long and relentless legal battle for a second, fuller inquest, going all the way to the court of appeal.That took place at Teesside magistrates court on Monday with the inquest hearing of Whiting’s physical and mental health problems which included chronic pain, making her dependent on opiates.Dove described her daughter as “the most caring person ever”, the “perfect daughter” and someone “not afraid to show her feelings”.Extracts from notes found alongside prescription drugs in Whiting’s flat in Stockton-on-Tees were read in court.Bridget Dolan KC, the coroner’s counsel, said: “She wrote about not being able to pay her bills and having no food.“In some she wrote about feeling breathless and having back pain and trying to pay her bills and being in debt.”Another note stated: “I have had enough.” One note ended with the words: “Debt, debt, debt.”An independent case examiner report on the decision to remove Whiting’s benefits found that mistakes had been made and her payments should not have been withdrawn.Helga Swidenbank, a director at the DWP responsible for accessibility and disability services, said the department should have recognised that Whiting had “good cause” not to attend a health assessment, given her illnesses and mental health concerns.She said opportunities were missed to identify Whiting’s vulnerabilities and people who worked for the department at the time were “deeply regretful and very sorry” for what happened.Swidenbank was not at the department in 2017 but said she thought staff were not as “tuned into mental health disabilities” as they should have been. She added: “I understand that there is a culture shift from being process-driven to being much more compassionate.”The department’s processes have changed but work still needed to be done, she said. “We are a work in progress.”The coroner said she was sorry that Whiting’s family had had to “walk such a long road” and described Dove’s persistence and resilience as remarkable.She recorded a conclusion that Whiting’s death was suicide “in the context of a deteriorating mental state, precipitated by the withdrawal of state benefits”.But she said she had heard of many changes and new structures at the DWP which left her satisfied that no wider recommendations were needed.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

However, while the risk of dementia increases with age, experts have long stressed it is notnot an inevitability of getting older.“Younger generations are less likely to develop dementia at the same age as their parents or grandparents, and that’s a hopeful sign,” said Dr Sabrina Lenzen, a co-author of the study from the University of Queensland’s Centre for the Business and Economics ofHealth.But she added: “The overall burden of dementia will still grow as populations age, and significant inequalities remain – especially by gender, education and geography.”Writing in the journalJama Network Open, researchers in Australia report how they analysed data from 62,437 people aged 70 and over, collected from three long-running surveys covering the US, England and parts of Europe.The team used an algorithm that took into account participants’ responses to a host of different metrics, from the difficulties they had with everyday activities to their scores on cognitive tests, to determine whether they were likely to have dementia.They then split the participants into eight different cohorts, representing different generations. Participants were also split into six age groups.As expected, the researchers found the prevalence of dementia increased by age among all birth cohorts, and in each of the three regions: UK, US and Europe. However, at a given age, people in more recent generations were less likely to have dementia compared with those in earlier generations.“For example, in the US, among people aged 81 to 85, 25.1% of those born between 1890–1913 had dementia, compared to 15.5% of those born between 1939–1943,” said Lenzen, adding similar trends were seen in Europe and England, although less pronounced in the latter.The team said the trend was more pronounced in women, especially in Europe and England, noting that one reason may be increased access to education for women in the mid-20th century.However, taking into account changes in GDP, a metric that reflects broader economic shifts, did not substantially alter the findings.Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, described the study as well-conducted. “The number of people living with dementia is still increasing due to our ageing population, but this study adds to the good news that more recent generations have a decreased risk compared to past generations,” she said.While the study did not investigate the reasons for the decline, Spires-Jones noted a number of factors could be at play. “This is likely due to interventions such as compulsory education, smoking bans, and improvements in medical treatments for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hearing loss, which are associated with dementia risk,” she said.Spires-Jones added the study had limitations, including that it did not rely on official diagnoses of dementia based on clinical testing.Prof Tom Dening, of the University of Nottingham, said the study contained good news but it should not be assumed that the trend would continue, given some of the biggest health changes to reduce dementia risk may already have been made.Prof Eric Brunner, of University College London, said it was important to look closely at recent trends and the impact of policies such as austerity, given other studies –including his own workrelating to England and Wales – have suggested dementia incidence, in other words the rate of new cases, may no longer be declining.David Thomas, the head of policy and public affairs at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said evidence suggested nearly half of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 key risk factors – from smoking to air quality – although he noted not all were within individuals’ control.“That’s why Alzheimer’s Research UK is calling on the government to put in place a strategy for preventing ill-health, including addressing dementia risk,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDementiaAlzheimer'sMedical researchHealthMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

An unresolved (trade deal with) China will result in empty shelves at retail for many do-it-yourself and professional goods,” a paper producer said.A chemicals producer reported: “Most suppliers are passing through tariffs at full value to us.” Many US companies have struggled to keep track of the rapid reversals in trade policy in recent weeks.The dollar dipped to $1.3542 against sterling after the downbeat manufacturing survey was published, close to the three-year lows in late May. It also fell by about 0.5% against a basket of currencies.Concern about the probable economic impact of Trump’s tariff policies intensified over the weekend, after heannounced a 50% tariff on steelon Friday – up from 25%. Trump also suggested China had “violated” the terms of a 90-day pause in the trade war between the two countries.Tariffs of 145% on Chinese exportswere slashed last monthto 30% for 90 days as the two sides agreed to discuss details of a wider deal. It is unclear what aspect of this truce Trump was accusing Beijing of breaching.The status of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs on a string of countries remains unclear, after a US court ruled last week that he overstepped his powers in imposing them –a decision the White House is challenging.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The country’s embassy in Washington confirmed it.Prime minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai received 44 votes, well short of the 64 needed, according to news site ikon.mn.The vote early on Tuesday followedweeks of protests sparked by reports of lavish spendingby the prime minister’s son. Some called for the prime minister to step down.Before the vote, Oyun-Erdene warned the vote could lead to instability and shake Mongolia’s fledgling democracy.Mineral-rich Mongolia is steeling itself for democratic changeRead more“If governance becomes unstable, the economic situation deteriorates, and political parties cannot come to consensus, it could lead the public to lose faith in parliamentary rule and potentially put our democratic parliamentary system at risk of collapse,” he said.He defended his integrity but acknowledged a mistake: “dedicating too much time to major projects while paying insufficient attention to social and internal political matters.”Oyun-Erdene had held the post for four years and survived previous calls to step down.Last year, parliament was enlarged from 76 seats to 126 after electoral reforms. It resulted in a coalition government.Landlocked between Russia and China, Mongolia has struggled to become more democratic after its party-state era. A communist state during the cold war, it has been transforming into a democracy since the collapse of the Soviet Union.Protesters have said the country’s mineral richeshave benefited business interests and the wealthy, while many Mongolians still live in poverty.“It’s very difficult to build that foundation for democracy” at a time that Mongolia also must tackle economic problems, which are a major source of people’s frustration, said Erin Murphy, deputy director and senior fellow of India and emerging Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“We still have to see what happens next and how the new government plans to tackle these issues,” she said.While democracy is yet to thrive in Mongolia, “it is taking root,” Murphy said.Explore more on these topicsMongolianewsShareReuse this content"

Parts of the opposition also called for a boycott.Still, the estimated 13% turnout is far below the more than 60% that tends to turn out for presidential elections, and also lower than any other federal vote in Mexico’s democratic history.Once blank and spoiled ballots are taken into account, the effective vote could be still lower.The opposition, which has been unable to find a response to Morena’s electoral machine since former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador first led it to power in 2018, seized on the low turnout to criticise the reform.“As we said from the beginning: the election of the judiciary was an absolute failure,”saidRicardo Anaya, a former presidential candidate from the conservative PAN party.“What we saw was a simulation, a fraud and a mess. Empty ballot boxes, ballots marked prematurely, and citizens who did not even know who they were voting for. This is not democracy. It is an insult.”However, there is no minimum turnout required to formally legitimise an election in Mexico.The vote count is expected to be protracted, and results will drip in over the next two weeks.Low turnout favours the clientelistic vote, and there was evidence of illegal party interference in the elections through the distribution ofcheat sheetslargely with the names of the government’s favoured candidates.Many of these sheets focused on the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena’s executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line.Other interests – including organised crime groups – may also have managed to place their own favoured candidates by mobilising voters.Over the coming weeks, experts will scrutinise the results to discern which interests have emerged with more and less influence in Mexico’s courts.The new judges will take their seats in a transformed judicial system in September.“Yesterday’s turnout at the polls met expectations,” said Sheinbaum. “It was an innovative process that generated interest among the participants.”“Everything can be perfected,” added Sheinbaum, looking ahead to the second round of judicial elections in which another 1,000 judges will be chosen. “We will draw conclusions from yesterday to make improvements for 2027.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As military officials scrambled to figure out who was passing military secrets to the Germans, they set their sights on Dreyfus, then a 36-year-old army captain from the Alsace region of north-eastern France.But Dreyfus was not the author of the note, as Charles Sitzenstuhl, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renaissance party, told a parliamentary committeelast month. He said: “It was the antisemitism of a section of the military leadership at the time, perhaps combined with the jealousy over Dreyfus’s exceptional qualities, all playing out against a backdrop of pressure from the press and nationalist and antisemitic movements, that led to him being accused without any proof and to the absurd persistence of this accusation.”Dreyfus was put on trial and convicted of treason. Publicly stripped of his rank, he was sentenced to life on Devil’s Island.The case, however, was taken up by a new head of intelligence services, who noticed that the handwriting on the torn-up document matched that of another officer, Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. But when the evidence was presented to top brass the intelligence chief was driven out of the military and jailed for a year and Esterhazy was cleared.As Dreyfus languished in prison, his case began to gain traction. Author Émile Zola became one of his most ardent defenders, catapulting the case into the spotlight with the open letter, titled J’accuse, which accused the government of antisemitism and unlawful imprisonment. The case split French society into twobitterly opposed camps; the anti-Dreyfusards who were convinced of his guilt, and the Dreyfusards, who saw him as innocent.In June 1899, Dreyfus was brought back to France for a second trial. He was initially found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison before being officially pardoned, though not cleared of the charges. It would take until 1906 for the high court of appeal to overturn the original verdict andexonerate Dreyfus.Eventually he was reinstated with the rank of major, going on to serve during the first world war. He died in 1935 at the age of 75.View image in fullscreenPromoting Alfred Dreyfus, pictured here in 1894, to the rank of brigadier general would constitute ‘an act of reparation’, Gabriel Attal, the former prime minister of France, said in May.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesFor years, lawmakers hadbatted aroundthe idea of posthumously promoting Dreyfus, culminating in the legislation presented on Monday. “The bill before you is the result of a unique legislative approach aimed at resolving a unique situation,” Sitzenstuhl told the National Assembly’s defence committee earlier this year. “It is a symbolic recognition of an extraordinary case, without parallel in the history of the republic.”Sitzenstuhl also suggested that Dreyfus could be entombed in the Pantheon, the Paris mausoleum reserved for France’s greatest heroes. The bill now heads to the senate for debate.The legislation makes it clear that the push to properly recognise Dreyfus was also a means of highlighting that France’s Jewish community – one of the largest in the world outside Israel and the US – continues towrestle with discrimination. “The antisemitism that struck Alfred Dreyfus is not a thing of the past,” thelegislation noted, describing it as a fight that is “still relevant today”.France has seen a rise in hate crimes: last year police recorded an 11% increase in racist, xenophobic or antireligious crimes, according to official data published in March.Explore more on these topicsFranceAntisemitismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But, after dying almost unknown, Gwen is now having the last laughJudith MackrellMon 2 Jun 2025 10.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 16.30 EDTShareWhen I began researching the lives of Gwen and Augustus John, the image I held in my mind was of the two of them, as very small siblings, sketching together on the coast around Tenby. For both to have escaped the narrowness of their modest provincial home, and established themselves at the heart of early 20th-century art, was a remarkable journey – and I was intrigued by what possible forces of temperament and upbringing might have driven them.It is hard to credit, now, the scale of Augustus’s celebrity. His youthful drawings were compared to Raphael; he was briefly acclaimed as the leader of British post-impressionism, then celebrated as the pre-eminent portrait-painter of his age. And while recognition came slower to Gwen, the singularity of her vision, drawing on early expressionism and abstraction, as well as her own mystic embrace of Catholicism, earned her a significant place in the modernist canon.He lived in a menage a trois, travelled in a caravan and had several run-ins with the policeBut if there are early clues to the Johns’ success they aren’t simple to find, because, apart from their mother’s amateur talent for watercolours, they had no other role models. Their childhood, in fact, was unusually forlorn. When their mother died in 1884, Gwen was just eight, Augustus six and a half, and their father was so felled by anxiety and grief he had no idea how to comfort them. “I used to cry all the time,” Gwen wrote, while Augustus would recall that, along with their two other siblings, they became a farouche little tribe, retreating behind a wall “of invincible shyness”.View image in fullscreen‘We ought to be free of ties’ … Mrs Atkinson by Gwen John.Photograph: AlamyYet it was misery that bred in the Johns a rebellious longing for escape – and, for Gwen and Augustus, their first and best escape was in art. They drew from the moment they were able to hold pencils, sketching portraits of the world around them. While they had only the vaguest idea of where their sketching might lead, when a teacher suggested that Augustus might do well at the Slade School of FineArtin London, Gwen insisted that she must go there too.The Slade felt like a miracle. The Johns were learning their craft, but they were also experimenting with love, with ideas, with the rackety fun of London. They were also as close as a brother and sister could be, understanding each other as no one else could, equally hungry for lives that would fill the void of their motherless upbringing.Yet beneath the intimacy there was also, always, an itch of sibling antagonism. At its roots lay Augustus’s childish, bullying resentment at being the younger of the two, and Gwen’s furious attempts to fight back. When their lives began to diverge, as Augustus and his work began to achieve a precocious fame, that itch could flare up again.View image in fullscreenHigh society … Augustus with actor Tallulah Bankhead.Photograph: Keystone Press/AlamyPart of the issue was the flamboyantly bohemian image Augustus had constructed around himself, to counteract the “invincible” John shyness. Beautiful and wild, he grew his hair long and wore hooped golden earrings. He lived in a menage a trois and had numerous affairs. When he travelled around England in a horse-drawn caravan, he had several run-ins with the police. And while the gossip columnists and most of the art critics adored him, the clamour of his success was difficult for Gwen. Even though she never doubted the value of her own work, and even though her life was no less unconventional – she went to Paris, she fell in love with both women and men, including the sculptor Auguste Rodin – she was increasingly impelled to distance herself from her brother.Augustus was hurt by that. He was also frustrated by Gwen’s growing inclination to keep her art to herself. Her pictures were like children to her, and while she needed praise as much as any artist, she often found it hard to send her work out into the world. She knew how much better she painted without the pressure of exhibitions and sales – and, while she could be very grateful to Augustus when he tried to promote her career, her instinct was often to reject what she regarded as his despotic interference.There was another set of reasons for this disparity in their fame. These lay, more starkly, in the fact that Augustus, as a man, had always enjoyed more opportunities than Gwen. The art world at the time was overwhelmingly male: almost all of the galleries and schools were run by men; and even at the Slade, which was unusually progressive in admitting students of both sexes, the teaching staff as well as the artists who dominated the curriculum were male. When one of Gwen’s fellow students, Edna Waugh, was told she might become “a second Burne-Jones”, she was spirited enough to reply: “I would rather be known as the first Edna Waugh.” Yet it was already clear to the women at the Slade that, once they graduated, the odds were stacked against them making professional names for themselves.While Augustus was rapidly taken up by a network of sympathetic (male) artists and buyers, and was able to survive on commissions and sales, Gwen had to support herself as an artists’ model. The fees she earned were “ruinous” but, even at the risk of poverty, she swore never to sacrifice her independence for the security of marriage. “I think if we are to make beautiful pictures, we ought to be free of family conventions and ties,” she wrote, and she only had to look at the fates of Waugh andIda Nettleship(Augustus’s wife) to see that most of her married friends ended up with little or no time for their art.View image in fullscreenSpurned marriage … Gwen in a self-portrait.Photograph: incamerastock/AlamyThere were so many factors – cultural, financial and personal – that shaped the trajectories by which Augustus and his art became so famous, while Gwen remained known to a small circle of connoisseurs. But the trajectories didn’t end there because, after their deaths, the reputations of the two Johns underwent a radical volte-face.There is no question that the quality of Augustus’s work declined during the second half of his career. Drink, combined with an incurable restlessness, corroded his talent, and so did the pressures of providing for family (he fathered at least 13 children and was, ironically, more compromised by “conventions and ties” than Gwen). After his death in 1961, his standing was further damaged by the volume of late, mediocre works coming on to the market, and by the inevitable fading of the legend that had once given such thrilling glamour (and marketability) to his name.In fact, the behaviour that had once fed that legend, the promiscuity and the wildness, was now more likely to be disparaged than cheered. This change in the political culture was one reason why Gwen’s own stock began to rise. Her relative obscurity had continued until 40 years after her death, in 1939, when her estate was taken over by the gallerist Anthony d’Offay. While the exhibitions and sales D’Offay masterminded were crucial to the explosion of interest in Gwen, so too was the campaign among late 20th-century scholars to restore female artists to their proper place in history. Gwen, according to Augustus’s granddaughter Rebecca John, had always been regarded as a “family secret”, yet from the mid-1980s onwards, she became the subject of numerous articles, biographies and even novels.Now, to a degree that would have flabbergasted most of her contemporaries, Gwen is the more famous John. The one person who wouldn’t have been surprised, however, was Augustus. Always the harshest critic of his own work, and the most loyal supporter of his sister’s, he once prophesied that in 50 years, he would be known “as the brother of Gwen John”. It was a prophesy uttered in a moment of gloom, but it spoke volumes about his relationship with his sister. The two of them, as siblings, might have become separated by time, circumstance and mutual exasperation, yet the bond between them was one that Augustus, in particular, was unable to break.Artists, Siblings, Visionaries: The Lives and Loves of Gwen and Augustus John, by Judith Mackrell, is published by Picador on 19 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

AsJarvis Cockerpoints out on Spike Island,the lead single from their first album in 24 years, their 2002 split went largely unlamented: they had already succeeded in considerably reducing the size of their audience with 1998’s claustrophobic album This Is Hardcore and 2001’s Scott Walker-produced We Love Life. An ostensibly valedictory greatest hits album spent a single week in the lower reaches of the Top 75. And the year after their demise, John Harris’s Britpop historyThe Last Partynoted tartly that Pulp’s music had “rather dated”. “The universe shrugged, then moved on,” sings Cocker, which is a perhaps more poetic reiteration of what he said at the time: the greatest hits album was “a real silent fart” and “nobody was that arsed, evidently”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for More.Photograph: no creditBut subsequent years significantly burnished their memory. It was frequently noted that, besides the Manic Street Preachers’ A Design for Life, Common People was the only significant hit of theBritpopyears that might be described as a protest song, a bulwark against the accusation that the era had nothing more substantial to offer than flag-waving and faux-gorblimey. At a time when ostensibly “alternative” rock bands had seemed suddenly desperate for mainstream acceptance, Pulp had become huge by sticking up for outsiders and weirdos. Mis-Shapes, for example, hymned the kinds of people one suspected some of Oasis’s fans would have happily thumped.They had also been quick to call time on rock’s disastrous association with New Labour, releasing the scathing Cocaine Socialism a year after Tony Blair was elected. If there weren’t a huge number of takers for Cocker’s musical solo projects, his national treasure status seemed to grow and grow. Pulp reformed in 2011 to general rejoicing, and again in 2022, by which point they could reasonably claim to be the only major Britpop band exerting an obvious influence on current artists (clearlySports Teamand, latterly, Welly both have Pulp in their DNA) and note that their infamous flop greatest hits collection had finally gone platinum.But there’s a huge difference between playing the old favourites live and making a new album. If you don’t want to sully your catalogue with a photocopy of past glories, you’d better have something new to say, something the oddly equivocal tone of Spike Island and indeed the Cocker quote accompanying More – “this is the best we can do” – seems to acknowledge. In fact, like Blur on last year’s acclaimedThe Ballad of Darren, Pulp have found a way to successfully apply their longstanding approach to a very different stage of life when, as Cocker puts it on Slow Jam, “you’ve gone from all you that could be to all that you once were”.Pulp: Spike Island – videoA man who once fantasised about cuckoldry as an act of class rage-fuelled revenge now finds himself addressing how divorce impacts on your potential to find love again on Background Noise (in a characteristic touch, this existential meditation takes place in the middle of a shopping centre). Tina effectively transposes the kind ofPulpsong that ruminates on missed romantic opportunities – Babies, Disco 2000, Inside Susan – into middle-age, the frustration sharpened by the fact that it’s 40 years since that particular opportunity sailed. Similarly, Cocker was always exceptionally skilled at drawing confused, youthful relationships and at making capital from the grubby mundane aspects of sex. He still is, although on Grown Ups, the relationship is depicted as taking place on a planet now out of reach, “because the rocket doesn’t have enough fuel” to get back – to youth, presumably – and on My Sex, all the grubby mundanity has taken on a pressing tone as libido dims: “Hurry ’cos with sex, we’re running out of time.”Pulp’s 20 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreGiven how strong the imprint of their frontman’s voice is, it seems almost pointless to note that the contents of More sound like Pulp – if Cocker was unexpectedly recruited as lead singer of Cannibal Corpse, they’d probably sound like Pulp too – but suffice to say the music here does all the things a longstanding fan might expect. There are melodies derived from Gallic chanson, tinny electronics, rhythms that lean towards disco, sprechgesang verses that build into anthemic choruses and a lot of flourishes that recall 70s pop (there’s also a surprising amount of violin redolent of long-departed member Russell Senior). More importantly, it does these things really well: the epic A Hymn of the North is as heart-rending a Scott Walker-influenced ballad as Pulp have ever recorded, while if they had released the joyous Got to Have Love as their post-Different Class comeback single in 1998, rather than Help the Aged, their commercial fortunes might have taken a different shape.More certainly isn’t going to convince anyone who doesn’t already like Pulp to change their mind, but then anyone who expects a reformed band’s first album in nearly 25 years to do that is perhaps grappling with wildly unreasonable expectations. It’s more likely that a reformed band’s new album might be a placeholder, filled with songs that pad out the hits live, but provoke a rush on the bars and loos in the process. That definitely isn’t the case with More. If this is the best Pulp can do, it’s more than good enough.Explore more on these topicsPulpJarvis CockerPop and rockIndieBritpopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But he is not a climate scientist.That fact might make him the perfect person to communicate the urgency of global heating to mass audiences.“You’ve got to speak to people in a way they can understand,” he said.That’s the purpose of a new video in which Cross co-stars with the renowned environmental scientist Michael Oppenheimer.“Humor, as I think has been shown over centuries, is a very effective way to get people to absorb the information,” said Cross.Almost 40% of world’s glaciers already doomed due to climate crisis – studyRead moreThe new video puts that theory to the test. In it, Oppenheimer plays the straight man, issuing a dire warning: “Heat records are being broken all over the world. In fact, last year was the hottest year since the industrial era began,” he says.Cross then interprets that message for laypeople. “Translation: the shit is hitting the fan,” he says. “And the fan is on maximum.”The video was released by the group Climate Science Breakthrough, which has over the past two years has made videos with leading UK comedians such as Nish Kumar and Jo Brand in an attempt to “help climate science break through to many more people - and unlock action”.“We’re aiming to reach beyond the converted and depolarize the debate,” said Ben Carey, one of the video’s producers. If the new video is well-received, they will enlist more scientists and experts to produce more of them, he said.The video series comes as part of a wave of climate-focused comedy launched in recent years. In 2023, the Oscar-winning director Adam McKay launchedthe non-profit Yellow Dot Studiosto make content about the dangers of fossil fuels, and the following year,climate advocacy organization Gas Leaks Projectlaunched amini seriesabout the dangers of gas stoves.These projects could help reach people who experts aren’t often reaching, said Oppenheimer, since “most of the training for young scientist is aimed at being able to communicate enough so you get your next job, not necessarily aimed at communicating to the public”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Indeed, George Carlin railed against censorship in the 1970s, while Bill Hicks memorably used his platform tospeak outagainst George W Bush’s foreign policy.“Even before standup existed, there was Molière and Voltaire and [Jonathan] Swift and Mark Twain – there is a huge precedent for artists using humor and satire to drive home a point,” said Cross.The use of humor may help drive the urgency of the climate crisis home for certain audiences, said Oppenheimer, particularly “when the news is so chock-a-block full of news that competes for people’s attention”. But comedy is not the only tool that can be used to better communicate the urgency of the climate crisis, he said.“Some scientists are excellent at communicating with religious audiences and can frame the issues in a way that resonates with them [while] other scientists are great at connecting with parents,” he said. “The point is, more scientists are recognizing that it’s not always enough to lay out the facts or the data, that we have to find ways to encourage people to listen and take notice.”Explore more on these topicsComedyClimate crisisTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet for all its faults it’s an honest, flawed attempt to show how complicated it is to meet someone in your 30s who may be The One when both of you already have entanglements or relationships or ex-relationships.It looks like a very personal work from Tezel, with moments that could be taken from real life. Chris Fulton plays Ian, a guy who has come back to his home town in Skye for difficult family reasons, and in the pub he meets-cute, or meets-intense, with German set-designer Kira, played by Tezel. They have a magical night where they stay up all night talking, but then have to part, both back to London where they pursue their separate imperfect lives, naturally excited and confused and saddened about what just happened and leaving us to wonder if they will find their way back to each other by the final credits.The parts in this film which are supposed to be joyous and life-affirming and adorable – Ian and Kira come close to dancing on the table over breakfast after their all-night talk – are pretty insufferable. There’s a moment in Anthony Minghella’s Truly, Madly, Deeply when Juliet Stevenson and Michael Maloney, to break the ice on their date, talk while hopping along in the street, and comedian Nick Hancock notably said that while watching this he realised he had more in common with any of the aliens in Star Trek than these people. It is how I felt some of the time watching this, as the dialogue switches from rom-dram loveliness to jarringly, unconvincingly acted scenes of shouty confrontation. It doesn’t, in fact, quite fall into place.Falling into Place is in UK cinemas from 6 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsDrama filmsLondonScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there it is: the stunning effects (which hold up to this day), the sprawling, larger-than-life cast and accompanying who-will-make-it-to-the-end? suspense, the earnest, cheeseball dialogue – whenever I feel anxious or down, something about The Towering Inferno offers solace.The most obvious reason boils down to one thing: nostalgia. My parents werefilmenthusiasts who would usually take us to a movie every week. And this was no ordinary experience: The Towering Inferno was the crown jewel in the 1970s disaster cycle, disdained by many critics for being trashy (while acknowledging it was entertaining trash). It was the talk of the schoolyard: whose parents were cool enough to actually take their kids to see this big-screen spectacle? Thus it was one of my primal filmgoing experiences: it accompanies fond memories of my parents treating us to something that felt as exhilarating as the circus.As I began film studies at university, the case for The Towering Inferno only became stronger: a genre analysis of the film suggested people were lining up to see it (it was the box office champ of ’74) because it reminded them of America itself, enduring the horrors ofVietnam, Watergate, racial strife and a flurry of political assassinations. Disaster movie casts were so full of familiar faces that everyone could find someone to identify with.‘I smile every time’: why Amélie is my feelgood movieRead moreBut as I continued to revisit the film – and all of the 70s disaster movies – it was clear they were also about old-school Hollywood grappling with the reality of the New Hollywood. Young directors were breaking the rules, independent production was expanding, the Hays code had expired and the studio system would never be the same. Stars of yesteryear such as Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones and (notoriously conservative) William Holden held court with the new iconoclastic superstars likeSteve McQueen, Paul Newman (who had made Nixon’s enemies list and declared it his proudest achievement) and Faye Dunaway (who, seven years earlier, had starred in Bonnie and Clyde, considered the breakout moment for the New Hollywood period).Each star inhabited their own mini-melodrama: would the ambitious journalist (Dunaway) leave her career to be with her lover? (He was played by Newman; did we have to ask?) Will the con artist (Astaire) reveal to his new crush (Jones) that his initial plan was to trick her into a scam? And really, is anyone actually safe whenOJ Simpsonis head of security? There were so many stars in this – hell, even one of the Brady Bunch (Mike Lookinland) is here as the obligatory precocious child – it was like watching Hollywood Squares goes to hell.Guardian writers on their ultimate feelgood movies: ‘ Pure sugar-rush’Read moreNot only were the actors forced to endure a lot of fiery heat during filming, they also had to utter some mind-numbingly rotten dialogue. When the secretary (Susan Flannery) having a secret affair with the building’s publicist (Robert Wagner) realizes they are probably going to get burned alive, she says: “Well, I always did want to die in bed.” How did anyone survive this screenplay? These lines were undoubtedly always groaners, but they’ve fermented into high-level camp.The meaning of each of those actors was something I encountered in further adventures in film studies. In his landmark 1979 book Stars, the British author Richard Dyer analyzes the ideological meanings of various Hollywood luminaries. When I spoke to him about developing his ideas for the book, Dyer confirmed that The Towering Inferno – with its complex, contradictory gaggle of stars of various levels of fame and clashing symbolic meanings – was part of his inspiration.If The Towering Inferno boiled over with old-versus-new tension, the people making it were clearly in the old-school camp. The film reminded us that even in uncertain times, American heroics, personified by square-jawed masculine protagonists, were alive and well. Sure, America and Hollywood had their downsides and greedy villains, but ultimately, there would be valiant survivors and people would prevail. Despite deep divisions, bad actors (real and literal) and brutal catastrophes, there are still good people around who will perform good deeds. Even in a deeply divided America, a collective challenge reminded us that we were all in this together – that something will emerge from the ruins of a tortured decade. A dozen years after the Cuban missile crisis, the idea that anyone was left standing by the film’s final crane shot was in itself miraculous.Come to think of it, it feels like it’s time to watch The Towering Inferno again.The Towering Inferno is available to buy digitally in the US and rent digitally in the UKExplore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsMy feelgood moviePaul NewmanFaye DunawaySteve McQueenOJ SimpsonDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One day, Joan confides to her two besties, fellow teacher Alice (Call My Agent’s Camille Cottin) and art teacher Rebecca (Sara Forestier), that she’s no longer “in love” with Victor and is therefore questioning the survival of her marriage. When she eventually plucks up enough gumption to confess her lack of feelings to Victor, he doesn’t take it well. Meanwhile, Rebecca is having an affair with Alice’s husband Eric (Grégoire Ludig); Alice doesn’t know but she doesn’t seem bothered that he’s a bit distant since, as she explains to Joan, she’s never really loved him that deeply. And wouldn’t you know it, she finds herself very tempted when she strikes up a long distance flirtation with artist Stéphane (Éric Caravaca) and asks Rebecca to be her alibi so she can go meet him one weekend – thereby opening up an opportunity for Rebecca and Eric to spend the weekend together themselves.The script by Carmen Leroi and the film’s director Emmanuel Mouret is deft enough to keep things in constant comic-dramatic motion, with lovers and romantic prospects constantly cycling through the ensemble as people keep hooking up and then having second thoughts or at least questioning their assumptions. It’s a minor miracle that the cast manages to charm throughout and keep the audience’s sympathies – instead of repelling us with their manifest dishonesty and delusions. For instance, some may find Joan’s belief in the primacy of being “in love” a bit childish and jejune, but Hair imbues the woman with such endearing vulnerability it’s hard not to forgive her flaws. Also, like any good French film, there’s tons of tasteful interiors and chic clothes and much fuss made of food and fellowship, as well as of love. It’s all a bit cliched, but made with such effortless elan it goes down a treat.Three Friends is at the Ciné Lumière, London, from 3 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsComedy filmsFranceWorld cinemaComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The writer of a new book explains his glorious allurePhilip HoareMon 2 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 21.21 EDTShareWilliam Blake may be known for seeing angels up in trees, for writing the alternative national anthem Jerusalem, and for his emblematic poem The Tyger. But his story is far more subversive and far queerer than cosy fables allow. It’s why Oscar Wilde hung a Blake nude on his college room wall. It’s why Blake became a lyric in a Pet Shop Boys song. And it’s why David Hockney is showing a Blake-inspired painting at his current exhibition in Paris.When I lived in the East End of London, I’d walk over Blake’s grave in Bunhill Fields every day. It felt sort of disrespectful. Perhaps that’s why he has haunted me ever since. Years later, while trying to write a book about another artist, I got ill and very low. Suddenly, echoing one of his own visions, Blake came to me and said: “Well, how about it?” I felt I had to make amends for treading on his dreams. I’ve met many artists – Andy Warhol, Lucian Freud, Derek Jarman – but it is Blake whose hand I would love to have held and whose magical spirit I summon up in my new book. He even gave me my title: William Blake and the Sea Monsters of Love. (A friend has since pointed out that the title sounds suspiciously like a 1970s album by a certain starman from Mars).His neighbour was the Chevalier D’Eon, a former army officer who fences in a black silk dressI was writing about a man who had died a long time ago, yet who still seems alive and among us. Born in 1757, dying in 1827, Blake had perfect timing: not to be confined by Victorian mores, but to live in a looser, revolutionary age. He only ever sold 61 copies of his revolutionary “illuminated books” – which, for the first time, placed images and words together. Each would be worth £1m now. Blake might have died in poverty and obscurity, but that is exactly where his potential resides – as an unexploded but benevolent device. His posthumous influence lives on in flash-lit scenes – as if his afterlife were a movie being screened in front of us.Cut to the 1820s and Blake’s young fans, called the Ancients, are led by Samuel Palmer, who bends to kiss the doorbell of their master’s lodgings as he passes by. They enact their Blakean cult in the Kentish countryside, swimming naked in a river and growing their hair long.View image in fullscreen‘Michelangelo thighs’ … Blake’s Newton.Photograph: artphotos/AlamyJump forward to Manhattan in 1967 and Blake’s new disciples, Patti Smith andRobert Mapplethorpe, are reading his poetry to each other every night in their poverty. They’re obsessed. Mapplethorpe gets a job in an antiquarian bookstore and when a copy of Blake’s revolutionary America: A Prophecycomes in, he tears a page out and stuffs it down his trousers. Then, freaking out that he might be discovered, he goes to the toilet, rips it up and flushes it away. That evening, he confesses his sin to Smith, who celebrates his act, seeing it as a fabulous infection of the sewers of New York with their hero’s subversion.Five years later, on the rocky coast of Dorset, Derek Jarman, deeply under Blake’s influence, recreates a Blakean scene for his first narrative Super 8 film. In flickering, saturated 70s colour, Andrew Logan poses as a sea god in the deconstructed dress he’d worn for his first Alternative Miss World that year. A half-naked young sailor floats in a rock pool. A young woman, wearing only a fishing net, plays the siren who lured him to his doom. That night, the crew meet Iris Murdoch in a nearby country house. She takes them up a hill to dance around a megalith in the moonlight. Murdoch cites Blake in a half a dozen of her queer-friendly novels, and discusses him with her lover, the gay liberation hero Brigid Brophy.Flashback to Paris, 1958: Allen Ginsberg, citing Blake in his outrageously queer poem Howl,emulates his hero by reciting it in the nude outside Shakespeare and Company, the famous bookshop on the Left Bank. He’s accompanied by a besuited William S Burroughs, whose cut-up writing technique is heavily influenced by Blake’s proto-surrealist texts. In 1975, in the New Mexico desert, David Bowie will play a queer alien, singing and speaking Blake’s words, in the Nicolas Roeg film The Man Who Fell to Earth.View image in fullscreenDeeply influenced … Derek Jarman’s At Low Tide.Photograph: Courtesy Luma FoundationLike Shakespeare’s Prospero or Doctor Who, Blake has the power to appear anywhere, any time, rewriting his own fate through his art. That’s why one of Oscar Wilde’s young lovers, W Graham Robertson, was so inspired by Blake’s sensuality that he became his greatest champion, using a multimillion-pound fortune to buy up every work by Blake he could. Presenting them to the Tate 40 years later, Robertson saves Blake for the nation.Yet Blake remains a secret, hiding in plain sight. In Milton, his astoundingly beautiful and prophetic book of 1804, he creates two images of male fellatio and a butt-naked Milton. They wouldn’t look out of place in a Mapplethorpe photograph. One reason Blake published his own work was to escape the censoring eye of the printer. It is this same transgression that powers James Joyce in 1920s Paris, as he deploys Blake’s queerness like a grenade in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. Joyce’s Leopold Bloom changes sex in a lucid dream sequence, while British grenadiers drop their trousers to bugger each other as an emblem of the anti-imperialism Joyce and Blake shared.In 1970s London, in their house that is as old as Blake, the artists Gilbert & George claim him as their saint. Like them, Blake would today be seen as one artist in two people. Misogynistic history has written his wife Catherine out of the story – but she shared his visions, printing and colouring them in. Then they’d spend the afternoon sitting naked in their backyard. “Come on in,” they’d tell visitors. “It’s only Adam and Eve, you know.”Shockingly modern, Blake burned with a fire that can’t be put out.Their neighbour is the Chevalier D’Eon, a former army officer who now performs fencing demonstrations in a black silk dress. D’Eon duly appears as Mr Femality in a witty salon skit written by Blake that today reads like a Joe Orton farce. Blake declared gender a mere earthly construction and agreed with Milton: “Spirits when they please / Can either Sex assume or both.”Faced with this fantastical cast, I can only wonder at Blake’s alchemical effect. His large colour prints – such as a nude Isaac Newton with Michelangelo thighs sitting at the bottom of the sea – have a 3D texture that still defies explanation. He was trying to make reproducible paintings. Like Andy Warhol and Albrecht Dürer, Blake trained as commercial artist. He believed in the egalitarian power of art. He even proposed a 100ft tall image of a naked “Nelson Guiding Leviathan” to be set over the road to London like a Regency Angel of the North.Shockingly modern, Blake burned with a fire that can’t be put out. His new Jerusalem was an achievable utopia, if only we shook off our “mind-forg’d manacles” – our prejudices about gender, sex, race and class. His art still inspires us as he shoots his arrows of desire from his bow of burning gold, standing there naked, bursting out of a rainbow. Blake’s new world is the one we long for, where we will all be gloriously free to love whoever and however we like.William Blake and the Sea Monsters of Love is published by 4th EstateWilliam Blake and The Sea Monsters of Love by Philip Hoare (HarperCollins Publishers, £22).

In The Möbius Book, her experiment crosses the blurred border of fiction into something else. Life writing, autofiction, memoir? Whatever you call it, The Möbius Book is deeply serious and engrossingly playful, and it lavishly rewards serious, playful attention.A Möbius strip is a length of any material joined into a loop with a half twist. It’s an uncanny shape, common and obvious, easily created and yet awkward to describe geometrically. For literary purposes, a Möbius is interesting because there’s intricate structure and constraint but no ending. It goes around again, mirrored with a twist. Lacey’s book takes this literally, the text printed from both ends, with memoir and fiction joined in the middle. Twin stories experiment with plotlessness and irresolution, while remaining aware of the way fiction attaches itself to linear plot and reverts to romance and quest. Characters find and lose love, find and lose meaning.In one half, two women, Edie and Marie, reminisce about their messy love lives and Christian beliefs in Marie’s grotty apartment, ignoring the pool of blood forming outside a neighbour’s door. In the other half, the first-person narrator leaves a controlling partner, recalls an ascetic adolescence and struggles to write and think about faith with clever friends during lockdown.Lacey is fascinated by literary form, finding fiction at once a constraint and a space for playLacey is fascinated by literary form and by the metaphors for literary form, finding fiction at once a constraint and a space for play. Late in the day, the narrator, “with trusted friends who knew how, got tied up and whipped”, as “a rite in all this, the chaos of having more freedom than I knew what to do with”. It’s impossible, in a book so preoccupied with crucifixion, martyrdom and self-denial, not to see the image of the twisted Möbius loop in this friendly bondage. The structures of novels and the iconography of Christian martyrdom are both narrative responses to suffering; both offer freedom through constraint. But for Lacey, suspicious of pleasure, the compatibility of faith and art is questionable.The two modes of the book, which I hesitate to call fiction and memoir because neither is wholly committed to realism or reality, undermine each other, with images and anecdotes reappearing in transmuted form. The shadow of the angry, manipulative ex-partner falls across both, challenging the narrator’s memories and intentions although, reassuringly, never inviting the reader’s distrust. Edie’s recounting of a transformative encounter with a dying, talking dog which speaks of the meaning of suffering (is “dog” a Möbius rendition of “God”?) is reprised when the narrator attends to a man lying on the street. In the first-person section, the narrator sees Matisse’s painting The Red Studio in New York’s Museum of Modern Art, “the red I imagine on the floor of an otherwise white room”, reflecting the blood pooling under a neighbour’s door that Edie and Marie in the novel section decide is probably “paint or something”. As the narrator comments: “Reality at large has never been my subject, but interiority always has been.”Lacey asks large questions about interiority, especially with regard to the subject of Christian faith. For some readers, it may be an alien idea that the sharply modern intellectual rigour on display here could be combined with religious conviction. How can a narrator who can play off Proust against Gillian Rose seriously expect to find consolation in the old myths about the baby in the manger and the man rising from death? It’s a question Lacey acknowledges, partly as unanswerable: “We want to speak of gnosis and mysticism without our phones listening to us and populating browser ad space with advertisements for Goddess Retreats and bogus supplements and acupuncture mats.” Even so, the narrator attempts an exorcism, employs an “energy healer”, is seduced by ideas about magic numbers. “Symbolism is both hollow and solid, a crutch, yes, but what’s so wrong with needing help to get around?”The question is not rhetorical. There’s a deep ambivalence in this book about needing literary and philosophical “help to get around”, about whether we’re allowed to want or need art, which is related to the narrator’s lack of appetite and consequent emaciation. “I was afraid of the line between basic needs and cravings, between living and lust.” The fear of slipping from necessity into pleasure shapes the distrust of fiction. What if storytelling is for fun? What if we don’t really need it? What if only what’s necessary is true, or only truth is necessary?Inevitably, the fictional half of this book refuses many of the satisfactions of a novel. Like a miniature homage to WG Sebald’sAusterlitz, the present action is mostly the recounting of past events, so that most of the characters, times and places appear only through a conversation between friends. There are complicated, triangular relationships in the background, between characters who never quite take shape, whose voices are only – and unreliably – recalled. Third-person narrative always calls into being a narrator, another layer of artifice, and here the slippage between present, past and past historic tenses also constantly reminds us that this story is at once engaging and not real. The questions are constant, implicit, teasing, elaborated rather than answered in the dark mirror of life writing. They don’t go away.

Both involve bombarding uranium-235 atoms with neutrons to produce a chain reaction via nuclear fission. Both were made possible in the same instant, at 3.25pm on 2 December 1942, when the Manhattan Project’s Enrico Fermi orchestrated the first human-made chain reaction in the squash court of the University of Chicago. “The flame of nuclear fission brought us to the forked road of promise and peril,” writes Tim Gregory.The bomb came first, of course, but atomic dread coexisted with tremendous optimism about what President Eisenhower dubbed “atoms for peace”: the potential of controlled fission to generate limitless energy. As David Lilienthal of the US AtomicEnergyCommission observed, atom-splitting thus inspired a pseudo-religious binary: “It would either destroy us all or it would bring about the millennium.”Nuclear optimism was shattered by the 1986Chornobyldisaster but, as the subtitle of his book advertises, Gregory is determined to bring it back. A nuclear chemist at Sellafield, where the Queen opened the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor in 1956, he’s a cheerleader for Team Millennium. Writing in a Promethean spirit of “rational and daring optimism”, this self-proclaimed “nuclear environmentalist” believes nuclear energy is the only viable route to net zero by 2050. “The nucleus could power the world securely, reliably, affordably, and – crucially – sustainably,” he declares.Gregory is an excellent popular science writer: clear as a bell and gently humorous. If you want to understand the workings of fission or radioactivity, he’s your man. But he is also an evangelical pitchman whose chapters on the atom’s myriad wonders can read rather like high-end sales brochures. Radiation? Not a problem! Less dangerous, in fact, than radiophobia, “the irrational fear of radiation”. High-level nuclear waste? It can be buried in impregnable catacombs like Finland’s state-of-the-art Onkalo or, better yet, recycled through breeder reactors. Gregory wants the reader to learn to stop worrying and love the reactor.Of course, there is a radioactive elephant in the room, which Gregory eventually confronts in the chapter We Need to Talk About Chernobyl. LikeThree Mile Island(1979) andFukushima(2011), the Soviet disaster caused reactor construction to crash. Europe built more reactors in the five years before Chornobyl than it has in the four decades since. The Fukushima meltdown spooked Germany into dismantling its entire nuclear programme. Whereas France, which has one-eighth of the planet’s 441 active reactors, currently generates two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear, Germany produces none, cancelling out its gains from renewables and making it painfully reliant on Russian gas. Gregory argues that the construction of reactors like Hinkley Point C in Somerset runs behind schedule and over budget because we’ve lost the habit, even as China and South Korea streak ahead.To Gregory, all this is a tragic case of radiophobia. Only around 50 fatalities have been directly attributed to radiation from Chornobyl, while the official death tolls for Fukushima and Three Mile Island are one and zero respectively. Roll them all together and the same number of people are lost roughly every three minutes to air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels.No doubt, the kneejerk rejection of nuclear energy can be ignorant bordering on superstitious, but safety concerns demand more space and consideration. Oddly, Gregory doesn’t mention Serhii Plokhy’s 2022 bookAtoms and Ashes, which explains how the Fukushima disaster could have been much worse if not for the courage and judgment of a few key officials. More offputtingly, he attacks renewable energy with roughly the same arguments used by rightwing critics of net zero, warning of “energy scarcity, industrial wind-down, and food insecurity” if we choose wind and sun over good old uranium-235. But surely it is not a zero-sum game?After a while, Gregory’s relentless boosterism begins to lose its persuasive power and he sounds rather like the blithely confident scientist in the first act of a disaster movie. Even though I’m personally convinced that anybody focused on the climate emergency would be foolish to dismiss nuclear out of hand, I suspect that sceptics may require an argument that sounds a little less like“Calm down, dear.”Going Nuclear: How the Atom Will Save the World by Tim Gregory is published by Bodley Head (£25).

In the TV show,Greg Daviesplays Wicky, the acerbic employee of a government-endorsed clean-up company, while Crime Scene Cleaner’s lead character Kovalsky is a lowly janitor, mopping up blood and disposing of trash to cover up for a mob boss named Big Jim.The crime scenes in both are laughably over the top. Or are they? I’ve never actually seen a real-life murder scene, so perhaps copious blood sprayed over walls and ceilings and the masses of broken furniture is completely normal.View image in fullscreenTake the edge off … Greg Davies as Wicky in the BBC’s The Cleaner.Photograph: Tom Jackson/PAStepping into Kovalsky’s plastic overshoes, the aim is to leave each location exactly as it was prior to the … um … incident. Unlike Wicky, who has to constantly deal with annoying homeowners and neighbours, Kovalsky has no living humans for company; just the dead ones that he hauls over his shoulder before slinging them unceremoniously into the back of his pickup truck. Each scene plays out in silence, save for the occasional brief chat with Big Jim and Kovalsky’s own pithy self-talk. Both Kovalsky and Wicky are world-weary labourers, doing what is necessary to get through each blood-splattered scene. But there are differences between the two men: Kovalsky swipes cash and valuables to boost his bank balance (he’s saving up to pay his daughter’s medical bills) while Wicky just wants to get finished in time for curry night at the pub.Crime Scene Cleaner is a weird concept for a game, the unnatural offspring of PowerWash Simulator and Hitman. But despite the macabre premise, I’ve come to appreciate the quiet, contemplative and satisfying process of cleaning up, as Kovalsky stuffs fragments of glass, pizza slices and broken crockery into his bin bag before hurling it into his truck and getting started on all the blood spatter with a microfibre mop, pushing sofas and tables back and returning ornaments to their rightful spot on the shelves afterwards. It’s immensely satisfying, despite the game’s realistic yet tiresome insistence on continually wringing out your mops and sponges.View image in fullscreenNo living humans for company … Crime Scene Cleaner video game.Photograph: President StudioExploring increasingly bizarre locations is also a common theme between the two: Crime Scene Cleaner has a pizzeria, a museum and a spooky smart house; The Cleaner takes in an ice-cream parlour, theatre and stately home. I love that the game gives me a chance to become a more sedate version of The Cleaner’s Wicky without the interference of coppers, maniacal novelists or even the killer themselves (as brilliantly portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter in the show). With his daughter ensconced in a medical clinic, Kovalsky’s only (living) companion is his playful German shepherd. Its name? Dexter. Of course.At the end of each clean-up, I find myself standing back and admiring the scene, content with a job well done. Crime Scene Cleaner and The Cleaner both tap into the very essence of black comedy, where horror becomes amusingly banall. In both, the crimes have already happened, the worst has been done and all that remains is… the remains.Explore more on these topicsGamesTV comedyGreg DaviesComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s something missing here. Something big.” The three grim, heavy, black monochromatic paintings that greet you as you walk into this show, called Resistant Forms, at Spike Island, the first major retrospective of the Guyanese-British artist’s work in the UK, have all the hallmarks of minimalism. They are dark, simple, ultra-formal images, a single colour on each canvas, covered in geometric grids, like Bauhaus in mourning. But the shapes and grids that define each work are not just experiments in form, they are not just an artist trying to push aesthetic boundaries: each is based on the architecture of the plantation.Suddenly, this formal minimalism becomes heavily weighed down by history, exploitation and oppression. Now, those formal geometric structures look like fields of sugar cane, bodies packed too close together in cramped dorms, sweaty and suffering. Fur peeks out of a metal grate cut into one of the canvases, as if countless animals are pressed in there, caged. They are incredible, powerful, uncomfortable, shocking paintings.View image in fullscreenDonald Locke, Black Box with Green Surface – Blackbirds, 1974.Photograph: Michael Brzezinski/Courtesy: Estate of Donald Locke and Alison Jacques. © Estate of Donald LockeAmazingly, Locke, who died in 2010, at first rejected any political reading of the works, insisting they were just exercises in form. It wasn’t until years later that he realised how overburdened with the pain of colonialism the works really were.Taking the language of art and imbuing it with the reality of the colonial experience is a move that Locke would repeat over and over. In the 1960s, he came to Bath and Edinburgh to study ceramics. The black sculptures that resulted are like splayed bodies, pairs of lungs spread apart, muscles locked in tension. In the 70s, the ceramic shapes elongate – now they look like long, downtrodden, browbeaten, solemn figures arranged into grids and locked in cages in sculptures titled Plantation K-140 and Plantation Piece. The brutality of the plantation as a tool of colonial greed, control and subjugation is everywhere.The most famous piece here, Trophies of Empire from the Tate’s collection, is a series of long black cylinders placed in vases and cups, some shackled together, others encased in silver, all displayed in a bleakwunderkammerof colonial violence. He was pretty insistent that these cylinders were bullets, not penises, but either way the result is the same: the colonies get screwed while the colonisers get rich.The mixing of media – in that case, ceramics and found objects – would happen throughout the rest of his career. Later paintings, from when he had moved to Arizona and then Atlanta, combine vast abysses of black paint with photos of confederate soldiers, skulls, Queen Victoria, white nudes and black singers. There are even photos of his own old work. Throughout, the past loops inescapably back into the present.He was a maximalist, smashing together painting and ceramics, modernism and African-Caribbean mythology, sculpture and photography, ideas upon ideas upon ideas. Some of the ceramic works get a little dull and repetitive, and the later reinterpretation of Trophies of Empire isn’t great. But the canvases are highly successful, powerfully dark, ultra-critical, vast, angry things.View image in fullscreenDonald Locke Dynasty, The Birth of Empire (The Birth of Empire #2), 1989.Photograph: Michael Brzezinski/Courtesy: Estate of Donald Locke and Alison Jacques. © Estate of Donald LockeLocke was at the forefront of a disparate group of diasporic artists dragging modern art into the post-colonial future. Alongside people including Frank Bowling and Aubrey Williams, Locke used his work to say: “Hey, you can’t separate art from history, from context.”Paintingand sculpture in the post-colonial era is haunted, stalked by colonialism. To ignore that is to ignore the truth. He could no more make art unaffected by those things than he could ignore his own race, his own family history, his own past.The most striking thing is how current the work looks. Decades before colonialism, blackness and post-colonial rhetoric became one of the dominant themes of contemporary art, Locke was laying out a roadmap for how art could confront uncomfortable histories and create something beautiful in the process.Donald Locke: Resistant Formsis at Spike Island, Bristol, 31 May to 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet Eastwood has now said that he never spoke to anyone from German-language Austrian newspaper Kurier.“A couple of items about me have recently shown up in the news,” Eastwood said in a statement released toDeadline. “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phony.”Eastwood, who turned 95 over the weekend, had been originally quoted as saying he was in pre-production on his new movie and had rallied against “an era of remakes and franchises”.Kurier is based in Vienna and has a circulation of approximately 100,000 copies.There is no official statement from Kurier or any details on how the interview was assembled.Eastwood’s most recent filmJuror #2, which starred Nicholas Hoult, was released at the end of last year with no confirmed word on what his next film will be. In aninterviewto support the film with the Metrograph magazine, he addressed his legacy as a film-maker.“That would be up to them, to the audiences, to answer,” he said. “Up to the people on the outside. I just kind of go along. I consider this, again, emotional. It comes upon you. You have a story, you make a movie of it. You have to just go for it. If you think too much about how it happened you might ruin it. I go back and look at films I’ve made, and I could easily ask, ‘Why the heck did I make this?’ I don’t remember! It might have been a long time ago.”Eastwood had recentlypaid tributeto co-star Gene Hackman after Hackman’s death in February. “There was no finer actor than Gene,” he said. “Intense and instinctive. Never a false note.” He added: “He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.”Explore more on these topicsClint EastwoodAustriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

What’s it like to be managed by your mother, run a billion-dollar business in your teens and be dismissed as ‘the lesbian’ by a Hollywood legend?Mon 2 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 05.06 EDTShareAweek before JoJo Siwa entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, she had a presentiment about it. “Something feels different,” she told her mother (and manager) Jessalynn. “I don’t think I’m gonna win, but I think I’m gonna change.” Siwa’s initial hunch was that the transformation would be in her career, she says. “Little did I know it was going to change my personal life so much. By a landslide, it is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”Siwa may be only 22, but it’s still quite the statement. As the breakout talent of the American reality TV series Dance Moms, she was arguably the biggest child star of the 2010s, at 11 years old instantly memorable for her larger-than-life personality and equally outsized hair bow. By the time she turned 15, in 2018, Siwa was a cross-platform tween sensation, with 5 million YouTube subscribers (now 12 million), a Nickelodeon deal, a burgeoning pop career and a staggeringly successful hair accessory business.When, at 17, Siwa came out by lip-syncing to Lady Gaga’s Born This Way on TikTok, Elton John phoned to congratulate her. He continues to send her birthday messages and Christmas cards, Siwa confirms: “We love Sir Elton!”She has now spent 12 years in the public eye, more than half her life – a fact that Siwa herself still seems to be wrapping her head around. “It’s been a decade of learning, you know what I mean? It’s really all I know.” She radiates a warm, solid professionalism somewhat at odds with her routinely outre getups (today a Burberry polo shirt, denim Bermuda shorts and diamante-studded, slicked-back ponytail).At times Siwa could pass for a California member of Congress, with her steady eye contact, deep tan and hypnotically white veneers (a recent investment,reportedly costing $50,000). But when her attention drifts to her nails or her buzzing phone, or she’s blushing over being “head over heels” with her new beau, she seems much younger than her years.We’re meeting a month after the Big Brother finale; Siwa finished third, behind Coronation Street’s Jack P Shepherd and drag queen Danny Beard. It was a surprise result: Siwa had been expected to place higher, as the series’ most talked-about contestant.On the second day of production, Siwa was targeted by 72-year-old actor Mickey Rourke, who grilled her about her sexuality, then told her: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.” Rourke persisted through Siwa’s polite but firm attempts to shut him down, announcing his intention to “vote the lesbian out”.View image in fullscreen‘Some rat doesn’t get to ruin this for me’ … Siwa with Mickey Rourke on Celebrity Big Brother in April.Photograph: Shutterstock for Big BrotherIt was an uncomfortable watch, with Siwa’s shock and discomfort palpable. It affected her “even more than people know”, Siwa says. “As it was happening, I just froze.” But she soon rallied, wanting to set an example for how to respond to such an outburst. She was also defiant: “Some rat doesn’t get to ruin this for me … It’s only day two.”Rourke was given a warning, and apologised to Siwa on-screen for his “short fuse” – but she says it was negated by his subsequent comments in private. “He mentioned to me that he knew what he was doing, that he tried to get under my skin and wanted to offend me, all this shit. That’s what made me super upset – that was really hard to take.”But Siwa does not believe Rourke should have been removed sooner, as some viewers called for. “I wanted to give him a chance, and I think production could see that as well,” she says. “Think about where we got to go from there: we got to have laughs with him [and] beautiful conversations about inclusion, and what you can and can’t say.”Those interactions gave Siwa closure, she says, “Like, ‘Oh, he doesn’t hate me; he’s a very hurt man.’” But Rourke was less invested in teachable moments; he later left the show after what ITV called “further use of inappropriate language” and “unacceptable behaviour” towards other contestants.Mickey Rourke ejected from Big Brother house over ‘unacceptable behaviour’Read moreHad she ever experienced such flagrant homophobia before? “Not to that level, and not in person like that. It was definitely a first – but I was lucky. I had a lot of support in that house.”Which brings us to the silver lining of the saga: Chris Hughes – or “sweet Christopher”, as Siwa calls him now.The ex-Love Islanderstood up to Rourke for Siwa, whom he had only just met, and comforted her. The intensity of the altercation, magnified by the Big Brother fishbowl, seemed to fast-track them to BFF status, surprising fellow housemates as much as audiences.Siwa says she and Hughes had to reckon with the suggestion they were playing to the cameras before they were even out of the house. It gave them the opportunity to clarify with each other: “No, this is a very genuine connection – we’re not faking a thing.”Their obvious chemistry was complicated, however, by Siwa’s being in a relationship (with 27-year-old Australian actor Kath Ebbs, who identifies as non-binary) and identifying as a lesbian (and, before that, gay and pansexual). When Siwa mused aloud on Big Brother that she felt more “queer” than lesbian, then broke up with Ebbs soon after production wrapped, tabloid speculation about the nature of her relationship with Hughes ramped up. In their first joint interview, on This Morning, both insisted on their “platonic soulmate” connection.After daily are-they-aren’t-they coverage and some awkward TV interviews I expect Siwa to shut the subject down. But she understands the interest, she says. “People can see our chemistry, and they got to see it develop.” Does it bother her? “I think everyone’s just curious, and I can’t blame them.”We have circled around the question long enough. I have to ask: is it platonic or romantic?Siwa is silent for a long time, staring down at the floor – but even with her body angled away from me, I can see she is smiling from ear to ear. “I am,” she agrees, when I point it out, “because we … we … we have …” She exhales noisily, ums and aahs some more. After a full 20 seconds, she says: “It’s not platonic any more, and it’s been a beautiful development, a beautiful connection, and I’m absolutely head over heels for him and he’s the same way.”It’s hard not to feel happy for her: she seems utterly smitten, the hearts-for-eyes emoji in human form.Anyone who suggests their relationship is “a PR stunt” is only telling on themselves, Siwa says. “Clearly, you’ve never been around us. I won’t ever speak for him, but for me personally, the happiness in my life just radiates off of me right now. Literally yesterday, I was massaging my cheeks; I’ve never [before] been in pain from smiling so much.”View image in fullscreen‘I live this very public life, and it can get really hard to navigate’ … Siwa.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianSiwa was born Joelle Joanie Siwa, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Jessalynn, a dance instructor, and Tom, a chiropractor. She has an older brother, Jayden, who briefly dabbled in vlogging, but Siwa was the star in the making – and Jessalynn made it her “mission in life” (as she later put it, on Dance Moms) to make it happen.In 2013, aged nine, Siwa was cast from an open call for Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition. She placed fifth in the reality show, but her star power – and Jessalynn’s tenacity – saw her picked up for two seasons of Dance Moms from 2015. Young Siwa was often singled out as loud and over the top, despite the show’s high bar for both; even her coach, the famously harsh Abby Lee Miller, described her as “obnoxious; sometimes rude” in the same breath as praising her stage presence and drive to succeed.For the producers who discovered her, Siwa was raw talent, reality TV gold. They would reportedly gather to watch her interviews as they were being taped, not wanting to miss a minute of what they called “the JoJo show”.“I did love it – that’s just who I was,” says Siwa. “It was the best time in my life. I would give anything to go back to it.”View image in fullscreen‘The hardest thing was feeling you weren’t in control of yourself’ … Siwa on stage at Nickelodeon SlimeFest in Chicago, June 2018.Photograph: Timothy Hiatt/Getty Images for NickelodeonWas she aware of the production around her, the narrative being built? “I was aware that we were making a TV show, but it was never like ‘here’s the plan’. I’ve never been told what to do, or how to be, or what to say, ever.” Other people’s experiences of reality TV are different, Siwa acknowledges; but “for me, it was 100% real”.After two seasons of Dance Moms, Siwa moved the JoJo show to YouTube, devising, shooting and editing all her videos herself. The workload was more brutal than TV, in the absence of child labour protection, but the payoff was higher. These days Siwa is nostalgic for that earlier, prospective era of what’s now established as “content creation”. “It was so hard to be successful at, but it was unreal fun.”In 2016, she released her first single, Boomerang, which went platinum; she signed with Nickelodeon the following year. Her first world tour, in 2019, sold out more than 100 venues, including the O2 Arena in London. She loved performing, and her career, and never felt forced, Siwa says, but she was aware of the pressure and responsibility.She recalls a moment on that tour, when her stage manager told her: “You can do the show without anybody; we can’t do the show without you … But do not abuse that power.” Another 16-year-old could hear that and run amok, Siwa agrees. “That’s why I am where I am now, because I don’t have that blood in my body.” Even as a child herself, she could “understand why child stars go crazy, because it’s really, really hard”, she says. “I think the hardest thing was feeling like you weren’t in control of yourself.”By age 15, “I was running a billion-dollar business. That’s something that should never be on a 15-year-old’s shoulders – but at the time, it was my normal.” As of 2019, she’d sold 90m hair bows, “and that was just the bows”, Siwa says. “Anything I did got turned into a doll.” She is embarrassed to give the retail sales figures for her slime kit, “because it’s ridiculous even to think about”. Hundreds of thousands of dollars? “More.More.”The profits didn’t go straight into her bank account, Siwa hastens to add – but she did gain access to a fortune. Jessalynn, as the quintessential “stage mom”, has often been accused of pushing Siwa and robbing her of a childhood – but, Siwa points out, Jessalynn was also working for her. She had the option of cutting Jessalynn off when she turned 18; instead, Siwa insists (somewhat morbidly) that when Jessalynn dies, it will be the end of her career.“We don’t have a normal mother-daughter relationship – but I couldn’t do it without her.”She did have a phase of envying her friends’ “more nurturing” parents, Siwa admits, and feeling wistful for what she missed out on: “Stupid little things like high-school football games, high school …” She would have liked to have gone to medical school: “It’s crazy to me that it’s now a more realistic option for me to build and own a hospital.”That sense of her unlived life played out last year, in what Siwa self-effacingly describes as her “bad girl phase”. After turning 21, she trialled an edgier, more in-your-face image with Kiss-inspired makeup, defiant clapbacks to “the haters” and drinking alcohol on stage. As child-star rebellions go, it was restrained, even perfunctory; Siwa, too, felt as if she was going through the motions. “I was laughing about it today, what my makeup looked like – like, ‘Dear God, if I could go back in time …’ It wasn’t authentic.”Even the Fireball shot she downed on stage was actually apple juice and Diet Coke, she says. “I think I just wanted to be so far away from being a child star, and I look back at that like, ‘You’re an idiot – being a child star was so fun.’ I love what I do, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”Now Siwa is seeking to channel that carefree freedom with her new single Bulletproof: a sugary yet distortion-heavy spin on Frère Jacques, and an instant earworm. Previously, Siwa says, she released songs she “didn’t fully connect with”, believing that they’d be hits; with Bulletproof, “It just feels right – it doesn’t matter the success level of it.”View image in fullscreen‘You can’t help who you love’ … Siwa and Chris Hughes on Celebrity Big Brother.Photograph: @chrishughesofficial/InstagramShe is similarly uninterested in justifying her present happiness. Her ex, Ebbs, has been vocal since the break-up, but Siwa says she’s “choosing peace” and not to engage with any takes or opinions. “I’ve read 50 articles in the last week about me that are not true, that say, ‘Sources close to JoJo …’ You’re never gonna know the full truth – and I can’t be bothered to fill anybody in.”She will confirm, however, that “queer” best “encompasses how I am, and who I am” – but reserves her right to remain fluid. “There’s a lot of different sexual identities. I think there’s nothing more beautiful than somebody discovering themselves.”At 22, it’s inevitable, too. The pushback to Siwa’s shifting identity (includingfeelings of betrayalfrom some in the LGBTQ+ community) seems consistent with the time-honoured resistance to child stars changing their image. “I do live this very, very big public life that has so many eyeballs on it, and it can get really hard to navigate,” Siwa says. “But I’m also living a human life. You can’t help who you love.”Whether it can be put down to her lifetime in the spotlight or the protective shield of new love (or, indeed, her shiny new teeth), Siwa gives off an armoured quality, like nothing can touch her. She is the happiest she’s been in years, she confirms. “Ever since Big Brother, genuinely. Even my family is like, ‘What happened in there?’”She describes lying in bed with Hughes, scrolling on their phones; this morning, she woke up to him singing one of her songs. “You know when you’re alone, how you feel? You are your true, raw self. I’ve obviously felt like that before, but never around one single person.”As a kid, Siwa says, she didn’t distinguish between her public and private selves, on camera and off: “It was very much one straight-up path.” She even learned to “look really happy, and fake it really well, and there’s something else going on inside”. Now, she says, “It’s the first time in my life that it feels like I’m switched off.”JoJo Siwa’s single Bulletproof is out nowExplore more on these topicsReality TVThe G2 interviewPop and rockTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

As the band return, they relive the mayhem years – and their soundtrack spinoffs, from Attenborough to ChernobylDaniel Dylan WrayMon 2 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareFifty years ago, Cabaret Voltaire shocked the people ofSheffieldinto revolt. A promoter screamed for the band to get off stage, while an audience baying for blood had to be held back with a clarinet being swung around for protection. All of which was taking place over the deafening recording of a looped steamhammer being used in place of a drummer, as a cacophony of strange, furious noises drove the crowd into a frenzy. “We turned up, made a complete racket, and then got attacked,” recalls Stephen Mallinder. “Yes, there was a bit of a riot, and I ended up in hospital, but it was great. That gig was the start of something because nothing like that had taken place in Sheffield before. It was ground zero.”Mallinder and his Cabaret Voltaire co-founder Chris Watson are sitting together again in Sheffield, looking back on that lift-off moment ahead of a handful of shows to commemorate the milestone. “It is astonishing,” says Watson. “Half a century. It really makes you stop, think and realise the significance.” Thedeath in 2021 of third founding member Richard H Kirkwas a trigger for thinking about ending things with finality. “It’ll be nice if we can use these shows to remind people what we did,” says Mallinder. “To acknowledge the music, as well as get closure.”It did feel a bit hostile at times – but more than anything, we just ruined people’s nightsIt’s impossible to overstate how ahead of their time “the Cabs” were. Regularly crowned the godfathers of the Sheffield scene, inspiring a wave of late 1970s groups such as the Human League and Clock DVA, they were making music in Watson’s attic as early as 1973. Their primitive explorations with tape loops, heavily treated vocals and instruments, along with home-built oscillators and synthesisers, laid the foundations for a singular career that would span experimental music, post-punk, industrial funk, electro, house and techno. “There was nothing happening in Sheffield that we could relate to,” says Mallinder. “We had nothing to conform to. We didn’t give a fuck. We just enjoyed annoying people, to be honest.”View image in fullscreenInspired by dadaism … the band’s early days.Photograph: Pete HillInspired by dadaism, they would set up speakers in cafes and public toilets, or strap them to a van and drive around Sheffield blasting out their groaning, hissing and droning in an attempt to spook and confuse people. “It did feel a bit violent and hostile at times, but more than anything we just ruined people’s nights,” laughs Mallinder, with Watson recalling a memory from their very first gig: “The organiser said to me after, ‘You’ve completely ruined our reputation.’ That was the best news we could have hoped for.”Insular and incendiary, the tight-knit trio had their own language, says Mallinder. “We talked in a cipher only we understood – we had our own jargon and syntax.” When I interviewed Kirk years before his death, he went even further. “We were like a terrorist cell,” he told me. “If we hadn’t ended up doing music and the arts, we might have ended up going around blowing up buildings as frustrated people wanting to express their disgust at society.”Instead they channelled that disgust into a type of sonic warfare – be it the blistering noise and head-butt attack of their landmark electro-punk track Nag Nag Nag, or the haunting yet celestial Red Mecca, an album rooted in political tensions and religious fundamentalism that throbs with a paranoid pulse.View image in fullscreenCool spinoff … Watson won a Bafta for his Frozen Planet recordings.Photograph: BBCWatson left the group in 1981 to pursue a career in sound recording for TV. Mallinder and Kirk invested in technology, moving away from the industrial sci-fi clangs of their early period into grinding yet glistening electro-funk. As the second summer of love blazed in the UK in 1988, they headed to Chicago instead – to make Groovy, Laidback and Nasty with house legend Marshall Jefferson. “We got slagged off for working with Marshall,” recalls Mallinder. “People were going, ‘England has got its own dance scene. Why aren’t you working with Paul Oakenfold?’ But we’re not the fucking Happy Mondays. We’d already been doing that shit for years. We wanted to acknowledge our connection to where we’d come from: Black American music.”This major label era for the group produced moderate commercial success before they wound things down in the mid-1990s. But in the years since, everyone from New Order to Trent Reznor has cited the group’s influence. Mallinder continued to make electronic music via groups such as Wrangler and Creep Show, the latter in collaboration with John Grant, a Cabs uber-fan.Watson says leaving the group was “probably the most difficult decision I’ve ever made” but he has gone on to have an illustrious career, winning Baftas for his recording work with David Attenborough on shows such as Frozen Planet. He recalls “the most dangerous journey I’ve ever made” being flown in a dinky helicopter that was akin to a “washing machine with a rotor blade” by drunk Russian pilots in order to reach a camp on the north pole. On 2003 album Weather Report, Watson harnessed his globetrotting field recording adventures with stunning effect, turning long, hot wildlife recording sessions in Kenya surrounded by buzzing mosquitoes, or the intense booming cracks of colossal glaciers in Iceland, into a work of immersive musical beauty.When he was at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania with Oscar-winning composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, recording sounds for the score to the 2019 TV series Chernobyl, he couldn’t help but draw parallels to his Cabs days. “It was horrific but really astonishing – such a tense, volatile, hostile environment,” he says. “But it really got me thinking about working with those sounds again, their musicality and how it goes back to where I started.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

This isn’t something you can do without emotion.” Mallinder and Kirk were not really speaking in the years leading up to his death, with Kirk operating under the Cabaret Voltaire name himself. “Richard was withdrawn and didn’t speak to many people,” says Mallinder. “And I was one of those people. He wanted to be in his own world. It was difficult because I missed him and there was a lot of history, but I accepted it.”There will be no new music being made as Cabaret Voltaire because, they stress, tsuch a thing cannot exist without Kirk. Instead, it’s a brief victory lap for the pair, a tribute to their late friend, as they sign off on a pioneering legacy with maybe one last chance for a riot. “Richard would probably hate us doing this but it’s done with massive respect,” Mallinder says. “I’m sad he’s not here but there’s such love for the Cabs that I want to give people the opportunity to acknowledge what we did. You can’t deny the music we made is important – and this is a way to celebrate that.”Cabaret Voltaire play a Forge Warehouse, Sheffield, 25 October, then tour the UK from 17 to 21 November.

Fewer than half of gen Z parents called reading to their children “fun for me”, and almost one in three saw reading as “more of a subject to learn” than something to be enjoyed – significantly more than their gen X counterparts.This mindset undoubtedly trickles down to their kids: the survey also found that only a third of five-to-10 year olds frequently read for fun, compared to over half in 2012. This could be because their parents are less likely to read to them before they turn five: 41% of parents of all ages reported doing so, a steep drop from the 64% in 2012.‘Reading role models’If parents are reading out loud to their children less, US educators can tell. Russell, who offers courses to teach literacy skills to kids as young as 18 months, regularly gets inquiries from parents of older children – some as old as 14 – who still struggle to crack open a book.There are other tell-tale signs. “We see children who can sit still and focus for hours on YouTube or Miss Rachel, but when you sit them down with a book, they move, wiggle, or scream and run away,” said Russell, who lives in Houston.Gen Z parents inherited an economy racked by inequity and instability that makes child rearing all the more stressful. The cost of childcare in the US – roughly $11,000 a year on average – hasskyrocketedsince the 90s. It’s no wonder they might be too tired or stressed to read to their kids at night, even if they realize it’s important to do so.At the same time,screens are inescapable– notably, gen Z parents were the first generation to grow up with them. “I don’t think we can divorce the role of technology influencing gen Z parents and their kids with the decline in reading out loud,” Russell said. “Screen time is replacing one-on-one, quality interactions between parent and child.”One of the most helpful ways to read books is by having a conversation with children about what they’re interested inDawna DuffLoads of evidenceshowsthatexcessive screen timecan harm a child’s cognitive, linguistic and social-emotional growth, and doctorsrecommendthat parents limit “non-educational screen time” for children ages two to five to about one hour per weekday, and three on the weekends. But you try getting a toddler to settle into story time without giving in to her demands to watch Bluey. Most parents see the iPad as anecessary evil.America’s so-called “literacy crises” is well-documented; an Atlanticreportfrom last fall found that many elite college students fail to complete English assignments, as they never had to read a full book in high school. The pandemicwreaked havocon students’ performance in both math and reading, with scores in both subjects dropping to the lowest margin in over 30 years. On TikTok,teachershavetakento posting PSAs urging parents to read to their children with the caption: “I bet you I can’t tell who was breast-fed vs formula-fed, but I can tell you who has grown ups that read to them every night.”Kids who don’t get a head start reading at home often have trouble catching up to those who do, says Dawna Duff, an associate professor of speech language pathology at Suny’s Binghamton University. “Books are a really rich source of learning new words, and if kids don’t have that experience reading at home, they’re likely to come to school knowing less vocabulary – and that makes a big difference in how successful you’re going to be throughout school,” she said.But kids don’t just learn to read at school. Becky Calzada, president of the American Association of School Librarians, stresses the importance of parents as “reading role models”. Reading out loud to children not only helps them learn vocabulary, but it builds emotional intelligence, such as the ability to empathize and connect, Caldaza says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This comes as boys continue to fall behind girls in school – they aremore likelyto enter kindergarten behind girls, earn lower GPAs and not graduate high school.Scaling back screen timeRussell acknowledges that books are “never going to compete with YouTube”, and that the pressures of parenthood in 2025 are immense. As one parent told him: “I just don’t have the energy to read to my kid. Me and my wife don’t ‘have a village’, so it’s hard to rest.” But there are ways to wean kids away from their phones. “Just scale it back a little, as much as you can at first.”She compared motherhood in four countries. The US isn’t looking goodRead moreCalzada encourages parents who don’t like reading to their children to start slowly. “You don’t have to sit there for 20 minutes to an hour,” she said. “A two-year-old doesn’t have much reading stamina, but you can read them something that has maybe five pages, that’s mostly ‘the cow says moo, the pig says oink,’ and you gradually build up from there.”Nor should parents give up if their children aren’t paying full attention during story time. According to Duff, “you shouldn’t feel like you need to read every word on the page, or even any words on the page.” Talking about the book’s pictures, or asking kids to tell the story in their own words counts, too.“We know one of the most helpful ways to read books is by having a conversation with children about what they’re interested in,” she added. “Follow their lead.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingChildrenUS educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But becoming Ginger Rachel brought me true happinessI tried bleaching my hair; I tried dyeing it pink, blue and purple. Then, at the age of 18, I finally discovered the real meRachel KeenanMon 2 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareMy hair has always been my pride and joy. Hairdressers would fawn over how long and thick it was. It was glossy, healthy and an unremarkable shade of light brown. But it never really felt like “me”. As a teen I dyed it purple, pink, red, blue or all four, trying to find the magic shade that would make sense.Until disaster struck. When I was 18, I damaged my hair so badly with bleach that no colour would stick to it. After I spent two weeks as peroxide Barbie, my hairdresser saved what she could of my hair by dyeing it back to its natural mousy brown colour and chopping a good 14 inches off into a blunt bob. Much to her dismay, again bored with brown I bleached it a week later. It seemed I was in a permanent identity crisis that only a box of bleach could fix.Accepting that I was maybe just one bleach job away from my hair falling out, and wanting to return to the glory days of healthy, luscious locks, I started researching natural ways to restore my hair. After sampling every haircare product and trying DIY hair masks made from eggs, it seemed the best long-term solution would be to use henna, a natural dye. I thought I would try to keep it interesting by going for auburn, a dark red/orange that would fade so I could easily slather shocking pink over it.View image in fullscreenPurple reign … Keenan in 2018.Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel Keenan‘Auburn’ was a little misleading and I ended up with bright ginger hair. When using henna the result can vary depending on your natural hair colour. But the second I saw my new hair colour, I finally recognised something in myself. My mum has naturally auburn hair. (Her hair used to be dark orange or red depending on the light. Some people, like me, would say ginger. She would disagree. It’s up for debate.) She rocked this look in her 20s, when I was a young child. At 26, when I look in the mirror, I now see her looking back at me.For the past seven years I have been dyeing my hair ginger every month and I still get the same feeling of relief as I did the first time I saw those fiery strands. Everyone thinks it’s natural. And it makes sense with my Scottish accent and pale complexion.My hair colour has become part of my identity. At an old job, I was even referred to as Ginger Rachel. When I told them my original hair colour was light brown, one co-worker very seriously told me it was an insult to his childhood struggles with being teased for being ginger. Another called me a fraud.The outrage has only confirmed that having ginger hair suits me. If I had never told anyone I wasn’t naturally ginger, they would never have known. I even forget myself that it’s fake until I have to dye it again. I’m committed to being Ginger Rachel for life.Explore more on these topicsWomen's hairThe one change that workedBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I would eat them by themselves standing up at the cooker, but when they’re draped with a little smoked trout, creme fraiche and dill, and served alongside a light salad, they make for an elegant dinner for two. Some shaved fennel (with its frilly leaves) in a lemony dressing wouldn’t go amiss here, either.Smoked trout and crispy potato cakes with capers, caraway and dillPrep15 minCook10 minServes2400gwaxy potatoes(I like alouette)1tsp flaky sea salt5tsp capers-3 tsp roughly chopped, the rest finely chopped1tspfresh dill,chopped, plus extra to garnish5 heapedtbsp full-fat creme fraiche½ tsp caraway seeds1 mediumegg1tbsp olive oil1tsp butter100g smoked troutJuice of ½ lemonGreen salad, to serve (optional)Wash the potatoes, but don’t bother peeling them. Now’s the time to use the grating attachment on your food processor, which will grate the potatoes in seconds; otherwise do so by hand. Tip the grated potatoes into a bowl with the sea salt, mix well, then leave to sit for five minutes.Meanwhile, mix the roughly chopped capers, dill and creme fraiche in a small bowl, and set aside.Tip the potatoes on to a clean tea towel, then wrap and twist it over the sink to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Return the potatoes to the bowl, and stir in the caraway seeds, finely chopped capers and egg.Heat half the olive oil and half the butter in a large frying pan. When the butter starts foaming, add heaped tablespoons of the potato mixture, flattening each to about 1cm-thick and the size of a jam-jar lid (you will most likely need to fry them in batches – I can fit five in my largest pan). Fry on a medium heat for three minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown all over, adding the remaining oil and butter to the pan as needed. Transfer the cooked potato cakes to a plate lined with kitchen paper, and keep warm in a low oven if need be.Serve the potato cakes topped with the creme fraiche mixture, and divide the smoked trout equally between them. Squeeze over a little lemon juice, garnish with dill, and serve hot with a green salad alongside, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyFishSeafoodPotatoesMain courseVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Creamy, slightly tangy, savoury, full of roasted flavours and a little sweet, it’s the ideal dressing for absolutely anything. It comes in squeezy bottles and is now widely available in larger supermarkets, but I’ve created my own version here in case you can’t find it. These lettuce cups make a fresh and crunchy snack that serves as a vessel for tender chicken and whatever herbs you have in the fridge. But first, a Japanified rendition of the Chinese dish mapo tofu, only more savoury and salty, and with a slightly thicker sauce. It’s a strong contender for weekly dinner rotations, depending on what you have in your fridge, of course.Mabo nasu (spiced aubergines; pictured top)I love the combination of pork mince and aubergine, but this also works well with tofu. You can even make it vegetarian or vegan by omitting the meat and using tofu or vegan mince and substituting vegetable stock powder. It’s a little spicy, very savoury and super-saucy, so is perfect for topping steamed rice and eating with a spoon. Negi is a type of Japanese spring onion – if you can find them, use them instead of the spring onion. Doubanjiang, also called fermented chilli bean paste or spicy bean paste, is a fiery, savoury paste made from fermented broad beans. You can find it in Asian food stores and in many supermarkets.Prep15 minCook35 minServes41 tbsp neutral oil, such as rapeseed or sunflower, plus extra as needed100gpork mince4 small aubergines, or 100g firm tofu, cut into cubes1 garlic clove, peeled and finely grated2cmfresh root ginger,peeled and finely grated½ spring onion, or ½ negi,finely sliced1 tsp cornflour1 tsp toasted sesame oilSteamed rice, to serveFor the sauce1 tbsp brown miso1½ tbsp doubanjiang1 tsp soy sauce1 tsp sugar1 tsp powdered chicken stock, or vegetable stockFor the sauce, put the miso, doubanjiang, soy sauce, sugar and stock powder in a bowl, add 200ml water, mix well and set aside.Put the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the pork mince and cook, stirring to break it up, for about five minutes, until the fat has rendered out and the meat is browned and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a plate, leaving the oil behind in the pan. Add the aubergine to the pan (and a touch more oil, if need be) and cook gently, turning often, for six to eight minutes, until browned all over and meltingly tender.Return the pork to the pan, add the garlic and ginger, then cook, stirring gently so as not to break up the aubergines, for two to three minutes, until fragrant. Stir in the sauce mixture, leave to simmer for two to three minutes, then add the spring onion and cook for five minutes more, until the sauce has reduced.Mix the cornflour with two tablespoons of water and tip into the pan, mixing gently. Simmer for two to three minutes, until the sauce thickens, then stir in the sesame oil.Serve immediately alongside a pile of steamed rice.Tori no gomae (chicken cups with sesame dressing)View image in fullscreenMillie Tsukagoshi Lagares’tori no gomae, or chicken cups with sesame dressing.Photograph: Emma Guscott Photography/The Guardian. Food styling: Ellie Mulligan. Props styling: Louie Waller. Food styling assistant: Alice Earll.For the chicken, I’ve used a microwave for speed – you’ll be surprised at just how much moisture the meat retains when it’s cooked this way, and that it cooks in mere minutes. For those without a microwave, poach it instead, or use leftover roast or rotisserie chicken.Prep10 minCook20 minServes2 as a snack100gchicken breastPinch of salt1 tbsp sake½ cucumber, julienned1 tbsp gari(pickled ginger), or peeled and very finely sliced fresh root ginger1butterhead lettuceFor the dressing2 tbsp mayonnaise1½ tbsp toasted sesame seeds,plus extra to serve1 tsp neutral oil, such as rapeseed or sunflower1 tsp apple cider vinegar1 tsp soy sauce1 tsp sugar1 tbsp waterTo serve (all optional)1 handfulfresh coriander leaves, or other herbs, roughly chopped2 spring onions, finely slicedSlice the chicken lengthways into two long strips and put these on a microwave-safe plate. Season with the salt and sake, then cover with clingfilm and microwave at 160W for two and a half to three minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the microwave and, once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with a fork.Combine all the dressing ingredients in a bowl and whisk. (This will make more dressing than you need here, but it keeps well in the fridge for a few days, so enjoy the rest with just about any salad.)Mix the shredded chicken with three to four tablespoons of the dressing, the cucumber and ginger. Separate the lettuce into leaves to make cups and fill them with the chicken mixture. Serve topped with coriander, spring onions and extra toasted sesame seeds, if you like.These recipes are edited extracts from Umai: Recipes From a Japanese Home Kitchen, by Millie Tsukagoshi Lagares, published by Quadrille at £27.

It doesn’t specify what I did incorrectly – I’m guessing I made a typo when entering my car reg because the buttons on the machines are so faded and Os andzeroslook identical.I’m told I face courtand a damaged credit ratingif I don’t stump up.ML,FakenhamIt looks as though NPE is hurrying to collect the money before the clock runs down. Private parking operators have to issue a ticket within 14 days of the alleged contravention if sending by post.If it’s taped to your windscreen and you fail to pay, the operator has an additional 56 days to send a notice to your home address. You say you never received any notice and were unaware of the alleged debt until the legal threats arrived.Private parking charges are not legally enforceable without a county court judgment, and the statute of limitations bars court action once six years have passed.‘Pay here’: the QR code ‘quishing’ scam targeting driversRead moreThe demands you received were sent days before the six years were up, and the deadline has since expired. Moreover, NPE has failed to provide evidence that you breached the terms and conditions.When you demanded details and proof of what you had done wrong it repeated, robotically, that you had used the machine incorrectly. It declared to me that it could not discuss cases with a third party, and refused to answer if, and when, it issued a parking charge notice and why it did not follow up earlier.I believe a court would take a dim view of this, even if it agreed to hear the case, so you could probably ignore it. But if you are worried, I suggest you write to NPE stating that you will not pay unless it provides all those details by a specific date.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

So when it was finally announced – six months after Dior’s menswear designer left, and four days after its womenswear head,Maria Grazia Chiuri, showed a collection in Rome – it surprised no one.Yet Anderson’s newfound position at luxury’s centre of gravity still setsDior, a grand fashion institution, careering down an experimental path. As Delphine Arnault, the chair and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture, told Vogue Business: “For any house, having new artistic direction can be a challenge.”Dior appoints Jonathan Anderson as sole creative directorRead moreA critical darling and commercial success, Anderson made Loewe into a fashion week hype machine and Hollywood powerhouse while creating shoes with perspex cracked eggs for heels,art-directing Daniel Craig’s post-Bond relaunch in specs and quirky knits, and casting the late Dame Maggie Smith as a model in an advertising campaign at the age of 88.Anderson’s role at Loewe was also lucrative. Since he took over, the brand’s annual revenues increased fivefold. With the move to Dior he will now probably become the most prolific designer in fashion; assuming he continues to work on his own brand (JW Anderson), as well as his collaboration with Uniqlo, it is expected he will show 18 collections a year.The world of high fashion is a long way from Anderson’s early days inNorthern Ireland. He was born in 1984 in Magherafelt, a town otherwise famous for cropping up in Seamus Heaney’s early work, and went to school during the Troubles. Raised Protestant, he has spoken in the past about passing through checkpoints on his way to school. “It does make you quite hard because emotionally you were toughened by that,” he recently told New York magazine.View image in fullscreenA model walks the catwalk of Loewe’s fall/winter show in Paris in 2023.Photograph: Gil-Gonzalez Alain/ABACA/REX/ShutterstockAnderson’s father, Willie, was captain of the Ireland rugby team, and something of a character; in 1980, he spent three months in an Argentinian prison for stealing the national flag from outside a government building while on tour. Anderson’s mother, Heather, was an English teacher. As parents, they were wholly supportive of his career. “You’ll do anything for your kid if you believe their dream is not something that’s beyond them,”said his father, adding that they “remortgaged the house to try and get him through certain points”.Anderson left home aged 18 to study acting in Washington DC, but changed his mind, returning home to work in the Dublin department store Brown Thomas. It was around this time he got into fashion, though he was turned down by every school he applied to except the London College of Fashion, which was piloting a new menswear course. He went on to launch his namesake brand JW Anderson in 2008. LVMH took a minority stake in the brand in 2013, and Anderson worked at Loewe from 2013 until spring this year.One of a new raft of power designers to share an art-college enthusiasm for avant-garde projects, he was never a designer in the pure “cutting and draping” sense (though he completed his degree), relating more to Miuccia Prada, who studied political science before going into fashion.Anderson’s arrival at Dior is part of a changing of the guard at leading houses that in recent months has seen Chanel appoint the French-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy and Gucci sign the Georgian fashion designer Demna. Dior’s announcement is the latest move in a frenzied round of musical chairs at fashion’s top table, the impact of which will be seen at fashion weeks in the second half of 2025.An immediate consequence of the recent personnel changes has been a rollback of female representation in fashion’s most prestigious roles.Anderson replaces Chiuri, Dior’s first female designer, who modernised the ladylike codes of the house while supporting and referencing a range of female artisans and artists. She became well-liked for attempting – however clumsily with her “We should all be feminists” T-shirts – to use her might and financial power to modernise feminism in fashion. With the exception of the appointments of two British female designers – Sarah Burton at Givenchy, and Louise Trotter, who replaces Blazy at Bottega Veneta – the incoming class of designers is overwhelmingly male.View image in fullscreenAnderson created Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show outfit in 2023.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesStill, as far as the male gaze is concerned, Anderson is well known for covering up the wearer’s body, albeit with anthuriums and deflated balloons as well as actual clothes. He created Rihanna’s bump-shaped red leather corset worn at the 2023 Super Bowl for an internet-breaking pregnancy reveal, and collaborated with the sculptor Lynda Benglis on a stage set that turned a Paris show space into a gallery. He also launched the most in-demand handbag of modern times, the Puzzle bag, and has dressed Beyoncé, Zendaya and Greta Lee.Anderson’s references have always come from outside the fashion world, namely craft, surrealism and cultural history (one JW Anderson show was inspired by Rasputin going skiing). As a result, the traditional narrative – in which young designers opt into commercial success by bending their taste toward the mainstream – has so far failed to apply in the case of Anderson, who has become more avant garde rather than less as his career has progressed.Yet however esoteric his designs, Anderson’s appointment suggests the mega-conglomerate LVMH is valuing creativity over celebrity. As Arnault said: “I think this is going to be great for the maison. There will be consistency and coherence in the products, but also in terms of communication, I think our message will be much clearer.”The idea is that Anderson will bring some of his own team and hopefully, his customers will follow suit. Whatever the hype surrounding his appointment, he is still tasked with turning around the fortunes of Dior, which saw sales decrease from €9.5bn in 2023 to €8.7bn in 2024, according to an HSBC estimate. But as Arnault has said: “Ittakes a few seasonsto see exactly what the vision is. But I think he’s totally energised by the idea.”Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion industryDiorNorthern IrelandRihannaMaria Grazia ChiuriprofilesShareReuse this content"

Made up of amino acids absorbed from the protein we eat, there are more than 20 subtypes found everywhere – from our bones and muscles to organs. Types I, II, and III are the most common in skin, cartilage and connective tissue, helping with strength and elasticity.In recent years collagen has become known as the protein that keeps the skin on our face young-looking, with collagen powders and pills promising to slow signs of ageing – but is there any truth in those claims?Dr Afshin Mosahebi, a professor in plastic surgery at University College London, says the science is “dubious”, with a lack of large-scale, peer-reviewed studies.“There’s no direct evidence that collagen, taken on its own, can do anything more than eating enough protein,” says Mosahebi.Is it true that … male pattern baldness is inherited from the mother?Read moreHe says it’s true that, as we age, changes in collagen level make the skin on our face start to look “crinkly” and less firm, but that it’s wrong to assume that simply supplementing collagen is the solution. “When you eat something it doesn’t go directly to your skin. Of course, parts of it are eventually absorbed and used in skin repair, but it’s not going to go straight from your mouth to your face and wrinkles.”He adds that using skincare containing collagen won’t make a long-term difference to ageing either, as “it doesn’t penetrate the skin itself”.Instead, he says that the way we age is down to genetics (like having fair skin that’s sensitive to the sun) and our lifestyles. His tips for slowing that process down include making sure to eat a balanced diet that includes proteins, keeping away from the sun, avoiding smoking, staying hydrated and keeping your skin moisturised with products like hyaluronic acid.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …Health & wellbeingSkincareNutrition (Life and style)Nutrition (Science)Medical researchBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How I found my voice on a musical theatre retreatWith tuition from West End pros, this week-long singing break in southern Spain hits all the right notesTracey DaviesMon 2 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShare‘Do you prefer alto or soprano?” asks Steve Moss, poised at his electric piano. My mind goes blank. I’m usually more of a pinot grigio girl, but that’s not the answer the former musical director of Les Misérables is looking for. Although I struggle to carry a tune in a bucket, I’m an enthusiastic karaoke singer, a big musical theatre fan and a shameless show-off, so Sing the Greatest Showman, a residential singing retreat in Spain, is right up my street.Founded by Zane Rambaran, a veteran concert promoter with his roots in musical theatre, Sing Eat Retreat offers a choice of breaks here throughout the year (from Sing Les Mis to Sing Mamma Mia), with 30  hours of tuition by West End professionals. (In October, Sing The Sound of Music will be held in Salzburg too, with guests recording tracks in a studio and performing in the actual movie locations. I’ve already packed my dirndl.)View image in fullscreenOur base in Spain is Huerta Belinda, a gorgeous Spanish finca close to the surfing mecca of Tarifa, where we’ll have five days of one-to-one and small group sessions on vocal technique, acting through song and performance preparation. The villa has eight rooms and some of the 21-strong group (mostly women in their 40s and 50s – and 60-something Ray, the only man) stays in Mesón de Sancho, a charming hotel nearby, but all of us eat together.I’m no stranger to pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone, but staring at a musical score – all impenetrable squiggles to me – under the expectant gaze of a West End director, I think I’ve pushed it too far this time. As Steve, who has been musical director of Mary Poppins as well as Les Mis, takes us through the song This Is Me!, breaking it down into easy chunks, I struggle to follow the music and can’t decide which octave to sing in. I end up squalling up and down the bars like an angry seagull.I ask Steve if I’m a lost cause. “I don’t necessarily think that everyone can carry a tune, but I think everyone can improve,” he says, kindly. “People always leave the retreats a better musician in some way, whether it’s an improved singing voice or just learning to stand still when they’re performing.” Well, I can definitely stand still.All retreats induce a naturally bonding environment, but there’s something rather special about singing togetherAll retreats induce a naturally bonding environment, but there’s something rather special about singing together. Much of our group has choir or am-dram experience, while others – like me – are complete beginners, and about half have come alone. Prior to arrival, guests fill out a questionnaire about their singing ability, what they want to achieve, and a clip of them singing Happy Birthday so tutors can assess abilities and arrange groups, but all levels are welcome.Our group includes guests from Switzerland and Spain; sisters Trish and Janet from Ireland, who sing in a choir; Emma, a teacher from Cambridge who runs musical theatre groups; and Miracle, a self-proclaimed “nomad” who is on her fifth retreat here. One thing we all have in common is our love of musicals.Days start with breakfast in the villa, followed by a group warm up before we splinter off for workshops. The week is run along the same lines as preparation for a West End show, with vocal coaches, musical directors and choreographers. “In the first week of a new show we do vocal calls,” says Steve. “We start with note bashing, recording it on our phones and making notes on the music, then the cast can go off and practise. By the Friday we do a sing through of the show, have a sit through with the orchestra, then the directors and choreographers start working their magic.”View image in fullscreen‘A highlight of the retreat is a masterclass with Luke Bayer’ (in white), an actor and guest mentorPerformance practice is led by Maria Graciano, who appeared in Miss Saigon and Wicked! and was the resident choreographer for Moulin Rouge! The Musical. Vocal coach Zev Chaplain teaches us about the physiology of singing and importance of warming up our vocal cords with lip trills, owl hoots, and ho, ho, ho’s in the style of the Jolly Green Giant. One of the (many) highlights is a three-hour masterclass with Luke Bayer – who starred in Everybody’s Talking About Jamie and Rent in the West End – giving us priceless advice and feedback on our performances.Over the week, singers are picked out for solos – not me – and all of us can have a one-to-one session with a tutor.After dinner we chat over more wine, before someone inevitably fires up the karaoke machineThere are plenty of breaks – it’s a holiday after all – and this is where friendships blossom, with the contagious sounds of singing around the villa as people practise their scales. Any free time is spent by the pool, sunbathing in the gardens and soaking up the glorious views across the Strait of Gibraltar. There’s little opportunity to venture farther afield, but most guests arrive a day or two early to explore the beaches and sand dunes of Tarifa. If you ask Zane, he may take you along when he walks Charlie, his dog.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After dinner, we congregate in the lounge and chat over more wine, before someone inevitably fires up the karaoke machine.When I arrived at Huerta Belinda, I was tempted to sit at the back and mouth the songs, such was my lack of confidence in my singing ability. But as the week progresses, I find I enjoy singing more and want to belt the tunes out with the rest of them. Thanks to Zev, I learn to breathe properly and really notice an improvement in my vocals. Part of it is because I don’t want to let the rest of the group down. No one is coming into this half-heartedly; we want to put on The Greatest Show.It isn’t just me who finds her voice. Elinor from Barry, a hardcore musical theatre fan (she won the quiz), loved to sing but lost all confidence after being criticised at school. “This week has been life-changing for me. It’s given me back my voice,” she says.The crescendo of the week is a concert on Friday night, with a real audience. During the day, our nerves start to show as we rehearse. But come 8pm, as we step on stage and sing the first “whoahs” of The Greatest Show, they’re quickly replaced with dopamine as the altos, sopranos, and Ray the tenor – and all the soloists – bring their A-game. It feels incredible.Waiting in the wings before our final song, I look around at my new friends, hugging, laughing, congratulating each other on their performances. It’s been an incredible week both musically and emotionally. And it turns out I can hold a tune, after all. While it’s far (very far) from West End-worthy, it doesn’t make Charlie howl, which I’m taking as a win.The trip was provided bySing Eat Retreat.

The best solutions are simpler – and more complexWhat we want is quick, clever fixes. What we need is quite different: the ability to tolerate intolerable feelings, to sustainably change and growMoya SarnerMon 2 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareWhen people seek therapy – and I know this, because I too was once a person seeking therapy – we often want strategies, techniques and tools for our toolboxes. We want to be asked questions and to know the answers; we want to ask questions and to be given answers. We believe that these are the things we need to build a better life.Now that I am a patient in psychoanalysis, and I am a psychodynamic psychotherapist treating patients, I can see why my therapist needed to frustrate this desire, and offer me the opposite. What I wanted was to manage myself out of my emotions rather than feel them, to hack my life rather than live it – and that makes for a shallower existence, not a better one.Good therapy takes time, and there are periods in our lives when that time may not be available to usMeaningful therapy has helped me to understand that what I wanted was not what I needed. That my search for the right answer, born out of my conviction that there is a right way to do life, could only ever keep me stuck. I see now that this powerful treatment can offer something far more valuable than strategies: a fertile environment in which a mind can grow, so that a new space can open up between sensing an emotional experience inside you and having to get rid of it immediately. In this space, you can develop the capacity to tolerate something that previously was experienced as unbearable – and this gives you time to feel, to think and to respond with agency, rather than remaining a slave to your reactions.This can be utterly transformative for our relationships, for our working lives, for our parenting and for our self-respect. It is not something we can try to do, it is not something someone can tell us how to do, it is not something we can read about in a newspaper article (even this one, I’m afraid). It is the outcome of a meaningful, sustained therapeutic relationship, and there is no shortcut.The fact is that strategies, techniques and tools are all out there for you to find if you want them. A quick internet search will serve up more studies than you could possibly wish to read showing that exercise is good for your mental health; that mindfulness can help to manage stress (and there are plenty of apps for that); and that if it makes you feel good, you can buy as many adult colouring books, gratitude journals and weighted blankets as you wish (before you feel so weighed down by all your stuff that it’s time to de-clutter again). These things may or may not be helpful, but advice along these lines can also make a person feel worse, if what they really need is to address the underlying difficulties, anxieties, depressions and unconscious dynamics that rob them of the capacity to enjoy the good things in life.Because the thing about building a better life is that it is at the same time incredibly complex and incredibly simple. (One consequence of good psychotherapy – and parenthood – is developing the capacity to recognise and feel two opposing truths at the same time.) In a therapy session, an almost imperceptible movement or sigh from a patient might, when attention is directed towards it, open up a fascinating seam of memories and associations that reveal buried pain and love and heartbreaking assumptions about themselves, which developed in their mind in childhood out of compelling family dynamics and have continued to imprison them for their entire lives. And once these knotty, complex dynamics have been excavated and understood, and the feelings trapped within have been allowed expression, then the cell door can open, and as well as pain and anger and longing and other feelings, all sorts of beautifully simple things become possible. The blissful feeling of warm sunshine on your face. The colours in a David Hockney painting. The deliciousness of a chocolate Hobnob. The heart-swelling sound of a toddler laughing – yours or someone else’s. The pleasure of exchanging a nod with a stranger who has also gone for a walk in the park. The joy of watching one of the greatest films of all time.Are you a people pleaser? It’s time to find out what you really wantRead moreWhich brings me to my final point. We have to acknowledge that good therapy can be difficult to find (though there is plenty of information atbpc.org.uk). And if you live in an area where psychotherapy is, outrageously, not available on the NHS, or about to be cut, then it can be expensive (though there are low-fee schemes available at theInstitute of Psychoanalysisand theBritish Psychotherapy Foundation, and elsewhere too). It may also be that this kind of therapy might not be useful to you at this moment. And, as I have written previously, good therapy takes time, and there are periods in our lives when that time may not be available to us.Fortunately, there is something else that can help. Here is the one strategy, technique and tool I have found that really does work – the answer to almost any question.WatchMidnight Run.And if you have already watched this exquisite 80s comedy with Robert De Niro, Charles Grodin and Yaphet Kotto, then watch it again.And when you have watched it, find someone else who has watched it – it may be that the greatest value of the internet lies in its facility to connect people who have watched Midnight Run – and swap your favourite quotes and scenes with them.And then make a cup of tea and dunk a chocolate Hobnob in it and eat it.You’re welcome.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromDr Carole Eastonof the Centre for Ageing BetterMon 2 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 13.33 EDTShareThe housing ombudsman’s latest report recorded a significant increase in social housing repairs and maintenance complaints since 2020 (Housing ombudsman for England warns of ‘simmering anger’ over living conditions, 29 May). We as a sector support the ombudsman’s campaign to raise awareness among tenants of routes to redress in cases where issues with their homes have not been resolved. It is also important to look at these figures in context.The increase represents one complaint upheld by the ombudsman for every 1,000 social homes. With many more residents now aware of the ombudsman’s service following an ad campaign, care must be taken when drawing any conclusions from the data.Looking at action and investment in the sector, we know that the quality of social housing is improving. Housing associations have prioritised investment in their existing homes, increasing spending on repairs and maintenanceby 55% since 2020, investing a record £8.8bn last year, with plans to spend a further £50bn over the next five years. Today 90% of housing association homes meet the decent homes standard, more than any other tenure, but there is work still to do and the sector is committed to ensuring that every single home is of high quality.However, cuts to social housing over many years have exacerbated quality issues, and only an increase in funding can address this long-term, as the ombudsman recognises. Some homes are in urgent need of regeneration, funding for which wascut in its entirety in 2010.In addition, overcrowding – at its highest level in 30 years – is a significant contributor to damp and mould. Financial pressures mean that by prioritising investment in existing homes, the sector is less able to build new homes, which is essential for tackling overcrowding. The upcoming spending review is a critical moment for the government to provide financial support for existing and new social housing.Kate HendersonChief executive, National Housing FederationIt was distressing but not surprising to read your report about the dire state of the country’s social housing. I live on a large estate in south London that has been severely mismanaged by a tenant management organisation (TMO) for decades. TMOs are a common system like that in place in Kensington and Chelsea before the Grenfell Tower fire, which originally aimed to hand power to residents but has become an open door for abuse. There are approximately 230 TMOs in England managing tens of thousands of properties.On our estate, repairs are left undone for months or years, many homes are filled with damp and mould, fly-tipping is out of control, vermin run wild and residents are blocked from using the community spaces. One man told me recently how he has lived without central heating for years.Service charges continue to escalate, and yet concierges whom these fees are meant to fund are mostly absent. Lifts are regularly out of order. Many feel anxious about the state of their flats – with the situation having a serious impact on their physical and mental health. Residents feel silenced or even threatened when they raise complaints. Anger is rising and residents are distraught.The government needs to do an urgent review of TMO law, which only seems to protect those who manage social housing estates, not those who live in damp, inadequate and rotting homes.Katherine Maxwell-RoseLondonIt is no surprise that the housing ombudsman, Richard Blakeway, has highlighted “simmering anger at poor housing conditions”, and the substantial increase in tenants’ complaints.But the problem of non-decent and unsafe homes isn’t just confined to social housing. In the UK, 15% of homes overall – which equates to 3.7m properties – are in such a bad state of repair that they don’t reach the government’s minimum standards of decency.That means nearly 8 million people are living in homes that can negatively impact their health and wellbeing, with 2.6 million being 55 and over. Many of these older people are vulnerable.If you don’t live in a good home, it’s more or less impossible to be in good health – particularly in later life. Homes that are damp, cold and hazardous can lead to many health problems, including asthma, strokes, heart attacks and broken bones. These can have devastating consequences for individuals, and present costs and demands to the NHS and social services. And if left unchecked, the problem will get worse. In the UK, 80% of the national building stock will still be in use by 2050 – and it’s already one of the oldest building stocks in Europe.We’re calling on the government to make a commitment to improving the quality of cold, dangerous homes – both for social and private tenants, and for poorer homeowners – in the forthcoming national housing strategy. This should set out detailed plans to tackle poor-quality homes of all types.Looking to the future, we also need to consider new homes and make sure that they’re accessible for disabled and older people. We have a moral obligation to ensure that the most vulnerable people in society live in a home that is safe.Dr Carole EastonChief executive,Centre for Ageing BetterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Where is the evidence for this? We have been facilitating “wealth creation” for most of the last 45 years via huge tax cuts for the mega-rich, allowing CEOs and bankers to “earn” millions in salaries and bonuses, permitting buy-to-let landlords to charge exorbitant rents, and relentless privatisation purportedly to create a dynamic enterprise economy.Yet our public services are in a state of utter destitution. So where, or to whom, has all the wealth gone? Has it flowed upwards, rather than trickled down in the manner that Conservatives promised us?Mr Biesterfield may envisage wealth creators as multimillionaire business tycoons and plucky, swashbuckling entrepreneurs, but many of the wealthy are merely appointed to senior posts in business and finance, rather than creating industries themselves.The real wealth creators are the hardworking people who do the daily job of making and selling the products and services that earn the profits, and ultimately fund the huge salaries and dividends enjoyed in the boardroom.Pete DoreyBathCan we put to bed this idea of double taxation on inheritance that David Biesterfield propounds. Most inheritance is based on the sale of a house that has accumulated in value without anyone having had to do anything to create the increase. The community is perfectly entitled to take a share of this wealth to help others less fortunate create actual wealth for the benefit of society.Stephen DorrilNetherthong, West YorkshireDavid Biesterfield asserts, without evidence, that inheritance tax disincentivises wealth creation. Perhaps he does know someone who was going to start a business and thought: “But wait a minute, if it’s really successful and worth, say, £200m when I die, my heirs will only inherit £120m because of inheritance tax. I’m not going to bother!” I suggest that such people are in a minority, however.

Shooting is currently continuing.”Residents of the ancient city also told journalists that they had heard gunfire.The news came as the group Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed responsibility for an attack on an army base in Boulkessi, near the border with Burkina Faso. The Malian authorities are yet to give casualty figures from Sunday’s attack, but sources have told Reuters that as many as 30 soldiers were killed.Since 2012, a swarm of jihadist groups including most notably the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and JNIM have been fighting Malian security forces.When Mali’s juntaseized power in 2020, it cited the deteriorating security situation as a major reason for its coup and promised to act decisively to stabilise the country.Experts and civil society figures say there has barely been any improvement in the situation, while indiscriminate killings by Malian security forces have increased in tandem with the arrival in the country of Russian mercenaries operating at first under the banner of the Wagner group and thenAfricaCorps.Armed groups have also continued attacks in the Liptako-Gourma region where Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger converge. In February,Human Rights Watch reported34 people were killed when an armed group ambushed a civilian convoy travelling from Gao to Ansongo in the north-east of Mali, despite the vehicles being escorted by five military pickup trucks.Similar attacks have taken place across the Sahel, which accounts for more than half of all deaths worldwide from terrorism. Recent attacks have targeted military formations including the 2019 killing of dozens of soldiers at a Boulkessi base andraids on army campsin north-east Nigeria in March.Last July, Malian authorities made the rare admission that “significant” losses had been suffered after clashes pitting the army and Russian-backed mercenaries against jihadists near the desert town of Tinzaouaten.Since the start of May, more than 400 soldiers have reportedly been killed by insurgents in military bases and towns in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. In January, the trio announced their exit from the regional Ecowas bloc – which turned 50 this May – to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), partly to enhance military cooperation.Explore more on these topicsMaliAfricaAl-QaidanewsShareReuse this content"

In 1999, the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission refused six security officers amnesty for their role in the killings. They were never prosecuted and have all since died.Howard Varney, a lawyer for relatives of the Cradock Four, said in his opening statement to the inquest, at the high court in the city of Gqeberha: “These were four young men who had so much to offer SouthAfrica. The searing pain of their absence persists with the families to this day.”At one of the previous inquests, it was revealed that Joffel van der Westhuizen, the former military commander of what was then the Eastern Province, sent a message to the apartheid regime’s state security council requesting permission to “remove permanently from society as a matter of urgency” the “agitators”. Another general who received the messagearguedthat this meant detaining the men, not killing them.In an opening statement, Van der Westhuizen’s lawyer said “he denies ever authorising or ordering the killing of the deceased”.The lawyer said the former general was “not in a very healthy condition” and had so far not been able to get the South African military to pay his legal costs. The lawyer argued that witnesses, who include nine family members of the Cradock Four, could not give evidence that implicated Van der Westhuizen unless he had funded legal representation.Judge Thami Beshe ruled that in the first part of the inquest, which will last until 12 June, witnesses could refer to Van der Westhuizen and three former police officers who are also still alive, as long as they only used information in the public domain.Calata’s son, Lukhanyo Calata, said: “Today is emotional. Good emotion. We’ve waited so many years to finally get to this point, where a court in democratic South Africa finally gets to hear the Cradock Four case.”Calata, who is a journalist, noted that some Afrikaners, the white minority that ruled South Africa during apartheid and the same ethnicity as his father’s killers, were promoting the false claim that there was a “genocide” against them, a claim amplified by the US president, Donald Trump.He added: “What we are hoping for now is to correct the historic record.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In April, the country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, set up an inquiry into whether past democratic governments interfered with investigations and prosecutions. However, the families havecriticisedthe inquiry, as it has only fact-finding powers and cannot award damages.The inquest continues on Tuesday with a visit to the home of Goniwe in the town of Cradock, now called Nxuba, and the site between there and Gqeberha, formerly known as Port Elizabeth, where the men were abducted.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She started the strike to secure either British consular access to her son or his release. Doctors have told the family she is at risk of sudden death, but her body has also adapted to months without food. It is the second time she has been hospitalised.Her son has been held in various forms of detention in Egypt for more than 10 years, but completed his latest five-year jail sentence last September. However, the Cairo judiciary kept him in prison on the grounds that the two years he had spent in jail prior to his sentencing did not count as part of his five years.Soueif’s two daughters remain by her bedside, but her family say she is determined not to back down and will see this through to a resolution.View image in fullscreenHelena Kennedy: ‘The time for relying solely on polite diplomacy is long past.’Photograph: David Levenson/Getty ImagesKennedy has urged the British government to elevate the case to a much higher level, including introducing “sanctions against any Egyptian authorities responsible for Abd el-Fattah’s continued detention beyond the end of his five-year sentence”, a course she has recommended to the Commons foreign affairs select committee.She is also calling for holding off any new trade and investment cooperation with Egypt. Overall, she says, the UK government’s approach in the case has been too timid and Soueif, a distinguished human rights activist, “wants more than anything else to reunite her son with his own 14-year-old son, who lives in Brighton and has barely been able to spend time with his father”.Kennedy said: “Laila’s bravery and fortitude is astonishing. The time for relying solely on polite diplomacy is long past: the prime minister must demonstrate his strength and resolve on this case.”Last week, Kennedy joined the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson, the former Foreign Office minister Peter Hain and thecampaigner Richard Ratcliffein urging “caution against travel to Egypt”.Kennedy said: “In light of what we have learned from Alaa’s case, the British government must make clear that a British citizen who falls foul of the police state in Egypt cannot expect fair process, nor normal support from the British government. Hundreds of thousands of British citizens travel to Egypt each year, making a major contribution to the country’s economy, and the truth is we can’t guarantee their rights. The Egyptian government will undoubtedly take notice if its failure to abide by the rule of law starts affecting British hotel bookings for the winter season.”The UK prime minister has twice phoned the Egyptian president to urge him to show clemency, but no punitive measures have been threatened by the UK government.Soueif’s determination has led to vigils being held for her in Berlin, Washington and Damascus.Omar Robert Hamilton, a nephew of Soueif who was with his aunt over the weekend, said she had told him “my course is irreversible”. He added: “My aunt’s resolve has only grown stronger in hospital. She is receiving the messages of support and solidarity from around the world, and she will see her struggle through to the end – whatever that end is.”More than 120 former Egyptian political prisoners have also appealed to the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to show clemency. They wrote: “What unites us is that we have been inside this circle, but what distinguishes us from Alaa and others still in detention is that the state has made decisions – at various stages – to give a presidential pardon, or release after the extension of our sentences has expired. And today, years or months after we left jail, we were not a threat or likely to damage to public safety, we simply returned to our lives, trying to restore what was lost.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptHuman Rights ActHuman rightsAfricaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Heavy rain struck the north of the country on Wednesday night and continued into Thursday, leading to flooding along the Niger River, displacing thousands and destroying hundreds of homes. The district head said it was the region’s worst flood in 60 years.Heavy rain is not unusual at this time of year in Nigeria. The country has a tropical climate and is influenced by the west African monsoon, with the wet season running from April until October. This type of seasonality is linked to land-sea temperature differences, alongside the shiftingintertropical convergence zone(ITCZ), a band of low pressure roughly around the equator that shifts north and south with the angle of the sun.From March to September, the sun favours the northern hemisphere, meaning there is greater incoming solar radiation here during this time. As land heats up faster than water, this creates surface low pressure over westAfricaas air ascends over the region, which then allows moister air to move in from the Atlantic to later fall out as rain.Additionally, the ITCZ moves northwards during the northern hemisphere summer, meaning this region of low pressure is now situated over north Africa, allowing for more precipitation there. In contrast, during the northern hemisphere winter, the ITCZ shifts southwards, leading to drier conditions in west Africa under higher pressure.This week, Niger andNigeriawill continue to experience rainfall but also below-average temperatures. These will fall about 10C below normal early this week, with daytime maximums in the mid to high 20s compared with a climate average of mid- to high 30s Celsius.Northern Africa also had some extreme weather, with a severe summer storm hitting Alexandria inEgypton Saturday. The city was battered by heavy rain, strong winds and hail, which flooded the streets and caused power outages.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Last year, archaeologists using AIdiscovered hundreds of new geoglyphsdating back more than 2,000 years, predating the famous lines in the sand.“They are trying to rub out history,” said Ana María Cogorno Mendoza, president of the Maria Reiche International Association, a non-profit created to protect the Nazca Lines. “The area that is being separated is exactly where some of the oldest rituals took place, according to our research.” Maria Reiche was a German-born mathematician who pioneered research on the Nazca Lines in the 20th century.Archaeologists use AI to discover 303 unknown geoglyphs near Nazca LinesRead moreCritics of the move say it will weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve toinformal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak.Peru’s culture ministry, which decided on Friday to reduce the Nazca reserve from about 5,600 sq km to roughly 3,200 sq km, said the decision was the result of a 20-year study and consultation and did not affect the Unesco World Heritage destination or its buffer zone.“There has not been enough study to say it has no cultural or archeological value,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who has closely followed the decision-making in the case.“This area, which belongs to our ancestors, requires real protection and not just political expediency.”Luis Jaime Castillo, a former culture minister and an archeologist who has studied the geoglyphs said the protected area was already “infested with illegal mining and mineral processing plants”.Sidney Novoa, the technology director at NGO Amazon Conservation, who has mapped the site, said the area now excluded from the protected archeological zone amounted to more 2,000 sq km and was overlapped by some 300 concessions owned by miners on a controversial registry of informal miners purportedly in the process of formalising their operations, known as REINFO.Ipenza said the registry allowed illegal mining to continue with impunity and without state oversight, adding that the government favours mining over environmental protection.The move “exposes [the reserve] to a very serious risks and cumulative damage”, said Mariano Castro, a former environment minister. “The ministry of culture is not considering the expansion of hundreds of extractive mining activities that will cumulatively impact the existing sensitive archaeological zones in Nazca.”“This update responds to the need to more accurately reflect the relationship between the geoglyphs and the physical features recorded in the area, ensuring their protection and preservation,” Fabricio Valencia, Peru’s culture minister, told national radio on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Parts of the opposition also called for a boycott.Still, the estimated 13% turnout is far below the more than 60% that tends to turn out for presidential elections, and also lower than any other federal vote in Mexico’s democratic history.Once blank and spoiled ballots are taken into account, the effective vote could be still lower.The opposition, which has been unable to find a response to Morena’s electoral machine since former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador first led it to power in 2018, seized on the low turnout to criticise the reform.“As we said from the beginning: the election of the judiciary was an absolute failure,”saidRicardo Anaya, a former presidential candidate from the conservative PAN party.“What we saw was a simulation, a fraud and a mess. Empty ballot boxes, ballots marked prematurely, and citizens who did not even know who they were voting for. This is not democracy. It is an insult.”However, there is no minimum turnout required to formally legitimise an election in Mexico.The vote count is expected to be protracted, and results will drip in over the next two weeks.Low turnout favours the clientelistic vote, and there was evidence of illegal party interference in the elections through the distribution ofcheat sheetslargely with the names of the government’s favoured candidates.Many of these sheets focused on the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena’s executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line.Other interests – including organised crime groups – may also have managed to place their own favoured candidates by mobilising voters.Over the coming weeks, experts will scrutinise the results to discern which interests have emerged with more and less influence in Mexico’s courts.The new judges will take their seats in a transformed judicial system in September.“Yesterday’s turnout at the polls met expectations,” said Sheinbaum. “It was an innovative process that generated interest among the participants.”“Everything can be perfected,” added Sheinbaum, looking ahead to the second round of judicial elections in which another 1,000 judges will be chosen. “We will draw conclusions from yesterday to make improvements for 2027.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The new president will face major challenges including a slowing economy, President Donald Trump’s America-first policies and North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats.The election commission says voting began at 6am at 14,295 polling stations nationwide that will close at 8pm. Observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight.More than 15 million people already have cast ballots during a two-day early voting period last week, accounting for nearly 35% of the country’s 44.4 million eligible voters.In his final campaign speeches Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. He urged the people to vote for him, arguing that a win by Kim would allow Yoon’s “rebellion forces” to return.“If they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people’s human rights, the normalisation of martial law and our country’s downfall into a backward, third-world nation,” Lee told the crowd gathered at a Seoul park.Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament.Lee “is now trying to seize all power inSouth Koreaand establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,” Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan.Lee, who led the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, has been a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics for years. He faces multiple criminal trials, including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal, with South Korea’s supreme court recently ordering a retrial of an election violation case after overturning his acquittal, with instructions for conviction.Courts have agreed to postpone further hearings of ongoing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remain unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution.Should he win though, legal questions remain over whether presidential immunity would halt his ongoing prosecutions, as opposed to simply preventing new charges, potentially setting up another constitutional crisis.As a former child labourer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country’s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country’s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on a political division and backpedals on promises too easily.On foreign policy, Lee has not made any contentious remarks recently and has steadfastly vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has called South Korea’s alliance with the US the foundation of its foreign policy and promised to solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that is not much different than the position held by South Korea’s conservatives.Experts say there aren’t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump’s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the US military presence, as well as North Korea’s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and Kim avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Buyers included people linked to sanctions, or facing serious allegations, or with warrants out for their arrest. In December,the EU revoked the visa-free travel agreementbecause of its concerns over the scheme.Tate’s citizenship was said to have been granted in December 2022, according to NXT Citizen, the agency that submitted the application, OCCRP reported. That month, Tate and his brother, Tristan, 36, were arrested by Romanian authorities on charges of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Andrew Tate was also accused of rape. His passport was issued in January 2023 while he was still being held in pre-trial detention, it has been claimed.The Tate brothers, who grew up in Luton in the UK, have been under criminal investigation in Romania since April 2022. It is not clear when Tate applied for citizenship for Vanuatu, which does not have a formal extradition arrangement with Romania.Tate’s spokesperson said he would not comment on the Vanuatu reports. The Guardian has also contacted Tate’s lawyers in Romania and the US.The Tate brothers have denied the allegations in Romania, and an appeals court said in December that a human trafficking case could not proceed because of legal and procedural irregularities. The case has been sent back to prosecutors.The Tates faced further allegations in Romania last August, including accusations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering, all of which they deny.The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.UK prosecutors confirmed last weekthey had authorised 10 charges against Andrew Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain. The charges are connected to three alleged victims. Tristan Tate faces 11 charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking, all connected to one alleged victim. They deny the charges.The brothers would return to Britain to defend themselves, their UK lawyer said last week.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaVanuatuSouth PacificPacific islandsAsia PacificEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Tariffs had reached 125% on each side, which officials feared amounted to virtual embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies.Donald Trump had hailed the pause as a “total reset” of US-China relations. But since then, trade negotiations have faltered, with the US complaining that China has not delivered on promises to roll back restrictions on the export of key critical minerals to the US. The US president said on Friday that China had “totally violated” the agreement.UK trade secretary to seek exemption from US steel and aluminium tariffsRead moreThe US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Sunday: “What China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe. And that is not what a reliable partner does.”During the period of aggressive retaliatory trade measures between the US and China in April, China had restricted the export of certain rare earth minerals and magnets, which are critical for US manufacturing.The restrictions were expected to be relaxed after the 12 May agreement but the process appears to have been patchy at best. Now, US companies, particularly car manufacturers, arereportedlyrunning out of magnets.China hit back on Monday, accusing the US of violating and undermining the agreements reached in Geneva in May, and the consensus between Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s president, on their17 January phone call.China’s commerce ministry said on Monday: “The US has successively introduced a number of discriminatory restrictive measures against China, including issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and announcing the revocation of Chinese student visas.”The ministry said China “is determined to safeguard its rights and interests” and denied the accusation from the US that it had undermined the 12 May agreement.The US has indicated that another Xi-Trump call is expected soon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet Eastwood has now said that he never spoke to anyone from German-language Austrian newspaper Kurier.“A couple of items about me have recently shown up in the news,” Eastwood said in a statement released toDeadline. “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phony.”Eastwood, who turned 95 over the weekend, had been originally quoted as saying he was in pre-production on his new movie and had rallied against “an era of remakes and franchises”.Kurier is based in Vienna and has a circulation of approximately 100,000 copies.There is no official statement from Kurier or any details on how the interview was assembled.Eastwood’s most recent filmJuror #2, which starred Nicholas Hoult, was released at the end of last year with no confirmed word on what his next film will be. In aninterviewto support the film with the Metrograph magazine, he addressed his legacy as a film-maker.“That would be up to them, to the audiences, to answer,” he said. “Up to the people on the outside. I just kind of go along. I consider this, again, emotional. It comes upon you. You have a story, you make a movie of it. You have to just go for it. If you think too much about how it happened you might ruin it. I go back and look at films I’ve made, and I could easily ask, ‘Why the heck did I make this?’ I don’t remember! It might have been a long time ago.”Eastwood had recentlypaid tributeto co-star Gene Hackman after Hackman’s death in February. “There was no finer actor than Gene,” he said. “Intense and instinctive.

He said he would seek a parliamentary vote to confirm his majority.The dramatic move highlights the government’s difficult position as it comes to terms with the consequences of losing the race for the presidency.Populist Nawrocki’s triumph threatens Poland’s place at Europe’s top tableRead moreTusk leads an ideologically diverse and politically fragile alliance of pro-European parties, from agrarian right to social democratic left, which promised to reverse the erosion of democratic checks and balances that had marked the eight-year rule of the Law and Justice party (PiS).After 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the outgoing president and PiS ally, Andrzej Duda, the government had hoped Rafał Trzaskowski, a pro-European Warsaw mayor, would win the election and lift the threat of a presidential veto on progressive legislation.But Sunday’s defeat will make it very difficult for the government to deliver on its promises, extending the political stalemate.Nawrocki, who received public backing from senior members of the Trump administration, is fiercely critical of the EU and likely to ally himself wherever he can with other Eurosceptic leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. This risks divisions within the bloc at a time when it faces challenges including US tariffs and the war in Ukraine.While the role of president is largely ceremonial, with some influence over foreign and defence policy, it carries the critical power to veto laws, which can be overturned only with a 60% majority in parliament, which Tusk’s coalition does not have.No date for the vote of confidence has been set, but it could take place as early as this week because parliament is scheduled to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday. Unless there is a rebellion, the ruling coalition has enough votes in parliament to win.A clear win would also quash any talk about a potential alternative majority emerging on the right should some government MPs defect to the opposition camp.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said an agreement had also been made to return the remains of killed service personnel, but added that this would take careful preparation.Zelenskyy did not take part in the talks but was speaking during a visit to Lithuania, where he called for stronger sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire.He said his negotiators had given their Russian counterparts a list of nearly 400 abducted Ukrainian children that Kyiv wanted Moscow to return home, but that the Russian delegation agreed to work on returning only 10 of them.Ukrainian officials said that the focus of the prisoner exchange should be the wounded and sick as well as young soldiers between 18 and 25 years old. Russian officials confirmed that “all” sick and wounded prisoners would be swapped, and that the exchange would involve at least 1,000 PoWs.View image in fullscreenThe Russian negotiating team in Istanbul’s Çırağan Palace.Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty ImagesMonday’s negotiations took place at the Çırağan Palace, a vast 19th-century Ottoman edifice on the banks of the Bosphorus that is now a luxury hotel. In one of its expansive conference chambers, the two delegations – each about a dozen strong – sat at long tables facing each other, about 10 metres apart. The Russians all came in dark suits, while the Ukrainians were mostly in military uniform. The whole meeting took less than two hours.After the talks, Ukraine’s head negotiator and defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said the return of the abducted children “is a fundamental priority for us”.“If Russia is genuinely committed to a peace process, the return of at least half the children on this list is positive,” Umerov said.The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed only that it had received a list of 339 names of people Ukraine wanted returned, but did not comment further.The international criminal court in The Hagueissued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putinand a senior aide in 2023 for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children.View image in fullscreenThe Ukrainian negotiating team.Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty ImagesAt Monday’s meeting in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said that the Russians rejected Kyiv’s call for an unconditional ceasefire of at least a month, but had instead handed over a written proposal , which the Ukrainians said they would need more time to study before responding. They suggested the talks should reconvene towards the end of June.The Russian state news agency, RIA, said the Russian document proposed two options for a ceasefire, one of which would require Ukraine to begin a complete withdrawal of its troops from four of its regions occupied by Russia. RIA described the second option only as a “package” containing a number of unspecified conditions.Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said meanwhile his government wanted to arrange a summit between Zelenskyy and Putin.“My desire is to bring Putin and Zelenskyy together in Istanbul or Ankara – also to invite Trump to this meeting as well,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara. “We will take steps for this meeting after the latest talks.”View image in fullscreenVadym Skibitskyi, Ukraine’s deputy defence intelligence chief, addresses the media alongside Rustem Umerov, the minister of defence.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesZelenskyy has repeatedly said he is ready to meet Putin and on Monday Umerov restated Kyiv’s desire for a summit.“We believe that all the key issues can only be solved at the level of leaders … with the possible involvement of other leaders such as the president of the United States,” the defence minister said.Heorhii Tykhyi, the Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “If Putin says he is ready to meet tomorrow, our president Zelenskyy is ready to meet him tomorrow.”Last month,Zelenskyy challenged Putinto meet him in Ankara for a summit suggested by Donald Trump. However, the Russian leader did not respond and sent mid-level officials to the talks instead.View image in fullscreenVladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, briefing the press after the talks.Photograph: Yasin Akgül/AFP/Getty ImagesBriefing reporters after Monday’s talks, Medinsky said that the memorandum given to the Ukrainian delegation included proposed “steps towards a full ceasefire”. He added that Moscow had suggested short ceasefires of two or three days at some parts of the front “so that commanders can collect the bodies of their soldiers”. But he did not specify where Russia was proposing such local truces should take place. The Ukrainian side did not respond publicly to the proposal.Both sides stepped up their military operations before the Istanbul talks. Ukraine carried outa complex drone strike on targeting Russian bomber planeson four military airfields across Russia, as far away as Siberia.Operation Spiderweb: a visual guide to Ukraine’s destruction of Russian aircraftRead moreUkrainian officials said that Sunday’s remote-controlled drone operation, codenameOperation Spiderweb, had been 18 months in the planning, and had succeeded in damaging or destroying 41 planes including Tu-160 and Tu-22 bombers, as well as Tu-95s used to launch cruise missiles against Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence put the total of Russian material losses at $7bn (£5.2bn).Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, called it a “very accurate military operation”, adding that as long as Russia rejected a ceasefire and continued to carry out attacks on Ukrainian civilians, Ukraine could continue to develop new ways to hamper Russia’s capacity to carry out missile or drone attacks.“Innovative technologies played a really crucial role in this operation, and these technologies now are the game-changers on the battlefield. And I believe that Ukraine has many other ideas, technologies, how to move ahead,” Shmyhaltold the France24 television channel. “We are working constantly to do our best to [restrict] Russian possibility to attack Ukraine … We continue to clear our sky from Russian bombers, and we will do the same in other spheres, including on the ground.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past two years, the bloc’s sixth-biggest economy has become a key player at the heart of mainstream European policymaking.Nawrocki’s victory hands him a presidential veto that will make it difficult for Tusk’s government to pass promised legislation rolling back the judicial and other changes implemented by PiS that led to repeated clashes with Brussels.But it heralds more than just a delicate period of cohabitation between a pro-EU prime minister and a nationalist, Eurosceptic president. The 42-year-old, who has never held elected office, will seek to actively undermine Tusk wherever he can.Poland’s outgoing PiS-aligned president, Andrzej Duda, deployed his veto, but sparingly. Nawrocki will do so more aggressively and systematically, analysts say, aiming to weaken the prime minister before 2027 parliamentary elections.PiS and its allies will portray Sunday’s presidential vote as a full-scale rejection of Tusk’s progressive and reformist agenda – and may even be tempted to try to bring down his already fractured coalition government before the end of its term.Snap elections could be triggered, for example, if Nawrocki, whose campaign focused on conservative Catholic values, attacks on EU migration and climate policy and opposition to Ukraine’s accession to the bloc, decides to stall the budget, which he could do by sending it to the PiS-dominated constitutional tribunal.Polls suggest that PiS and the far-right, libertarian Confederation party of Sławomir Mentzen, who won nearly 15% of the vote in the first round of the presidential ballot, could control a majority of seats in parliament if they were to unite.So far, Mentzen has ruled that out, even refusing to endorse Nawrocki. But an analysis of Sunday’s vote showed that almost 90% of Mentzen’s first-round voters backed Nawrocki in the presidential runoff, and the potential affinity is clear.Amid growing speculation about the government’s future, Tusk on Monday called for a confidence vote to force junior partners to commit to his coalition and head off any defections towards a possible PiS-Confederation majority.In Europe, while Tusk will continue to represent Poland at EU summits, he will inevitably be weakened by the challenge to his domestic legitimacy. Nawrocki, as commander-in-chief, may also seek to sway Poland’s strongly pro-Ukraine stance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But analysts note Polish conservatives cast Sunday’s vote as a refendum on Tusk’s whole pro-EU agenda.The nationalist’s win is also a boost for Europe’s populist EU-critical parties, led by Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and to Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister and the bloc’s disrupter-in-chief, whose illiberal rule-of-law playbook PiS follows.Nawrocki’s triumph was a “fresh victory for patriots”, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on his Facebook page on Monday.Nawrocki, who was invited to Washington by Trump and has shared a selfie with the US president, is opposed to Europe’s recent security shift away from the US and favours closer transatlantic ties – another source of tension with Tusk, and Brussels.Explore more on these topicsPolandEuropeEuropean UnionThe far rightDonald TuskanalysisShareReuse this content"

That could see Iran in turn launch reprisals.Faced by such a catastrophe, Iran is likely to temper its response to the US plans so that further talks are possible.The best compromise available would be a US statement that Iran in principle is permitted to enrich uranium but in practice will not do so, at least inside Iran, for an indefinite period.The US has said it would allow Iran to join a Middle East consortium to enrich uranium,in conjunction with Saudi Arabia, but this could not take place on Iranian soil. A regional consortium for a civil nuclear program would require huge trust between the countries involved and continued external inspection.At one point it seemed that Donald Trump would allow Iranian enrichment at low levels so long as US inspectors – not just UN teams – were given access to Iran’s nuclear sites, but that solution seems to be fading.But on Monday evening, the US president said Iran would not be allowed to enrich any uranium under a possible nuclear deal.“Under our potential Agreement – WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” Trump said on social media, in response to a report in the Axios news outlet that said his administration’s offer would let Tehran enrich some of the nuclear fuel.Speaking on a visit to Cairo, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi revealed little about the progress of the talks, but said Iran would be replying to the US proposals shortly.Iran did suspend enrichment for two years from November 2003, but in 2005 it rejected the European plan to use imported low-enriched nuclear fuel for its reactors.In Egypt Araghchi met Raphael Grossi, the director of the UN nuclear inspectorate the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), expressing his displeasure at a draft IAEA report prepared for the agency’s next board meeting that highlights how Iran has continued to enrich uranium at high levels of purity contrary to the agreement the nation signed in 2015.France, Germany and the UK intend to use the report to press for a board vote leading to UN sanctions being reimposed in September.The Iranians claim the draft IAEA report contains nothing surprising or new, but accuse the west of pressurising the inspectorate to develop an increasingly propagandistic tone.The report found that Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the UN nuclear watchdog at three locations that have long been under investigation.Araghchi said: “western pressures should not affect the IAEA and the IAEA must maintain its independent and technical identity. Some countries want to put pressure on Iran through the IAEA, and we hope that the IAEA will not fall into this trap.”He added: “Iran’s enrichment is completely peaceful and a scientific achievement that we have achieved through our scientists. The Iranian nation has paid heavy prices to achieve this achievement, andthe blood of a number of our nuclear scientists has been shed for this issue.“If the goal of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran does not seek to obtain nuclear weapons, we can reach an agreement in this regard, but if unacceptable and unrealistic goals are pursued in this regard and the goal is to deprive Iran of peaceful nuclear activities, there will definitely be no agreement.”Ebrahim Azizi, the head of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission, said: “If a proposal is based on ignoring the principle of enrichment, it is not at all presentable, not acceptable, not admissible, not worthy of attention, and not negotiable.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranMiddle East and north AfricaInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)OmannewsShareReuse this content"

Videos on social media appeared to show the aftermath of what was said to be the location of al-Aishiya school.Announcing the strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, without providing evidence or naming the school, it had bombed a site “used by terrorists” in the area, claiming it had taken steps to reduce civilian harm.Al-Aishiya school was among a series of school buildings used as shelters identified by the IDF as targets in recent weeks, according to military sources.Four further school buildings have been marked as potential targets to be bombed, according to the sources.The locations identified as potential targets include four schools: Halawa, al-Rafaa’i, Nusiba and Halima Sa’dia. All four are in or near Jabaliya in the north of Gaza.It was not immediately clear whether these buildings were also being used as shelters. Two of the schools appear to have been damaged by airstrikes at earlier stages in the offensive.According tolatest UN assessments, 95% of Gaza’s schools have sustained some level of damage to their buildings. Approximately 400 schools were classified as having suffered a “direct hit”.1:19Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza – video reportOn 25 May, an Israeli strike killed at least 54 people sleeping at the Fahmi al-Jarjawi school, according to local officials, whotold the BBCthat severely burnt bodies, including those of children, were recovered from classrooms that had been set ablaze.The IDF claimed it had “struck key terrorists who were operating within a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre embedded in an area that previously served” as the school.Over the past two months, school buildings, hospitals and municipal buildings have been categorised by the IDF as “heavy centres”, which it believes are being used by Hamas militants alongside civilians, according to three military sources.The sources said airstrikes had been authorised against such sites in circumstances in which only low-ranking militants were present despite knowing that civilians could be killed.Juliette Touma, the director of communications at Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, said schools “must always be protected and must never be hit or used for military or fighting purposes”.“Very sadly, schools have been struck over and over for the past 20 months. It’s a grave violation of international law and of children’s rights,” she said.Asked about its planned operations against school buildings, a spokesperson said the IDF “operates exclusively on the grounds of military necessity and in strict accordance with international law”.The spokesperson claimed that Hamas unlawfully “exploits schools” for military activities by “building military networks beneath and within schools … launching attacks towards IDF forces from them, and imprisoning hostages in them”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The military said it fired warning shots at “suspects” who approached its forces.The shooting occurred at the same location where witnesses say Israeli forces fired a day earlier on crowds of people heading towards the food distribution hub in southern Gaza run by the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.The Israeli military said it fired warning shots on Monday toward “several suspects who advanced toward the troops and posed a threat to them”, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution site at a time when it was closed. The army denied it was preventing people from reaching the site.The UN and leading aid groups have rejected the foundation’s new system for food distribution. They say it violates humanitarian principles and cannot meet mounting needs in the territory of roughly 2 million people, whereexperts have warned of faminebecause of an Israeli blockade that was only slightly eased last month.In a separate incident on Monday, an Israeli strike on a residential building in northern Gaza killed 14 people, according to health officials. The Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals confirmed the toll from the strike in the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp, saying five women and seven children were among those killed.The military said it had struck “terror targets” across northern Gaza, without elaborating. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militant group is entrenched in populated areas.A Red Cross field hospital received 50 injured people, including two declared dead on arrival, after the shooting in southern Gaza, according to Hisham Mhanna, a Red Cross spokesperson. He said most had gunfire and shrapnel wounds. Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis said it received a third body.Moataz al-Feirani, 21, who was being treated at Nasser hospital, said he was shot in his leg as he walked with a crowd of thousands towards the food distribution site. He said Israeli forces opened fire as they neared the Flag Roundabout at about 5:30 am.One afternoon in Gaza, two family tragedies: the childhoods cut short by Israeli airstrikesRead more“We had had nothing, and they [the Israeli military] were watching us,” he said, adding that drones were filming them.On Sunday, at least31 people were killedand more than 170 injured at the Flag Roundabout as large crowds headed towards the food distribution site, according to local health officials, aid groups and several eyewitnesses. The witnesses said Israeli forces opened fire on the crowds at about 3 am after ordering them to disperse and come back when the distribution site opened.Israel’s military on Sunday denied its forces fired at civilians near the site in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, a military zone off limits to independent media. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with procedure, said troops fired warning shots at several suspects advancing towards them overnight.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has denied previous accounts of chaos and gunfire around its sites, said it had delivered aid on both days without incident.On Sunday night, the foundation issued a statement, saying food recipients must stay on the designated route to reach the hub on Monday, and that Israeli troops are positioned along the way to ensure their security. “Leaving the road is extremely dangerous,” the statement said.The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said he was “appalled by the reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza” on Sunday. “It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food.”“I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable,” he said in a statement on Monday.Israel and the US say they helped establish the new food distribution system to circumvent Hamas, which they accuse of siphoning off assistance.UN agencies deny there is any systemic diversion of aid and say the new system violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to control who receives food and by forcing Palestinians to travel long distances to receive it.Palestinians must pass close to Israeli forces and cross military lines to reach the GHF hubs, in contrast to the UN aid network, which delivers aid to where Palestinians are located.The Israel-Hamas war began when Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after others were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to the Hamas-run government. Its toll is seen as generally reliable by UNagencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers.Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pull-out.Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned, and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and sent into exile. It has said it will maintain control of Gaza indefinitely and facilitate what it refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its population.Palestinians and most of the international community have rejected the resettlement plans, viewing them as forcible expulsion.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The city hosted Eurovision in 2023, which generated £54m in direct economic impact.If a £1- to £5-a-night levy were introduced in Greater Manchester, it could raise between £8m and £40m a year, which could go towards infrastructure projects such as the regeneration of Old Trafford or airport development, the mayors said.The mayors said funds raised through a visitor levy would be ringfenced for local reinvestment, and said the government needed to act urgently, as devolved governments in Scotland and Wales are moving ahead with their own tourism levies, leaving English regions at risk of falling behind.“The Liverpool city region is a global icon of creativity, culture and character – attracting more than 60 million visitors every year and supporting a £6.25bn visitor economy,” Rotheram said. “That’s something to be incredibly proud of – but it also comes with pressures on our infrastructure and services.“A small charge on overnight stays – the kind most of us wouldn’t think twice about when travelling abroad – would give us the power to reinvest directly into the things that make our area so special.”Burnham added: “At a time when national resources are under real pressure, a modest visitor levy – something we all pay in other parts of Europe – offers a fair and sustainable way to support our local services.”McGuinness said: “A local tourism tax is so mainstream across the rest of the world you barely notice it, so it should not be a big step here in the UK.”Last year, areport from the landscape charity Friends of the Lake Districtmade a similar call. The organisation’s chief executive, Mike Hill, said: “In most of the places around the world that we’ve looked at that have brought in some sort of tourism levy, tourism numbers have actually increased, because the place gets better.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandTax and spendingLiverpoolManchesterSteve RotheramRachel ReevesLisa NandynewsShareReuse this content"

The fact is that it’s not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?”This year’s fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues.Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. “What excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,” he said.For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to theKeep it Fringefunding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe’s honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts.Lankester said he had numerous conversations that “reaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there’s a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It’s something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It’s still on an incredible number of people’s bucket lists.”He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her “enormously valuable” intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: “The message landed.”Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least £1.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city’s ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents.The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. “What we don’t want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people [who] drive a big chunk of that revenue,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festivalEdinburghScotlandOasisAC/DCFestivalsFringe theatrenewsShareReuse this content"

Coskun had argued his criticism was of Islam in general rather than its followers but McGarva said he could not accept this.Coskun’s legal fees are being paid by the National Secular Society and the Free Speech Union, both of which criticised the ruling and said they intended to appeal “and keep on appealing it until it’s overturned”.The advocacy group Muslim Engagement and Development quoted the judge’s sentencing remarks on X,commenting on the ruling with the hashtag #hatespeechisnotfreespeech.The ruling has prompted comment from figures in Westminster. The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment on the case but said there were no blasphemy laws inEnglandnor were there plans to introduce any.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said on X that the case “should go to appeal”. “Freedom of belief, and freedom not to believe, are inalienable rights in Britain,” she said. “I’ll defend those rights to my dying day.”McGarva, who issued a fine of £240,rejected the idea that the prosecution was “an attempt to bring back and expand blasphemy law”.In his ruling, he said burning a religious book and making criticism of Islam or the Qur’an are “not necessarily disorderly”, but added: “What made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Originally from Poland, she had last made contact with family on 28 August 2010.She lived in Princes Street, Normanton, after arriving in the UK in 2009. Police said they had concentrated their search at an address on the same street where human remains were found in the garden.Formal identification is yet to take place but police believe that the remains are those of Zablocka.In the past week, two women, 39 and 43, and a 41-year-old man were arrested in connection with the investigation. Police said a 39-year-old woman who was arrested on suspicion of murder was rearrested on Monday. They remain on police bail pending further inquiries.Police have offered a £20,000 reward for information that leads to the conviction of someone in the case of Zablocka, who is understood to have worked at the former Cranberry Foods chicken and turkey factory in Scropton.DI Kane Martin, who is leading the investigation, said: “Izabela’s family are at the forefront of our minds following this discovery and, whilst formal identification has not yet taken place, it is our belief that these remains do belong to Izabela.“As such, we have spoken with Izabela’s family in Poland, and they are aware. Our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time.“Identification of the remains is likely to be a lengthy process, but we will issue updates when we are able.“I know that reports of these findings will send shock waves through the local community, and I understand the concern of residents.Officers will remain in Princes Street in the coming days, and anyone with concerns is encouraged to speak with them.“A dedicated team of detectives are continuing to piece together information about the days prior to Izabela’s death.“Izabela had friends in Derby, socialised in Derby, and worked in Derby.“We know that someone out there will have information about Izabela that may help us understand what happened to her, and urge anyone who saw, spoke to, or heard anything about Izabela in July or August 2010 to come forward.“You may hold the key piece of information that we need to understand the full circumstances of Izabela’s disappearance, and to give her family answers on what happened to their loved one.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsDerbynewsShareReuse this content"

He argued on a visit to the BAE Systems shipyard at Govan, in Glasgow, that defence had to come above other public services.Growing threats, new weapons, more troops: key points of UK’s defence reviewRead moreDrones have transformed the battlefield in Ukraine, with Moscow and Kyiv’s forces now making heavy use of attack and surveillance drones several miles beyond the frontline, causing an estimated 70% of casualties.On Sunday, Ukraine launched coordinated attacks from remotely piloted drones hidden inside trucks aimed at airfields deep inside Russia. Kyiv claimed it had destroyed or damaged 41 Russian aircraft in the innovative long-range attack.The strategic review said drones had become “an essential component of land warfare” and the army needed to invest in a mix of attack drones, surveillance craft and counter-drone technology.But critics said remotely piloted drones risked increasing the chance of conflict. Chris Cole, of the research group Drone Wars UK, said that drones “lower the threshold for the use of armed force” and so could “encourage war as the firstrather than the last option”.Starmer said the 140-page defence review was “a blueprint to make Britain safer and stronger, a battle-ready, armour-clad nation with the strongest alliances and the most advanced capabilities”.The prime minister reiterated that the UK would spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2027, but declined to set a firm date on when that would increase to 3%. Labour has committed to a further increase during the next parliament.The review concluded that Britain faced “multiple, direct threats” to its security for the first time since the end of the cold war – and that to deter conflict in the future the UK must be “ready to fight and win”.But while the review team described the government’s 2.5% target as “good news”, it said a reversal of the hollowing-out of the armed forces would take about 10 years on current budget forecasts. “As we live in such turbulent times, it may be necessary to go faster,” the team said.The target size of the British army will be increased from 73,000 to 76,000 in the next parliament as funding becomes available,Healeytold MPs. But he added that the immediate priority was to reverse falls in personnel numbers. Last week, the total number of soldiers had dropped to a low of 70,860.The review also commits the UK to:Explore the possibility of reintroducing air-launched nuclear weapons by discussing with the US and Nato the possibility of buying F-35A fighters equipped with US B61-12 bombs.Spending £15bn to develop new submarine-launched nuclear warheads – and committing to build 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines in Derby and Barrow, starting in the 2030s.Investing £1bn in air and missile defence, £6bn on munitions during this parliament and opening at least six weapons factories to increase military stockpiles, which currently may last only a few days in a crisis.Developing a home guard, modelled on the army reserves, to ensure the protection of airports, communications sites and other parts of the critical national infrastructure in a major crisis.On Monday, Starmer said he was not “as the prime minister of aLabourgovernment, going to make a commitment as to the precise date” as to when defence spending would increase to 3%. “I don’t believe in performative fantasy politics, and certainly not on defence and security,” the prime minister said.That prompted the Conservatives to accuse Labour of underfunding the new plan. James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, said the prime minister had been unable to set a date for the 3% target “because the Treasury haven’t approved a plan to pay for it”.Starmer is due to join western leaders at a Nato summit this month. NATO members are expected to agree to a proposal from Mark Rutte, the alliance’s secretary general, that member states agree to spend 3.5% on defence by 2035 and a further 1.5% on cyber defences and other military-related infrastructure.Donald Trump, the US president, has demanded that Nato members lift defence budgets to 5% of GDP while Washington has indicated it would reduce its focus on Europe. No American troops are expected to participate in a “reassurance force” designed to ensure peace in Ukraine if a long-term ceasefire is agreed.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryDrones (military)British armyJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

Tariffs had reached 125% on each side, which officials feared amounted to virtual embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies.Donald Trump had hailed the pause as a “total reset” of US-China relations. But since then, trade negotiations have faltered, with the US complaining that China has not delivered on promises to roll back restrictions on the export of key critical minerals to the US. The US president said on Friday that China had “totally violated” the agreement.UK trade secretary to seek exemption from US steel and aluminium tariffsRead moreThe US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Sunday: “What China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe. And that is not what a reliable partner does.”During the period of aggressive retaliatory trade measures between the US and China in April, China had restricted the export of certain rare earth minerals and magnets, which are critical for US manufacturing.The restrictions were expected to be relaxed after the 12 May agreement but the process appears to have been patchy at best. Now, US companies, particularly car manufacturers, arereportedlyrunning out of magnets.China hit back on Monday, accusing the US of violating and undermining the agreements reached in Geneva in May, and the consensus between Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s president, on their17 January phone call.China’s commerce ministry said on Monday: “The US has successively introduced a number of discriminatory restrictive measures against China, including issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and announcing the revocation of Chinese student visas.”The ministry said China “is determined to safeguard its rights and interests” and denied the accusation from the US that it had undermined the 12 May agreement.The US has indicated that another Xi-Trump call is expected soon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While we think there will ultimately be more automation in marketing, the role that agencies play is going to become ever more important through their ability to plan, execute and measure across platforms.”However, Schultz added that AI tools would help “level the playing field” for small and medium-sized businesses that do not have the time or financial scale to use agencies.“Millions of small businesses rely upon our platform to grow,” he said. “For these businesses who aren’t able to work with an agency, or don’t have time during their busy days to think about their creative or targeting, that’s where AI can help level the playing field.”Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookArtificial intelligence (AI)InstagramTechnology sectorSocial networkingAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

One woman was allegedly approached from behind by an executive who put earphones in her ears, saying: “This is the playlist I listen to when having sex.”Men also allegedly approached female staff and, unsolicited, massaged their shoulders to “relax” them. One executive would approach seated staff and allegedly fart near their face, witnesses told police.A female employee told police how she was allegedly tied to her office chair with rolls of tape then put in the lift and a random button was pressed. She said she arrived at another floor, “where I knew no one”, bound to the chair unable to move. The same woman allegedly had her face drawn on with marker pen and was forced to attend a meeting like that, prevented from washing it off. One woman wearing a skirt was allegedly forced to do a handstand in the office.A young Muslim member of staff who did not eat pork allegedly found her screensaver changed to an image of a bacon sandwich. Sandwiches were allegedly placed on her desk or thrown at her during Ramadan. After the2015 jihadist attacks on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, she was ostracised and asked if she supported Islamic State.Junior male staff were also allegedly targeted, with a regular game of chase in which if a man was caught, his penis was touched through his trousers.The three executives deny all the charges.Serge Hascoët, 59, Ubisoft’s chief creative officer and second-in-command, who resigned after the allegations, is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. He is also accused of making sexual and sexist comments. He allegedly told staff that a senior employee was irritating because she did not have enough sex and that he should have sex with her in a meeting room in front of everyone “to show how to calm her”.He is alleged to have handed a young female member of staff a tissue in which he had blown his nose, saying “you can resell it, it’s worth gold at Ubisoft”.He denies all charges.Hascoët’s lawyer, Jean-Guillaume Le Mintier, said: “Serge Hascoët categorically denies having harassed a single colleague. He denies any knowledge of reprehensible acts committed by collaborators at Ubisoft and did not receive any reports of this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was dismissed for misconduct.At a 2015 office Christmas party with a Back to the Future theme, François allegedly told a member of staff he liked her 1950s dress. He then allegedly stepped towards her to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back. The woman said she shouted and broke free, and felt “traumatised”.François denies all charges. He told the court: “I never tried to harm anyone.” He said there had been a “culture of joking around.”The former game director Guillaume Patrux, 41, also dismissed for misconduct, is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. He is alleged to have punched walls, mimed hitting staff, cracked a whip near colleagues’ faces and played with a cigarette lighter near workers, setting alight a man’s beard.Patrux is also alleged to have thrown office equipment across the open-plan office space, kicked footballs across the office, thrown a metal key at a member of staff and drawn swastikas on a woman’s notebook as he sat near her in a meeting.He denies all charges.Ubisoft did not respond to a request for comment.In 2020, when allegations weremade public, the firm’s chief executive, Yves Guillemot, told staff inappropriate behaviour would not be tolerated and disciplinary measures would be taken for any form of harassment.Explore more on these topicsFranceUbisoftGamesSexual harassmentTechnology sector#MeToo movementEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

What were they doing there?Bryan Armen GrahamMon 2 Jun 2025 10.11 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 19.47 EDTShareThe thousands who gathered on Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia weren’t there for a basketball or hockey game. Instead, the 21,000-seat arena played host to a very different spectacle. The stage was bathed in lights, Christian pop thundered from the speakers and the congregation filed in to hear not just sermons, but also strategies: how to get right with God and get rich doing so.The billed headliners were five current and former members of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Head coach Nick Sirianni, star running back Saquon Barkley, second-year cornerback Cooper DeJean, and longtime fan favorites Brandon Graham and Brian Dawkins all appeared on promotional materials forLife Surge, a touring Christian financial seminar that promises attendees a blueprint “to grow and use wealth for Kingdom impact”. Ticket packages offering photo ops with the players sold out in advance.In the extended afterglow of the Eagles’ Super Bowl beatdown of the Kansas City Chiefs, it was a marketing no-brainer: there may not be five public figures with higher popularity at the moment in Philadelphia, a city where sports have always meant a little too much.Get-rich-quick schemes drained my town’s wealth. At a Christian conference, their legacy lives onRead moreYet for all the spiritual rhetoric and NFL star power, Life Surge was built on a business model repeatedly criticized in investigative reports bythe Guardian, thePhiladelphia Inquirerandothersas one that uses faith and celebrity as bait for high-cost financial mentorships. The man behind the operation, Joe Johnson, is a self-described “serial entrepreneur” whose past ventures have been subject to lawsuits, tax controversies and accusations of exploiting Christian values for profit.Johnson has declined requests for interviews but told the Inquirer, whichpublished a detailed investigationinto Life Surge last week, that his failures taught him to become a better business leader. Yet critics describe a pattern that goes back years. Johnson was previously an executive at Get Motivated, a now defunct seminar company that sold expensive investing classes wrapped in conservative Christian branding. One former attendee, Amy Wolfe, said Johnson persuaded her to loan him $12m under the guise of mentorship. She says she never got it back. “They’re predators who want to be your mentors,” Wolfe told the Inquirer. “It happened to me.”The model has hardly changed. Life Surge offers low-cost entry – sometimes as little as $19 – but attendees are soon encouraged to sign up for $97 “starter” seminars, then pitched on advanced training packages that can run as high as $40,000. Credit card applications are often made available on-site and attendees have reported being encouraged to cash out retirement accounts or go into debt. One man, a Christian minister named John Simmons, compared the atmosphere to a timeshare presentation. When he posted a critical YouTube review of his experience, Life Surge sent him cease-and-desist letters and takedown notices. Social media platforms like Reddit arefull of horror storiesclaiming the organization preys on the faith of financially naive Christians.On Saturday in Philadelphia, across the street from the stadium where the Eagles will raise their second Super Bowl banner in September, the event’s branding emphasized faith, success and patriotism, but carefully avoided any official association with the team or the NFL. Earlier versions of promotional artwork used team-style typography and labelled Sirianni the “Philadelphia Eagles Head Coach”. Those references were scrubbed after questions arose in March. A team spokesperson went on to tell the Inquirer that the Eagles had no affiliation with the event. Still, the message was clear: these were NFL champions backing the product.When DeJean was asked about the Life Surge event after an Eagles practice session last week, theSuper Bowl herosaid simply, “They came to my management team.” The other four did not comment. A Life Surge spokesperson confirmed that all five were paid a flat appearance fee but declined to say how much.View image in fullscreenThe amended promotional artwork for Life Surge’s Philadelphia event with the Eagles’ team name and typeface removed.Photograph: Life SurgeView image in fullscreenThe original promotional artwork for Life Surge’s Philadelphia event.Photograph: Life SurgeThis was not a one-off. A2022 Guardian reportfrom a Life Surge event in Denver painted a strikingly similar picture: a day of worship music, motivational speakers and calls to “surge your wealth” as a Christian duty. “Grow your faith to grow your business,” one session instructed. The former NFL star and evangelical heroTim Tebow, reality TV starWillie Robertsonof Duck Dynasty and other conservative Christian luminaries likeKayleigh McEnanyfilled out the program, while the crowd dined on Chick-fil-A. At one point, a speaker asked, “Why on earth are we not buying Twitter?” and encouraged the audience to pool their resources to fight “the devil” taking over American culture. Financial success, attendees were told, was not just personal; it was spiritual warfare.Life Surge’s Philadelphia spectacle also echoed a more recent playbook in Columbus, the college town where the Ohio State Buckeyes football teaminspires a religious fervor. There, the organization tapped into local sporting legends with former Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer, broadcaster Kirk Herbstreit and several Ohio State football players. According tothe Rooster, attendees paid up to $997 for a ticket, with a chance to win photo ops with the stars. Meanwhile, speakers pitched $97 investment classes on the arena floor and sent card readers through the concession lines. The football figures did not directly endorse the seminars, but their proximity to the brand helped attract and validate the crowd. The same cosmetic firewall between pitchmen and athletes was visible in both cities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAt every stop, Life Surge appears to follow the same formula: emotionally charged Christian messaging, conservative talking points and financial promises, all propped up by local sports heroes. It functions as a touring prosperity gospel roadshow, while denying that’s what it is. Speakers at recent tour stops have included some of the NFL’s most recognizable names, such asJoe MontanaandEmmitt Smith, while the Hall of Famer turned broadcasterMichael Strahanis on the slate for next month’s event in Newark, New Jersey.Beneath the stagecraft and scripture, Johnson’s record tells a different story. His previous companies, including the Welfont Group, a real estate firm that marketed dubious tax shelters, have been sued repeatedly. Public records show at least six cases where courts found that appraisals were inflated to artificially boost deductions, ultimately costing clients millions. Johnson insists he left Welfont before the lawsuits began and says he has no knowledge of pending legal actions. But court documents show the deals in question happened while he was CEO.In addition to Welfont, Johnson ran a series of Christian-themed nonprofits and investment initiatives that folded amid controversy. One charity, which claimed to offer microloans in developing countries, spent most of its budget on executive salaries and fundraising, accordingto a Tampa Bay Times investigation. Another declared bankruptcy with $16m in debts.Despite this trail of ventures, Life Surge has flourished since its 2019 launch in Palmetto, Florida, not as a ministry but as a for-profit limited liability company. It sold more than 100,000 tickets for events in more than two dozen cities last year and boasts a 98% satisfaction rate, according to internal surveys. Its spokespeople point to glowing Google reviews and Trustpilot scores. Yet thepattern of complaints persists, from attendees who felt blindsided by the costs, to critics who say the seminars mask old-fashioned hucksterism in a veneer of righteousness.For the Eagles’ devoted supporters, many who wore team-branded gear to Saturday’s event, the presence of their heroes on that stage was surely a thrill. For Life Surge, it was a promotional coup. But for those in the audience already struggling financially, the real cost may not be clear until long after the music fades and the arena empties out.Neither Life Surge nor the Eagles responded to requests for comment from the Guardian for this story.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesNFLUS sportsTim TebowReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was still sportswashingAfter years as a directionless collection of celebrity footballers, PSG are a true team now. But they still represent one of the sport’s darkest trendsSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 2 Jun 2025 10.56 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 12.59 EDTShareParis Saint-Germain’s success in the Champions League final on Saturday was a victory foryouth and adventure. It was a victory for a team built with a coherent vision, and a rebuke to those who believe the game is just about collecting the biggest names. It was avictory for Luis Enrique, a very fine coach who has suffered dreadful personal tragedy. It was a victory for forward-thinking, progressive, fluent football.But it was also a victory for sportswashing.If you could divorce the game from its context, it was mesmerising. PSG were brilliant and although Inter were awful, at least some of that awfulness was provoked by the relentless energy of PSG. The five-goal margin was the widest in any European Cup or Champions League final and it’s hard to believe any final has been anywhere near so one-sided (at least until the next day’s Concacaf Champions Cup final, won bythe same 5-0 scoreline).Four times before, there had been a four-goal margin in the Champions League final. There was Real Madrid’sfabled 7-3 victoryover Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park in 1960, the game that so inspired the future Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. But part of the fascination there was that Frankfurt were also an exceptional side. They had beaten Rangers 12-4 on aggregate in the semi and they were good enough to take the lead – even if their second and third goals came as part of a four-goal flurry between the 71st and 75th minutes.Our Champions League team of the season: a teen sensation to a marauding GunnerRead moreBayern beat Atlético 4-0 in 1974, but that was in a replay. WhenMilan beat Barcelona 4-0 in 1994, it was a shock, and a huge tactical victory for Fabio Capello over Johan Cruyff, but until the fourth went in there was still a sense that Barcelona might come back. Milan’s 4-0 win over Steaua Bucharest in 1989 was perhaps the closest to Saturday; they were emphatic winners and Arrigo Sacchi said it was the closest any of his sides came to achieving his ideal of football.Even whenBarcelona outplayed Manchester Unitedin 2011, United had enough resilience to restrict them to three, even to force an improbable equaliser. It was not the capitulation of Inter.Barcelona must have watched Saturday’s final with disbelief; how had theylost the semi-finalto that Inter? How had they allowed themselves again and again to be undone at set plays and on the counter?The sense is that Saturday will be a defining victory. This is a young PSG side. TheChampions Leagueis a notoriously difficult tournament to retain for everybody apart from Real Madrid, but there’s no reason why this can’t be the first Champions League of many. After the years of the club as a celebrity circus, one which admittedly helped establish their brand, they have a rational recruitment policy and an intense and gifted manager. And they are undoubtedly fun to watch.Which is what makes sportswashing so insidious. On the pitch PSG are what a football club should be. But the fact remains that they are owned by Qatari Sports Investments, and that state support gives them an enormous advantage over other clubs financed by more traditional means. QSI invested in PSG six months after the meeting at the Élysée Palace in November 2010 – a month before Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup – between the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president of Uefa, Michel Platini, and Tamim al-Thani, the crown prince of Qatar – now the emir. PSG was just part of wave of Qatari investment in France, although it should be stressed that Platini maintains he had already decided to vote for Qatar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inter are one of the big three in Italy. They have won the European Cup/Champions League three times. For a long time, they were sustained by the wealth of the Moratti family. They are not minnows in any sense. And yet, according to Deloitte, their annual revenue is less than half that of PSG. Among PSG’s sponsors are Qatar Airways and the Qatar Tourism Agency; state support can oil a lot of wheels.Qataris a countryin which workers are routinely exploited, women are subject to male guardianship laws, same-sex relations are outlawed and freedom of expression severely restricted. It is also the country that hosted thegreatest World Cup final of all timein 2022 and that owns the best team in European (and therefore world) football. Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of PSG, is also the chair of the beIN media group, a major player in the broadcasting of football, and is head of the European Clubs Association, in which role he was seated on Saturday next to the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin. He is enormously influential and is answerable, ultimately, to QSI, of which he is chair.Inter have lost in two of the last three Champions League finals. Both defeats have been to state-owned clubs. This is modern football, the stage for geopolitical manoeuvring. It used to be easy to laugh at PSG, who had spent a fortune on ageing stars who reliably collapsed under pressure. This latest iteration looks more like a football team. It is admirable in many ways. The football is both thrilling and successful. But it is still sportswashing.On this day …View image in fullscreenGiorgio Ferrini, centre, is sent off by the British referee Ken Aston during Italy v Chile.Photograph: APBefore the BBC screened highlights of Chile’s 2-0 victory over Italy at the 1962 World Cup, the presenter David Colemanwarned viewersthat what they were about to see was, “the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of the game”.He wasn’t wrong. The first foul was committed after 35 seconds and matters had got so out of hand by the eighth minute that Italy’s Giorgio Ferrini was sent off for a foul on Honorino Landa. He refused to leave the field, leading to a melee that was only ended by the intervention of police. In the confusion, Chile’s Léonel Sánchez landed a left hook on Humberto Maschio, breaking his nose. As the mayhem continued, Sánchez got away with cuffing Mario David in the face, but David responded a couple of minutes later with a flying kick to the head for which he was sent off. Chile wonwhat became known as the Battle of Santiago2-0.The violence had been provoked by critical articles written by two Italian journalists as they covered the draw in Santiago several months earlier. Both had the sense not to turn up for the tournament itself.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The 22-year-old, ranked No 361 in the world, stunned the American 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 to the delight of the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd.Boisson’s only real claim to fame before the tournament this year was when Britain’s Harriet Dart complained to an umpire about her, saying“tell her to wear deodorant”.French Open: world No 361 Boisson stuns Pegula, Norrie v Djokovic to come – liveRead moreIt was an emotional victory for Boisson, who was due to make her debut in Paris last year only to sustain a serious knee injury a fortnight before the tournament that kept her out of action for nine months. In the last eight she will meet the Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, the sixth seed.“Playing on this court with this atmosphere was amazing,” Boisson said. “I gave my all and in the end I won, which is just incredible. I hope I’m going to win it all.”Andreeva became the youngest player to reach back-to-back French Open quarter-finals in nearly three decades when she defeated the 17th seed, Daria Kasatkina, 6-3, 7-5. The powerful 18-year-old has scythed through the field without dropping a set and her fourth-round victory on Court Suzanne Lenglen helped her to match the feat of Martina Hingis between 1997 and 1998.“I’m so happy I won. I hate playing against her, we practise a lot and even that is a torture,” Andreeva said with a smile. “It was a hell of a match. I’m super happy I stayed calm in the second set when she raised her level … I had to fight and continue playing my game. I knew if I believed in myself I would win a third set.”Andreeva came up with a tight hold to thwart her frequent practice partner in the seventh game and grabbed the break in the next game when Kasatkina sent a backhand long.The Russian-born Kasatkina,who switched nationalities this year, defeated Andreeva in three sets when they met last year in the Ningbo Open final and the 28-year-old showcased her fighting spirit in the next set to recover a break and lead 5-3. “My coach [Conchita Martínez] says you’ve got to practise with the people you don’t like. That’s why I practise with her because I hate her,” Andreeva said. “I knew this match would be tough.”View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff stretches to return during her win over Ekaterina Alexandrova.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThe second seed,Coco Gauff, brushed aside Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-0, 7-5 to also move into the quarter-finals and stay on course for her first title in Paris.

She stepped up her game in the second set. Overall, I thought I played great,” Gauff said. “I move well on clay, really comfortable with sliding and moving on the surface. The most physical surface for sure and I do well in that department.”Hunting her first French Open crown after reaching the final in 2022 and semi-finals last year, the 21-year-old started fast, earning three consecutive breaks for a 5-0 lead in 15 minutes. Gauff was running her opponent ragged across the baseline, with Alexandrova, attempting to reach her first grand slam quarter-final, earning a mere five points until that stage.Gauff, who has now won four of their five meetings, gave away five break points in the next game but still secured her first bagel of the tournament before Alexandrova got on the scoreboard at the start of the second set with her first hold.

And it made my parlay win,” the social media user wrote, with a screenshot of two multi-leg bets on the FanDuel sportsbook platform.Grand Slam Track did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Thomas was catapulted to mainstream fame after her breakout performance in Paris, gracing the cover of American Vogue and appearing on US talk shows. But Thomas has also suffered the darker side of fame, describing on TikTok this year how she was stalked by a group of men at several airports, as social media gives female athletes greater exposure.The incident at Grand Slam Track also reflecteda growing link between sports betting and harassment, with female tennis players including Caroline Garcia pointing to “unhealthy betting” as a culprit.“Thank you for pointing out this disgusting behavior,” retired former world 10,000 metres silver medallist and NBC Sports commentator Kara Goucher wrote on X. “You are exposing the crap that women go through and will eventually help other women as well.”Explore more on these topicsSportAthleticsUS sportsGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

The world champion knows it and on Mondayhe admitted as muchwith something of a mea culpa on social media. Yet it also must be considered that it is part and parcel of what makes Verstappen so competitive, albeit in this case in an entirely unedifying and self‑defeating fashion.Angry and frustrated at a sequence of events in Barcelona, including having to cede a place to Russell, Verstappen surrendered to his baser instincts. Having pulled over to give the place to Russell, he clearly then felt a point had to be made and accelerated back up the inside to collide with the Mercedes.‘Not right’: Verstappen issues veiled apology for Russell crash at F1 Spanish GPRead moreHe took a 10-second penalty, dropping him to 10th, putting him 49 points behind the championship leader Oscar Piastri, with three points added to his licence. One more penalty and he will receive a one-race ban.He conceded on Monday that he was “frustrated”, his emotions were running high and that the move was “not right and shouldn’t have happened”.Clearly he had had time to cool down and gain some perspective from what was a moment of madness, but even given the chain of events – which were hardly rage-inducing stuff – this was still shocking from an F1 veteran at 27 years old and a four‑time world champion.It was the purposeless anger that really caught the eye, rather than the severity of the action itself.The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described it as “incomprehensible” and his interpretation of it in the immediate aftermath bears repeating. “The great ones, whether it’s in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level,” he said. “That’s why sometimes these greats don’t recognise that actually the world is not against you, it’s just you who has made a mistake or you’ve screwed up.”Verstappen has displayed this attitude in the past, while hisRed Bullteam have at times positively cultivated the “us‑against‑the‑world” stance, with their contention they have never been quite taken seriously because they are backed by an energy drink manufacturer.Verstappen has also been clear in the past that he believes the rules around overtaking are over‑prescriptive and this too doubtless fed into his frustration. He was similarly aggrieved in Mexico last season when he was penalised twice for two rash manoeuvres on the same lap against Lando Norris. “What is allowed, what isn’t, is not very natural,” he said on Sunday, in reference to the regulations.Even given that antipathy, it is hard not to sense that the driver who can be as controlled and composed as they come, who will grind out a result from nowhere, who has been dragging his recalcitrant car by the scruff of the neck to the front of the grid this season, can sometimes simply succumb to a base, emotive response that is really beneath him but which he cannot seem to quite suppress.That is disappointing, because Wolff is also correct in identifying Verstappen as one of the greats. He may be flawed but he is without doubt an exceptional driver, a generational talent. His uncompromising attitude, drive and competitive spirit inform part of what makes him so good and so hard to beat – but on Sunday those attributes went unrestrained to his cost.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen pictured in the paddock at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday.Photograph: Jayce Illman/Getty ImagesThe Dutchman shares those ultra‑competitive traits with others, perhaps notably Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna, but there is also a fundamental difference. When Schumacher ruthlessly and deliberately clashed with Damon Hill at Adelaide in 1994 and then Jacques Villeneuve at Jerez in 1997, he had a specific purpose in mind – the moves were with the intent of winning the world championship. Similarly, Senna taking out Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990. Cynical, ruthless, ugly and unsportsmanlike, without doubt, but notably with purpose.Nigel Mansell recalls that Senna’s uncompromising attitude was aimed expressly at intimidating other drivers. Verstappen’s wild lunge at Russell in Spain was none of these things. It served no end other than to vent his own anger and has left his title hopes hanging by the slenderest of threads.Worse still it coloured what has otherwise been an enormously impressive season in which he has stayed with the McLarens with immense determination and consistency, taking every opportunity and returning the maximum when he had none.This moment of madness was a pointless flailing that rendered those efforts all but futile and while he maintains he was never really in the title fight, his fearsome efforts thus far this season belie that claim because for all the rightful opprobrium from Sunday, Verstappen is better and more than the driver who gave in to his emotions. His legacy as a potentially great champion depends on him proving that.Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportRed BullanalysisShareReuse this content"

And you see as the years go on, and more and more players have done it, and then now we’ve got all the Arsenal girls as well, it’s just fantastic for us as an England team and us as a country, to have so many more players who are doing great things and achieving great things.”The Arsenal quintet of Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Alessia Russo, Chloe Kelly and Lotte Wubben-Moy all featured in the 1-0 win against Barcelona on 24 May, alongside Arsenal’s Spain midfielder Mariona Caldentey, who was full of praise for Sarina Wiegman’s team on Monday, said: “They have won already the Euros and have played big games already, and of course when you win you feel stronger and have more confidence. That’s always dangerous.We could see against Portugal[on Friday] how they won that game with six goals and they are one of the best teams in the world. We know and respect that, but we have confidence in ourselves as well.”View image in fullscreenMillie Bright is taking a break for her mental health and to recover from the domestic season with Chelsea.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesEngland have been without Bronze’s Chelsea teammate Millie Bright in this international camp while the centre-back takes a break for her mental health as well as to allow her body to recover after the domestic season and, speaking for the first time about Bright’s decision, Bronze said: “She’s missed. We’ve all spoken to Millie during the week. We’ve just offered her our support. Both physically and mentally, it’s been a long season for everyone but, having spent every day with Millie, I know she’s someone who’s quite tough and maybe just holds a lot in, so I think it’s been quite brave for her to come out and speak. And just from a friend’s perspective, I just want her to be OK, and give her as much time as she needs to feel OK again.”Spain, who will be without the Manchester City left-back Leila Ouahabi owing to an ankle injury, were 5-1 winners in Belgium on Friday to stay at the top of Group A3 of the Nations League, with England in second spot, before the decider on Tuesday, with only one team progressing to the semi-finals in October. This is the final fixture before Wiegman names her 23-player squad for the European Championship on Thursday and she says she is nearly ready to make her final decisions.Asked how many more selections she had to make, she said: “We’re pretty close. Of course you still want to get through the game [against Spain] and then make the final decisions, but we are pretty close.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, short-term, trying to win that game, and a little longer-term, a bit long-term, it’s preparation for the Euros, which of course is the bigger picture.“If a player has a little injury and is a risk for the Euros then I wouldn’t play her. That’s one difference. But we’re a good team too and will do everything to win that game.”The match is a repeat of the 2023 Women’s World Cup final, won by Spain, although the last time the sides met it was the Lionesses who won at Wembley in February.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamLucy BronzeSarina WiegmanSpain women's football teamWomen's Nations LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Spurs’ rollercoaster 2024-25 campaign – in which theysecured Europa League success– only ended on 25 May and forced West Brom to bide their time but Mason, after a short holiday, decided to accept their offer and take his first step into management.Chelsea favour £50m bid for Jamie Gittens over keeping Jadon SanchoRead more“I’m absolutely thrilled to have been appointed head coach ofWest Bromwich Albion,” Mason said. “This is a huge club with a fantastic infrastructure and an incredible fanbase and I am excited about what we can achieve together.“Having spoken at length to the board and those at the club, I am convinced that Albion is the perfect place for me to be and I can’t wait to get started. I will bring with me a huge amount of enthusiasm, dedication and ambition and look forward to a positive future together at such a fantastic club.”At the age of 33, Mason becomes the youngest head coach in the Championship and the move ends his seven-year coaching career at Tottenham.Mason, who progressed through Spurs’ academy to play 70 times for his boyhood team, was forced tocut short his playing careerin 2018 after he sustained a fractured skull in a Premier League match for Hull at Chelsea a year earlier.Mason held talks with the Belgian club Anderlecht in October before a mutual decision was made to remain at Spurs, which enabled him to play his part in the club’s first trophy since 2008.After two previous caretaker stints at Tottenham, including leading the club inthe 2021 Carabao Cup final, Mason has long been tipped for a future in management.Mason initially started coaching at youth level for Spurs upon his playing retirement before being promoted to Antonio Conte’s coaching staff three years later, not long after a seven-game spell as interim boss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are deeply frustrated that it has not been possible to reach agreement on this with Mr Abramovich so far,” the statement read.“While the door for negotiations will remain open, we are fully prepared to pursue this through the courts if required, to ensure people suffering in Ukraine can benefit from these proceeds as soon as possible.”The Guardian first reported in March thatthe government was considering this move, with the hope that resolving questions over the Chelsea money could be separated from a broader debate over how to free up Russian assets frozen by sanctions.Abramovichannounced his decision to sell Chelseafollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022. The billionaire oligarch, who had owned Chelsea for nearly 19 years, said he would put any proceeds from the sale into a charitable foundation “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”.A little more than a week after this declaration, however, Abramovich wassanctioned by the UK government, measures which remain in place. While the sale of Chelsea was allowed to go through, the proceeds could only be distributed when a licence was granted by the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation. That licence, in turn, depended on the creation of a foundation, which has yet to be set up with the Charity Commission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he wants to give his football career ‘one last push’Mon 2 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 14.33 EDTShareJordon Ibe was not supposed to go to the park that day. He reiterates the point several times when recalling the events of 17 June 2008. Ibe’s mum had forbidden his attendance at Tabard Gardens in Southwark, south-east London, but he went anyway; a kickabout was too much of a draw for the then 12‑year‑old. That day Ibe witnessed his friend David Idowu being stabbed through the heart. A few weeks later, Idowu died.“I’d not even seen a butter knife,” Ibe says. The cadence of his voice has slowed, his words so soft they are virtually inaudible. “To see that happen in front of me … my friend wasn’t about that life. He got stabbed because he had the wrong school uniform on. I saw it and ran out of the park, ran home. I remember seeing myself on the news on the CCTV.“You don’t really know what to do. It wasn’t like I was going to say anything to my mum because I wasn’t supposed to be there. She didn’t know I’d witnessed a death. I told her a few years later.“I don’t think I really processed it until I was a bit older. I’d not even been in a school fight, but I’d witnessed something like that. It’s something I’ll never forget, but I’ve never really spoken about it. Being so young, you’re not really going to be processing trauma like that.”Ibe was not intending to speak about the tragedy, nor does he raise it to stir sympathy. It comes up naturally during a broad and open conversation on mental health and anxiety, Ibe segueing to his childhood after describing being robbed at gunpoint at the age of 20.He had been tailed from a London hotel one morning and, as he reached Surrey Quays, his car was bumped. It was lunchtime, broad daylight. “I got out not noticing who was in the car,” he says. “They had balaclavas on. One put a machete to my chest and said: ‘If you move, I’ll stab you.’ Everything happened so fast but slow at the same time. My silly arse tried to get away and the passenger pulled a gun out.”The two incidents are touchstones in Ibe’s life. Their effects are impossible to measure, although he recalls hiding in bushes as a child to avoid running into the wrong people and hired security after the robbery. However, they have not detracted from his trust in humanity or his desire to be a good person.Take a little-known story about the winger’s time atBournemouth, for example. Ibe got chatting to a homeless man who had split with his wife and lost contact with his kids. Ibe took him home, stuffed several bags full of clothes, checked the guy into a hotel for a few weeks and bought him a mobile phone so he could contact his children.View image in fullscreenJordon Ibe in action for Bournemouth against Manchester City in March 2019.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersIt was also while on the south coast that Ibe’s mental health hit crisis point. Shortly before the pandemic, Ibe had bought a family home. But after splitting from his partner “it became a home for me”. He was still able to see his young daughter, but it was not the same as living together. Family is everything to Ibe, his little girl his world.“There were a lot of dark times. The house was too big. Being by myself was difficult,” he says solemnly.Many speak of being able to hide their inner demons, of putting on a brave face in public. Not Ibe. “People could see it in me. I was a bit in denial at first, but deep down I knew.”It reached a point that Ibe was having “thoughts that human beings shouldn’t be having – you want to live, not be on the other side. If it wasn’t for my path in life with God, especially my daughter, I don’t know what the future would have been.”Ibe will eternally be grateful for the intervention of Eddie Howe, his manager at the time. “He helped me during the hard times – letting me go to rehab, taking time off football, going to see a psychiatrist.”Howe is one of the good men according to Ibe, “a real family guy. Every time I message him, he replies within a day or two. And you know managers are busy.”Ibe recently returned to public consciousness via the Baller League. He is not a former footballer, but a current footballer, even if he has played only 11 minutes professionally – for Derby and Ebbsfleet – since his Bournemouth contract expired in June 2020.Still only 29, Ibe was a child prodigy. Aged 15 years and 244 days, he made his debut forWycombein the League Cup. A few months later, in October 2011, he scored on his first start. At school the following Monday his science teacher showed the highlights during class.“Everything came so quick,” Ibe says. “I was in year 10, playing League One. It was crazy.”It does not take long in Ibe’s company to conclude that he would have found that spotlight awkward. But the lights only brightened. Among several Premier League suitors wereLiverpool. He initially turned them down. “It wasn’t out of disrespect, but I’d never been out of London,” he says. “Going to the north felt very foreign to me. I wanted to be with my family. It wasn’t ‘no’ – it was: ‘Could we speak about this in a year’s time?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Premier League debut came under Brendan Rodgers in May 2013, with Ibe assisting Philippe Coutinho for the winner. Later that night he was back in London for a kickabout with his friends. “I love football and I told them I’d be down,” he says matter-of-factly.Loans at Birmingham and Derby followed, the latter spell coming under Steve McClaren, and Ibe did so well that he was recalled by Liverpool in January 2015. The mention of McClaren visibly lifts Ibe.“I felt like I was at Real Madrid at Derby,” he says, grinning. “I was gutted when I left – he’s the best I had. He gave me freedom to play. I was just happy with him. A lot of Derby fans have said if I’d stayed … well, I just loved it there.”That May Ibe signed a long-term Anfield deal and within weeks Raheem Sterling – a mentor for Ibe despite being exactly a year older – joined Manchester City. “I thought it was my time regardless,” Ibe says when asked if he felt that further opened the door. “I was determined to get on the pitch, whether he, or other players, were there or not. I knew I could rise to the standard.”Ibe was flying andafter Rodgers’s October sackinghe featured regularly under Jürgen Klopp. But the following summer, in a demonstration of just how quickly the football sands shift, everything flipped. “I was kind of pushed out the door,” Ibe says. His reluctance to reveal further details until his career is done is understandable. All Ibe is willing to say is that there was a “lot of politics” that he “didn’t really understand at the time”.View image in fullscreen‘Football is not the main accomplishment in my life.

I don’t regret Bournemouth but I’m very sensitive. I’ve always been that way. I didn’t think it was right. But life is not like that.”Ibe was Bournemouth’s record signing; a £15m starlet expected to make a huge impact. That is not how it transpired and come the last 18 months of his four-year contract he felt ostracised. An extension was on the table but his refusal to sign it – he wanted the control of being a free agent – meant he was, if not entirely excluded, pushed out.“They’d spent a lot of money at my age and needed to recoup something. It’s a business. I’m not disrespecting anyone, but I was killing it in training. It wasn’t making sense. But I knew the reason.”Last season, Ibe turned out for the non-league sides Hayes & Yeading and Hungerford. For him it was all about feeling part of something again, smelling the grass, being in the dressing room. As for what comes next, Ibe is clear but also coy. “Continue football; reach the levels I know I can hit; give it that one last push,” he says.“I wouldn’t say I regret what’s happened. It’s changed me for the better. Football is not the main accomplishment in my life. I have a deeper purpose; being a dad; being a great human being; being a brother; being a son. More meaningful stuff in life.”Ibe is in conversation with several clubs. “Hopefully everything goes my way,” he says. And with that he is off to spend time with his little girl.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

Similar trips are on the agenda for next year.PFA chief Molango voices concern over effects of post-season tours on playersRead moreTuchel is working with the FA’s medical and sports science departments on strategies to mitigate the effects of high temperatures and he is keen to give the players as much exposure to extreme conditions as possible. The German intends to pay particular attention to the physical condition of the players when ­attending gamesat the Club World Cup this month, while the FA will send operational staff to the tournament in the US to scout for World Cup training bases and hotels.Tuchel is understood to have expressed a preference for a pre‑World Cup training camp in Miami before England move to their tournament base. The location of the base will depend on the December draw.A long-haul trip for warm-weather training ­during the March international break may be unpopular with club managers concerned about potential burnout before the Premier League and Champions League run-in, but that will not concern Tuchel.After his first game in chargeagainst Albania in March, he warned top-flight managers that he intended to pick his strongest side whenever possible. The 51-year-old also questioned Mikel Arteta’s decision to select Declan Rice for the second leg of Arsenal’s Champions League last-16 tie against PSV Eindhoven the previous week, given they had won the first leg 7-1.Tuchel will have the freedom to take his side away next season ifEnglandwin their World Cup qualifying group to avoid the playoffs. The FA would normally stage two ­lucrative matches at Wembley before a ­summer tournament but will support plans to go away if he concludes it is the best preparation for the World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Enzo Maresca’s system relies on quality wide players. Sancho had an opportunity to press his case after joining Chelsea on loan with an obligation to buy for £25m last summer. The 25‑year‑old’s talent has flickered at times and he scored whenMaresca’s side beat Real Betisin the Uefa Conference League final last week.Yet Sancho, who struggled after joining Manchester United from Dortmund in 2021, was unable to hold down a regular starting place last season and it is understood that Chelsea have misgivings over buying him. They can pay a £5m exit fee to terminate the agreement with United and sources have said that the London club are edging towards that option. Chelsea think Sancho is talented and have been impressed with his attitude but fear he is not consistent enough. There remains a possibility that ­Chelsea could decide to sign Sancho if he agrees to a lower salary in line with the club’s wage policy.Returning to United would leave Sancho, who has lost his place in the England squad, in an awkward position. The attacker cut an unhappy ­figure after moving to Old Trafford four years ago and joined Dortmund on loan afterclashing with Erik ten Hagin August 2023. Sancho had joined Chelsea by the time United fired Ten Hag and hired Ruben Amorim last November. It remains to be seen if Amorim would want to look at Sancho in pre-season. United are looking to refresh their squad and sell unwanted players after missing out on European qualification.Gittens, who joined Dortmund from ­Manchester City’s academy, plays in Sancho’s position and is expected to cost £50m this summer. He scored 12 goals in 48 games in all competitions last season. Chelsea, who arepoised to sign the Ipswich striker Liam Delapfor £30m, have also tracked Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams, who is likely to prove too expensive, and were interested in United’s Alejandro Garnacho in January. There were concerns at the time over Garnacho’s attitude. They have been linked with RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons.View image in fullscreenChelsea are weighing up whether or not to permanently sign Jadon Sancho from Manchester United after an inconsistent loan spell by the winger.Photograph: Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Uefa/Getty ImagesIt is set to be another busy summer at Stamford Bridge, with Maresca also hoping to sign a new centre-back after leading his side into the Champions League and winning the Uefa Conference League. It remains to be seen if the arrival of Delap will be followed by Maresca targeting another striker. Chelsea like ­Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike but see him as too expensive at £84m. There is long‑term interest in RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, who is wanted by Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson’s future will be up in the air if two strikers arrive. Chelsea confirmed the signing of midfielder Dário Essugo from ­Sporting on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Lyon midfielder Rayan Cherki is another target.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreGuardiola has been keen to strengthen at left-back after ­playing the centre-back Josko Gvardiol and the midfielder Nico O’Reilly – neither of whom are orthodox full-backs – there for most of last season. City are among the clubs to have tracked the Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez, who is expected to join ­Liverpool. The Premier League champions want to add a left-back to compete with Andy Robertson.Aït-Nouri has impressed in four seasons at Wolves, for whom he initially signed on loan from the Ligue 1 club Angers in October 2020. Wolves are thought to value the 23-year-old at about £50m. He has 12 months remaining on his contract, though the club hold an option to extend his deal for a further year.Wolves,who have already sold Matheus Cunha to Manchester Unitedin a £62.5m deal this transfer window, have not given up hope of retaining their captain, Nélson Semedo, who is out of contract this summer. He is yet to respond to the offer of a new four-year contract.Meanwhile, City midfielder Mateo Kovacic will miss the Club World Cup after having surgery to repair an achilles tendon injury. The Croatian sat out last month’s 1-0 FA Cup final loss to Crystal Palace with the issue.Wolves’ head coach, Vitor Pereira, wanted to keep the Portugal full-back. In April, the Wolves head coach, Vítor Pereira, said of the Portugal full‑back: “He knows I want him to stay. He’s very important with the group. But it’s his life, his family life and if he decides to move we need to find another one, another good man.”Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowWolverhampton WanderersManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

Manchester United’s controversy-ridden trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong is the latest example in a trend some fear is damaging athletes’ health.Our Champions League team of the season: a teen sensation to a marauding GunnerRead more“We’re all mindful and understand some of the financial dynamics the club goes through, but the reality is that quite a few players have expressed concern,” Molango said. “We have expressed concern about these post-season tours.”United’s tour descended into farce when they were booed by the crowd afterlosing to an Asean All Stars side in Kuala Lumpur. The forward Amad Diallo drew icriticism for raising his middle finger to fans outside the team hotel after that embarrassment,explaining later that he was responding to insults aimed at his mother. United expect to generate around £10m from the excursion.Molango also questioned pre-season tours that pit traditional rivals against one another when players are still building fitness.Arsenaland Tottenham will meet in Hong Kong next month, the first north London derby to take place outside the UK. “You cannot just turn up at the derby with flip-flops,” he said. “Sometimes there’s this misunderstanding that, yes, [pre-season] is about resting but then having a proper ability to build up to that level of intensity and that level of game.”No solution to the discussion about fthe bloated schedule is in sight, although progress is being made with a formal complaint tabled by European Leagues, La Liga and the global players’ union, Fifpro, last October against Fifa’s imposition of the match calendar. While Fifa is understood to have begun engaging with the complainants, who have accused world football’s governing body of“abusive and anti-competitive” actsin imposing events like the expanded Club World Cup that starts on 15 June, there is scant prospect of a quick agreement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he could only watch on helplessly as his opponent threaded four outlandish winners to break his serve to love.It was that kind of evening for Draper, the fifth seed in Paris, who was thoroughly outplayed by a stupendous performance from the unseeded Alexander Bublik. The Kazakhstani held his nerve in front of an ­ebullient Court Suzanne Lenglen crowd to close out an immense 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win and reach a grand slam quarter-final for the first time in his career.Djokovic brushes Norrie aside to reach record 19th quarter-final in ParisRead moreInstead of a tough, attritional battle with Alex de Minaur, the ­highest‑ranked seed in his section, Draper found himself against the enigmatic 27-year-old, who dramatically toppled De Minaur from two sets down in the second round. Bublik has been as high as No 17 in the rankings – he is now No 62 – and on a good day he is an incredibly dangerous and unpredictable player. This was a miraculous day.He said: “I have a certain skill set to play tennis, and it worked marvellously today – 100% one of the best days of my life and one of the best matches I have ever played in my life. That was as simple as that.”From the beginning, Bublik showed just how good he can be as he rolled through his early service games with a mixture of pinpoint serving, destructive shot­making off both wings and, most strikingly, a relentless stream ofperfectly weighted drop shots.The first set, however, progressed just how many thought it would. ­Bublik is as well known for his ­unstable temperament and ­wavering focus as he is for his undeniable ­talent. In the tight moments, Draper’s superior return of serve, movement and point-by-point focus earned him the first set.The start of the second set was ­similarly unsurprising. Still reeling from the abrupt end to the first set, Bublik handed over a service game with a series of ill-advised drop shots. Just as it seemed like Draper had the match under control, however, it all fell apart.Bublik immediately forced himself back into the match with a spectacular exhibition of varied attacking tennis. He served brilliantly, keeping Draper out of his service games, pounding his excellent two-handed backhand and he continued to suffocate the left-hander with sickly sweet drop shots from all parts of the court.View image in fullscreenAlexander Bublik falls to the floor as the emotion engulfs him after beating Jack Draper.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesAgainst an opponent who seemed to be able to do anything he wanted with the ball, Draper just could not keep up. As his first serve crumbled, he lost confidence in his forehand and retreated into his shell.Bublik has shown throughout his career that he can play quality tennis, but sustaining such an ­incredible level across the best of five sets against one of the leading players in the world is another question altogether. Somehow, he just kept on going. “I don’t play many matches where I feel like it’s almost out of my control what’s going on, and he made that happen today,” Draper said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They make you feel extremely uncomfortable, and they make you feel like you can’t do much. He did that today.”Bublik finished the match with 37 drop‑shot attempts, hitting 12 clean winners behind them alone. He also struck 68 winners compared to 37 from Draper. “He missed hardly any [drop shots],” Draper said. “They were all incredibly good. It’s tough, because you know that’s coming, but yet he can unload on the forehand as well. You just don’t know what to do.”Considering the momentum Draper had built and positivity surrounding him in Paris, this will be an incredibly tough defeat for him to digest. He sees himself competing for these titles, not merely reaching the second week. However, after starting this season simply seeking his first breakthrough on red clay, he ended this period having won numerous matches, beaten quality players and established himself as a true threat. This loss will simply form another part of his development.“I’m hurt, and for sure I’m really disappointed,” the 23-year-old said. “I had an opportunity today, and I missed my opportunity, for sure. I struggle to put things in perspective, but I think I am proud of the effort I’ve done on the clay. I think I’ve really improved. I think last year I was leaving here, first-round loss, being 40 in the world and very disappointed with my tennis and not sure, you know, where I was going with it. This year I’m ­leaving No 5 in the world.”Bublik’s next opponent is none other than Jannik Sinner, the Italian world No 1, who continued his bid for a fourth grand slam title with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 victory against the Russian 17th seed Andrey Rublev.Explore more on these topicsFrench OpenJack DraperFrench Open 2025TennisnewsShareReuse this content"

From my side, a very solid performance.”Although Djokovic had won all five of their previous matches, Norrie put up solid resistance in their Geneva Open semi-final 10 days earlier. If there is any time for opponents to step on the court fully believing they can beat him, this is it. Djokovic continues to fight against the unavoidable struggles that come with age.After his dire start to the clay-court season, Djokovic’s decision to compete in Geneva proved to be a smart move. He had been untroubled here, rolling into the second week without dropping a set, but it had also been difficult to assess his level. His highest ranked opponent had been the world No 73, Corentin Moutet.Before the match, Norrie said he would have to be out on court for more than four hours if he had any chance of winning. He unsurprisingly tried to test Djokovic with his own durability and shot tolerance, dragging the Serb into countless long, attritional exchanges.Over the past 18 months, Djokovic’s waning patience and fitness, two pillars of his game, are areas opponents have been able to exploit. But here he was disciplined. He peppered Norrie with drop shots, punishing his deep court positioning; he struck his forehand increasingly well as the match endured and he served well enough in the decisive moments. It was a positive, controlled performance against an opponent whose game simply lacks sufficient firepower to make Djokovic uncomfortable when he is dialled in.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie can take some confidence from his run in Paris.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesAfterachieving his best result in Paris, Norrie leaves Roland Garros having achieved the breakthrough he has been seeking for so long. The past 18 months have been extremely difficult for him as he fell from his comfortable position inside the top 20 to outside the top 90. The Briton handled himself extremely well in Paris, following up his stellar five-set upset win against Daniil Medvedev with two quality victories. He will head to the grass-court season on home soil fully confident in his ability to maintain the momentum he has built.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Really, the way for me to take confidence is playing matches and then actually getting through some tough matches. I won a lot of tie-breaks recently, so I can take so much confidence from this and momentum. I think that’s the biggest thing. It’s been really tricky to gain momentum.”After the match, Djokovic also reflected on his eventful Saturday night after his third‑round victory against Filip Misolic as he tried to return to the hotel while fans continued to celebrate PSG’s Champions League victory in the streets. Roland Garros is just 600 metres from the Parc des Princes and fans congregated on streets directly outside the tournament’s grounds, letting off fireworks all night. In the morning, numerous cars close to the tournament were burned out.“People were quite tense here, I must say, for our return to the hotel,” Djokovic said. “They were not suggesting us at one point to go back at all, to maybe find a place to sleep somewhere around here for a night, because at that point it was already past midnight and some gas bombs and cars under fire and stuff happening on the street that was really dangerous. Everything around our hotel, which is close to Arc de Triomphe. So in the end we talked. We waited for a bit, and then we decided to go.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenNovak DjokovicTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Based in Cardiff, where bums on seats can be a challenge, and lacking Welsh representation on the field, they have been the butt of a few jokes during the tournament’s short history.But for Sanjay Govil, an IT entrepreneur and the owner of Washington Freedom in Major LeagueCricket(MLC), the appeal of “one team, one country” was too great, likewise the “chemistry” during talks with the top brass at Glamorgan. Though he was on a plane when the auction took place, he secured a 49% stake in Welsh Fire, later raised to 50%, that valued the team at £84.6m, more than Trent Rockets or Birmingham Phoenix.County cricket: Lancashire, Sussex and Somerset lead way in T20 BlastRead moreAs Govil outlines his vision for Welsh Fire the most eyebrow-raising remark arguably comes when discussing the future of the Hundred at large and whether, like a number of observers, he believes the 100-ball format is simply one too many for an overstuffed sport.“I absolutely see it the same way,” he says. “The Hundred should at some point follow the T20 format because you already have one-day cricket, you have T20, you have Test cricket, right? And just having one more variation, which is off from any other strategy … from a longer-term perspective it would just be better as a T20. But that is something for the future. And [the counties] already have a T20 tournament.”Govil is reluctant to call himself an owner just yet, with the new model not kicking in until 2026 and investors still to sign the contracts with the England and Wales Cricket Board. The delay, he says, comes down to the number of lawyers involved, even if the sticking points reportedly centre onbroadcast money, sponsorship and representation on the Hundred’s governing body.This impasse is expected to be resolved soon, after which Govil, a tech magnate who made his fortune founding Infinite Computer Solutions in the US will formally become a major player in English cricket. Born in Canada and raised in India, Govil says that alongside a love of Test cricket –plus India’s era-defining World Cup win in 1983– he grew up following county cricket scores in the newspapers. “Being associated with the Hundred is a dream come true,” he says.This investment in Welsh Fire is a passion project, it appears, but Govil stresses that passion has always underpinned his work. As for the lack of Welsh players in the two squads – and the fact that the last England men’s player produced by Glamorgan was Simon Jones more than 20 years ago – he says he has “not given it much thought” due to his focus on getting the deal done. More broadly, he prefers to leave the cricket to the coaching staff and take a “back seat”.That said, as the owner of Washington Freedom, a team coached by Ricky Ponting and featuring Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell during last year’s title win, the vision for the men’s team is clear. In time Govil wants to marry up the two “WF” franchises – the initials are a happy coincidence, he says – and secure players to feature in tournaments that currently run back-to-back.View image in fullscreenWelsh Fire’s women’s team before their match against Birmingham Phoenix at Sophia Gardens last August.Photograph: Harry Trump/ECB/Getty Images“Smith is playing for Welsh Fire this summer, so that is the first player from Washington Freedom,” says Govil. “We have tremendous talent in our [Washington] team and they have expressed great interest in playing in the Hundred. With MLC and the Hundred so close to each other, we have an opportunity to sign up players for multi-league. It is important to build local talent also but these things don’t change overnight.”The notion of tournament-hopping players flags the broader direction of travel for the sport and as a self-professed Test cricket lover one would assume Govil to have concerns. There are only 12 months in a year and the squeeze created by the franchise world’s tractor beam means something will have to give. “Cricket might go the way of football in Europe, where they play for the clubs but then play for the country when required,” he says. “There is still going to be Test cricket, but maybe – again, I’m just thinking through it – it is played just three months a year in two blocks of six weeks. Then X amount of time for the IPL, MLC, the Hundred etc. And not all players overlap. But I see the calendars evolving.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs well as the broader plan, what comes across is just how collegiate the Hundred team owners are despite four coming from established Indian Premier League teams and four relative newcomers. They are rivals, clearly, but Govil says they are also “a family” who happily offered him guidance when first setting up his MLC team. It makes sense. A rising tide lifts all boats.It will be interesting to discover whether Govil’s view on the 100-ball format is shared by others; whether they have simply bought stakes in English cricket and plan to shape what this means at a later date. Another question is whether TV rights for the Hundred will be sold separately in future. The current deal has the English summer bundled up as one product and means Test cricket – still the No 1 format in the UK – could even be subsidising the thing that threatens to strangle it.“You will only know if they are split up, right?” says Govil. “I am a very firm believer in the market determining your price. And so I believe the TV contract should be separate. Or we’re guessing. Maybe it is correct that Test cricket is subsidising the Hundred. But maybe it is the other way around. The TV money [from Sky] went up when the Hundred came in, no? But I like objectivity. Everything should be simple.”A laudable sentiment – although when it comes to the Hundred, a tournament that has split opinions and looks likely to change, simplicity has been a rarity.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

PSG’s path to glory saw him outshine Ederson, Alisson, and Emi Martínez before besting Yann Sommer in the final. Donnarumma made a series of saves only he can make, throwing that huge, rangy frame to its full expanse while playing behind a backline built to attack rather than concentrate on defence.DefendersAchraf Hakimi(PSG)If this is the age of full-back being the most multipurpose player in football, then Hakimi is best in class. The Moroccan matched defensive rigour with attacking instincts that saw him score four goals and supply five assists in PSG’s run, including the opening strike of the final. His signing in 2021 was probably the first building block of the team that reigned supreme in 2025.Luis Enrique secures status as one of the all-time greats with PSG triumph | David HytnerRead moreWillian Pacho(PSG)Marquinhos is the long-serving veteran of the champions, but his partner, Pacho, signed from Eintracht Frankfurt last year for €45m, has completed the Parisians’ backline. He became the first Ecuadorian to lift the trophy after his dominant display in Munich blunted Inter’s Lautaro Martínez and Marcus Thuram. Playing all 17 matches and logging more minutes than any other player with 1,542, Pacho also won the ball back far more than any player: 124 times.Alessandro Bastoni(Inter)Munich was a living nightmare for Inter defenders. They also conceded six across the two legs in their semi-final classic with Barcelona. But to focus on those matches is to forget the supremacy the Inter defence enjoyed in the extended group stage, where they conceded just a single goal in eight matches. Until the semis and final, Bastoni, an Italian defender of the classic style, had marshalled a three-man defence performing far better in Europe than in Serie A, but still ended a campaign of which he can be proud in tears.Nuno Mendes(PSG)Mirroring Hakimi’s command of his flank in attack and defense, Mendes was tasked in the final with stopping the runs of Inter’s Denzel Dumfries, one of the competition’s most effective players this season. The Dutchman ended up chasing Mendes’s shadow. That followed a season where the Portuguese player, just 22 years old, scored fourChampions Leaguegoals and ravaged opponents, both attackers and defenders, with his athleticism. Mohamed Salah has rarely been kept so quiet.View image in fullscreenAlessandro Bastoni anchored an elite Internazionale backline.Photograph: Alexandra Beier/AFP/Getty ImagesMidfieldersJoão Neves(PSG)PSG’s title-winning team did not come cheap but they have invested well, with a summer deal worth €70m landing Neves, one of the most wanted young midfielders in Europe. Small but combative, Neves now stars in the best midfield in Europe in combination with Vitinha and Fabián Ruiz. He had been a slow burn through his first season. When PSG were playing to stay alive in the group stage, Neves was the match-winner against Manchester City, Seven tackles, all successful, seven shots, including a goal, he began to embody a team fighting like wild dogs to win the ball back.Viva Vitinha: how PSG’s deep conductor proved Lionel Messi wrong | Barney RonayRead moreDeclan Rice(Arsenal)English clubs had a chastening Champions League season, mostly because of PSG, and Arsenal were the semi-final victims. Despite Mikel Arteta’s protestations, the Gunners were well beaten but this was the club’s best run in the competition in more than a decade. At the fulcrum was Rice, who is maturing into a midfielder who can run a game, as he did most obviously against Real Madrid – a two-legged performance Gunners fans will happily fall back on as something to cherish after their team’s exit. Rice usually saved his marauding best for Europe.Pedri (Barcelona)If the modern PSG are a hyper-realised, updated version of Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona team, the club he long left behind proved to be this season’s entertainers. Hansi Flick is football’s great gambler, his team a high-line, high wire act. In the middle of the morass is Pedri, a midfielder of balance, creativity and now experience. Thankfully, he is recovered from the injury problems that his 75-game 2020 caused and fills the mould Andrés Iniesta once did, never looking like losing the ball, forever dangerous to the opposition.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal was incandescent in the Champions League semi-final v Internazionale.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockForwardsOusmane Dembélé(PSG)A mark of Luis Enrique’s quality as a coach is that he made a productive, consistent player out of one of the game’s great enigmas. PSG played mostly without a centre-forward but it was Dembélé who led the line, cutting in from flanks, operating as a false No 9, interchanging with his fellow wingers, his movement creating space and angles to work with.PSG 2.0 have potential to dominate but young stars could be lured away | Nick AmesRead moreKhvicha Kvaratskhelia(PSG)There may be little coincidence that once the Georgian was bought from Naples in January, PSG’s status as a giant struggling to make the knockout stages was shedded as they instead became the most decisive champions in European Cup history. The best attacking player in Serie A, a maverick talent that resemblesboth a throwback and the futureproved a revelation in destroying defences. The English teams in particular struggled with him, and when he was going though on goal in Munich, he was able to show off his party-trick finish, at the near post.Lamine Yamal(Barcelona)The best team did not have the best player, and that’s how it’s supposed to work. When Barcelona were torching opposition defences, winning games from impossible positions, it seemed as if Lamine Yamal would win the Champions League at 17. He will just have to do it at 18. European defences had no answer to his speed and quality of finishing. Those slaloming runs and thunderbolt finishes against Benfica and Inter could be seen as preludes to greatness if he were notalreadygreat.SubstitutesEmi Martínezcame up big in Aston Villa’s hugely enjoyable run to the last eight.Denzel Dumfrieshad five goal involvements in the Inter v Barcelona semi-final.RaphinhaandSerhou Guirassywere joint-top for goals, with the Brazilian outstanding for Barcelona, the Guinean a ray of light for a faded Dortmund team.Désiré Doué, scoring two goals in the final, completed PSG’s thrilling attacking trio.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the current MLS collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournament, capped at $1m for the entire team.In effect, that makes for an initial 90/10 split of prize money, with the ratio potentially getting worse if MLS teams advance in the competition.The MLSPA said in its statement that the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes to the arrangement, but that the league has “failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.”Fifa itself does not have any rules governing how teams distribute prize money between front office, players, and associated parties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that the device’s design would be driven by “a sense of ‘we deserve better. Humanity deserves better’.”However, Ive, Apple’s former chief design officer, said he felt the burden of the negative impact of modern technology products. “While some of the less positive consequences were unintentional, I still feel responsibility. And the manifestation of that is a determination to try and be useful.”He added: “If you make something new, if you innovate, there will be consequences unforeseen, and some will be wonderful and some will be harmful.”Last month, Ivesold his hardware startup, io, to OpenAI in a $6.4bn (£4.7bn) deal and will be taking on creative and design leadership across the merged businesses.In avideo announcing the deal, the OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, described a prototype developed by Ive as “the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen”.The Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo hasclaimed the device will be screenless, can be worn around the neck and will be as “compact and elegant as an iPod Shuffle”. Mass production is expected to start in 2027.The Wall Street Journal reported the device would be fully aware of a user’s surroundings and life. It described the product as a user’s third core device after a MacBook Pro andiPhone.Ive, who joined Apple in 1992, said theOpenAIpartnership had made him optimistic again about technology’s capabilities, something he felt Silicon Valley had lost.“When I first moved here I came because it was characterised by people who genuinely saw that their purpose was in service to humanity, to inspire people and help people create. I don’t feel that way about this place right now,” he said.Ive was interviewed alongside Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who also acknowledged “dark uses for certain types of technology”.She added: “You can only look at the studies being done on teenage girls and on anxiety in young people, and the rise of mental health needs, to understand that we’ve gone sideways. Certainly, technology wasn’t designed to have that result. But that is the sideways result.”Powell Jobs – whose company, Emerson Collective, is an investor in Ive’s LoveFrom business – declined to comment on whether the new OpenAI device would compete with Apple products.“I’m still very close to the leadership team in Apple,” she said. “They’re really good people and I want them to succeed also.”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTOpenAIAppleiPhoneTelecomsSmartphonesComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

While we think there will ultimately be more automation in marketing, the role that agencies play is going to become ever more important through their ability to plan, execute and measure across platforms.”However, Schultz added that AI tools would help “level the playing field” for small and medium-sized businesses that do not have the time or financial scale to use agencies.“Millions of small businesses rely upon our platform to grow,” he said. “For these businesses who aren’t able to work with an agency, or don’t have time during their busy days to think about their creative or targeting, that’s where AI can help level the playing field.”Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookArtificial intelligence (AI)InstagramTechnology sectorSocial networkingAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

In the TV show,Greg Daviesplays Wicky, the acerbic employee of a government-endorsed clean-up company, while Crime Scene Cleaner’s lead character Kovalsky is a lowly janitor, mopping up blood and disposing of trash to cover up for a mob boss named Big Jim.The crime scenes in both are laughably over the top. Or are they? I’ve never actually seen a real-life murder scene, so perhaps copious blood sprayed over walls and ceilings and the masses of broken furniture is completely normal.View image in fullscreenTake the edge off … Greg Davies as Wicky in the BBC’s The Cleaner.Photograph: Tom Jackson/PAStepping into Kovalsky’s plastic overshoes, the aim is to leave each location exactly as it was prior to the … um … incident. Unlike Wicky, who has to constantly deal with annoying homeowners and neighbours, Kovalsky has no living humans for company; just the dead ones that he hauls over his shoulder before slinging them unceremoniously into the back of his pickup truck. Each scene plays out in silence, save for the occasional brief chat with Big Jim and Kovalsky’s own pithy self-talk. Both Kovalsky and Wicky are world-weary labourers, doing what is necessary to get through each blood-splattered scene. But there are differences between the two men: Kovalsky swipes cash and valuables to boost his bank balance (he’s saving up to pay his daughter’s medical bills) while Wicky just wants to get finished in time for curry night at the pub.Crime Scene Cleaner is a weird concept for a game, the unnatural offspring of PowerWash Simulator and Hitman. But despite the macabre premise, I’ve come to appreciate the quiet, contemplative and satisfying process of cleaning up, as Kovalsky stuffs fragments of glass, pizza slices and broken crockery into his bin bag before hurling it into his truck and getting started on all the blood spatter with a microfibre mop, pushing sofas and tables back and returning ornaments to their rightful spot on the shelves afterwards. It’s immensely satisfying, despite the game’s realistic yet tiresome insistence on continually wringing out your mops and sponges.View image in fullscreenNo living humans for company … Crime Scene Cleaner video game.Photograph: President StudioExploring increasingly bizarre locations is also a common theme between the two: Crime Scene Cleaner has a pizzeria, a museum and a spooky smart house; The Cleaner takes in an ice-cream parlour, theatre and stately home. I love that the game gives me a chance to become a more sedate version of The Cleaner’s Wicky without the interference of coppers, maniacal novelists or even the killer themselves (as brilliantly portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter in the show). With his daughter ensconced in a medical clinic, Kovalsky’s only (living) companion is his playful German shepherd. Its name? Dexter. Of course.At the end of each clean-up, I find myself standing back and admiring the scene, content with a job well done. Crime Scene Cleaner and The Cleaner both tap into the very essence of black comedy, where horror becomes amusingly banall. In both, the crimes have already happened, the worst has been done and all that remains is… the remains.Explore more on these topicsGamesTV comedyGreg DaviesComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The race was a showdown between two candidates who represent the country’s stark political and ideological divide: Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the far-right opposition party, Law and Justice (PiS), and Rafał Trzaskowski, the liberal and strongly pro-European mayor of Warsaw representing the Civic Platform (PO) party of the prime minister,Donald Tusk. The razor-thin victory for Nawrocki, who secured just over 50% of the vote, is a domestic setback for Tusk, but it also threatens wide and gloomy repercussions within the EU and beyond.Tusk’sreturn to poweras prime minister in 2023, after previously serving from 2007 to 2014, was widely seen as a bid to re-anchor Poland within the European project. His government promised reforms, especially in restoring the rule of law, after years of confrontational policies under PiS aimed at undermining theindependence of the judiciary and the constitutional court. Those ambitions now face a significant institutional roadblock. While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, the president has significant powers: they can veto legislation and influence domestic, foreign and defence policy. The outgoing president, Andrzej Duda, who is also aligned with PiS, used his veto toblock Tusk’s reform efforts. With Nawrocki now set to occupy the presidential palace, such obstruction is expected to intensify rather than ease.The implications of this election are potentially immense. Political deadlock between a pro-European government and a Eurosceptic president could stall Poland’s reform agenda and weaken the country’s standing within the EU. It also risks undermining the unity of the European response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Poland has played a leading role here, providing humanitarian and military aid and acting as a key diplomatic force on the EU’s eastern flank. Nawrocki, though, could inject a new unreliability into that equation, as became clear during the campaign when he repeatedlypitted Poles against Ukrainian refugees. His victory could place additional strain on Europe’s cohesion at a time when the US has already rolled back military, humanitarian and diplomatic aid to Kyiv.The comeback for PiS that this outcome represents also reflects a broader global trend of political polarisation. While far-right parties have recently lost ground in countries such as Canada, Australia and Romania, where the pro-European Nicușor Dan convincingly defeated the far-right presidential challenger, George Simion, Poland is shifting towards the conservative and nationalist camp. The Polish election signals a reconsolidation of the far right.Nawrocki’s win is a morale boost for the international movement surrounding Donald Trump. After a string of defeats for Trump-aligned candidates, Poland’s result gives renewed momentum to the global wing of the “make America great again” agenda. At CPAC Hungary, a gathering of conservative and far-right politicians held days before the Polish vote, the US secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, urged Polish votersto choose“the right leader” and attacked Trzaskowski as “a train wreck”. This kind of overt election interference is increasingly common in the Trump era and illustrates how closely Europe’s far right is now tied to Trumpism.This also reveals a paradox: while Trump undermines the credibility of multilateral institutions such as Nato through his inflammatory rhetoric, he is able to mobilise a different kind of internationalism – one for leaders across Europe who emphasise national sovereignty and identity. His implicit message, that Europe is on its own and can’t rely on the US to defend it, serves not only as a warning but reinforces nationalist instincts.Earlier this year, Trump again declared that Nato countries “don’t pay enough” and that theycould no longer count on US support, a comment that sparked near-panic in European capitals. For centrist leaders, it reinforced calls for stronger European defence cooperation. But on the political fringes, it was seen as confirmation that nations must rely on themselves. The defeat of Tusk’s favoured candidate in Poland symbolises a larger battle over the political narrative. Trzaskowski’s pro-European message, rooted in cooperation, shared values and the rule of law, failed to convince enough voters that it could protect Poland from geopolitical threats. Nawrocki’s message of national control and sovereignty resonated more.The long-term threat from revanchist Russia, combined with Trump’s unpredictable leadership, has shaken Europe’s decades-long strategic reliance on US military protection. The continent now faces the urgent task of rethinking its own security architecture. Ironically, Trump’s unpredictability is what may accelerate this process. But it requires political will, not only in Brussels but in the capitals of EU member states. As long as parties such as PiS maintain a grip on national institutions, Europe’s strategic shift remains fragile.Poland’s election outcome therefore serves as a warning to pro-European politicians. Without a compelling narrative on security, social protection and national identity, pro-European parties will struggle to retain voter support. The future of Europe will not be decided in Brussels alone; it hinges just as much on the electoral choices made in Warsaw, Bucharest and other capitals. The real impact of Trump in Europe, whether as a force that strengthens or weakens the European project, will ultimately be determined not in Washington but in the voting booths of Europe itself.Catherine De Vries is Generali chair in European policies and a professor at Bocconi University in MilanExplore more on these topicsPolandOpinionEuropeDonald TuskThe far rightDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

So are America’s public libraries, arts organizations and museums.But that hasn’t stopped theTrump administrationfrom threatening or harming them.These institutions are under siege. They are hurt by deep funding cuts, the loss or bullying of public employees and, in some cases, by threats of extinction.Why would any politician – especially one as hungry for adulation asDonald Trump– go after such cherished parts of America?It seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.Trump is laying the groundwork to privatize America’s national parks | Jonathan B Jarvis and Gary MachlisRead moreTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism,in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.That’s what Trump and company are counting on.It’s also part of the effort to divide Americans into two tribes – the elites and the regular folks, the blue and the red, the drivers of dorky hybrid sedans and the drivers of oversized pickup trucks.The arts and nature, by contrast, serve to unite us. When you’re admiring a redwood or gazing at the Grand Canyon, you’re neither Republican nor Democrat. The same goes for listening to a beautiful piece of new music or choosing library books to read with your children.But division and grievance serve Trump better. And so, we have the attacks on marginalized people, on university research, and the performing arts, often in the guise of eliminating waste or discriminatory hiring practices.“The Trump administration has launched a comprehensive attack on knowledge itself, a war against culture, history and science,” Adam Serwer wrote in the Atlantic recently in amuch-discussed piecedescribing “the attack on knowledge”, putting in broad context Trump’s defunding of universities and attempts to discourage international scholarship.What’s really going on is a long-term power grab.In crippling learning, beauty and culture Trump and his helpers “seek to make the country more amenable to their political domination”.When it comes to the parks, as the Guardian’s Annette McGivneyreportedrecently, the harm is well under way.Thousands of staffing cuts mean that many parks lack adequate supervision, that campgrounds are closed and that the care of precious natural resources is neglected.Again, it’s by design, as the former national parks director Jonathan Jarvis told McGivney.“There are ideologues who want to dismantle the federal government,” Jarvis said. “And the last thing they need is a highly popular federal agency that undermines their argument about how the government is dysfunctional.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These organizations provide crucial support for public libraries and museums, grants to artists and writers, and much more.They make us better as a people. They uplift us. Like the parks, they can bring beauty into our lives. And as the poet John Keats wrote, beauty and truth are inseparable.But truth is only trouble for the would-be autocrat.And truth itself is under attack, as Trump – a prolific liar – tries to control the message to the public by controlling the reality-based press. That’s how successful propaganda works.Toward that end, his administration is trying to defund public media,including NPR and PBS, and – partly through lawsuits against media organizations including CBS News and ABC News – to intimidate journalists and their corporate bosses.A more ignorant, less enlightened, more divided electorate is far easier to manipulate. And the power grab, after all, is the larger aim.Once that power is fully secured, there is no one left to challenge the endless grift and self-dealing that is a hallmark of this administration – the sale of meme coins, the pay-to-play pardons of criminals and the cultivation of rich guys and their fat wallets.The diminishment of truth and beauty is part of a long game, but one that doesn’t have to prevail.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsNational parksOpinionDonald TrumpMuseumsLibrariesTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The erstwhile“First Buddy”and born-again fiscal hawk Elon Muskrecently saidhe was “disappointed” by Donald Trump’s spendthrift budget currently under debate in the US Senate.Squeaking throughthe House of Representatives thanks tothe capitulationof several Republican deficit hardliners, this“big, beautiful bill”certainly increases the federal debtbigly– bynearly $4tnover the next decade.Equally disappointed are those who have been busy burnishing Trump’s populist veneer. Steve Bannon hadrepeatedly promisedhigher taxes for millionaires, buthe has confessedhe’s “very upset”. That’s because the bill wouldcut taxes by over $600bnfor the top 1% of wage-earners, also known as millionaires. It amounts tothe largest upward transfer of wealthin American history.Yet this double betrayal will do nothing to impede the sundry Maga apparatchiks’ breathless support for their dear leader. Musk hasalready tweetedhis gratitude to the president for the opportunity to lead Doge (that is,slash fundingfor cancer research). So this bill has once again proven Republicans’ willingness to relinquish their convictions as long as they can keep their grasp on power. And for Trump, it has reaffirmed that hispledged golden ageis really just a windfall for the uber-wealthy like him. Now there can be no mistaking that Republicans’ governing philosophy is neither conservatism nor populism but unabashed hypocrisy.A hidden measure in the Republican budget bill would crown Trump king | Robert ReichRead moreExpecting the self-proclaimedKing of Debtto balance the budget – or hoping workers would be protected by the billionaire whose personal motto is“You’re fired”– was always imaginative thinking at best. In his first term, Trumpadded $8tnto the national deficit. Even excluding Covid relief spending, that’stwice as much debtas Joe Biden racked up during his four years in the White House. Almost $2tn of that tab came from Trump’s vaunted tax cut, which deliveredthree times more wealthto the top 5% of wage earners than it did to the bottom 60%. Nor did its benefits trickle down, with incomes remaining flat for workers who earn less than $114,000.Trump’s disingenuousness on the deficit continues a hallowed Republican tradition. All four Republican presidents since 1980have increasedthe federal debt. By combining reckless militarism with rampant corporatism, George W Bush managed toballoon it by 1,204%. When Bush’s treasury secretary Paul O’Neill expressed concern about that spending, Dick Cheney, the then-vice president, reportedlyretorted: “Deficits don’t matter.”Except, of course, when a Democrat occupies the Oval Office. During his campaign for the US Senate in 2022, JD VancederidedBiden’s signature $1tn infrastructure package as a “huge mistake” that would waste money on “really crazy stuff”. Like improving almost200,000 miles of roadsand repairing over 11,000 bridges across the country.Now there can be no mistaking that Republicans’ governing philosophy is neither conservatism nor populism but unabashed hypocrisyApparently less crazy, but certainly more callous, are the vertiginous cuts to the social safety net proposed in Trump’s current budget bill. Its$1tn eviscerationof Medicaid and Snap would leave 8 million Americans uninsured and potentially end food assistance for 11 million people, including 4 million children. When the Democratic Representative Ro Khannaintroduced an amendmentto maintain coverage for the 38 million kids who receive their healthcare through Medicaid, Republicans blocked it from even receiving a vote.But for all the budget’s austerity, it alsoprovides $20bnin tax credits to establish a national school voucher program. And equally outrageous are its provisions that have nothing to do with the pecuniary, fromeasing regulationson gun silencers tohamstringing the power of courtsto enforce injunctions.Perhaps most breathtaking of all, though, is how shamelessly the bill enriches the already mega-rich. In its first year, its tax breaks will grace Americans in the top 0.1% of the income bracket withan additional $400,000, while decreasing the earnings of people in the bottom 25% by $1,000. In other words, those who can least afford it are financing relief for those who least need it.When the50% of working class Americanswho broke for Trump in last year’s election realize they voted for a pay cut, they might begin to feel a bit disillusioned with thecrypto trader-in-chief. They might even feel pulled to the authentically populist vision outlined by the progressives Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on their nationwideFighting Oligarchy Tour.In the meantime, it is almost an inevitability that Republican senators will wring their hands before pressing the green button to vote “yea.” Josh Hawley hascalledthe budget bill “morally wrong and politically suicidal”, criticism which Trump haspreviously mockedas “grandstanding”. The insult contains a typically Trumpian flash of psychological insight, because Hawley and his colleagues will no doubt do exactly what their counterparts in the House have already done – cave.Once Trump has scribbled his oversized signature onto the bill, his vision for the US will have become unmistakable. Try as they might, not even the spinmeisters at Fox News will be able to deny that he runs this country the way he ran hisAtlantic City casinos, leading working Americans to financial ruin while he emerges all the richer for it.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionRepublicansUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateUS politicsUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

The plan includes increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with aspirations to reach 3% in the next parliament.The government’s narrative suggests that increased military spending will enhance national security and stimulate economic growth. However, this perspective neglects the immediate threats facing UK citizens: underfunded public services, a strained National Health Service and the escalating climate crisis.Redirecting substantial funds to military projects, such as nuclear submarines and warheads, is likely to divert resources from essential sectors that directly affect citizens’ daily lives. Investments in healthcare, education and renewable energy not only address current societal needs but also contribute to long-term national resilience. Globally, on average more than24,000 people die of hunger dailyand cutting our aid budget will worsen this tragic situation.The UK’s defence procurement history is marred by inefficiencies and mismanagement. The government’s hugely ambitious strategic defence review is an exercise in hope over experience. For many years big defence projects have been delayed as a result of unforeseen technical problems partly caused by overoptimistic military planners and advisers influencing gullible ministers. Defence officials are highlighting the plan for a big increase in the number of nuclear-powered attack submarines, yet the cost of the existing, and much-delayed, Astute class submarine fleet, has already increased from an estimated£4.3 bn to more than £11bn.Meanwhile, spending on nuclear weapons has increased significantly more than anticipated and serious problems remain over the project to build a new fleet ofDreadnought nuclear missile submarines. Although the government suggests that priority should be given to the defence of Europe where, it says, the main threat to Britain’s security lies, it invests in expensive and vulnerable aircraft carriers for deployment elsewhere, including the far east.The government’s review risks repeating past mistakes by committing to large-scale projects that have led to wasted resources and unmet objectives. Furthermore, while theUK spends more on defencethan all but five other countries in the world already, evidence indicates that military build-up actuallyincreases the likelihood of conflict.Keir Starmer has also argued that defence projects will stimulate the economy. Yet investments in sectors such as renewable energy and public infrastructure have demonstrated more consistent returns and broader societal benefits.The review claims that the defence strategy will support 400,000 UK jobs, including 25,000 in Scotland. While job creation is vital, the number, quality and sustainability of these jobs warrant scrutiny. There is likely to be a net loss of jobs as a result of shifting funding from other sectors.Analysis for the Scottish governmentshowed that military spending has one of the lowest “employment multipliers” of all economic categories, ranking 70 out of 100 in terms of numbers of jobs generated. Much of the defence spending will probably be on weaponry from the US.Furthermore,recent researchis clearly showing that global boosts in defence spending will worsen the climate crisis. A2020 report by Scientists for Global Responsibility and Declassified UKfound that the UK military-industrial sector already produces greater quantities of carbon emissions than 60 countries. While the Ministry of Defence acknowledges the environmental impacts of its operations, its proposed solutions, particularly increased biofuel and nuclear, even where lower in carbon emissions,still threaten ecosystems, biodiversity and human health. In the light of these concerns, it’s imperative to consider alternative strategies that prioritise human security and sustainable development.A group of academics, trade unionists and campaign groups has drafted analternative defence review, a civil society response to the government’s SDR. We call for a radical break with successive UK governments’ failed security and defence policies, which distort Britain’s national priorities, fuel global instability, undermine international law, harm the environment and divert investment from public services and social infrastructure towards subsidies for the global arms industry. Our ADR suggests that most of this increased spending appears to be linked to policy influence by international arms companies.By reallocating resources towards healthcare, education and climate resilience, the UK can address immediate domestic challenges while contributing to global stability. Such an approach not only enhances national security but fosters economic growth through the creation of sustainable jobs and industries.The strategic defence review presents an opportunity to redefine the UK’s security priorities. However, by focusing predominantly on military expansion, it risks neglecting the pressing needs of its citizens and repeating past procurement failures. It’s time for the UK to embrace a holistic security strategy that truly addresses the challenges of the 21st century.Karen Bell is professor of social and environmental justice at the University of Glasgow.

We would climb up the winding concrete stairs in a Soviet-era apartment block and be greeted with a warmth that felt like family. Over piping hot bowls of Uyghurchay, mum would talk to them for hours while my brother and I listened. I always assumed they were relatives of ours, until mum told me that they were the parents of her friend Örkesh Dölet, and they had not seen their son for over 20 years. As a child, I didn’t know who Örkesh was, but my heart broke for his parents, who clearly loved and missed their son so very dearly.Growing up in Beijing, dad used to take us to Tiananmen Square on weekends to fly colourful swallow-shaped kites. Due to censorship, I never knew that the pristine, neatly paved tiles beneath the soles of my sparkly light-up sneakers were once carpeted with the corpses of brave pro-democracy student protesters. I never saw the famous photo of “tank man”. I never knew the date “4 June 1989” had any significance for the city that I called home.3:11Exiled pro-democracy activist on being Uyghur during Tiananmen Square protests - videoWhen I first learned about the Tiananmen Square protests, I was in disbelief. I could not even imagine a Beijing where young people would dare to dream of and fight for a betterChina. In the repressive China that I grew up in, a movement like that of 1989 seemed like fiction from some distant, unrecognisable timeline.But the student movement was real, it was impactful, and it was led by a young Uyghur man named Örkesh Dölet.I interviewed Örkesh remotely from his home in exile in Taiwan as part of an upcoming book project, titled Uyghur Resistance. Now, as the anniversary of the 1989 massacre approaches, Örkesh reflects on his lifelong dedication to the fight for democracy, and on that one summer 36 years ago that would irreversibly alter the course of his life.Australia exposed to modern slave labour imports and many businesses ‘ignoring the facts’, commissioner warnsRead moreIn April 1989, Örkesh was a scrawny, charismatic 21-year-old student at Beijing Normal University. He descended on to Tiananmen Square with thousands of fellow students, who bravely protested for democracy and human rights. Over 50 days, Örkesh stepped up as a leader of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation and represented students in televised negotiations with Chinese Communist party leaders. Then,on 4 June 1989,the tanks rolled in. The People’s Liberation Army mowed down the blossoming civil society movement that Örkesh had helped build, but it could not extinguish the powerful sense of justice that continues to burn within the soul of this lifetime activist.After the massacre, Örkesh found himself on China’s most wanted list and escaped into exile under cover of darkness, as did the other high-profile protest leaders. However, unlike his fellow exiled Han Chinese protest leaders, Örkesh has not once been allowed to return to China, nor has the Chinese Communist party granted his parents the documents necessary to travel overseas. During one of our visits, Örkesh’s father said he had sent one handwritten letter to Chinese government officials every week since June 1989, imploring them to let him see his son. I know every stroke of every Mandarin character on every one of those 1,800 unanswered letters is chiselled with longing.Desperate to see his family, Örkesh tried to turn himself in to China on four separate occasions without success. “I was most wanted by the Chinese government, but then all of a sudden when I turn myself in, when I offer myself to them, I became the most unwanted.” Örkesh is a really strong person who has seen and survived extraordinary hardships, but even the staunchest, most assertive political dissident is still human: “I miss my family. I want to see them. Even if that meeting has to take place in the form of a prison visit, I still want to have an opportunity to see my family.”View image in fullscreen‘I will always look up to Örkesh. He is the human embodiment of the fighting spirit that lives within every Uyghur person.’Photograph: Sam BiddleThirty-six years in exile is a pain that I can only imagine. For me, it has been 10 years since I’ve been to East Turkestan and seen my loved ones. These past 10 years have been pure agony. But Örkesh has borne this pain since before I was even alive. I think of the vacuum left by his absence, which was palpable in his parents’ apartment. Then I think of the 500,000 members of the Uyghur diaspora and the void we ourselves have left in the homes of our loved ones. Then I think of the millions ofUyghursin arbitrary detention and the hollowness that haunts the homes of their loved ones.The pain of Örkesh and his family was once exceptional, yet now it has become a defining feature of the Uyghur experience – the pain of seemingly interminable temporal, emotional and physical space between us and the people whom we love the most.Yet no amount of discrimination could drive a wedge between Örkesh and his Uyghur-ness. He attributes his continued advocacy to the foundational Uyghur values that he was taught as a child: “As Uyghurs, we were brought up always being taught to be courageous, to be brave. I think that has played an important role in 1989 for me to take the step up and become one of the early leaders of the movement. When I am presented with an opportunity to say something, I believe that I should say what I think is right, not what is safe. As Uyghurs, we do the right thing, not the safe thing.”Generations of Uyghur activists like Örkesh have laid the groundwork for Uyghur advocacy today. To be a young Uyghur activist is to follow a path of resistance that has been paved by our forebears, to draw inspiration from their tenacity, wisdom from their experience and strength from the knowledge that we are joined in this fight by all those who have come before us and all those who will come after us. To be a young Uyghur activist is also to know that this path never has been and never will be an easy one.I will always look up to Örkesh. He is the human embodiment of the fighting spirit that lives within every Uyghur person – this spirit is the reason why a vibrant culture of Uyghur resistance persists to this day.Nuria Khasim is a Uyghur advocate living in Naarm.

The grandmother, 69, islying in a hospital bedin central London, perilously close to death after 245 days on hunger strike. She could still survive, but it will depend on the UK government taking strong action.Soueifstopped eating to try to save her son, the imprisoned British-Egyptian national Alaa Abd el-Fattah, an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience and winner of the 2024English PEN writer of courage award. He has spent more than a decade in an Egyptian jail cell because of his writings on democracy. Soueif wants more than anything else to reunite him with his own son, 13, who lives in Brighton and has barely been able to spend time with his father.Soueif’s hunger strike has been fuelled by her frustration with both her governments: the Egyptian government that heartlessly refused to release Abd el-Fattah at the end of his most recent five-year sentence, imposed because he shared a Facebook post about thetorture of a prisoner; and the British government, which has not been able even to visit Abd el-Fattah and has been regrettably timid in pushing for its citizen’s freedom.This is the second time this year that Soueif’s hunger strike has led to her beingadmitted to hospital, but the danger to her life is far greater this time after so long without food. Her blood-sugar levels are shockingly low and her family spend each day hoping she can make it through the next night. Her doctors say it is a miracle that she is still alive.The pressure on Egypt to release Abd el-Fattah has been growing. The UN working group on arbitrary detention last week issued alandmark opiniondetermining that he is unlawfully detained and that under international law Egyptian authorities must release him immediately.Given the overwhelming and urgent threats to Soueif’s life, and Egypt’s repeated insults to the British government and international law, the UK must now ramp up the pressure on Egypt to release Abd el-Fattah. Keir Starmer has rightlyraised his casewith the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, but we know this Egyptian government will not respond to words alone: the last three prime ministers also tried discussing the case without success.I have beenworking on Abd el-Fattah’s caseas part of a new all-party parliamentary group campaigning for British nationals who are arbitrarily detained, and I find the lack of respect shown by Egypt for the UK’s rights in relation to a British citizen alarming. With my colleagues, I recentlysubmitted evidenceto the foreign affairs committee inquiry noting that the UK has not taken any action, including sanctions, against any Egyptian authorities responsible for Abd el-Fattah’s continued detention beyond the end of his five-year sentence. That position should be urgently reviewed.This week I joined the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson, the former Foreign Office minister Peter Hain and the campaigner Richard Ratcliffe in calling on the government tochange its travel adviceto “caution against travel to Egypt”. In light of what we have learned from Abd el-Fattah’s case, the British government must make clear that a UK citizen who falls foul of the police state in Egypt cannot expect fair process or normal support from the British government. Hundreds of thousands of UK citizens travel to Egypt each year, making a major contribution to the country’s economy, and the truth is we can’t guarantee their rights. The Egyptian government will undoubtedly take notice if its failure to abide by the rule of law starts affecting hotel bookings for the winter season.Alongside this, the UK should be holding off any new trade and investment cooperation with Egypt until Abd el-Fattah is released. The British government should not be signing trade deals with countries that are arbitrarily detaining our citizens. Any plans for the conferenceannounced by the Egyptian governmentlast year to “pump British investments” should be shelved immediately and there should be no discussion of UK support forfinancial packagesto Egypt.Finally, the British government should look to take this matter to the international court of justice. The Egyptian government’s continued refusal of consular access to Abd el-Fattah amounts to a clear breach of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and Britain should seek to claim its rights at the world court. France has recentlytaken this stepin relation to two of its nationals held in Iran.Soueif’s bravery and fortitude is astonishing but if her son’s case is not solved urgently, the consequences for her and her family are too terrible to contemplate. Our government has a duty to use every tool available to secure his release. The time for relying solely on polite diplomacy is long past: the prime minister must demonstrate his strength and resolve in this case.Helena Kennedy KC is a Labour peer and was chair of the Power inquiry into the reform of democracyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Tory MPs know the future looks direHenry HillFairly or unfairly, the party is thinking not whether there will be a leadership challenge, but whenHenry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeMon 2 Jun 2025 07.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 12.29 EDTShareBack in 1997, the former minister and famous political diaristAlan Clarkidentified a potentially fatal flaw in the Conservative party’s leadership system. No, not the controversial membership vote – William Hague did not introduce that until 1998. For Clark, eloquent reactionary that he was, the problem was giving MPs the vote and formal mechanisms to challenge the leader when the old “magic circle” was abolished in the 1960s.The problem, as Clark saw it, was that it would turn the question of the leadership into a pageant without end. The press would always be able to speculate about a contest, and MPs looking to puff themselves up would have an easy way to do so. Over time, the party’s old norms of internal discipline would, said Clark, be worn away.A quarter of a century on, events lend credence to his depressing thesis. It was once said of the Conservative party that loyalty was its secret weapon; nobody says that today. In the 1990s, Clark could write of the foolishness of leadership hopefuls who missed their chance, waiting for a better shot at a job that had only fallen vacant a handful of times since the second world war; as it stands, David Cameron was the last Tory leader to remain in post for an entire parliament.There is surely no disputing that the Conservative party has become a highly unstable institution, and few institutions benefit from being unstable. But there is a compelling counter-argument: which of the recently deposed Tory leaders did not deserve to go?Boris Johnson fell because he could not command enough support from his MPs to staff a government; Theresa May because she could not steer the government through Brexit; Liz Truss because she tanked the party’s economic reputation (and its polling).Whatever you think aboutPartygate, orBrexit, or themini-budget, in each case the leader was failing at their most essential function: delivering victory for, or failing that securing the survival of, the Conservative and Unionist party.This is the context in which the current, increasingly feverish speculation aboutKemi Badenoch’s leadershipis taking place. Her supporters can fairly claim that the Tories have made a vice of leadership contests, and that their woman has not yet been in the job a year. Her critics can, equally fairly, make the case that she is failing at the mostbasic jobof any Conservative leader: survival.Last month’s local elections were a shattering rout. Overall, the party losttwo-thirds of the seatsit was defending; in several counties, it went from near-hegemonic control to single-digit shares of the vote. That has shaken complacent MPs out of the notion that if they held on in 2024, they had a “safe seat”; many have also just lost the councillors who formed the core of their local activist base.Were next year’s elections to play out the same way, the Conservative machine would be disembowelled across another broad swath of England. Worse still, it could suffer humiliating reversals in Edinburgh and Cardiff. Across much of mainland Britain, the Tories would suddenly be in a potentially fatal position: no longer being the most plausible rightwing option on the ballot paper.Badenoch’s allies insist that she needs time to turn the ship around. That was always an argument with a clock on it, but it has been worn thinner still by the brutal fact that theConservativeshave actually started goingbackwards. In May, the party actually under-polled last year’s (already catastrophic) general election performance.The polls also tell their own story. Prior to the conclusion of the leadership contestin November, the Tories’ share was rising as Labour’s fell. Almost immediately afterwards, its polling went into a nosedive – with Reform UK the main beneficiary.Fairly or unfairly, the balance of opinion inside the party seems to be not whether there will be a challenge to Badenoch’s leadership, but when.The most obvious opening is in November, when she marks her first anniversary as leader: the point at which the party’s rules stop protecting a new leader from being challenged. The window of maximum danger runs from then until next May’s local elections and their aftermath; if she survives that, it’s harder to imagine MPs finding the will to depose her later.But the Conservative party’s internal rules are much more flexible than Labour’s. That one-year immunity from challenge? It’s just a rule of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, and they can change it. If the parliamentary party gets its heart set on removing a leader, it can.With such a shrunken parliamentary party, the threshold of letters to the 1922 chairman needed to trigger a contest is lower than it was in the comparative salad days of the last parliament. Yet both wings of the party took heavy punishment at the general election, and the current balance of the parliamentary party favours neither.Badenoch won last November by consolidating her own supporters with the anti-Robert Jenrick vote. The key question is whether that second group will decide to move, either because of a plausible challenge from one of their own (James Cleverly 2.0?), or because Jenrick starts to look like the lesser of two evils – a possibility Badenoch increases every time she inches towards his positions on issues such as the European convention on human rights.Whether a new leader will save the party is another question entirely. The Tory party was once described as an absolute monarchy moderated by regicide; today, it increasingly resembles a state of absolute regicide.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

Maybe – but siblings shape us in far more interesting waysImogen West-KnightsA new book explores the impact of birth order, but how we measure up against our brothers and sisters can be complexMon 2 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 14.07 EDTShareAnew book about sibling relationships, The Family Dynamic by Susan Dominus, examines how things like birth order and the specific achievements of your siblings affect a person’s life trajectory. As such, some of myfavourite researchis back in the public eye: the studies that suggest that I, as the eldest of three children, am the cleverest.I’m kidding. I don’t actually think this is true in my own sibling group, but sure, I’ll take it, and say so in the national press: I’m smarter than you guys, science confirms. I am very interested in siblings and their influences, though. So much so that I wrotemy first novelabout a brother-sister relationship. Siblings shape you in ways that are less deliberate than parents, which means their influence is less discussed, though just as important. That said,birth orderhas remained a public fascination, with parents agonising over whether a middle child is overlooked or eldest is overburdened.I definitely have classic “eldest daughter syndrome”: the tendency for the oldest girl in a family to take on roles of responsibility. Planning of family matters has generally fallen to me in the past, and I remain a planner. I like control to the freakish degree that I eat the same breakfast and lunch every single weekday and run my to-do list with the iron fist of a navy Seal commander.Still, I have often thought that some of the well-worn sibling birth order archetypes – the type-A eldest daughter, the laid-back middle sibling, the rebellious youngest child – must be too simple. They sat in my mind alongside things like star signs: fun but ultimately baseless ways to parse the eternal puzzle of why people are the way that they are.But it seems, as Dominus found, that the studies do bear this stuff out. Eldest children apparently outstrip their younger counterparts in cognitive tests by as early as their first birthday, probably due to the increased parental attention they receive during the however-brief period they are an only child. And sibling influence can be incredibly powerful. Dominus interviews families in which each child went on to achieve success in very different fields, and were spurred to do so specifically by what their siblings were doing.My brother was a quiet little boy, either naturally or because I did all his talking for him. We were very close as children – I would get my hair cut short like his, and enjoyed it if people mistook us for twins. But we grew into quite different people, and that is probably no accident. For instance, he went on to pursue Stem subjects, and I pursued the humanities: the boy whose sister spoke for him went for numbers and concepts, and I went for words.Age gaps between siblings can also complicate the effect of birth order. My sister is nearly 10 years younger than me, whereas my brother is only 18 months my junior. She told me: “I feel like being the youngest, with two siblings quite a bit older than me, meant that I sculpted my perception of what is ‘cool’ on a pretty much even mix of your respective interests.” She’s very into music (my brother) and also video games (me). I think she’s also more emotionally robust than I am. We both wonder whether this is partly the result of getting a front-row seat to all of mine and our brother’s chaotic decisions and teenage crises, and being able to take notes.Growing up surrounded by boys, I’m fascinated – and a bit scared – by the dynamic between sisters | Rebecca ShawRead moreBy now, my siblings and I are, roughly, who we’re going to be. We’re all adults. Perhaps it is less that we are now honing ourselves consciously or subconsciously to resemble or differ from one another, but that we act as vivid mirrors for each other to really see ourselves in.Sometimes, in the company of my brother and sister, I have an ambient sense of something similar to not liking myself very much. Partly, it’s that near-universal experience of regression in the family home: we start to occupy childish roles to befit the dynamics first built in childhood. But it’s also that these are people who have seen every side of me. And they have not been afraid to challenge my less lovable attributes. That feeling of not liking myself is maybe more accurately a feeling of being truly, wholly known for my best and worst traits. My irritability, my belief that I know better than others, my melodrama.I see their flaws too, and they know that I see them. Not unexpectedly, some of these flaws are shared. I asked my brother about this, and he said: “Seeing characteristics of yourself in people you love is quite helpful. Like, oh maybe I’m not that bad: I don’t hate them for the way they are, but the opposite.” And for all that we bicker, it’s a beautiful thing to be loved by people who, unlike your parents, are not hard-wired to love you unconditionally, but who know you just as well as your parents do, and for almost as long.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsSiblingsOpinionFamilyParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet denying people safety, belonging and the right to vote for a decade amounts to the exact oppositeMon 2 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 10.35 EDTShareThere are many lies told by politicians when it comes to immigration in the UK, but none is bigger than the claim that it’s all too easy. Too easy to enter Britain; too easy to be given handouts; too easy to acquire citizenship. The UK is presented as an inert country, passively receiving future Britons that it does not charge, test or, indeed, invite. The government’s latest raft of policies to deal with the“failed experiment” of “open borders”is heavily influenced by this lie, as it is intended to make things harder for immigrants. One of those policies went broadly under the radar, a small technicality amid Keir Starmer’s unsettlingrhetoric, but it will have serious consequences.That policy is extending the period you’re required to be settled in Britain before you can get permanent residency, and then citizenship,from five years to 10 years. As someone who became naturalised under the five-year route, my stomach sank when I saw the news.There is no automatic route to citizenship in the UK for foreigners, not through marriage to a British citizen or even birth on British soil to non-British parents; there has long been a residency requirement component.The “settlement” route to citizenshipis – or was – open to those who have worked and lived in the country legally for five continuous years, and their dependants. After that five years, one can apply for “indefinite leave to remain” (ILR). After a minimum of a year on that status, one can apply for naturalisation, and then a British passport.If thegovernment’s new policiescome to pass, the route to settlement will now take a minimum of 11 years, not including any timespent in Britain as a student or on other visas that don’t count towards the settlement component. I know from experience that five years is already one long trial of keeping jobs against all odds and fighting sudden changes in the law. Doubling that time has ramifications that encompass everything from professional security to that supposed holy grail of immigration anxieties, “integration”.The panic about settlement is misinformed by temporary patterns and faulty premises. After Brexit and the pandemic, the need to support struggling health and care sectors led to a short-term increase in work visas. And what counts towards immigration numbers includes category errors, such as students, as well as an underlying assumption that all those who enter on long-term visas with a potential for settlement will remain. Areportfrom 2023 indicates that, of those on work routes in 2018, only 38% still had valid or indefinite leave to remain five years later.By this measure, not all workers and their families, not even half, are likely to remain in the UK and apply for citizenship – the punitiveness of the extension is disproportionate to the pain it will inflict. It is particularly gratuitously cruel as the 10-year limit will be applied retroactively. Those who came to the UK based on the understanding that naturalisation was an option, and made big life arrangements on that basis, now find themselves literally unsettled.The least ‘integrated’ part of British society isn’t the immigrants – it’s the elite | Andy BeckettRead moreOnce the proposed new rules were announced, I received a flurry of correspondence and calls.“I feel it is unfair,” Christine (not her real name), a skilled worker who was one year away from securing ILR, told me. “Moving to a new country is not a life decision that anyone takes lightly,” she said. These are people who are keenly aware that they have no recourse to public funds and risk having to pack up and leave if they lose their jobs. Christine understood that uncertainty was part of the deal – but thought it could be weathered if she followed the rules, with the promised reward at the end of being “accepted into British society”.Vulnerability is a point that recurred in conversations. Even for those happy in their work, the prospect of being in bondage to their employer for double the anticipated time seized them with a sense of precariousness. Workers’ visas are tied to their employers. They can’t just leave or look for another job, unless the new employer is willing to take on the cost and effort of sponsoring them. The new rules limit career prospects, and will expose people to the whims of bosses and employers. Every bad day at work becomes not just that, but a worry that your whole life in the UK may be over. Long-term sickness becomes not just a health calamity, but an existential one.Then there is the cost and administrative burden. Each extension or renewal of a visa can cost upto almost £2,000, in addition to the£1,035 annual NHSsurchargethat migrants need to pay (on top of national insurance contributions). Over a period of 10 years, a family of four could pay almost up to £35,000 in health surcharges alone. There are other potential cascading costs. Children without ILR, for example, will enter the university system as overseas students, and may be treated as such for fees purposes.Many of these human consequences have not been thought through. We know this because one chilling aspect of the new policies is the lack of specificity beyond the headline summary. The extension comes with the caveat that some people will qualify “sooner based on criteria yet to be decided”, and that there will be a “consultation” later this year. To anyone who has dealt with the Home Office, this working-it-out-as-you-go-along language augurs the sort of unclear process that one immigrant in the throes of challenging a Home Office error once told me was akin to “climbing a crumbling staircase”.Above all, the rule changes show how little our politicians really care about integration. They constantly cite it as the epitome of what earns the right to be in the country and accuse immigrants of not holding up their end of the bargain.But being stuck on work visas for year after year amounts to the opposite of integration. It means you can’t vote, cannot have recourse to public funds if needed, cannot fully lean in to British society and participate with a sense of safety and belonging, as you’re constantly trying to minimise costs in case a change in circumstances means relocating. The policy creates a tier of second-class worker, a sort of migrant labourer welcomed for their work and paying of taxes, but shut out from the privileges enjoyed by British nationals.That’s the real cost of this shortsighted and heartless change. Thosewho come to the country and build a life, have or bring children, become part of the fabric of society, and work continuously throughout their naturalisation time might soon be prevented for more than a decade from having a relationship with the British state that is defined by anything more than fear and anxiety. If there were ever a “failed experiment”, this is it.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionKeir StarmerLabourMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The results will be significant for both the war and Europe’s reputationMon 2 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 14.07 EDTShareAfter many months of inaction and complicity in the face of Israel’s destruction of Gaza, Europe is finally beginning to stir. Tens of thousands of people killed and attacks on schools and hospitals had apparently not been enough. But, along with theblocking of humanitarian aidand opencalls for ethnic cleansing, Israel’s actions finally became too severe to ignore, deny or justify. In recent weeks, a cascadeof unusually strong statements,diplomatic rebukesand threats of sanctions has emerged from European capitals – each move amplifying the next, as if a long-dormant herd has suddenly jolted into motion.Among these developments, the most significant may be the possiblesuspension of the EU-Israel association agreement, which grants Israel preferential access to the world’s largest single market. Last month, the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, broke the EU’s silencewith a letterdemanding a formal review of Israel’s compliance with article 2 of the agreement, which requires it to “respect human rights”.That move triggered a wave of other EU states lining up behind the idea. At the 20 May meeting of EU foreign ministers, a clear majority –17 member states– backed the Dutch proposal. EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, who had appeared sceptical ahead of the meeting,seemed to shiftduring the discussion and at the end clearly announced the launch of the review.Is this a real turning point or just more empty words? That remains to be seen.What is clear is that the EU’sdynamics have shifted. A year ago, when Spain and Ireland – the governments most vocal about the Palestinian plight –proposed the same review idea, they found little support. The Netherlands, by contrast, is traditionally closer to Israel and sits in the EU’s middle ground on this issue. It is this broad centre, which up until now favoured dialogue and close ties with Israel, that has now shifted and aligned with the more critical flank. Only Israel’s staunchest backers – including Germany, Italy, Hungary and the Czech Republic – remained in a minority voting against the review.International opinion has rounded on Israel, but it’s not enough to force Netanyahu’s hand | Sanam VakilRead moreThe review is only the first step: an examination of whether Israel is breaching article 2, which defines respect for human rights as an “essential element” of the agreement. Given the scale of violations and crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, backed up by findings from international courts, such a review shouldn’t even be necessary. As oneIrish campaigner put it: “It’s like standing in front of a burning building and asking for a review of whether there’s a fire.” The facts are clear – but even acknowledging them is politically explosive.The review, which is expected to be done by the next EU foreign ministers’ meeting on 23 June, now depends on two key figures: Kallas and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Will they confirm the obvious – that Israel is in breach of article 2 – and draw the logical consequences? Or will they seek to shield EU-Israel ties from any rupture?Kallas, a liberal from Estonia, had until recently avoided much criticism of Israel, though now seems to have moved along with the EU’s political centre. Von der Leyen, a German Christian Democrat, represents the bloc’s more Israel-aligned wing. She was the face of the EU’s initial blanket support for Israel’s devastating response to Hamas’s 7 October 2023 atrocities, and then fell largely silent as civilian deaths in Gaza soared. But last week, for the first time,she statedthat Israel’s killing of civilians is “abhorrent” and “cannot be justified under humanitarian and international law”. That language points unmistakably toward the only credible conclusion the review can reach.Once the review is completed, EU foreign ministers will discuss options for next steps, which should include suspending the association agreement. A full suspension would require unanimity among all 27 member states – an impossible bar given diehards such as Hungary. But suspending the agreement’s preferential trade component – the most economically significant part – requires only a qualified majority: 15 member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.The trade pillar is where the real leverage lies. The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, accounting for32% of its total trade. Israel, by contrast, represents just 0.8% of the EU’s trade. Revoking preferential access wouldn’t stop trade, but would impose a tangible cost on Israel in the form of higher tariffs and reduced market access. The EU could also suspend Israel’s participation inHorizon Europe, the union’s flagship research programme – a prospect alreadycausing alarmin Israel’s academic sector.Reaching a qualified majority is still a tall order. Not all states that voted for the review necessarily favour actual suspension. And to meet the 65% population threshold, Germany or Italy – large states that opposed the review – would need to shift. For now, that seems unlikely. But if Israel continues its current extremist course, pressure will mount. Chancellor FriedrichMerz’sunusually strong rebukeof Israel last week suggests that not even Berlin’s backing can be taken for granted.And if the EU decided to ignore the findings of an honest review, it would render article 2 meaningless and undermine human rights clauses in EU agreements around the world. Since the 1990s, the EU has invoked such clauses over20 timesto suspend benefits over serious violations, mostly in Africa.That’s why the possibility of suspension cannot be dismissed. UnlessIsraelfundamentally changes course, the likelihood will only grow.For Europe, this is an opportunity to step out of its self-imposed irrelevance and begin to matter again. Pressure-free dialogue hascompletely failed. When the EU held an association council meeting with Israel in February and politely urged more aid to Gaza and a halt to settlement expansion,Israel respondedby blocking all aid and accelerating settlement growth. Only after the Dutch initiative began gaining traction did Israeli officials startpushing internallyto allows some aid into Gaza, citing the threat of EU sanctions.To prevent the looming horror of ethnic cleansing and annexation, the EU must go further and impose a real economic and political cost on Israel. If it does, the prospect of restoring suspended benefits could then become the EU’s most powerful lever to encourage a different path: one that leads not to endless oppression and violence, but to peace and security based on equality.Martin Konečný runs the European Middle East Project (EuMEP), a Brussels-based NGODo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The ABC reported that the chair of a Queensland government-owned company “faced questions” after billing the taxpayer for a hotel stay with a luxury accommodation packagefor his dog.The energy company chair, his “fur-baby Vito” and his wife (unnamed) allegedly enjoyed a $500-a-night stay at the Ovolo hotel in Fortitude Valley when a board meeting obliged his attendance in Brisbane, 100km away from his Sunshine Coast home. The “luxury pet-friendly accommodation” offered at the five-star Ovolo includes a “super comfy” dog bed, treats, premium dog food, mealtime mat and water bowl, as well as a take-home dog toy “because who doesn’t love a present?”According to the report, although the stay last year was approved, the cost was queried by the company’s operations director who feared it was “above the state’s recommended rate of $181 a night for stays in Brisbane”.The story provokes two immediate responses. The first is: should the people of Queensland really be subsidising some suit’s puppycation when the state’s youth justice systemcries outforreform?A ruff guide: how to travel around Australia with your dogRead moreThe second response is, alas: “Honey, grab the dog. Ovolo are doing a puppy package. We’re going to Brisbane.”If the suit wants to move on from the story, I’d suggest they merely outline to theQueenslandgovernment the efficiency dividends delivered by choosing dogcommodation over the alternatives. The productivity impact on leaving one’s dog behind for a business trip is considerable. The phone costs of being told by a partner on solitary dog duty at home that “he keeps sniffing the door, waiting for you to come back” may be negligible, but consider the data costs of watching breed-specific Instagram videos from your lonely hotel room to make moony, sooky faces over.Forty-eight percent of Australian households own dogs; to those of us on the outlay for food, treats, toys, grooming, kennels, vets and puppy school, $500 seems like a rare bargain. While the suit declined to comment to the ABC, a company spokesperson said his travel with his dog involved extenuating circumstances related to “personal family circumstances, which are private”. They said the trip complied with the corporation’s policies and that he “strongly rejected the assertions made against him”.The “VIPooch” story isn’t this nation’s only political dog-indulgence expenses controversy. In 2016, it came out that the Victorian corrections minister, Steve Herbert, had used his taxpayer-funded ministerial car tochauffeur his dogs, Patch and Ted, the 97km between his Melbourne residence and his Trentham country home – notably, without him. Herbert insisted he’d done this only “once, possibly twice”, but the backlash at the time was enough for him to resign his ministry and, soon after, leave parliament.One wonders if he’d be obliged into such a dramatic apology now. In the almost 10 years since the “dog chauffeur scandal”, the century-long shift of pets from household roles of utility to those of companionship has ratcheted up rapidly.Australians have always been pet people, but we are now living in the wake of apost-pandemic pet proliferationthat between 2019 and 2021 raised the proportion of Australian households with pets from 61% to a goggling 69%, marking the largest increase in decades. Australians are now – officially –more pets than people, with 28.7 million fluffy, furry, scaly and feathery pals spread across the population. (Notably, households own over11 million fish. Someone really should tell the Ovolo marketing department.)Other western countries are similar;94 million Americansowned a pet in 2024, which is more people than voted for Donald Trump.Halfof European households are now pet owners. The existence of Petfood Industry magazine itself suggests an expanding “pet economy” that’s estimated to be worth $157bn in the US alone – yet the figures this august journal supplies are also a revelation: gen Z are building a pet empire. In 2024, 18.8 millions American households from this cohort were pet owners – a staggering43.5% increasefrom only the previous year.It has long been observed that the size of every market spawns a proportionalonline influencer communityto grift from it; the word “petfluencer” hasentered the dictionary.A chiweenie with an overbite and 1.9m followers: how Tuna and Instagram’s other top dogs rake in thousands per postRead moreThose horrified by the concept of a dog-positive hotel stay should block their eyes here. Harrods will sell you a designer diamond dog collar for £500,000; “pet-focused fashion” is a real term invented by real human beings to describe brands that hawk pet accessories from raincoats to jewellery made ofprecious gems and leather. “Barkitecture” is now also a word, used in the “designer dog house” biz; you can DIY or invest in “doggy mansions” – evena dog castle– with a build that costs more than a human house.You can charter aprivate plane for your pet. Send them off toa spa. There’s dog yoga, custom cakes and an “aesthetic cat furniture solution” for those whose problems obliging it are truly beyond my imagination.The problem with late-stage capitalism is its indulgences are so extreme that fancier pet food, a BarkBox delivery or the odd commonwealth-sponsored dog chauffeur seem positively humble in comparison.As the birth rate continues to decline, “pet parenting” has emerged as a household-building alternative, expanding the content of family, if not the definition, as a place of mutual love and togetherness.Problem is, we are making our pets the new projection surface for all the fucked-up materialistic status performance infecting us elsewhere – this time, in the most clownish of ways – because your dogdoes not careif its collar’s fromBurberryor its hotel really deserves its five-star accreditation.What makes it most like a human child, my friends, is that it just needs to be fed, needs to be safe – and to spend time with you.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsPetsOpinionDogsQueenslandAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

Research offers some cluesSun 1 Jun 2025 20.31 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 02.41 EDTShareWith the Reserve Bankeasing monetary policy, interest ratesare on the way down.Already this year mortgage pre-approvals havebegun to rise, suggesting that many aspiring homebuyers are excited by the prospect of cheaper home loans.With further cuts expected before the end of the year, some economists are predicting Australia could beabout to experience another house price boom. Lower interest rates enable people to borrow more and potentially spend more on homes, bidding up prices.So, how might the RBA’s actions affect home buying behaviour and the housing market more broadly? Research offers us some clues.How rates affect pricesResearchshowsthat when a central bank lowers its benchmark interest rate, mortgage interest rates usually follow suit.We saw this after the Reserve Bank’sMay decisionto cut rates. Australia’s big four banks immediatelyannounced similar reductionsin rates for new and existing borrowers.You would think after nearly three years of being wrong, the RBA might start to question its economics. But no | Greg JerichoRead moreLower rates reduce the cost of servicing a loan. This is a big deal for Australian homebuyers, whose mortgages can be very large.With the average house pricenow hitting about $1m, an 80% loan saddles the typical homebuyer with $800,000 in debt.Back in March theaverage interest rateon new mortgages was 6%. For the average $1m house, this implies a monthly repayment of about $4,796, using thestandard formulafor amortising loans.After the RBA cut the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points the new monthly repayment would be $4,669 – $127 less. That’s a small but surely welcome relief for mortgage holders.Combined with the Reserve Bank’s rate cut in February, such borrowers are now saving more than $250 a month relative to the start of the year.Everyone can borrow moreLower rates can also improve the borrowing capacity of new homebuyers.Before a bank issues a new mortgage, it weighs the ability of a borrower to service the loan. It does this by considering the amount of income the applicant will have left over after meeting typical expenses.This is known as a borrower’s “net income surplus” and the proportion of this that is used to service a loan is known as the “net surplus ratio”.The maximum ratio is capped at 90% but the typical mortgage is lent against a ratio ofless than 70%.If a household earns $100,000 a year and allocates 25% to expenses, it can afford $4,375 in monthly mortgage repayments at a 70% net surplus ratio.Given the previous interest rate of 6%, this maximum monthly repayment implies the household can afford to borrow $680,000. But, after a 0.25 percentage point rate cut, this household can now afford a $695,000 home loan.And after the 0.50 percentage points of cuts we’ve seen since January, this household’s borrowing capacity is up by $30,000.Pulling up the ladderFor an individual homebuyer, this extra borrowing may be enough to secure that dream home. But the rate cut affects everyone at the same time, increasing the borrowing capacity of homebuyers across the country.All of this extra mortgage credit feeds housing demand, which is likely to pour more fuel into an already overheated market.Indeed,researchindicatesthat a 0.25 percentage point cut in the cash rate is likely to lead to a 1.5% to 2% increase in average house prices over one to two years.That’s an extra $20,000 on the $1m average home value.Research also suggeststhat the impact of interest rates across local housing markets may be strongest where housing supply is tightest and houses are already more expensive.Mortgages get biggerWhile lower rates reduce the cost of a given mortgage, the average mortgage size needs to grow to keep up with higher prices.After the latest cash rate cut, the question on borrowers’ lips is already: when can we expect rates to go down further? | Nicki HutleyRead moreRecall that the monthly payment associated with an 80% loan on a $1m home at 6% interest was $4,796. If the interest rate falls by 0.25 percentage points but house prices rise by 2%, the new monthly payment is little changed, at $4,762.On top of this, the 20% down payment on that new home will now have increased – by $4,000.Is there hope for first home buyers?Despite the initial excitement of lower rates, aspiring homebuyers may be disappointed to see the price of their dream home climb further out of reach. Some may end up no better off.Others might try to snap up a home before lower rates are completely priced in – motivated by a fear of missing out.Research suggestsit can take a year or more before house prices peak after a rate change.And others still may decide to keep renting for the time being. Fortunately for them,research shows thatchanges in interest rates do not materially affect the rents that landlords charge their tenants.Finally, one option is holding savings in the stock market while they wait, perhaps diversified via exchange-traded funds, as these assets usually rise in value after an interest rate cut.It’s never a good idea to panic. It’s always important to think through your options before diving into the market. And remember, this is general information, not financial advice.

But, after dying almost unknown, Gwen is now having the last laughJudith MackrellMon 2 Jun 2025 10.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 16.30 EDTShareWhen I began researching the lives of Gwen and Augustus John, the image I held in my mind was of the two of them, as very small siblings, sketching together on the coast around Tenby. For both to have escaped the narrowness of their modest provincial home, and established themselves at the heart of early 20th-century art, was a remarkable journey – and I was intrigued by what possible forces of temperament and upbringing might have driven them.It is hard to credit, now, the scale of Augustus’s celebrity. His youthful drawings were compared to Raphael; he was briefly acclaimed as the leader of British post-impressionism, then celebrated as the pre-eminent portrait-painter of his age. And while recognition came slower to Gwen, the singularity of her vision, drawing on early expressionism and abstraction, as well as her own mystic embrace of Catholicism, earned her a significant place in the modernist canon.He lived in a menage a trois, travelled in a caravan and had several run-ins with the policeBut if there are early clues to the Johns’ success they aren’t simple to find, because, apart from their mother’s amateur talent for watercolours, they had no other role models. Their childhood, in fact, was unusually forlorn. When their mother died in 1884, Gwen was just eight, Augustus six and a half, and their father was so felled by anxiety and grief he had no idea how to comfort them. “I used to cry all the time,” Gwen wrote, while Augustus would recall that, along with their two other siblings, they became a farouche little tribe, retreating behind a wall “of invincible shyness”.View image in fullscreen‘We ought to be free of ties’ … Mrs Atkinson by Gwen John.Photograph: AlamyYet it was misery that bred in the Johns a rebellious longing for escape – and, for Gwen and Augustus, their first and best escape was in art. They drew from the moment they were able to hold pencils, sketching portraits of the world around them. While they had only the vaguest idea of where their sketching might lead, when a teacher suggested that Augustus might do well at the Slade School of FineArtin London, Gwen insisted that she must go there too.The Slade felt like a miracle. The Johns were learning their craft, but they were also experimenting with love, with ideas, with the rackety fun of London. They were also as close as a brother and sister could be, understanding each other as no one else could, equally hungry for lives that would fill the void of their motherless upbringing.Yet beneath the intimacy there was also, always, an itch of sibling antagonism. At its roots lay Augustus’s childish, bullying resentment at being the younger of the two, and Gwen’s furious attempts to fight back. When their lives began to diverge, as Augustus and his work began to achieve a precocious fame, that itch could flare up again.View image in fullscreenHigh society … Augustus with actor Tallulah Bankhead.Photograph: Keystone Press/AlamyPart of the issue was the flamboyantly bohemian image Augustus had constructed around himself, to counteract the “invincible” John shyness. Beautiful and wild, he grew his hair long and wore hooped golden earrings. He lived in a menage a trois and had numerous affairs. When he travelled around England in a horse-drawn caravan, he had several run-ins with the police. And while the gossip columnists and most of the art critics adored him, the clamour of his success was difficult for Gwen. Even though she never doubted the value of her own work, and even though her life was no less unconventional – she went to Paris, she fell in love with both women and men, including the sculptor Auguste Rodin – she was increasingly impelled to distance herself from her brother.Augustus was hurt by that. He was also frustrated by Gwen’s growing inclination to keep her art to herself. Her pictures were like children to her, and while she needed praise as much as any artist, she often found it hard to send her work out into the world. She knew how much better she painted without the pressure of exhibitions and sales – and, while she could be very grateful to Augustus when he tried to promote her career, her instinct was often to reject what she regarded as his despotic interference.There was another set of reasons for this disparity in their fame. These lay, more starkly, in the fact that Augustus, as a man, had always enjoyed more opportunities than Gwen. The art world at the time was overwhelmingly male: almost all of the galleries and schools were run by men; and even at the Slade, which was unusually progressive in admitting students of both sexes, the teaching staff as well as the artists who dominated the curriculum were male. When one of Gwen’s fellow students, Edna Waugh, was told she might become “a second Burne-Jones”, she was spirited enough to reply: “I would rather be known as the first Edna Waugh.” Yet it was already clear to the women at the Slade that, once they graduated, the odds were stacked against them making professional names for themselves.While Augustus was rapidly taken up by a network of sympathetic (male) artists and buyers, and was able to survive on commissions and sales, Gwen had to support herself as an artists’ model. The fees she earned were “ruinous” but, even at the risk of poverty, she swore never to sacrifice her independence for the security of marriage. “I think if we are to make beautiful pictures, we ought to be free of family conventions and ties,” she wrote, and she only had to look at the fates of Waugh andIda Nettleship(Augustus’s wife) to see that most of her married friends ended up with little or no time for their art.View image in fullscreenSpurned marriage … Gwen in a self-portrait.Photograph: incamerastock/AlamyThere were so many factors – cultural, financial and personal – that shaped the trajectories by which Augustus and his art became so famous, while Gwen remained known to a small circle of connoisseurs. But the trajectories didn’t end there because, after their deaths, the reputations of the two Johns underwent a radical volte-face.There is no question that the quality of Augustus’s work declined during the second half of his career. Drink, combined with an incurable restlessness, corroded his talent, and so did the pressures of providing for family (he fathered at least 13 children and was, ironically, more compromised by “conventions and ties” than Gwen). After his death in 1961, his standing was further damaged by the volume of late, mediocre works coming on to the market, and by the inevitable fading of the legend that had once given such thrilling glamour (and marketability) to his name.In fact, the behaviour that had once fed that legend, the promiscuity and the wildness, was now more likely to be disparaged than cheered. This change in the political culture was one reason why Gwen’s own stock began to rise. Her relative obscurity had continued until 40 years after her death, in 1939, when her estate was taken over by the gallerist Anthony d’Offay. While the exhibitions and sales D’Offay masterminded were crucial to the explosion of interest in Gwen, so too was the campaign among late 20th-century scholars to restore female artists to their proper place in history. Gwen, according to Augustus’s granddaughter Rebecca John, had always been regarded as a “family secret”, yet from the mid-1980s onwards, she became the subject of numerous articles, biographies and even novels.Now, to a degree that would have flabbergasted most of her contemporaries, Gwen is the more famous John. The one person who wouldn’t have been surprised, however, was Augustus. Always the harshest critic of his own work, and the most loyal supporter of his sister’s, he once prophesied that in 50 years, he would be known “as the brother of Gwen John”. It was a prophesy uttered in a moment of gloom, but it spoke volumes about his relationship with his sister. The two of them, as siblings, might have become separated by time, circumstance and mutual exasperation, yet the bond between them was one that Augustus, in particular, was unable to break.Artists, Siblings, Visionaries: The Lives and Loves of Gwen and Augustus John, by Judith Mackrell, is published by Picador on 19 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a lonely time, but a lovely summer and I decided to do something uplifting and joyous. There were a bunch of records I loved listening to on a sunny day – Dusty Springfield’s I Only Want to Be With You, The First Picture of You by the Lotus Eaters, You on My Mind by Swing Out Sister, which has Bacharach key changes and strings. I wanted to make a piece of music that gave me the buzz those songs did.I didn’t want to worry about an album or sleeve artwork or how the video was going to go. I just wanted people to hear the song and feel like the sun had come out. I needed strings for the demo and found a fellow who was advertising samples in Loot magazine – this was 1994, before you could get anything you needed on your laptop. I remember going round to his flat and waiting for hours while he copied them on to a floppy disc.I spent an afternoon with Kirsty MacColl, who really loved what I’d done – but wanted to change everythingThere was never a plan to sing the song myself. I’d been writing with Julianne Regan, who was in All About Eve, so she was the first person to have a crack at writing a melody and lyrics. After she went her own way, Geoff Travis at Rough Trade played the demo to Morrissey, who asked for a meeting – we ended up playing pinball. A week later, I got a letter from him that just said: “Dear Bernard, I’m sorry, I can’t.” Then I spent an afternoon with Kirsty MacColl, who really loved what I’d done but still wanted to change everything.Someone suggested I go and see David McAlmont playing at the Jazz Cafe. During his first song, the drummer Makoto Sakamoto came on and started smashing the shit out of his drums – it was the greatest sound I’d ever heard. Then David started singing and I was like, “Well, there it is.” I knew I needed both of them. I gave David a tape of the instrumental and two days later he came round to my flat with what he’d written. He only had words for one verse. I said: “Just sing it twice. We’ll worry about that later.” But we never got around to it and people don’t seem to notice. I love the message of the lyric: it’s a big “fuck you”, but delivered in the most positive way.We recorded the strings then spent a couple of days in producer Mike Hedges’ chateau in Normandy. We set the drums up in the old stone cellar – Mako didn’t speak English but I directed him with my arms and remember the room shaking as he produced that eruption you hear at the start of the record. David recorded his vocals in the ballroom – he seemed to find the key-change leap effortless. I was standing 10ft away thinking: “This is going to be great.”Yes is my favourite out of all the records I’ve ever made. To make a song that people put on to feel good is just magic. Years after it came out, I was at a fireworks display with my kids. They always finished the night with a banger. That year, they closed with Yes. That just blew my mind.David McAlmont, singing, backing vocals and songwritingKnowing three artists before me had been given the option to do something with this great piece of music was very motivating. Bernard had evoked Motown, Burt Bacharach and Dusty Springfield, but he’d added a rocky thing. I wanted to try something simple.Initially, I came up with something quite T Rex but my flatmate said: “It’s a bit one dimensional, dear.” I remember sticking my finger into my vinyl pile, touching the soundtrack to Judy Garland’s version of A Star Is Born, and thinking: “What would Judy do?” Lyrically, it was such a punt. I’d been dating somebody who I really liked, but he’d just kind of ghosted me. I was thinking: “What would I say to him if I became famous?” I just started singing: “So you want to know me now?” It was delusional, really. Before Yes came out, a friend asked me: “What kind of a song is it?” I said: “It’s an I Will Survive for the 90s.”Women have told me they left abusive relationships thanks to YesI remember getting to the climactic point after the second chorus where the song builds and builds and I sing: “I’m better, better, Ye-e-e-e-es!” I was thinking I was done, but then Bernard said: “We need something for the end, a kind of refrain.” I thought: “Smokey Robinson!” And I used my falsetto to repeat: “I feel well enough to tell you what you can do with what you got.” The recording actually uses varispeed to pitch that part a semitone out of my comfort zone, so I was much happier performing the song with a live band onLater With Jools Hollandthan I was singing along to the backing track on Top of the Pops.Over the years, I’ve met women who have told me they left abusive relationships thanks to Yes. After our second Top of the Pops appearance, the sister of the show’s producer came over to say she’d been unable to walk and the song had helped her to get up. It has a power I can’t account for. After it had reached the Top 10, I went to see Jimmy Somerville live – and the guy who inspired the lyric was there. He said: “Oh my god, David, you’re doing so well!” I was standing there biting my lip, thinking: “You have no idea.”Butler, Blake & Grant play Cambridge Junction on 6 June before touring the UK.

The writer of a new book explains his glorious allurePhilip HoareMon 2 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 21.21 EDTShareWilliam Blake may be known for seeing angels up in trees, for writing the alternative national anthem Jerusalem, and for his emblematic poem The Tyger. But his story is far more subversive and far queerer than cosy fables allow. It’s why Oscar Wilde hung a Blake nude on his college room wall. It’s why Blake became a lyric in a Pet Shop Boys song. And it’s why David Hockney is showing a Blake-inspired painting at his current exhibition in Paris.When I lived in the East End of London, I’d walk over Blake’s grave in Bunhill Fields every day. It felt sort of disrespectful. Perhaps that’s why he has haunted me ever since. Years later, while trying to write a book about another artist, I got ill and very low. Suddenly, echoing one of his own visions, Blake came to me and said: “Well, how about it?” I felt I had to make amends for treading on his dreams. I’ve met many artists – Andy Warhol, Lucian Freud, Derek Jarman – but it is Blake whose hand I would love to have held and whose magical spirit I summon up in my new book. He even gave me my title: William Blake and the Sea Monsters of Love. (A friend has since pointed out that the title sounds suspiciously like a 1970s album by a certain starman from Mars).His neighbour was the Chevalier D’Eon, a former army officer who fences in a black silk dressI was writing about a man who had died a long time ago, yet who still seems alive and among us. Born in 1757, dying in 1827, Blake had perfect timing: not to be confined by Victorian mores, but to live in a looser, revolutionary age. He only ever sold 61 copies of his revolutionary “illuminated books” – which, for the first time, placed images and words together. Each would be worth £1m now. Blake might have died in poverty and obscurity, but that is exactly where his potential resides – as an unexploded but benevolent device. His posthumous influence lives on in flash-lit scenes – as if his afterlife were a movie being screened in front of us.Cut to the 1820s and Blake’s young fans, called the Ancients, are led by Samuel Palmer, who bends to kiss the doorbell of their master’s lodgings as he passes by. They enact their Blakean cult in the Kentish countryside, swimming naked in a river and growing their hair long.View image in fullscreen‘Michelangelo thighs’ … Blake’s Newton.Photograph: artphotos/AlamyJump forward to Manhattan in 1967 and Blake’s new disciples, Patti Smith andRobert Mapplethorpe, are reading his poetry to each other every night in their poverty. They’re obsessed. Mapplethorpe gets a job in an antiquarian bookstore and when a copy of Blake’s revolutionary America: A Prophecycomes in, he tears a page out and stuffs it down his trousers. Then, freaking out that he might be discovered, he goes to the toilet, rips it up and flushes it away. That evening, he confesses his sin to Smith, who celebrates his act, seeing it as a fabulous infection of the sewers of New York with their hero’s subversion.Five years later, on the rocky coast of Dorset, Derek Jarman, deeply under Blake’s influence, recreates a Blakean scene for his first narrative Super 8 film. In flickering, saturated 70s colour, Andrew Logan poses as a sea god in the deconstructed dress he’d worn for his first Alternative Miss World that year. A half-naked young sailor floats in a rock pool. A young woman, wearing only a fishing net, plays the siren who lured him to his doom. That night, the crew meet Iris Murdoch in a nearby country house. She takes them up a hill to dance around a megalith in the moonlight. Murdoch cites Blake in a half a dozen of her queer-friendly novels, and discusses him with her lover, the gay liberation hero Brigid Brophy.Flashback to Paris, 1958: Allen Ginsberg, citing Blake in his outrageously queer poem Howl,emulates his hero by reciting it in the nude outside Shakespeare and Company, the famous bookshop on the Left Bank. He’s accompanied by a besuited William S Burroughs, whose cut-up writing technique is heavily influenced by Blake’s proto-surrealist texts. In 1975, in the New Mexico desert, David Bowie will play a queer alien, singing and speaking Blake’s words, in the Nicolas Roeg film The Man Who Fell to Earth.View image in fullscreenDeeply influenced … Derek Jarman’s At Low Tide.Photograph: Courtesy Luma FoundationLike Shakespeare’s Prospero or Doctor Who, Blake has the power to appear anywhere, any time, rewriting his own fate through his art. That’s why one of Oscar Wilde’s young lovers, W Graham Robertson, was so inspired by Blake’s sensuality that he became his greatest champion, using a multimillion-pound fortune to buy up every work by Blake he could. Presenting them to the Tate 40 years later, Robertson saves Blake for the nation.Yet Blake remains a secret, hiding in plain sight. In Milton, his astoundingly beautiful and prophetic book of 1804, he creates two images of male fellatio and a butt-naked Milton. They wouldn’t look out of place in a Mapplethorpe photograph. One reason Blake published his own work was to escape the censoring eye of the printer. It is this same transgression that powers James Joyce in 1920s Paris, as he deploys Blake’s queerness like a grenade in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. Joyce’s Leopold Bloom changes sex in a lucid dream sequence, while British grenadiers drop their trousers to bugger each other as an emblem of the anti-imperialism Joyce and Blake shared.In 1970s London, in their house that is as old as Blake, the artists Gilbert & George claim him as their saint. Like them, Blake would today be seen as one artist in two people. Misogynistic history has written his wife Catherine out of the story – but she shared his visions, printing and colouring them in. Then they’d spend the afternoon sitting naked in their backyard. “Come on in,” they’d tell visitors. “It’s only Adam and Eve, you know.”Shockingly modern, Blake burned with a fire that can’t be put out.Their neighbour is the Chevalier D’Eon, a former army officer who now performs fencing demonstrations in a black silk dress. D’Eon duly appears as Mr Femality in a witty salon skit written by Blake that today reads like a Joe Orton farce. Blake declared gender a mere earthly construction and agreed with Milton: “Spirits when they please / Can either Sex assume or both.”Faced with this fantastical cast, I can only wonder at Blake’s alchemical effect. His large colour prints – such as a nude Isaac Newton with Michelangelo thighs sitting at the bottom of the sea – have a 3D texture that still defies explanation. He was trying to make reproducible paintings. Like Andy Warhol and Albrecht Dürer, Blake trained as commercial artist. He believed in the egalitarian power of art. He even proposed a 100ft tall image of a naked “Nelson Guiding Leviathan” to be set over the road to London like a Regency Angel of the North.Shockingly modern, Blake burned with a fire that can’t be put out. His new Jerusalem was an achievable utopia, if only we shook off our “mind-forg’d manacles” – our prejudices about gender, sex, race and class. His art still inspires us as he shoots his arrows of desire from his bow of burning gold, standing there naked, bursting out of a rainbow. Blake’s new world is the one we long for, where we will all be gloriously free to love whoever and however we like.William Blake and the Sea Monsters of Love is published by 4th EstateWilliam Blake and The Sea Monsters of Love by Philip Hoare (HarperCollins Publishers, £22).

What next for him … and the show?Martin BelamMon 2 Jun 2025 06.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 07.43 EDTShareAt the weekend, Doctor Who attempted to pull off the holy grail of a surprise regeneration, with Billie Piper appearing to step into the shoes of the departing 15th DoctorNcuti Gatwain a move that, unless you are constantly online in the fandom rumour mills, would have come as a shock. Gatwa’s exit gives him one of the shortest ever tenures in a role that has been a fixture of British television for more than six decades.Fresh from making waves in Sex Education, 32-year-old Gatwa is young and beautiful in a way that the Doctor has not always been. His incarnation of the Time Lord delivered scenes it is hard to imagine most of the other actors inhabiting – whether that was him clubbing, pulling off a 1960s dance number, using a glitter cannon to fly through space, or saying “babes” a lot.View image in fullscreenGlitter cannon in space! … Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor.Photograph: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC StudiosThe first Black man to lead the show, his era of Doctor Who sensitively explored him visiting periods of Earth’s history where his skin colour would have an impact, such as the south of the US in the segregation era inLuxwhere he was not welcome, and Lagos in Nigeria during playwright Inua Ellams’The Story and the Engine, where he said he felt he very much was.The show was also uncompromising about this Doctor being queer, almost instantly falling for Jonathan Groff’s character in Bridgerton tributeRoguein a way that the unrequited love of Mandip Gill’s Yaz for Jodie Whittaker’s 13th Doctor only awkwardly tiptoed around.But perhaps the thing that most characterised Gatwa’s Doctor was his open displays of emotion – showing on screen that he was not afraid to cry. However, the device was probably overused.View image in fullscreenNo tiptoeing here … the Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) hits it off with Rogue (Jonathan Groff).Photograph: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC StudiosSeeing the self-styled “last of the Time Lords” cry over the death of a character we have barely met, as happened with Sasha 55 inThe Robot Revolution, was meant to show the audience she was important to him, but it felt as if the frequent tears cheapened the other times we have seen the character weep.Part of the Doctor’s character is that they need to sometimes feel dangerous to the audience. This is to make it clear that while they may appear human and enjoy the company of humans, they are also close to being an omnipotent immortal being, who usually chooses to use those powers for good, but not always.Doctor Who: The Reality War – season two finale and Ncuti Gatwa era recapRead moreHis howl of despair at the racist society in Dot and Bubble not wanting to be saved by him was raw, and we also got to see those kinds of scenes from Gatwa inThe Interstellar Song Contest. Despite having the lightness of internet viral sensationDugga Dooin it, it was a dark story from Juno Dawson with a message about genocide and terrorism that featured scenes of the Doctor torturing Kid (Freddie Fox).View image in fullscreenShowing his dark side … Gatwa with Varada Sethu in Intergalactic Song Contest.Photograph: Lara Cornell/APThe show sometimes feels stuck between a rock and a hard place in the modern era. It has to compete in a streaming environment where grownup fans also watch shows such as Andor or The Last of Us and compare it directly with those. The BBC though is also still trying to make a show whose primary purpose is to be broadcast on Saturday evening on BBC One for a communal multigenerational family audience gathered around the TV. And that is an audience that is increasingly vanishing in houses with multiple screens and multiple viewing options.Gatwa’s era also seemed to be riding two slightly conflicting horses. Russell T Davies returned as showrunner with the nostalgia rush of havingDavid Tennant and Catherine Tate back in the Tardisfor three 60th anniversary specials, then promised a softish reboot with the aim of picking up new audiences and starting afresh as “Season one” with a new Disney+ international distribution deal. But he also opted to bring back companions from the 1960s and 1980s, and have the return of niche villains and enemies that necessitated flashbacks to episodes from the 1970s, which didn’t exactly scream “accessible”.‘An audible gasp’: Doctor Who fans shocked by Billie Piper returnRead moreThe eight episode series length is also causing pacing issues. If you accept that the first and final two episodes make up the bulk of the series arc, then you only have five episodes to play with. Once you have done a couple of experimental “bottle” episodes, and one Doctor-lite episode, there really isn’t much time to get to know a Doctor and their companion simply hanging out having adventures in time and space.View image in fullscreenNot enough adventures in time and space … Gatwa.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonAnd a single misfiring episode – last year’s finaleEmpire of Deathwas widely regarded in fandom as not having stuck the landing – is an eighth of the season. Two misfiring episodes is a quarter of the season. There is no room in the present format for mid-tier Doctor Who stories.It always feels as if it is too soon to say goodbye to an incarnation of a Doctor, but we only got 19 episodes with Gatwa, and of those he sharedThe Giggle– and his clothes – with Tennant, and in three of them (73 Yards,Dot and Bubble,Lucky Day) he barely appeared at all.He also becomes the first Doctor since Paul McGann – whose main appearance wasthe one-off TV movie in 1996– not to face the Daleks, the most iconic Doctor Who monster of all. Gatwa’s Doctor was fun, flirty and full of joy, but it is difficult not to conclude that we hadn’t seen enough of him in the role, and now we never will.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoTelevisionFantasy TVNcuti GatwaRussell T DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

AsJarvis Cockerpoints out on Spike Island,the lead single from their first album in 24 years, their 2002 split went largely unlamented: they had already succeeded in considerably reducing the size of their audience with 1998’s claustrophobic album This Is Hardcore and 2001’s Scott Walker-produced We Love Life. An ostensibly valedictory greatest hits album spent a single week in the lower reaches of the Top 75. And the year after their demise, John Harris’s Britpop historyThe Last Partynoted tartly that Pulp’s music had “rather dated”. “The universe shrugged, then moved on,” sings Cocker, which is a perhaps more poetic reiteration of what he said at the time: the greatest hits album was “a real silent fart” and “nobody was that arsed, evidently”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for More.Photograph: no creditBut subsequent years significantly burnished their memory. It was frequently noted that, besides the Manic Street Preachers’ A Design for Life, Common People was the only significant hit of theBritpopyears that might be described as a protest song, a bulwark against the accusation that the era had nothing more substantial to offer than flag-waving and faux-gorblimey. At a time when ostensibly “alternative” rock bands had seemed suddenly desperate for mainstream acceptance, Pulp had become huge by sticking up for outsiders and weirdos. Mis-Shapes, for example, hymned the kinds of people one suspected some of Oasis’s fans would have happily thumped.They had also been quick to call time on rock’s disastrous association with New Labour, releasing the scathing Cocaine Socialism a year after Tony Blair was elected. If there weren’t a huge number of takers for Cocker’s musical solo projects, his national treasure status seemed to grow and grow. Pulp reformed in 2011 to general rejoicing, and again in 2022, by which point they could reasonably claim to be the only major Britpop band exerting an obvious influence on current artists (clearlySports Teamand, latterly, Welly both have Pulp in their DNA) and note that their infamous flop greatest hits collection had finally gone platinum.But there’s a huge difference between playing the old favourites live and making a new album. If you don’t want to sully your catalogue with a photocopy of past glories, you’d better have something new to say, something the oddly equivocal tone of Spike Island and indeed the Cocker quote accompanying More – “this is the best we can do” – seems to acknowledge. In fact, like Blur on last year’s acclaimedThe Ballad of Darren, Pulp have found a way to successfully apply their longstanding approach to a very different stage of life when, as Cocker puts it on Slow Jam, “you’ve gone from all you that could be to all that you once were”.Pulp: Spike Island – videoA man who once fantasised about cuckoldry as an act of class rage-fuelled revenge now finds himself addressing how divorce impacts on your potential to find love again on Background Noise (in a characteristic touch, this existential meditation takes place in the middle of a shopping centre). Tina effectively transposes the kind ofPulpsong that ruminates on missed romantic opportunities – Babies, Disco 2000, Inside Susan – into middle-age, the frustration sharpened by the fact that it’s 40 years since that particular opportunity sailed. Similarly, Cocker was always exceptionally skilled at drawing confused, youthful relationships and at making capital from the grubby mundane aspects of sex. He still is, although on Grown Ups, the relationship is depicted as taking place on a planet now out of reach, “because the rocket doesn’t have enough fuel” to get back – to youth, presumably – and on My Sex, all the grubby mundanity has taken on a pressing tone as libido dims: “Hurry ’cos with sex, we’re running out of time.”Pulp’s 20 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreGiven how strong the imprint of their frontman’s voice is, it seems almost pointless to note that the contents of More sound like Pulp – if Cocker was unexpectedly recruited as lead singer of Cannibal Corpse, they’d probably sound like Pulp too – but suffice to say the music here does all the things a longstanding fan might expect. There are melodies derived from Gallic chanson, tinny electronics, rhythms that lean towards disco, sprechgesang verses that build into anthemic choruses and a lot of flourishes that recall 70s pop (there’s also a surprising amount of violin redolent of long-departed member Russell Senior). More importantly, it does these things really well: the epic A Hymn of the North is as heart-rending a Scott Walker-influenced ballad as Pulp have ever recorded, while if they had released the joyous Got to Have Love as their post-Different Class comeback single in 1998, rather than Help the Aged, their commercial fortunes might have taken a different shape.More certainly isn’t going to convince anyone who doesn’t already like Pulp to change their mind, but then anyone who expects a reformed band’s first album in nearly 25 years to do that is perhaps grappling with wildly unreasonable expectations. It’s more likely that a reformed band’s new album might be a placeholder, filled with songs that pad out the hits live, but provoke a rush on the bars and loos in the process. That definitely isn’t the case with More. If this is the best Pulp can do, it’s more than good enough.Explore more on these topicsPulpJarvis CockerPop and rockIndieBritpopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

What’s it like to be managed by your mother, run a billion-dollar business in your teens and be dismissed as ‘the lesbian’ by a Hollywood legend?Mon 2 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 2 Jun 2025 05.06 EDTShareAweek before JoJo Siwa entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, she had a presentiment about it. “Something feels different,” she told her mother (and manager) Jessalynn. “I don’t think I’m gonna win, but I think I’m gonna change.” Siwa’s initial hunch was that the transformation would be in her career, she says. “Little did I know it was going to change my personal life so much. By a landslide, it is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”Siwa may be only 22, but it’s still quite the statement. As the breakout talent of the American reality TV series Dance Moms, she was arguably the biggest child star of the 2010s, at 11 years old instantly memorable for her larger-than-life personality and equally outsized hair bow. By the time she turned 15, in 2018, Siwa was a cross-platform tween sensation, with 5 million YouTube subscribers (now 12 million), a Nickelodeon deal, a burgeoning pop career and a staggeringly successful hair accessory business.When, at 17, Siwa came out by lip-syncing to Lady Gaga’s Born This Way on TikTok, Elton John phoned to congratulate her. He continues to send her birthday messages and Christmas cards, Siwa confirms: “We love Sir Elton!”She has now spent 12 years in the public eye, more than half her life – a fact that Siwa herself still seems to be wrapping her head around. “It’s been a decade of learning, you know what I mean? It’s really all I know.” She radiates a warm, solid professionalism somewhat at odds with her routinely outre getups (today a Burberry polo shirt, denim Bermuda shorts and diamante-studded, slicked-back ponytail).At times Siwa could pass for a California member of Congress, with her steady eye contact, deep tan and hypnotically white veneers (a recent investment,reportedly costing $50,000). But when her attention drifts to her nails or her buzzing phone, or she’s blushing over being “head over heels” with her new beau, she seems much younger than her years.We’re meeting a month after the Big Brother finale; Siwa finished third, behind Coronation Street’s Jack P Shepherd and drag queen Danny Beard. It was a surprise result: Siwa had been expected to place higher, as the series’ most talked-about contestant.On the second day of production, Siwa was targeted by 72-year-old actor Mickey Rourke, who grilled her about her sexuality, then told her: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.” Rourke persisted through Siwa’s polite but firm attempts to shut him down, announcing his intention to “vote the lesbian out”.View image in fullscreen‘Some rat doesn’t get to ruin this for me’ … Siwa with Mickey Rourke on Celebrity Big Brother in April.Photograph: Shutterstock for Big BrotherIt was an uncomfortable watch, with Siwa’s shock and discomfort palpable. It affected her “even more than people know”, Siwa says. “As it was happening, I just froze.” But she soon rallied, wanting to set an example for how to respond to such an outburst. She was also defiant: “Some rat doesn’t get to ruin this for me … It’s only day two.”Rourke was given a warning, and apologised to Siwa on-screen for his “short fuse” – but she says it was negated by his subsequent comments in private. “He mentioned to me that he knew what he was doing, that he tried to get under my skin and wanted to offend me, all this shit. That’s what made me super upset – that was really hard to take.”But Siwa does not believe Rourke should have been removed sooner, as some viewers called for. “I wanted to give him a chance, and I think production could see that as well,” she says. “Think about where we got to go from there: we got to have laughs with him [and] beautiful conversations about inclusion, and what you can and can’t say.”Those interactions gave Siwa closure, she says, “Like, ‘Oh, he doesn’t hate me; he’s a very hurt man.’” But Rourke was less invested in teachable moments; he later left the show after what ITV called “further use of inappropriate language” and “unacceptable behaviour” towards other contestants.Mickey Rourke ejected from Big Brother house over ‘unacceptable behaviour’Read moreHad she ever experienced such flagrant homophobia before? “Not to that level, and not in person like that. It was definitely a first – but I was lucky. I had a lot of support in that house.”Which brings us to the silver lining of the saga: Chris Hughes – or “sweet Christopher”, as Siwa calls him now.The ex-Love Islanderstood up to Rourke for Siwa, whom he had only just met, and comforted her. The intensity of the altercation, magnified by the Big Brother fishbowl, seemed to fast-track them to BFF status, surprising fellow housemates as much as audiences.Siwa says she and Hughes had to reckon with the suggestion they were playing to the cameras before they were even out of the house. It gave them the opportunity to clarify with each other: “No, this is a very genuine connection – we’re not faking a thing.”Their obvious chemistry was complicated, however, by Siwa’s being in a relationship (with 27-year-old Australian actor Kath Ebbs, who identifies as non-binary) and identifying as a lesbian (and, before that, gay and pansexual). When Siwa mused aloud on Big Brother that she felt more “queer” than lesbian, then broke up with Ebbs soon after production wrapped, tabloid speculation about the nature of her relationship with Hughes ramped up. In their first joint interview, on This Morning, both insisted on their “platonic soulmate” connection.After daily are-they-aren’t-they coverage and some awkward TV interviews I expect Siwa to shut the subject down. But she understands the interest, she says. “People can see our chemistry, and they got to see it develop.” Does it bother her? “I think everyone’s just curious, and I can’t blame them.”We have circled around the question long enough. I have to ask: is it platonic or romantic?Siwa is silent for a long time, staring down at the floor – but even with her body angled away from me, I can see she is smiling from ear to ear. “I am,” she agrees, when I point it out, “because we … we … we have …” She exhales noisily, ums and aahs some more. After a full 20 seconds, she says: “It’s not platonic any more, and it’s been a beautiful development, a beautiful connection, and I’m absolutely head over heels for him and he’s the same way.”It’s hard not to feel happy for her: she seems utterly smitten, the hearts-for-eyes emoji in human form.Anyone who suggests their relationship is “a PR stunt” is only telling on themselves, Siwa says. “Clearly, you’ve never been around us. I won’t ever speak for him, but for me personally, the happiness in my life just radiates off of me right now. Literally yesterday, I was massaging my cheeks; I’ve never [before] been in pain from smiling so much.”View image in fullscreen‘I live this very public life, and it can get really hard to navigate’ … Siwa.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianSiwa was born Joelle Joanie Siwa, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Jessalynn, a dance instructor, and Tom, a chiropractor. She has an older brother, Jayden, who briefly dabbled in vlogging, but Siwa was the star in the making – and Jessalynn made it her “mission in life” (as she later put it, on Dance Moms) to make it happen.In 2013, aged nine, Siwa was cast from an open call for Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition. She placed fifth in the reality show, but her star power – and Jessalynn’s tenacity – saw her picked up for two seasons of Dance Moms from 2015. Young Siwa was often singled out as loud and over the top, despite the show’s high bar for both; even her coach, the famously harsh Abby Lee Miller, described her as “obnoxious; sometimes rude” in the same breath as praising her stage presence and drive to succeed.For the producers who discovered her, Siwa was raw talent, reality TV gold. They would reportedly gather to watch her interviews as they were being taped, not wanting to miss a minute of what they called “the JoJo show”.“I did love it – that’s just who I was,” says Siwa. “It was the best time in my life. I would give anything to go back to it.”View image in fullscreen‘The hardest thing was feeling you weren’t in control of yourself’ … Siwa on stage at Nickelodeon SlimeFest in Chicago, June 2018.Photograph: Timothy Hiatt/Getty Images for NickelodeonWas she aware of the production around her, the narrative being built? “I was aware that we were making a TV show, but it was never like ‘here’s the plan’. I’ve never been told what to do, or how to be, or what to say, ever.” Other people’s experiences of reality TV are different, Siwa acknowledges; but “for me, it was 100% real”.After two seasons of Dance Moms, Siwa moved the JoJo show to YouTube, devising, shooting and editing all her videos herself. The workload was more brutal than TV, in the absence of child labour protection, but the payoff was higher. These days Siwa is nostalgic for that earlier, prospective era of what’s now established as “content creation”. “It was so hard to be successful at, but it was unreal fun.”In 2016, she released her first single, Boomerang, which went platinum; she signed with Nickelodeon the following year. Her first world tour, in 2019, sold out more than 100 venues, including the O2 Arena in London. She loved performing, and her career, and never felt forced, Siwa says, but she was aware of the pressure and responsibility.She recalls a moment on that tour, when her stage manager told her: “You can do the show without anybody; we can’t do the show without you … But do not abuse that power.” Another 16-year-old could hear that and run amok, Siwa agrees. “That’s why I am where I am now, because I don’t have that blood in my body.” Even as a child herself, she could “understand why child stars go crazy, because it’s really, really hard”, she says. “I think the hardest thing was feeling like you weren’t in control of yourself.”By age 15, “I was running a billion-dollar business. That’s something that should never be on a 15-year-old’s shoulders – but at the time, it was my normal.” As of 2019, she’d sold 90m hair bows, “and that was just the bows”, Siwa says. “Anything I did got turned into a doll.” She is embarrassed to give the retail sales figures for her slime kit, “because it’s ridiculous even to think about”. Hundreds of thousands of dollars? “More.More.”The profits didn’t go straight into her bank account, Siwa hastens to add – but she did gain access to a fortune. Jessalynn, as the quintessential “stage mom”, has often been accused of pushing Siwa and robbing her of a childhood – but, Siwa points out, Jessalynn was also working for her. She had the option of cutting Jessalynn off when she turned 18; instead, Siwa insists (somewhat morbidly) that when Jessalynn dies, it will be the end of her career.“We don’t have a normal mother-daughter relationship – but I couldn’t do it without her.”She did have a phase of envying her friends’ “more nurturing” parents, Siwa admits, and feeling wistful for what she missed out on: “Stupid little things like high-school football games, high school …” She would have liked to have gone to medical school: “It’s crazy to me that it’s now a more realistic option for me to build and own a hospital.”That sense of her unlived life played out last year, in what Siwa self-effacingly describes as her “bad girl phase”. After turning 21, she trialled an edgier, more in-your-face image with Kiss-inspired makeup, defiant clapbacks to “the haters” and drinking alcohol on stage. As child-star rebellions go, it was restrained, even perfunctory; Siwa, too, felt as if she was going through the motions. “I was laughing about it today, what my makeup looked like – like, ‘Dear God, if I could go back in time …’ It wasn’t authentic.”Even the Fireball shot she downed on stage was actually apple juice and Diet Coke, she says. “I think I just wanted to be so far away from being a child star, and I look back at that like, ‘You’re an idiot – being a child star was so fun.’ I love what I do, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”Now Siwa is seeking to channel that carefree freedom with her new single Bulletproof: a sugary yet distortion-heavy spin on Frère Jacques, and an instant earworm. Previously, Siwa says, she released songs she “didn’t fully connect with”, believing that they’d be hits; with Bulletproof, “It just feels right – it doesn’t matter the success level of it.”View image in fullscreen‘You can’t help who you love’ … Siwa and Chris Hughes on Celebrity Big Brother.Photograph: @chrishughesofficial/InstagramShe is similarly uninterested in justifying her present happiness. Her ex, Ebbs, has been vocal since the break-up, but Siwa says she’s “choosing peace” and not to engage with any takes or opinions. “I’ve read 50 articles in the last week about me that are not true, that say, ‘Sources close to JoJo …’ You’re never gonna know the full truth – and I can’t be bothered to fill anybody in.”She will confirm, however, that “queer” best “encompasses how I am, and who I am” – but reserves her right to remain fluid. “There’s a lot of different sexual identities. I think there’s nothing more beautiful than somebody discovering themselves.”At 22, it’s inevitable, too. The pushback to Siwa’s shifting identity (includingfeelings of betrayalfrom some in the LGBTQ+ community) seems consistent with the time-honoured resistance to child stars changing their image. “I do live this very, very big public life that has so many eyeballs on it, and it can get really hard to navigate,” Siwa says. “But I’m also living a human life. You can’t help who you love.”Whether it can be put down to her lifetime in the spotlight or the protective shield of new love (or, indeed, her shiny new teeth), Siwa gives off an armoured quality, like nothing can touch her. She is the happiest she’s been in years, she confirms. “Ever since Big Brother, genuinely. Even my family is like, ‘What happened in there?’”She describes lying in bed with Hughes, scrolling on their phones; this morning, she woke up to him singing one of her songs. “You know when you’re alone, how you feel? You are your true, raw self. I’ve obviously felt like that before, but never around one single person.”As a kid, Siwa says, she didn’t distinguish between her public and private selves, on camera and off: “It was very much one straight-up path.” She even learned to “look really happy, and fake it really well, and there’s something else going on inside”. Now, she says, “It’s the first time in my life that it feels like I’m switched off.”JoJo Siwa’s single Bulletproof is out nowExplore more on these topicsReality TVThe G2 interviewPop and rockTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

As the band return, they relive the mayhem years – and their soundtrack spinoffs, from Attenborough to ChernobylDaniel Dylan WrayMon 2 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareFifty years ago, Cabaret Voltaire shocked the people ofSheffieldinto revolt. A promoter screamed for the band to get off stage, while an audience baying for blood had to be held back with a clarinet being swung around for protection. All of which was taking place over the deafening recording of a looped steamhammer being used in place of a drummer, as a cacophony of strange, furious noises drove the crowd into a frenzy. “We turned up, made a complete racket, and then got attacked,” recalls Stephen Mallinder. “Yes, there was a bit of a riot, and I ended up in hospital, but it was great. That gig was the start of something because nothing like that had taken place in Sheffield before. It was ground zero.”Mallinder and his Cabaret Voltaire co-founder Chris Watson are sitting together again in Sheffield, looking back on that lift-off moment ahead of a handful of shows to commemorate the milestone. “It is astonishing,” says Watson. “Half a century. It really makes you stop, think and realise the significance.” Thedeath in 2021 of third founding member Richard H Kirkwas a trigger for thinking about ending things with finality. “It’ll be nice if we can use these shows to remind people what we did,” says Mallinder. “To acknowledge the music, as well as get closure.”It did feel a bit hostile at times – but more than anything, we just ruined people’s nightsIt’s impossible to overstate how ahead of their time “the Cabs” were. Regularly crowned the godfathers of the Sheffield scene, inspiring a wave of late 1970s groups such as the Human League and Clock DVA, they were making music in Watson’s attic as early as 1973. Their primitive explorations with tape loops, heavily treated vocals and instruments, along with home-built oscillators and synthesisers, laid the foundations for a singular career that would span experimental music, post-punk, industrial funk, electro, house and techno. “There was nothing happening in Sheffield that we could relate to,” says Mallinder. “We had nothing to conform to. We didn’t give a fuck. We just enjoyed annoying people, to be honest.”View image in fullscreenInspired by dadaism … the band’s early days.Photograph: Pete HillInspired by dadaism, they would set up speakers in cafes and public toilets, or strap them to a van and drive around Sheffield blasting out their groaning, hissing and droning in an attempt to spook and confuse people. “It did feel a bit violent and hostile at times, but more than anything we just ruined people’s nights,” laughs Mallinder, with Watson recalling a memory from their very first gig: “The organiser said to me after, ‘You’ve completely ruined our reputation.’ That was the best news we could have hoped for.”Insular and incendiary, the tight-knit trio had their own language, says Mallinder. “We talked in a cipher only we understood – we had our own jargon and syntax.” When I interviewed Kirk years before his death, he went even further. “We were like a terrorist cell,” he told me. “If we hadn’t ended up doing music and the arts, we might have ended up going around blowing up buildings as frustrated people wanting to express their disgust at society.”Instead they channelled that disgust into a type of sonic warfare – be it the blistering noise and head-butt attack of their landmark electro-punk track Nag Nag Nag, or the haunting yet celestial Red Mecca, an album rooted in political tensions and religious fundamentalism that throbs with a paranoid pulse.View image in fullscreenCool spinoff … Watson won a Bafta for his Frozen Planet recordings.Photograph: BBCWatson left the group in 1981 to pursue a career in sound recording for TV. Mallinder and Kirk invested in technology, moving away from the industrial sci-fi clangs of their early period into grinding yet glistening electro-funk. As the second summer of love blazed in the UK in 1988, they headed to Chicago instead – to make Groovy, Laidback and Nasty with house legend Marshall Jefferson. “We got slagged off for working with Marshall,” recalls Mallinder. “People were going, ‘England has got its own dance scene. Why aren’t you working with Paul Oakenfold?’ But we’re not the fucking Happy Mondays. We’d already been doing that shit for years. We wanted to acknowledge our connection to where we’d come from: Black American music.”This major label era for the group produced moderate commercial success before they wound things down in the mid-1990s. But in the years since, everyone from New Order to Trent Reznor has cited the group’s influence. Mallinder continued to make electronic music via groups such as Wrangler and Creep Show, the latter in collaboration with John Grant, a Cabs uber-fan.Watson says leaving the group was “probably the most difficult decision I’ve ever made” but he has gone on to have an illustrious career, winning Baftas for his recording work with David Attenborough on shows such as Frozen Planet. He recalls “the most dangerous journey I’ve ever made” being flown in a dinky helicopter that was akin to a “washing machine with a rotor blade” by drunk Russian pilots in order to reach a camp on the north pole. On 2003 album Weather Report, Watson harnessed his globetrotting field recording adventures with stunning effect, turning long, hot wildlife recording sessions in Kenya surrounded by buzzing mosquitoes, or the intense booming cracks of colossal glaciers in Iceland, into a work of immersive musical beauty.When he was at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania with Oscar-winning composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, recording sounds for the score to the 2019 TV series Chernobyl, he couldn’t help but draw parallels to his Cabs days. “It was horrific but really astonishing – such a tense, volatile, hostile environment,” he says. “But it really got me thinking about working with those sounds again, their musicality and how it goes back to where I started.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

This isn’t something you can do without emotion.” Mallinder and Kirk were not really speaking in the years leading up to his death, with Kirk operating under the Cabaret Voltaire name himself. “Richard was withdrawn and didn’t speak to many people,” says Mallinder. “And I was one of those people. He wanted to be in his own world. It was difficult because I missed him and there was a lot of history, but I accepted it.”There will be no new music being made as Cabaret Voltaire because, they stress, tsuch a thing cannot exist without Kirk. Instead, it’s a brief victory lap for the pair, a tribute to their late friend, as they sign off on a pioneering legacy with maybe one last chance for a riot. “Richard would probably hate us doing this but it’s done with massive respect,” Mallinder says. “I’m sad he’s not here but there’s such love for the Cabs that I want to give people the opportunity to acknowledge what we did. You can’t deny the music we made is important – and this is a way to celebrate that.”Cabaret Voltaire play a Forge Warehouse, Sheffield, 25 October, then tour the UK from 17 to 21 November.

The fact is that it’s not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?”This year’s fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues.Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. “What excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,” he said.For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to theKeep it Fringefunding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe’s honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts.Lankester said he had numerous conversations that “reaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there’s a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It’s something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It’s still on an incredible number of people’s bucket lists.”He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her “enormously valuable” intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: “The message landed.”Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least £1.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city’s ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents.The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. “What we don’t want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people [who] drive a big chunk of that revenue,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festivalEdinburghScotlandOasisAC/DCFestivalsFringe theatrenewsShareReuse this content"

So that was quite a technical obstacle,” said Prof Aaron Koller, who later this year will become the first Jewish occupant of the post since 1540.Henry’s motives for founding the Regius professorship of Hebrew studies read like a chapter fromWolf Hall, bound up with the aftermath of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon and England’s break with the church of Rome.Rare and ornate 14th-century Bible sells at auction for £5.3mRead moreKoller suspects Henry wanted to boost England’s intellectual firepower after the rupture with the papacy, with Hebrew a critical tool for retranslating sections of the Old Testament and offering competing interpretations to those used by the church in Rome.“I need to learn about the Tudor background to this, but about 10 years earlier he and Catherine had been tangling over the interpretation of Leviticus [a book of the Bible] and whether their marriage was legal or not,” said Koller.“For the papacy, Jerome’s Latin translation had taken pride of place as the Bible. But as part of the Protestant reformation – [Martin] Luther was very big on this, and in England it happened as well – the thinking was: we have to go back to the original, so we want to read about it in the Hebrew and the Greek.”Royal attention could also be dangerous. After Mary I acceded to the throne, the body of one of Koller’s predecessors as professor of Hebrew was dug up, charged with heresy and burned, in a sign of her regime’s displeasure.But Koller said Henry’s decision also reflected the status of Hebrew alongside ancient Greek and Latin as a classical language of scholars. Studying Hebrew allowed intellectuals to tap into thousands of years of literature spread across the world.Koller, who teaches at Yeshiva University in New York, said part of his new role would be “convincing the British public that Hebrew studies is of broad interest”, regardless of background or religion.He said: “One of the challenges we’ve had, politically and educationally, is that the idea of Hebrew has been tied in with a particular nation state in the past 75 years. While that has some advantages – suddenly you have 10 million native speakers of the language – it also has educational disadvantages because people are thinking Hebrew is quite a political thing. Whereas no one thinks that about Latin, it’s easier to sell it as politics-free than Hebrew, which immediately makes people think: what am I doing with this country of Israel? Do I like it? Do I want to go there?“But part of my role is to say: Hebrew has a massively and really fascinatingly long history, and has nothing to do with the nation state that happens to exist today in the 21st century. You can study medieval Hebrew and be enthralled by the poetry and the philosophy without coming across as taking a stand on a contested issue.”Cambridge’s archives include the pricelessGenizah Collectionof nearly 200,000 books, letters and documents, written mainly in Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic, retrieved from a Cairo synagogue’s storeroom at the end of the 19th century. Koller’s own research has included studying an ancient Hebrew text discovered in a cave in Dunhuang, western China, alongside 40,000 Buddhist manuscripts.Even during the centuries when Jews were banned from Britain, Koller said, there were scholars of Hebrew working on medieval manuscripts in college libraries, although Jews were barred from academic posts until 1871.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am very happy with his appointment,” said Khan.“This wider contextualisation of Hebrew in the broader cultures of the Middle East is, I believe, a key change to the profile of the Cambridge professorship of Hebrew that is significant for the history of the post.”Koller said: “One of the things that attracted me to the job is that Hebrew, as conceived in the position, is not religiously aligned. It’s a world cultural language, it’s alongside Persian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic.“The same way that we have classics – where we teach Greek and Latin because there are sources and texts that need to be accessible and of interest to all people who are interested in humanistic inquiry – the same is true of Hebrew, and Persian, and Chinese.

His family said in a statement that he died of natural causes.“Dad leaves behind a legacy of sound, love and boundless creativity,” they said on Facebook. “At the centre of it all was our amazing mom, Pamela – his guiding star, enduring muse and wife of 62 years. We know how deeply he cherished this community, and we feel that love too.”View image in fullscreenJames Lowe, centre, with the Electric Prunes circa 1970.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesFormed in Los Angeles in 1965, the band’s second single, 1966’s I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night), reached No 11 in the US, and proved their biggest hit. (Most of their hits were written by Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz.) More significant, perhaps, was the song’s inclusion on the 1972 psych and garage compilation Nuggets, a cult favourite for more than 50 years, and their general influence over the emerging psychedelic scene. Lowe said that the band wanted to make “free-form garage music”.The band’s name started as a joke and they had a short-lived, tumultuous existence, with Lowe later admitting that they were learning to play their instruments as they went along, with one significant early woodshedding session taking place at the house of Leon Russell. Members came and went, a David Axelrod-produced album of psychedelic pop and Gregorian music flopped and inspired a disastrous live performance, and producer and engineer Dave Hassinger’s rights to the name allowed him to reassemble the band at will. Lowe left in 1968. The so-called New Improved Electric Prunes released their last album, Just Good Old Rock and Roll, in 1969 and split a year later.Lowe distanced himself from the band until interest resurged in the 1990s and he began touring and recording with other members of the group. The song Kyrie Eleison, from the Gregorian-inspired album Mass in F Minor, had been used in the 1969 film Easy Rider and part of the album were later sampled by the likes of MF Doom and Madlib. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving original member.Lowe was born in San Luis Obispo, California, on 5 March 1943 and lived in Hawaii for a time as a teenager. When he returned to California, he performed folk music and worked in rocket engine production before forming the Sanctions, the band that evolved into the Electric Prunes.After the band’s split, Lowe worked as a recording engineer, contributing to significant works such as all three albums by Todd Rundgren’s band Nazz and the first album by the band that would become Sparks, then known as Halfnelson. That record flopped, prompting Lowe to leave music to work in television production.In 2000,he told US author Richie Unterbergerthat the band’s reunion had reminded him “how much fun music is. Take away the profit motive and all that greed and you get back to trying to make a good record … it’s very hard.” Of the Electric Prunes’ brief existence, he said: “Some things are meant to be short and sweet. Life is but a dream.”This article was amended on 2 June 2025.

Russell Grant, Keith Floyd and Robin Cook – remember them? Bremner does, and remembers the jokes he once told about them too. Prompted by onstage interlocutor Fred MacAulay, he summons them back to life here, in An Evening With … format that includes standup and sketch alongside chat-show banter and questions from the crowd.It’s perfectly entertaining, especially for those of us who were there first time around. (MacAulay makes a running joke of the confused 17-year-old in the front row.) Bremner is nothing if not a slick raconteur. Too slick, arguably: I sometimes wished he’d answer a question from the heart rather than from his mental Rolodex of well-buffed anecdotes. He does that once, when prompted to discuss his ADHD, and his commitment to destigmatising the condition. Elsewhere, it’s smooth repartee about schmoozing the king, struggling with Noel Edmonds’ voice, and prank calls he once made in character as Nelson Mandela.There are treats for the locals in his native city: a cameo from Gavin Hastings and a Trump gag about the Fife village of Lower Largo that would bewilder audiences elsewhere. With little new to say about the US president, there’s too much Trump in the standup portion of Bremner’s show. It’s not the only instance of our host treading familiar ground (on Rees-Mogg: “he’s like something out of a previous century”, as if that’s not been frequently observed). But there are choice moments, too: a fine quip about the names of the ex-Member for North East Somerset’s kids; another about concussion protocols and the high recent turnover of British PMs.You end with an impression of a satirist with little fire left in his belly, his anecdotes suggesting cosy camaraderie with the public figures he lampoons onstage. But he remains witty, well-informed (see the set piece in which voice-of-horseracing Peter O’Sullevan commentates on modern politics) and able with a twist of those vocal chords to spring the innocent, distant past irresistibly back to life.AtGala Durham, 3 June;then touring.Explore more on these topicsComedyRory BremnerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet for all its faults it’s an honest, flawed attempt to show how complicated it is to meet someone in your 30s who may be The One when both of you already have entanglements or relationships or ex-relationships.It looks like a very personal work from Tezel, with moments that could be taken from real life. Chris Fulton plays Ian, a guy who has come back to his home town in Skye for difficult family reasons, and in the pub he meets-cute, or meets-intense, with German set-designer Kira, played by Tezel. They have a magical night where they stay up all night talking, but then have to part, both back to London where they pursue their separate imperfect lives, naturally excited and confused and saddened about what just happened and leaving us to wonder if they will find their way back to each other by the final credits.The parts in this film which are supposed to be joyous and life-affirming and adorable – Ian and Kira come close to dancing on the table over breakfast after their all-night talk – are pretty insufferable. There’s a moment in Anthony Minghella’s Truly, Madly, Deeply when Juliet Stevenson and Michael Maloney, to break the ice on their date, talk while hopping along in the street, and comedian Nick Hancock notably said that while watching this he realised he had more in common with any of the aliens in Star Trek than these people. It is how I felt some of the time watching this, as the dialogue switches from rom-dram loveliness to jarringly, unconvincingly acted scenes of shouty confrontation. It doesn’t, in fact, quite fall into place.Falling into Place is in UK cinemas from 6 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsDrama filmsLondonScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

One day, Joan confides to her two besties, fellow teacher Alice (Call My Agent’s Camille Cottin) and art teacher Rebecca (Sara Forestier), that she’s no longer “in love” with Victor and is therefore questioning the survival of her marriage. When she eventually plucks up enough gumption to confess her lack of feelings to Victor, he doesn’t take it well. Meanwhile, Rebecca is having an affair with Alice’s husband Eric (Grégoire Ludig); Alice doesn’t know but she doesn’t seem bothered that he’s a bit distant since, as she explains to Joan, she’s never really loved him that deeply. And wouldn’t you know it, she finds herself very tempted when she strikes up a long distance flirtation with artist Stéphane (Éric Caravaca) and asks Rebecca to be her alibi so she can go meet him one weekend – thereby opening up an opportunity for Rebecca and Eric to spend the weekend together themselves.The script by Carmen Leroi and the film’s director Emmanuel Mouret is deft enough to keep things in constant comic-dramatic motion, with lovers and romantic prospects constantly cycling through the ensemble as people keep hooking up and then having second thoughts or at least questioning their assumptions. It’s a minor miracle that the cast manages to charm throughout and keep the audience’s sympathies – instead of repelling us with their manifest dishonesty and delusions. For instance, some may find Joan’s belief in the primacy of being “in love” a bit childish and jejune, but Hair imbues the woman with such endearing vulnerability it’s hard not to forgive her flaws. Also, like any good French film, there’s tons of tasteful interiors and chic clothes and much fuss made of food and fellowship, as well as of love. It’s all a bit cliched, but made with such effortless elan it goes down a treat.Three Friends is at the Ciné Lumière, London, from 3 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsComedy filmsFranceWorld cinemaComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s something missing here. Something big.” The three grim, heavy, black monochromatic paintings that greet you as you walk into this show, called Resistant Forms, at Spike Island, the first major retrospective of the Guyanese-British artist’s work in the UK, have all the hallmarks of minimalism. They are dark, simple, ultra-formal images, a single colour on each canvas, covered in geometric grids, like Bauhaus in mourning. But the shapes and grids that define each work are not just experiments in form, they are not just an artist trying to push aesthetic boundaries: each is based on the architecture of the plantation.Suddenly, this formal minimalism becomes heavily weighed down by history, exploitation and oppression. Now, those formal geometric structures look like fields of sugar cane, bodies packed too close together in cramped dorms, sweaty and suffering. Fur peeks out of a metal grate cut into one of the canvases, as if countless animals are pressed in there, caged. They are incredible, powerful, uncomfortable, shocking paintings.View image in fullscreenDonald Locke, Black Box with Green Surface – Blackbirds, 1974.Photograph: Michael Brzezinski/Courtesy: Estate of Donald Locke and Alison Jacques. © Estate of Donald LockeAmazingly, Locke, who died in 2010, at first rejected any political reading of the works, insisting they were just exercises in form. It wasn’t until years later that he realised how overburdened with the pain of colonialism the works really were.Taking the language of art and imbuing it with the reality of the colonial experience is a move that Locke would repeat over and over. In the 1960s, he came to Bath and Edinburgh to study ceramics. The black sculptures that resulted are like splayed bodies, pairs of lungs spread apart, muscles locked in tension. In the 70s, the ceramic shapes elongate – now they look like long, downtrodden, browbeaten, solemn figures arranged into grids and locked in cages in sculptures titled Plantation K-140 and Plantation Piece. The brutality of the plantation as a tool of colonial greed, control and subjugation is everywhere.The most famous piece here, Trophies of Empire from the Tate’s collection, is a series of long black cylinders placed in vases and cups, some shackled together, others encased in silver, all displayed in a bleakwunderkammerof colonial violence. He was pretty insistent that these cylinders were bullets, not penises, but either way the result is the same: the colonies get screwed while the colonisers get rich.The mixing of media – in that case, ceramics and found objects – would happen throughout the rest of his career. Later paintings, from when he had moved to Arizona and then Atlanta, combine vast abysses of black paint with photos of confederate soldiers, skulls, Queen Victoria, white nudes and black singers. There are even photos of his own old work. Throughout, the past loops inescapably back into the present.He was a maximalist, smashing together painting and ceramics, modernism and African-Caribbean mythology, sculpture and photography, ideas upon ideas upon ideas. Some of the ceramic works get a little dull and repetitive, and the later reinterpretation of Trophies of Empire isn’t great. But the canvases are highly successful, powerfully dark, ultra-critical, vast, angry things.View image in fullscreenDonald Locke Dynasty, The Birth of Empire (The Birth of Empire #2), 1989.Photograph: Michael Brzezinski/Courtesy: Estate of Donald Locke and Alison Jacques. © Estate of Donald LockeLocke was at the forefront of a disparate group of diasporic artists dragging modern art into the post-colonial future. Alongside people including Frank Bowling and Aubrey Williams, Locke used his work to say: “Hey, you can’t separate art from history, from context.”Paintingand sculpture in the post-colonial era is haunted, stalked by colonialism. To ignore that is to ignore the truth. He could no more make art unaffected by those things than he could ignore his own race, his own family history, his own past.The most striking thing is how current the work looks. Decades before colonialism, blackness and post-colonial rhetoric became one of the dominant themes of contemporary art, Locke was laying out a roadmap for how art could confront uncomfortable histories and create something beautiful in the process.Donald Locke: Resistant Formsis at Spike Island, Bristol, 31 May to 7 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Returning to herBurkina Fasovillage after decades of living in France, Boro experiences an emotional paradox intimately known by all immigrants. Once-familiar places turn foreign, since the migrator has undergone huge internal changes of their own. And with the recent passing of her uncle Ousmane Coulibaly, the head of her extended Muslim family, Boro’s homecoming is marred by disharmony. Between Coulibaly’s brothers and his 19 children, warring interests over inherited land rage on.The film returns time and again to a sacred courtyard where, for centuries, the umbilical cords of Coulibaly newborns have been buried to ensure their ascendence to heaven in the afterlife. More than a ritual, the tradition concretises the lineage of generations. But while religious rules automatically transfer Coulibaly’s claim to this land to his sons, some of the elders turn to secular laws for their bid. As the courts of Burkina Faso are based on the French colonial system, this clash is more than just a family squabble; it represents a disconnect between the past and the present of a nation.Boro’s perspective on the dispute remains incisively critical while reserving judgment. The courtyard is not a neutral domain but a gendered one. Several scenes move between the men’s heated debates and the women on the sidelines who have little say in the proceedings; thanks to her camera, Boro gains access to spaces that previously excluded her. In a particularly striking and moving sequence, the director steps in front of the lens as she joins her aunts and cousins in a song. Though cut from the same cloth, the women are now worlds apart.Al Djanat: The Original Paradise is on True Story from 6 June.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsBurkina FasoAfricaWorld cinemareviewsShareReuse this content"

In The Möbius Book, her experiment crosses the blurred border of fiction into something else. Life writing, autofiction, memoir? Whatever you call it, The Möbius Book is deeply serious and engrossingly playful, and it lavishly rewards serious, playful attention.A Möbius strip is a length of any material joined into a loop with a half twist. It’s an uncanny shape, common and obvious, easily created and yet awkward to describe geometrically. For literary purposes, a Möbius is interesting because there’s intricate structure and constraint but no ending. It goes around again, mirrored with a twist. Lacey’s book takes this literally, the text printed from both ends, with memoir and fiction joined in the middle. Twin stories experiment with plotlessness and irresolution, while remaining aware of the way fiction attaches itself to linear plot and reverts to romance and quest. Characters find and lose love, find and lose meaning.In one half, two women, Edie and Marie, reminisce about their messy love lives and Christian beliefs in Marie’s grotty apartment, ignoring the pool of blood forming outside a neighbour’s door. In the other half, the first-person narrator leaves a controlling partner, recalls an ascetic adolescence and struggles to write and think about faith with clever friends during lockdown.Lacey is fascinated by literary form, finding fiction at once a constraint and a space for playLacey is fascinated by literary form and by the metaphors for literary form, finding fiction at once a constraint and a space for play. Late in the day, the narrator, “with trusted friends who knew how, got tied up and whipped”, as “a rite in all this, the chaos of having more freedom than I knew what to do with”. It’s impossible, in a book so preoccupied with crucifixion, martyrdom and self-denial, not to see the image of the twisted Möbius loop in this friendly bondage. The structures of novels and the iconography of Christian martyrdom are both narrative responses to suffering; both offer freedom through constraint. But for Lacey, suspicious of pleasure, the compatibility of faith and art is questionable.The two modes of the book, which I hesitate to call fiction and memoir because neither is wholly committed to realism or reality, undermine each other, with images and anecdotes reappearing in transmuted form. The shadow of the angry, manipulative ex-partner falls across both, challenging the narrator’s memories and intentions although, reassuringly, never inviting the reader’s distrust. Edie’s recounting of a transformative encounter with a dying, talking dog which speaks of the meaning of suffering (is “dog” a Möbius rendition of “God”?) is reprised when the narrator attends to a man lying on the street. In the first-person section, the narrator sees Matisse’s painting The Red Studio in New York’s Museum of Modern Art, “the red I imagine on the floor of an otherwise white room”, reflecting the blood pooling under a neighbour’s door that Edie and Marie in the novel section decide is probably “paint or something”. As the narrator comments: “Reality at large has never been my subject, but interiority always has been.”Lacey asks large questions about interiority, especially with regard to the subject of Christian faith. For some readers, it may be an alien idea that the sharply modern intellectual rigour on display here could be combined with religious conviction. How can a narrator who can play off Proust against Gillian Rose seriously expect to find consolation in the old myths about the baby in the manger and the man rising from death? It’s a question Lacey acknowledges, partly as unanswerable: “We want to speak of gnosis and mysticism without our phones listening to us and populating browser ad space with advertisements for Goddess Retreats and bogus supplements and acupuncture mats.” Even so, the narrator attempts an exorcism, employs an “energy healer”, is seduced by ideas about magic numbers. “Symbolism is both hollow and solid, a crutch, yes, but what’s so wrong with needing help to get around?”The question is not rhetorical. There’s a deep ambivalence in this book about needing literary and philosophical “help to get around”, about whether we’re allowed to want or need art, which is related to the narrator’s lack of appetite and consequent emaciation. “I was afraid of the line between basic needs and cravings, between living and lust.” The fear of slipping from necessity into pleasure shapes the distrust of fiction. What if storytelling is for fun? What if we don’t really need it? What if only what’s necessary is true, or only truth is necessary?Inevitably, the fictional half of this book refuses many of the satisfactions of a novel. Like a miniature homage to WG Sebald’sAusterlitz, the present action is mostly the recounting of past events, so that most of the characters, times and places appear only through a conversation between friends. There are complicated, triangular relationships in the background, between characters who never quite take shape, whose voices are only – and unreliably – recalled. Third-person narrative always calls into being a narrator, another layer of artifice, and here the slippage between present, past and past historic tenses also constantly reminds us that this story is at once engaging and not real. The questions are constant, implicit, teasing, elaborated rather than answered in the dark mirror of life writing. They don’t go away.

How I found my voice on a musical theatre retreatWith tuition from West End pros, this week-long singing break in southern Spain hits all the right notesTracey DaviesMon 2 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShare‘Do you prefer alto or soprano?” asks Steve Moss, poised at his electric piano. My mind goes blank. I’m usually more of a pinot grigio girl, but that’s not the answer the former musical director of Les Misérables is looking for. Although I struggle to carry a tune in a bucket, I’m an enthusiastic karaoke singer, a big musical theatre fan and a shameless show-off, so Sing the Greatest Showman, a residential singing retreat in Spain, is right up my street.Founded by Zane Rambaran, a veteran concert promoter with his roots in musical theatre, Sing Eat Retreat offers a choice of breaks here throughout the year (from Sing Les Mis to Sing Mamma Mia), with 30  hours of tuition by West End professionals. (In October, Sing The Sound of Music will be held in Salzburg too, with guests recording tracks in a studio and performing in the actual movie locations. I’ve already packed my dirndl.)View image in fullscreenOur base in Spain is Huerta Belinda, a gorgeous Spanish finca close to the surfing mecca of Tarifa, where we’ll have five days of one-to-one and small group sessions on vocal technique, acting through song and performance preparation. The villa has eight rooms and some of the 21-strong group (mostly women in their 40s and 50s – and 60-something Ray, the only man) stays in Mesón de Sancho, a charming hotel nearby, but all of us eat together.I’m no stranger to pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone, but staring at a musical score – all impenetrable squiggles to me – under the expectant gaze of a West End director, I think I’ve pushed it too far this time. As Steve, who has been musical director of Mary Poppins as well as Les Mis, takes us through the song This Is Me!, breaking it down into easy chunks, I struggle to follow the music and can’t decide which octave to sing in. I end up squalling up and down the bars like an angry seagull.I ask Steve if I’m a lost cause. “I don’t necessarily think that everyone can carry a tune, but I think everyone can improve,” he says, kindly. “People always leave the retreats a better musician in some way, whether it’s an improved singing voice or just learning to stand still when they’re performing.” Well, I can definitely stand still.All retreats induce a naturally bonding environment, but there’s something rather special about singing togetherAll retreats induce a naturally bonding environment, but there’s something rather special about singing together. Much of our group has choir or am-dram experience, while others – like me – are complete beginners, and about half have come alone. Prior to arrival, guests fill out a questionnaire about their singing ability, what they want to achieve, and a clip of them singing Happy Birthday so tutors can assess abilities and arrange groups, but all levels are welcome.Our group includes guests from Switzerland and Spain; sisters Trish and Janet from Ireland, who sing in a choir; Emma, a teacher from Cambridge who runs musical theatre groups; and Miracle, a self-proclaimed “nomad” who is on her fifth retreat here. One thing we all have in common is our love of musicals.Days start with breakfast in the villa, followed by a group warm up before we splinter off for workshops. The week is run along the same lines as preparation for a West End show, with vocal coaches, musical directors and choreographers. “In the first week of a new show we do vocal calls,” says Steve. “We start with note bashing, recording it on our phones and making notes on the music, then the cast can go off and practise. By the Friday we do a sing through of the show, have a sit through with the orchestra, then the directors and choreographers start working their magic.”View image in fullscreen‘A highlight of the retreat is a masterclass with Luke Bayer’ (in white), an actor and guest mentorPerformance practice is led by Maria Graciano, who appeared in Miss Saigon and Wicked! and was the resident choreographer for Moulin Rouge! The Musical. Vocal coach Zev Chaplain teaches us about the physiology of singing and importance of warming up our vocal cords with lip trills, owl hoots, and ho, ho, ho’s in the style of the Jolly Green Giant. One of the (many) highlights is a three-hour masterclass with Luke Bayer – who starred in Everybody’s Talking About Jamie and Rent in the West End – giving us priceless advice and feedback on our performances.Over the week, singers are picked out for solos – not me – and all of us can have a one-to-one session with a tutor.After dinner we chat over more wine, before someone inevitably fires up the karaoke machineThere are plenty of breaks – it’s a holiday after all – and this is where friendships blossom, with the contagious sounds of singing around the villa as people practise their scales. Any free time is spent by the pool, sunbathing in the gardens and soaking up the glorious views across the Strait of Gibraltar. There’s little opportunity to venture farther afield, but most guests arrive a day or two early to explore the beaches and sand dunes of Tarifa. If you ask Zane, he may take you along when he walks Charlie, his dog.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After dinner, we congregate in the lounge and chat over more wine, before someone inevitably fires up the karaoke machine.When I arrived at Huerta Belinda, I was tempted to sit at the back and mouth the songs, such was my lack of confidence in my singing ability. But as the week progresses, I find I enjoy singing more and want to belt the tunes out with the rest of them. Thanks to Zev, I learn to breathe properly and really notice an improvement in my vocals. Part of it is because I don’t want to let the rest of the group down. No one is coming into this half-heartedly; we want to put on The Greatest Show.It isn’t just me who finds her voice. Elinor from Barry, a hardcore musical theatre fan (she won the quiz), loved to sing but lost all confidence after being criticised at school. “This week has been life-changing for me. It’s given me back my voice,” she says.The crescendo of the week is a concert on Friday night, with a real audience. During the day, our nerves start to show as we rehearse. But come 8pm, as we step on stage and sing the first “whoahs” of The Greatest Show, they’re quickly replaced with dopamine as the altos, sopranos, and Ray the tenor – and all the soloists – bring their A-game. It feels incredible.Waiting in the wings before our final song, I look around at my new friends, hugging, laughing, congratulating each other on their performances. It’s been an incredible week both musically and emotionally. And it turns out I can hold a tune, after all. While it’s far (very far) from West End-worthy, it doesn’t make Charlie howl, which I’m taking as a win.The trip was provided bySing Eat Retreat.

Creamy, slightly tangy, savoury, full of roasted flavours and a little sweet, it’s the ideal dressing for absolutely anything. It comes in squeezy bottles and is now widely available in larger supermarkets, but I’ve created my own version here in case you can’t find it. These lettuce cups make a fresh and crunchy snack that serves as a vessel for tender chicken and whatever herbs you have in the fridge. But first, a Japanified rendition of the Chinese dish mapo tofu, only more savoury and salty, and with a slightly thicker sauce. It’s a strong contender for weekly dinner rotations, depending on what you have in your fridge, of course.Mabo nasu (spiced aubergines; pictured top)I love the combination of pork mince and aubergine, but this also works well with tofu. You can even make it vegetarian or vegan by omitting the meat and using tofu or vegan mince and substituting vegetable stock powder. It’s a little spicy, very savoury and super-saucy, so is perfect for topping steamed rice and eating with a spoon. Negi is a type of Japanese spring onion – if you can find them, use them instead of the spring onion. Doubanjiang, also called fermented chilli bean paste or spicy bean paste, is a fiery, savoury paste made from fermented broad beans. You can find it in Asian food stores and in many supermarkets.Prep15 minCook35 minServes41 tbsp neutral oil, such as rapeseed or sunflower, plus extra as needed100gpork mince4 small aubergines, or 100g firm tofu, cut into cubes1 garlic clove, peeled and finely grated2cmfresh root ginger,peeled and finely grated½ spring onion, or ½ negi,finely sliced1 tsp cornflour1 tsp toasted sesame oilSteamed rice, to serveFor the sauce1 tbsp brown miso1½ tbsp doubanjiang1 tsp soy sauce1 tsp sugar1 tsp powdered chicken stock, or vegetable stockFor the sauce, put the miso, doubanjiang, soy sauce, sugar and stock powder in a bowl, add 200ml water, mix well and set aside.Put the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the pork mince and cook, stirring to break it up, for about five minutes, until the fat has rendered out and the meat is browned and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a plate, leaving the oil behind in the pan. Add the aubergine to the pan (and a touch more oil, if need be) and cook gently, turning often, for six to eight minutes, until browned all over and meltingly tender.Return the pork to the pan, add the garlic and ginger, then cook, stirring gently so as not to break up the aubergines, for two to three minutes, until fragrant. Stir in the sauce mixture, leave to simmer for two to three minutes, then add the spring onion and cook for five minutes more, until the sauce has reduced.Mix the cornflour with two tablespoons of water and tip into the pan, mixing gently. Simmer for two to three minutes, until the sauce thickens, then stir in the sesame oil.Serve immediately alongside a pile of steamed rice.Tori no gomae (chicken cups with sesame dressing)View image in fullscreenMillie Tsukagoshi Lagares’tori no gomae, or chicken cups with sesame dressing.Photograph: Emma Guscott Photography/The Guardian. Food styling: Ellie Mulligan. Props styling: Louie Waller. Food styling assistant: Alice Earll.For the chicken, I’ve used a microwave for speed – you’ll be surprised at just how much moisture the meat retains when it’s cooked this way, and that it cooks in mere minutes. For those without a microwave, poach it instead, or use leftover roast or rotisserie chicken.Prep10 minCook20 minServes2 as a snack100gchicken breastPinch of salt1 tbsp sake½ cucumber, julienned1 tbsp gari(pickled ginger), or peeled and very finely sliced fresh root ginger1butterhead lettuceFor the dressing2 tbsp mayonnaise1½ tbsp toasted sesame seeds,plus extra to serve1 tsp neutral oil, such as rapeseed or sunflower1 tsp apple cider vinegar1 tsp soy sauce1 tsp sugar1 tbsp waterTo serve (all optional)1 handfulfresh coriander leaves, or other herbs, roughly chopped2 spring onions, finely slicedSlice the chicken lengthways into two long strips and put these on a microwave-safe plate. Season with the salt and sake, then cover with clingfilm and microwave at 160W for two and a half to three minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the microwave and, once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with a fork.Combine all the dressing ingredients in a bowl and whisk. (This will make more dressing than you need here, but it keeps well in the fridge for a few days, so enjoy the rest with just about any salad.)Mix the shredded chicken with three to four tablespoons of the dressing, the cucumber and ginger. Separate the lettuce into leaves to make cups and fill them with the chicken mixture. Serve topped with coriander, spring onions and extra toasted sesame seeds, if you like.These recipes are edited extracts from Umai: Recipes From a Japanese Home Kitchen, by Millie Tsukagoshi Lagares, published by Quadrille at £27.

I would eat them by themselves standing up at the cooker, but when they’re draped with a little smoked trout, creme fraiche and dill, and served alongside a light salad, they make for an elegant dinner for two. Some shaved fennel (with its frilly leaves) in a lemony dressing wouldn’t go amiss here, either.Smoked trout and crispy potato cakes with capers, caraway and dillPrep15 minCook10 minServes2400gwaxy potatoes(I like alouette)1tsp flaky sea salt5tsp capers-3 tsp roughly chopped, the rest finely chopped1tspfresh dill,chopped, plus extra to garnish5 heapedtbsp full-fat creme fraiche½ tsp caraway seeds1 mediumegg1tbsp olive oil1tsp butter100g smoked troutJuice of ½ lemonGreen salad, to serve (optional)Wash the potatoes, but don’t bother peeling them. Now’s the time to use the grating attachment on your food processor, which will grate the potatoes in seconds; otherwise do so by hand. Tip the grated potatoes into a bowl with the sea salt, mix well, then leave to sit for five minutes.Meanwhile, mix the roughly chopped capers, dill and creme fraiche in a small bowl, and set aside.Tip the potatoes on to a clean tea towel, then wrap and twist it over the sink to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Return the potatoes to the bowl, and stir in the caraway seeds, finely chopped capers and egg.Heat half the olive oil and half the butter in a large frying pan. When the butter starts foaming, add heaped tablespoons of the potato mixture, flattening each to about 1cm-thick and the size of a jam-jar lid (you will most likely need to fry them in batches – I can fit five in my largest pan). Fry on a medium heat for three minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown all over, adding the remaining oil and butter to the pan as needed. Transfer the cooked potato cakes to a plate lined with kitchen paper, and keep warm in a low oven if need be.Serve the potato cakes topped with the creme fraiche mixture, and divide the smoked trout equally between them. Squeeze over a little lemon juice, garnish with dill, and serve hot with a green salad alongside, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyFishSeafoodPotatoesMain courseVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
