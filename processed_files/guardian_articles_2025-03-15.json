I thought [it] would not be regarded as very fair. What I did try to do was reform Pip.”Balls, who is married to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, infuriated Downing Street by saying on the same podcast that the plan would not work if its aim was to get more people back into work, adding that “it’s not aLabourthing to do”.At a tense cabinet meeting last Tuesday, several serving members raised their concerns about how the Labour government would be viewed if it froze Pip and made it more difficult to receive payments.Any plan to freeze Pip or change ­eligibility rules would require ­primary legislation, running the risk that they could become the focus of a sizeable Labour rebellion in the Commons and the Lords. Several Labour MPs have made it clear to theObserverthat they could not support the plans in any parliamentary vote.View image in fullscreenWork and pensions ­secretary Liz Kendall said protecting people in ­need was a principle Labour would not compromise on.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/ShutterstockSpeaking to theObserver,Liz Kendall, the work and pensions ­secretary, insisted that Labour was sympathetic to those unable to work because of disability.“I know as a constituency MP for 14 long years under the Tories that there will always be some ­people who cannot work because of the severity of their disability or health condition,” she said. “Protecting people in ­genuine need is a principle Labour will never compromise on.”But she also insisted that the ­system badly needed reform to ensure that people did not spend a lifetime on benefits and to prevent the overall benefits bill from soaring even higher. “Being trapped on benefits if you can work is terrible for people’s ­living standards, health and opportunities,” Kendall said.She added: “It’s terrible for the country too, as spending on the costs of failure soar. The sickness and ­disability bill for working age ­people has increased by £20bn since the ­pandemic, with a further £18bn rise to £70bn projected over the next five years.We must fix this broken system for the people who depend on it and the country as a whole.”In a further measure to placate ­furious Labour MPs, sources said Kendall would move to legislate to create “a right to try” guarantee to ensure sick and disabled people could take a job safe in the knowledge that they would not be forced to undergo a new reassessment and the possibility of losing their benefits as a result.‘How can I not charge my wheelchair?’ The real effects of benefit cuts for millions of disabled peopleRead moreOne million people would see their benefits reduced under the government’s ­proposed reforms, according to theTimes.The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that it would be the biggest cut to disability benefits since the Office for Budget Responsibility was created in 2010.Ministers are said to be examining changing eligibility for Pip in such a way that it would not be available for people who need someone else to help them wash below the waist, or need to be reminded to go to the toilet to prevent them having an accident.The new rules would, in effect, mean that only the most severely ­disabled would receive Pip, while those with mental health conditions would not.Ministers are also planning to scrap the work capability assessment, which is used to decide if people receiving universal credit are fit for work. It is separate from Pip, which is intended to help cover the extra costs of being disabled, whether or not they can work.About 4.8 million people receive Pip or the benefit it was designed to replace, the disability living allowance.Campaigners say the problem ­facing disabled people is that even those who are desperate to return to the workforce find they cannot cope, or employers are not willing to accommodate them.A government programme that supported 286,000 disabled people over the past seven years who wanted to find work was only able to secure jobs for one in five.View image in fullscreenFormer shadow chancellor Ed Balls criticised the proposed welfare cuts for disabled people as ‘not a Labour thing to do’.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/ShutterstockAnna Stevenson, a benefits expert at the disability charity Turn2us, said: “These were people who, although they were unwell, thought they were probably well enough to work and really keen to work.”Stevenson said that if the ­government was serious about helping more disabled people into work, it needed to change employment law.“If you want very high employment among disabled people, one of the things you need to change is how easy it is for employers to fire people when they’re ill. But that has the potential to ­distort the labour market. There are always trade-offs.”In the 1970s, employers would put workers on “light duties” if they were unable to do harder, physical jobs, but that practice has all but vanished, leaving disabled people to rely on the state instead.“We have a duty to get the welfare bill on a more sustainable path and we will achieve that through meaningful, principled reforms rather than arbitrary cuts to spending.“That why as part of our Plan for Change we will bring forward our proposals for reform shortly that will unlock work to help us reach our ambition of an 80% employment rate, and is fairer to all.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsThe ObserverDisabilityWelfareKeir StarmerWork & careersPodcastsEd BallsnewsShareReuse this content"

They want to improve their situation on the battlefield,” Zelenskyy told a group of journalists in a briefing at the presidential administration.He said Ukraine had shown its willingness to agree toUS proposals for a temporary ceasefireduring which terms for a more lasting deal could be discussed, as agreed last week at talks in Saudi Arabia.“Today, Putin is the one who doesn’t agree with what [Donald] Trump has proposed,” he said.Zelenskyy said Russia’s attempts to impose conditions on a ceasefire should be rejected out of hand.“This is a ceasefire for 30 days; it’s not for ever, it’s 30 days, during which all sides have the chance to demonstrate their willingness to end the war,” he said.Although it is clear that any potential agreement would probably require Ukraine to accept de facto Russian control of some Ukrainian land, he ruled out formally ceding any territory to Russia.0:50Volodymyr Zelenskyy says territory issue is 'complicated' – video“Our position is that we do not recognise the occupied Ukrainian territories as Russian in any case,” he said. Zelenskyy called the territorial issue complex and said it should be “resolved later, at the negotiating table”.Trump’s right, Putin can take the hard or easy way on Ukraine. He has to prove he wants peace | David LammyRead moreWriting in theObserver, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, also taunted Putin, saying he had been put on the spot by Ukraine’s agreement to a ceasefire and the moves, led by the US president, Donald Trump, to end the conflict.“The proposal for a ceasefire is therefore a test. He can’t simply say he is ready to end this war – he has to prove it.”Lammy, who attended a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada last week, said the group of nations known as the “coalition of the willing” was determined to create the conditions “that guarantee that Russia does not come back for more”.Referring to the security guarantee that these nations plan to offer, Lammy added: “To be credible, it needs US support. But Britain and our allies recognise that the bulk of the contribution must come from Europeans.”Asked about whether he discussed seizing Russian assets with his counterparts, Starmer said it had been on the agenda but added it was “a complicated question”.Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine launched drone attacks overnight, each reporting more than 100 enemy drones entering their respective airspaces.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverUkraineRussiaEuropeEmmanuel MacronVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Theorganizations chargethat the Trump administrationunlawfully invokedthe Alien Enemies Act.In the lawsuit, ACLU and Democracy Forward argued the act has been invoked only three times in the history of the US: the war of 1812, first world war and second world war.“It cannot be used here against nationals of a country – Venezuela – with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States,” the lawsuit stated.“The government’s proclamation would allow agents to immediately put noncitizens on planes without any review of any aspect of the determination that they are alien enemies,” the lawsuit added.At remote hearing before Boasberg, both ACLU and Democracy Forwardaskedthat the temporary restraining order be broadened to everyone in danger of removal under the act, the civil liberties organizations said.The president had previouslyorderedhis administration to designate Venezuela’s Tren De Aragua gang as a foreign terrorist organization.With Trump characterizing the gang as a foreign force that is invading the US, civil liberties organizations such as the ACLUfearedTrump would invoke the 1798 act “unlawfully during peacetime to accelerate mass deportations, sidestepping the limits of this wartime authority and the procedures and protections in immigration law.”The 227-year-old law is designed to primarily be used in wartime, and only Congress has the authority to declare a war. But the president does have the discretion to invoke the law to defend against a “threatened or ongoing invasion or predatory incursion”, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan authority on law and policy.“This law shouldn’t be invoked because migration is not an invasion, and we’re not in a war time,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, the deputy director of federal advocacy for United We Dream, an immigrant rights organization. “It’s extremely horrifying that we, as immigrants, are being labeled as terrorists, as invaders.”Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act could be deported without a court hearing or asylum interview, and their cases would be governed by wartime authority rather than by immigration law.The Alien Enemies Act specifically allows the president to detain, relocate, or deport immigrants based on their country of ancestry – and crucially covers not only citizens of hostile nations but also “natives”, which could include people who may have renounced their foreign citizenship and sought legal residency in the US.The centuries-old law was also used to arrest more than 31,000 people – mostly people of Japanese, German and Italian ancestry – as “alien enemies” during the second world war, and played a role in the mass removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during the war.Trump has been building his case for invoking the act for years by characterizing the influx of migrants at the southern border as an “invasion”. He also previewed his invocation in an executive order on his inauguration day, directing the secretaries of state to plan by preparing facilities “necessary to expedite the removal” of those subject to the act.“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil, including our cities and inner cities,” he said in hisinaugural address.Though anti-immigrant politicians and groups have long advocated for the use of the act in response to unlawful border crossings, Macedo do Nascimento said a number of executive orders and congressional policies have already broadened the federal government’s authorities to detain and deport immigrants.“There are already laws that allow for mass detention. There are already laws, like the Laiken Riley Act, that would broaden the dragnet of people who can be detained,” Macedo do Nascimento said. “So the idea of him invoking the Alien Enemies Act feels kind of needless. To me, it is really about building the narrative to label immigrants as terrorists.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

England may have done all they could to put France under some pressure – and Scotland went on to exert a bit more, testing France as few others can – butLes Bleuscan play rugby any which way. They ran through the full gamut in the third quarter, blasting and slashing Scotland with equal facility to take the game away from the visitors and the championship from everyone else.They are worth it and then some. The Stade de France rang out euphorically, as its darlings returned home after three matches on the road.It was the first of those– in London – that cost France the grand slam they were surely good for. Carelessness blighted their every genius move against England that day, and we wondered if they had it in them, despite it all. But they have been unplayable since and claim a first title since 2022.France 35-16 Scotland: Six Nations 2025 – live reactionRead moreRecords were collected along the way. Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored his eighth try of thisSix Nations, a record. France surpassed the 29 tries England scored in 2001 to set a collective try-scoring record too.Scotland were the perfect foils. These two have been the best teams to watch this championship. Scotland lack France’s power but they can weave all the same patterns – and here they did again. France looked rattled for around 45 minutes. England dared to dream. A lot of the old questions regarding their temperament bubbled up for a few minutes, only to be answered in such decisive fashion.That France went in at the break ahead owed as much to the grace of the gods as it did to their own prowess. Scotland thought they had scored their second try, the game’s third, on the stroke of half-time. A brilliant counter by the full-back of the tournament, Blair Kinghorn, set up the position from which Finn Russell, in his best matador form, switched play to the right to put over Tom Jordan.That would have earned Scotland an 18-16 lead, with the conversion to come, but the television match official advised the referee that Kinghorn’s elbow had clipped the touchline as he offloaded. The try was chalked off without further consultation, and France retained their narrow lead.View image in fullscreenDave Cherry and Peato Mauvaka clash after the France hooker was only given a yellow card following an incident with Ben White.Photograph: Dave Winter/Inpho/ShutterstockMore fortune had come their way earlier in the half, when Peato Mauvaka was sent to the sin-bin for a bunker review of the gratuitous way he lashed out at Ben White with the ball dead. Mauvaka had not looked as if he were trying to head-butt White, but his head did clip the Scotland scrum-half, whose reaction was disappointinglyde trop. The card stayed at yellow, because the incident was not high danger – but certainly his action represented a glaring lapse of discipline. As such, it was more deserving of a red card than every other red card we have seen this championship.France had a real match on their hands. They started with confidence, coaxing a yellow card for Jamie Ritchie, who was sent to the bin early for dragging down an advancing lineout and drive. France capitalised a few minutes later, when Thomas Ramos turned the ball inside to Gaël Fickou, who sent Yoram Moefana to the line to open up a 10-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scotland’s deadly winger hared between multiple pairs of clutching hands to the line.Russell levelled with five minutes to half-time, when he landed his second penalty. Jean-Baptiste Gros received yellow this time for a high tackle during more inventive Scottish attack. But Ramos converted his third penalty with two to go for the lead that Jordan’s disallowed try would not overturn.France made their move in the third quarter. First by the rapier – albeit thrust into their hand by the opposition – and then by the bludgeon.View image in fullscreenLouis Bielle-Biarrey scores France’s second try.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/ReutersScotland came out of the break looking as dangerous as ever, when Russell and Graham tried one switch too many. The ball went to floor, and Romain Ntamack was way. Bielle-Biarrey, who else, appeared on his shoulder to run the ball home for his Six Nations record.So much for the rapier. In the few minutes that followed, on came six of the seven forwards France keep on their bench. On came enormous pressure.France sent a penalty to touch and drove deep into Scotland’s 22. After the next penalty went to the right corner, those forwards drove to the brink, before allowing the rapier-types thecoup de grace. Damian Penaud’s pass found Ramos and France’s full-back added a try to all those other points he has been accruing for a record of his own. Here he passed Frédéric Michalak as France’s top point-scorer.More pertinently, France suddenly had a 14-point lead, which became more or less unassailable when Bielle-Biarrey’s footwork paved the way for a second try for Moefana, France’s fourth. That was the bonus point sewn up.

It comes as the counciltries to buy up housing around Liverpoolto relocate homeless families there.Councils have legal obligations to support and rehouse homeless people, but they can terminate these duties if a household refuses a “reasonable” offer of housing.That offer must be affordable, but councils havemore leeway around location, and the housing affordability crisis in London and other high-demand areas has seen large numbers of homeless people relocated around the country.Enfield has recently taken a particularly aggressive approach. A reportpublished last yearby Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth (HASL) found that 94% of Enfield council’s offers of private rented housing to homeless people in 2023 were outside the capital, with 59% in the north-east. Perhaps as a result, three-quarters of their offers were rejected, the highest refusal rate of any London council.“It’s outrageous,” Enfield-based housing and union activist Paul Kershaw told theObserver. “These are people who are going to have families – they can be vulnerable, and as far as the council is concerned, they’re just being ripped away from their social connections and sent to totally inappropriate locations.”“You have families here with kids and everything, and what happens is that all your community networks break down,” added Charith Gunawardena, a former Enfield councillor who defected from Labour to the Greens, partly because of dissatisfaction with the council’s housing policies.“If you just move people to the north, where they have no community links or never lived in these areas, they have a house but everything else is broken down.”The rising costs of temporary accommodation for homeless ­people have squeezed Enfield’s finances, triggering a reaction from council bosses.At a council meeting in September 2023, Enfield council’s housing improvement director, Duane Dyer, said it would take a stricter approach to homeless households, allowing them fewer choices of alternative housing. “We are going to enforce our policy hardline,”he told the meeting. “I think the weakness is that we have not been as hardline as we should have been.”“I was horrified that they could possibly imagine they weren’t being hard enough on people who are desperate,” said Matt Burn of campaign group Better Homes Enfield. “We have a very significant problem in terms of our homelessness numbers. It comes largely from the housing benefit cap – ­[people] simply can’t afford private rents, and housing benefit doesn’t cover it.“Sooner or later, they’re issued with an eviction notice, and they then present themselves to the council as on the verge of homelessness.”London councils buy £140m of property to move homeless people out of cityRead morePart of the problem is that, for a long time, more expensive inner London boroughs with their own housing crises have relocated their homeless households to Enfield, leading to a rise in rents and using up housing stock that Enfield might otherwise have used for its own homeless people.But Enfield has also failed to build enough social housing. Its troubled Meridian Water regeneration scheme initially had no socially rented homes planned for the first two phases, though the council told theObserverthis position has changed and social housing is now part of the programme.An Enfield council spokesperson said: “To ensure that residents have access to secure, long-term and ­stable homes, we have taken the ­difficult but necessary decision adopted by other London local authorities to look into the possibility of buying a small number of residential properties in more affordable areas.“Where possible, we continue to seek housing solutions closer to Enfield. We’re focused on building homes. We will continue to work with the government to address our housing needs.”Explore more on these topicsHousingThe ObserverLocal governmentLondon politicsCommunitiesPovertyLondonSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Thedemonstrations against government corruptionand incompetence have so far been overwhelmingly peaceful.Hundreds of government supporters, mostly black-clad young men wearing baseball caps, many with matching black backpacks, gathered in Belgrade’s Pionirski Park, opposite the Serbian parliament, one of the focal points of the demonstration. Local reports suggested there were members of organised football hooligan groups among them, as well as veterans of the Red Berets special forces unit implicated in the 2003 assassination of Serbia’s liberal prime minister Zoran Djindjić.A thick cordon of police ringed the assembly building and separated the Vučić supporters from the protesters, who also gathered in front of a stage set up in nearby Slavija Square.View image in fullscreenRiot police cordon off the area near the parliament building in Belgrade.Photograph: Armin Durgut/APIn the mid-afternoon, protesters close to the state broadcasting headquarters in central Belgrade were told by police to move as there was a threat of an attack by a pro-government mob.Intercity trains had been cancelled for the day in what the state railway company said was a security measure for passenger safety but which was widely seen as an attempt by Vučić to limit the size of the protests. Some city transport services were also suspended in the capital. But long convoys of cars converged on Belgrade from across the country, flying national flags and banners in support of the student cause.In the roads leading into the city, scores of tractors joined the procession, signalling farmers’ support for the protest movement, as well as hundreds of bikers, riding into town in a phalanx.The European Union and the United Nations both appealed to the government ahead of the rally to respect the right to demonstrate. Western governments have been hesitant in their approach to the protests over the past four months, partly out of a desire to cultivate good relations with Vučić in the hope of luring him away from Moscow’s orbit.Vučić has cultivated Donald Trump, approving the construction of a Trump hotel in Belgrade, and on Thursday gave an interview to the US president’s son Don Jr, who echoed the Serbian government’s unsubstantiated claims that the protest movement was fuelled by foreign funding.The younger Trump suggested the protests had been “weaponised … to incite, potentially, a revolution”, airing conspiracy theories about how the protests were organised and paid for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Public outrage was fuelled by an apparent attempt by government officials to cover up unsafe construction methods and potential corruption in the Chinese-led refurbishment.The demonstrations have been led by students who have focused on demands for better governance and for state institutions to provide the services they are supposed to, without the need for bribes or personal connections.The students, who make collective decisions rather than elect a leadership,have kept their distancefrom opposition parties, which they blame for being complicit in the atrophy and cynicism of the public sector.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaThe ObserverEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy.”NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it wasestablished to cut down on political interference in the NHS– something Streeting described as an act of “backside-covering” to avoid blame for failures.1:31'We are abolishing biggest quango in the world': Wes Streeting welcomes end of NHS England – videoBut on Thursday, Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid “duplication”.In his Sunday Telegraph article, Streeting suggested more was to come, saying the new NHS England chair, Penny Dash, had “identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration”.The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Streeting, who in January said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS.He told the Health Service Journal he could spend “a hell of a lot of time” on reorganisation “and not make a single difference to the patient interest”, saying instead he would focus on trying to “eliminate waste and duplication”.But in the Telegraph article, Streeting said he had heard former Conservative health ministers “bemoan” not abolishing NHS England, adding: “If we hadn’t acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn’t have been possible.”The government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save “hundreds of millions of pounds” that can be spent on frontline services.But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.The Guardian reported on Friday that the jobs cull from the government’s radical restructuring of the NHS will be at least twice as big as previously thought.The staff shakeout caused by NHS England’s abolition and unprecedented cost-cutting elsewhere will mean the number of lost posts will soarfrom the 10,000 expected to between 20,000 and 30,000.Manythousands more people who work for the NHS’s 42 integrated care boards (ICBs) in England will see their roles axed, as well as the 10,000 working for NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) who have already been earmarked to go.ICBs, regional health service bodies which oversee groupings ofNHStrusts, employ 25,000 people between them.Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingLabourHealthPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home.“It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler county, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.”In Arkansas, three storm-related deaths have been confirmed in Independence county with an additional 29 people injured in eight counties,according tothe Arkansas division of emergency management on Saturday morning.Three people were killed on Friday in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo county in theTexaspanhandle, according to Sgt Cindy Barkley of the state’s department of public safety. One pileup involved an estimated 38 cars.“It’s the worst I’ve ever seen,” Barkley said, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. “We couldn’t tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.”This morning's (March 15) visible@NOAASatellitesimagery shows the deep low pressure system centered in Minnesota/Wisconsin.

Grenada county has been hit the hardest, Reeves said. A shelter has opened up in the Grenada City auditorium for those in search of refuge.At least 26 tornadoes were reported but not confirmed to have touched down late on Friday night and early on Saturday as a low pressure system drove powerful thunderstorms across parts of Arkansas, Illinois,Mississippiand Missouri, said David Roth, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center.“Today there is a high risk for more tornadoes acrossAlabamaand Mississippi, the chance is 30%,” he said. “That’s pretty significant.”As the storms regain strength, the highest possible risk of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms was on Saturday night, forecasters said.The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings early on Saturday morning for areas in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi,Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana and Texas.The agency has warned residents not to seek refuge in vehicles outside or under overpasses, as well as not to seek shelter under trees. Instead, it urged residents to get off the road and drive to a designated shelter, basement or safe room. The next best option for shelter is a small, windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor of a sturdy building, according to the agency.Extreme weather and powerful winds predicted for 100 million AmericansRead moreEvacuations were ordered in someOklahomacommunities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The state patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.Forecasters said the severe storm threat would continue into the weekend with a high chance of tornadoes and damaging winds on Saturday in Mississippi and Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the east coast on Sunday.Experts say it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.“What’s unique about this one is its large size and intensity,” said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. “And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.”The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the Saint Louis area. Several buildings were damaged.The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph (160km/h) possible.“Potentially violent” tornadoes were expected on Saturday in parts of the central Gulf coast and deep south into the Tennessee valley, according to the National Weather Service.The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida panhandle.Wildfires in the southern plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered on Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.A blaze in Roberts county, Texas, north-east of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 sq km) to an estimated 32.8 sq miles (85 sq km), the Texas A&M University forest service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening.About 60 miles (90km) to the south, another fire grew to about 4 sq miles (10 sq km) before its advance was halted in the afternoon.High winds also knocked out power to more than 300,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma,Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according the website poweroutage.us.The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far easternSouth Dakotastarting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in (7.6-15.2cm) were expected, with up to a foot (30cm) possible.Winds gusting to 60mph (97km/h) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherTexasMinnesotaSouth DakotaMissouriTornadoesAlabamanewsShareReuse this content"

And in an interview with the Guardian, Tsai said: “I hope his involvement with [Doge] is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses.”The chief investment officer and president of Tsai Capital, which reportedly manages a portfolio of about $137m, made it a point to say that his stated hope does not constitute a loss of faith in Musk or his company’s earning potential, despite opinion polls establishing the Tesla boss’s unpopularity with the American public and his net worth evidentlytumblingabout $23bn in recent days.Tsai said the stock markets also reacted negatively when Musk bought Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, in 2022 for $44bn. Yet he said Tsai Capital – which holds about 75,000 shares inTeslaas of its most recent quarterly filings – had made more than six times its money since first investing in the company in February 2020, even with the downturn in performance of late.A president touting Musk’s cars from the White House shows this: the Tesla boycott really irks him | Gaby HinsliffRead moreTsai recently told his investors ina letterthat his firm considers Tesla to be more of a creator of advanced electronics and software that it attaches to cars rather than a traditional automotive manufacturer and he insisted that the EV maker remained “on a path to become one of the most valuable companies on the planet”.Nonetheless, he said “the market … reacting unfavorably to Elon Musk’s recent involvement in politics” was real. And though he said he thought Musk’s self-professed belief that government reforms are needed was genuine, Tsai expressed a hope that the Tesla boss’s role in Doge ultimately proved to be like other temporary commitments he had previously taken on.Tsai’s comments on what is his firm’s largest holding come at a time when Musk – who prominently supported Trump’s successful run for a second presidency – has advised the White House on the widespread firings of government employees and the dismantling of various services. Those services include US humanitarian aid and development work, with experts warning that their elimination could have life-threatening consequences.If a CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS is any indication, such measures have not gone over well with the public. Thesurveyshowed 53% of Americans disapproved of Musk, and 35% approved – leaving him about 18 points underwater.Those results werereleasedon Wednesday, two days after Tesla’s stock fell more than 15% amid public protests against the company and vandalism reported at some of the brand’s dealerships.Tsai’s descent from a lineage of legendary investors sets his voice apart from some of the others who have weighed in on Musk, Doge and Tesla at the two-month mark of the second Trump presidency.His paternal grandmother was Ruth Tsai, who became the first woman to trade on the floor of the stock exchange in Shanghai, China, in 1939 during the second world war. Her earnings helped her send her son – Tsai’s father, Gerald – to college in the US, where he ultimately settled and made a name for himself as a financier and fund manager.Gerald Tsai Jr also eventually became the chief executive officer of the financial services giant Primerica, which – along with its subsidiary Commercial Credit Group – helped build Citigroup, as the New York Times hasreported.A notable aspect of Tsai’s trajectory was his father’s acquaintance with Trump when the latter was primarily a real estate mogul in Manhattan. The families were close enough that, in his youth, Tsai considered Donald Trump Jr his best friend, vacationing with him and once going to a baseball game with his siblings, their mother and their father.Tsai said the younger Trump was one of the first people to whom he came out as a gay man, doing so before he did to Gerald. “That’s cool,” Tsai recalled Trump Jr telling him, while he said Gerald took a longer time to accept it.A registered Democrat, Tsai said he had not had “a meaningful conversation with any member of” the president’s family since a lunch with Donald Jr in January 2014 – more than two years before Trump Sr clinched the Republican White House nomination and won his first presidency. Tsai said they just “went in different directions” as the Trumps moved into politics, and their family patriarch aligned himself closely with Musk as he clinched the White House a second time in November’s election.Meanwhile, the elder Tsai, who married and divorced four times and once survived crashing in a helicopter into New York’s Hudson River before his death in 2008, did not pass on much of his larger-than-life personality to Christopher.The younger Tsai for instance has been married to his spouse – with whom he is raising teenaged twins – since 2005.But, as Christopher put it, Gerald Tsai Jr did teach him to learn about – and love – trading stocks in his childhood. He began investing at 12 and started his capital firm in 1997 at age 22.Tsai said some of the principles to which he adheres – whether as a philanthropic donor to artistic as well as environmental causes – were inherited from the first Chinese American to be CEO of a Dow Jones Industrial company.“My father would say you have to do deep work in order to figure out where value is and to uncover great situations,” Tsai said. “Our job as investors is to figure out what’s real, what’s not real, what that’s worth, what’s priced into the stock and where the company’s valuation is going.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

We have entries who suffered hair loss and very serious skin conditions that led them to create their own treatments which they later started to sell.“All these people went on to build successful beauty brands making products people love, creating jobs, contributing decent sums to the public finances and of course making many of us look and feel a lot better along the way.”Phoebe McDowell, beauty and interiors director of the Sunday Times, said: “Beauty is big business, and this inaugural list demonstrates the power of creativity and innovation in the sector.

Others have demanded money back from restaurant gift vouchers.While being careful to discriminate between constructive and destructive criticism, Sheridan has now had enough.“Everyone is a restaurant critic now and online reviews have given them a mass audience to vent if their personal preferences haven’t been met, regardless of whether that’s fair.“I recently asked customers to get out halfway through their meal,” said Sheridan, who added his attitude changed last year after beingblackmailedby criminals who threatened to flood his restaurants’ online listings with fake one-star reviews until Sheridan paid thousands of pounds.“They arrived complaining that the location of the restaurant wasn’t right on Google Maps, which it is,” he said. “Then they complained about the lighting, then the style of the plates and then the food.”Sheridan is now unmoved by threats to post bad reviews. “Five years ago, chefs used to be really worried when people wrote bad reviews, but now chefs are increasingly saying that the customer isn’t always right,” he said.“I respond to every unfair, bad online review, explaining why it’s unreasonable.”Sheridan is supportive of Chris D’Sylva, the owner of the renowned Notting Hill bistroDorian, who this week said he was so tired of complaining customers that he now reviews them.“Everything gets marked,” D’Sylva said. “Good behaviours and not favourable behaviours get noted on the … tiered system whereby we rank how much we like the customer and the value of the customer, or the destructiveness of the customer.”View image in fullscreenMichelin star chef Ben Murphy says rising prices have been a factor for why customers expect freebies from restaurantsPhotograph: Mark Parren TaylorBen Murphy, the Michelin star chef who won National Chef of the Year, believes the “bond of trust” has broken between restaurants and their customers: “You don’t hear that thing about the customer always being right any more,” he said. “There has definitely been a change in the dynamics.”Murphy reevaluated the “customer is always right” maxim after a customer slipped clingfilm on to her plate and demanded to be given her meal for free.“We were really apologetic and had no choice but to comp her entire meal but something didn’t feel right,” said Murphy. “That night, I spent two hours watching the CCTV of her meal and saw her taking the clingfilm out of her bag.“I’ve also had a customer blaming me for food poisoning, which also turned out to be completely false,” he added.Murphy said rising prices had proved a tipping point. “There’s definitely been a corresponding rise in customers trying to get freebies,” he said.Stefan Chomka, the editor of the Restaurant magazine, agreed that the bond of trust has been strained by the rise of social media reviewing platforms.“The balance of power has shifted towards customers, who can now publicly voice their opinions, which can be both beneficial and damaging for businesses,” he said. “But chefs are pushing back against false negative reviews, especially during these tough economic times.”Chomka added that the balance of power had got out of kilter: “Until fairly recently, chefs often had a ‘my way or the highway’ attitude towards customers: not letting customers use salt and pepper, not accepting dietary requirements,” he said. “High-end dining rooms often maintained a strict hierarchy where customers were treated as inferior.”Oisin Rogers, the landlord of The Devonshire in Soho in London, however, still sticks to the “customer is always right” adage. “I absolutely do because if you start off with the vibe of, ‘You’ve got to work within our rules, and we don’t like it if you do this or that’, you’re not going to make people feel wonderful, are you?” he said.“If customers complain, we have to understand that sometimes people have bad days, and sometimes people don’t understand what you’re doing – and that’s totally their prerogative because they’re already investing their time and their precious money in coming to to see us.“Essentially, it’s way better to be optimistic and occasionally wrong than to be pessimistic and sometimes correct.”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsChefsWalesFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Militants dragged him outside, threw him to the ground and started shooting right above his head, making it so he could no longer hear the insults they lobbed at him for being a member of the country’s minority Islamic Alawite sect.Hayan was lucky – they chose merely to scare not kill him – but by the time the rampage finally ended, 25 residents of the Alawite town of Salhab, northwestSyria, were dead. They included a 90-year-old local religious figure whom militants killed after forcing him to watch them murder his son.Such massacres had become a feature of Syria’s 14-year civil war, but Salhab’s violence last week took place during some of the country’s deadliest days since the beginning of the war itself. Besides the high death toll, what marked these killings as different — and a dark omen for the country’s future — is that many were carried out by militants nominally a part of the new Syrian army created by the country’s new president.The massacresbrought into question the ability of Syria’s government to control its ranks and the challenges of reining in the patchwork of militias that currently control the country.Fighting startedwhen fighters loyal to ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad launched a coordinated attack on Syrian government forces across the country’s coast on 6 March, prompting the government to call for help. Thousands of armed individuals and several rebel groups answered the call. The incensed militias and crowds carried out a wave of revenge attacks against members of Syria’s Alawite community, the same sect from which Assad hailed, though most had nothing to do with the former regime. Massacres in most Alawite villages ensued.View image in fullscreenSyrian security forces guard a checkpoint a day after clashes with supporters of the former regime in Latakia.Photograph: Mohamad Daboul/EPAIn total, the four days of fighting left more than 1,000 people dead, including 745 civilians, many of whom were killed in revenge attacks targeting the sect. In addition, Assad loyalists killed 211 members of the Syrian security forces and 228 civilians.Experts have pointed to two factions, Abu Amsha’s Sultan Suleiman Shah brigade and the Hamzat division, as being responsible for the bulk of killing of civilians and unarmed prisoners during the explosion of violence on Syria’s coast last week. Both rebel groups were previously affiliated with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. Both factions and their leaders are under US sanctions for alleged serious human rights abuses, including rape and torture.Abu Amsha said in aposton x that his division adhered to orders from Syria’s ministry of defence and said that news of their participation in massacres was “propaganda.” He added that every member of his faction are “subject to the law and accountability.”“The vast majority of the violations were committed by Abu Amsha’s [faction] and Hamzat. Lots of residents were asking government security forces to defend them from those factions,” said Fadel Abdulghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR).Along with dozens of other armed groups, the two factions have only recently been integrated into Syria’s new army, led by the now-disbanded Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).HTS, the leader of the rebel coalition which ousted the Assad regime on 8 December, dissolved all armed factions in the country, including itself, and announced they would be integrated into the new Syrian army.In practice, however, the government has struggled to integrate military factions and exercises limited control over them.View image in fullscreenSyrian soldiers in Qardaha, the birthplace of Bashar al-Assad.Photograph: Ahmad Fallaha/EPA“Currently it appears that the integration of SNA factions into the ministry of defence has only occurred at a symbolic level,” said Alexander McKeever, researcher and author of a weekly newsletter on northern Syria. “The institutional ties are weak so HTS’s tools in terms of cracking down are limited,” he added.Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has promised that all those who killed or abused civilians on Syria’s coast last week will be held accountable, even if they are allies of HTS.“We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain. No one will be above the law,” Sharaa said.It’s unclear if Sharaa can indeed hold accountable some of the very same factions who helped bring him to power, for fear of alienating militias who could provoke instability or even conflict in Syria. If he does not punish those militias who massacred civilians, he will alienate many citizens of Syria, who would be reminded of regime figures slaughtering their countrymen with impunity.The slaughter of civilians on Syria’s coast has also given the international community pause about lifting sanctions. Syria has been under US sanctions since 1979, which intensified after the Assad regime’s brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011.Syria’s new authorities have made the lifting of sanctions one of its top priorities, to help its ailing economy and allow it to build a functional state with a professional army.The killing of Alawite civilians deeply disturbed evangelical members of the Trump White House, who viewed the protection of Syria’s religious minorities as a key benchmark for the new government.“They only have one agenda about Syria and that’s Christians. They don’t care if the rest of the country goes to hell. And they were furious about what happened last week,” said Kamal Alam, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises the evangelical members of the Trump team on Syria and support to Christians in the Levant.Alam added that after last week’s killings, these members of the Trump administration have sought to add the protection of all minorities to their portfolio, not just Syria’s Christians. This could in turn, blunt the efforts of congresspeople who have been trying to get US sanctions lifted.To many members of Syria’s Alawite community, the damage has already been done. Almost 11,000 Syrians have fled into Lebanon since the violence on the coast, according to the UN.“The streets are empty. No one dares go outside. All of us here cannot sleep from the fear that we will be killed in our beds,” Hayan said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaThe ObserverMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And he can tell Trump that these cunning Ukrainians are trying to trick you, and so on.” Putin’s trademark “yes, but” answer to the US ceasefire ­proposal was essentially a carefully packaged “no”, according to many Kremlin observers.“They are trying not to reject it fully, because it can spoil the ­relationship with Trump and ­complicate things, so they have to say ‘Yes, we agree, but…’ And then this ‘but’ makes it impossible,” said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya.Putin is very dangerous when he’s directly talking to Trump. He knows how to charm him, how to give ­compliments.Russia has no interest in a ­ceasefire for the sake of it, she said, and is only interested in talks that would bring about a final ­settlement advantageous to the Kremlin. “Russians don’t want a ceasefire unconditionally – they have been saying it for a long time,” she said.According to Stanovaya, Putin still believes there is a “real Ukraine” that exists in parallel to Zelenskyy and other supposed radicals in Kyiv, and that these real Ukrainians want good relations with Russia.“They are not saying it explicitly, but the idea is that with Ukraine as it is now, with Zelenskyy in power, there won’t be a deal, there will be nothing. Ukraine must admit it has lost the war, it has no chances to reverse the military situation, and that the only way to get out is to start talking to Russians about Moscow’s peace terms,” she said.That, of course, is a far cry from what Kyiv and most of Ukraine’s western allies have in mind for a lasting peace.Discussions, led by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, to rally western nations into providing some kind of military able to police an eventual peace, appear to be far removed from the reality of the Kremlin’s current position.The decisive question will be whether or not Trump is ready to really push Moscow when the scale of Putin’s “nuances” becomes clear. Putin put his position to Trump’s negotiator Steve Witkoff in closed-door talks on Thursday in Moscow. In a time-honoured tactic, he­reportedlyunderlined the power dynamic of the meeting by ­keeping Witkoff waiting for eight hours before receiving him for discussions. In a social media post yesterday, Trump insisted “there was no wait whatsoever”, accusing those who suggested otherwise of being “sick degenerates”.At least one positive for Ukraine last week was the apparent reset of relations with the Americans after the White House debacle, at talks in Saudi Arabia. Instead of JD Vance or others in Trump’s circle known to have a dislike for Ukraine, the White House sent secretary of state Marco Rubio and national ­security adviser Mike Waltz, seen as two of the more traditional foreign policy thinkers among the eclectic mix of those around Trump.Instead of Zelenskyy, who communicates with raw emotion, the Ukranian delegation was led by chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, known for speaking quietly and drily. The talks went on for eight hours with only a short break for lunch, and those involved said they were marked by methodical back-and-forth, rather than emotional appeals.“Historians underestimate the role of human exhaustion in ­making historical decisions,” Heorhii Tykhyi, spokesperson for Ukraine’s ­foreign ministry, wrote on Facebook after the talks. “It is in these last hours, when fatigue is already ­making itself felt, that a way out of the impasse and even difficult compromises suddenly become possible.”After the two ­delegations called their respective presidents, an agreement was made: Ukraine would agree to a 30-day ceasefire, and the US would resume intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries – a return to the status quo that after the preceding fortnight felt like a diplomatic victory.Witkoff was not in Saudi Arabia, while Rubio and Waltz did not travel to Moscow, leaving it an open ­question as to how coordinated the US dealmaking is. Keith Kellogg, the retired general whom Trump ­initially appointed his Ukraine and Russia envoy, and who was known to be a supporter of Kyiv, appears to have been completely sidelined from the process, with reports that the Kremlin asked him to be removed from high-level meetings.If, against the odds, Trump can persuade Putin to agree to the 30-day ceasefire, discussions will then move on to the more difficult question of how to turn that into a sustainable peace. Even before that, there would be the issue of how such a ceasefire is monitored, along the long and unstable frontline.“A ceasefire can’t be based only on political statements,” said Fesenko. “The military would have to sit down and agree on the contact line, the monitoring procedure.It’s all harder now – before, there was just artillery, now there are drones. Who is going to control or at least monitor this?”Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpRussiaEuropeKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

Already, it had been a trying few days for the world’s richest man, who was facing aTeslastock selloff and fierce backlashover his attempts to radically overhaul the federal government. His net worthdeclined over $22bnon Monday alone.After Musk jokingly brushed off initial questions about the mounting pressure, host Larry Kudlow asked the Tesla andSpaceXCEO how he was managing to run his numerous companies amid the chaos.“With great difficulty,” Musk answered, at first chuckling then taking a long sigh and staring off into the middle distance. “I mean … yeah”.‘Major brand worries’: Just how toxic is Elon Musk for Tesla?Read moreThe past 10 days have marked several of the most significant setbacks for Musk in months. Tesla, arguably his marquee company, continued to fall in value as investors worried about thethreat of trade warandpossible recession– as well as declining profits. Escalating protests against the company over the billionaire’s role in the government also grew in number and intensity across the US, coupled with rising cases of vandalism andsocial stigmaagainst his cars. SpaceX has also struggled, with one of its rocketsdramatically explodingin midflight last week and then an announcement on Wednesday that it wasdelaying a rescue missionto retrieve “stranded” astronauts. The companytried againtwo days later.Adding to Musk’s headaches, his social media platform, X, experiencedwidespread outages throughout the dayon Monday. During his Fox Business interview, he claimed that it was the result of a “massive cyberattack” that the company had traced to the area of Ukraine.Musk is also dealing with increasing pushback over his role at Doge. Multiple outlets reported that the “first buddy”, as he’s christened himself, gotinto a heated exchangewithMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, during a White House meeting last week, which ended withDonald Trumpappearing to rein in Musk’s power to make staffing decisions at government agencies with aTruth social post. A federal judge in California alsoissued a preliminary injunctionon Thursday to reinstate thousands of the workers that Doge mass fired. Meanwhile, polling this week from Quinnipiac University shows that despite Musk repeatedly declaring that the public loves what Doge is doing, astrong majorityof people disapprove of his initiative.After a long string of victories for Musk that included soaring share prices and a period of seemingly unchecked power following Trump’s inauguration, some signs of strain are beginning to show on his grip on his empire. He has lost around $119bn this year so far, although staggeringly still boasts a fortune $100bn greater than the next richest man in the world, and facesquestions from investorson whether his political activity ishurting his companies.Rather than step away from his role in the White House, however, Musk appears to be doubling down.Musk turns to Maga world to turn Tesla’s fortunes aroundTwo days after his labored appearance on Fox Business, Musk was once again in front of the cameras. This time, he was smiling alongside Trump on the White House lawn as thepresident cooed overa new red Tesla Model S and gushed to reporters about what a wonderful car it was.“Everything is computer,” Trump said, sitting in the driver’s seat. “That’s beautiful!”At the climax of the transformation of the White House into a car dealership, Trump announced that he had bought the Model S. He likewise spoke out in support of Musk and told reporters that Americans should “cherish” the billionaire. Others in the Maga world soon followed suit, declaring their backing forTeslaand urging their followers to do the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the display also gave the impression that Musk needed Trump to reverse his string of losses and quell the backlash against him. Trump stated at the event that he would label demonstrations against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism. Attorney general Pam Bondiannounced on Fridayshe would launch an investigation into vandalism targeting the company.“They fought the law and the law won,” Musk posted on X above news that Bondi was threatening vandals with up to 20 years in prison forattacking Tesla dealerships.The backlash against Tesla does not appear to be slowing; more protests against Tesla are set for the coming week. In response, Musk is deepening his embrace with the Maga world, including its most distasteful denizens. He spent a sizable part of Friday afternoon posting support for Tesla and Doge from rightwing media influencer accounts and Fox News clips. At one point, he retweeted a post that compared attacks against Tesla vehicles and dealerships to Kristallnacht, the infamous Nazi pogrom against Jewish-owned businesses that took place at the onset of the Holocaust.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationTeslaSpaceXDonald TrumpXUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She previously covered pop culture ati-Dmagazine, and is now contributing editor at the independent quarterlytheFence. Her absorbing debut novel,I Want to Go Home But I’m Already There(Fig Tree), remakes the haunted house genre for the rental age, following a millennial couple, Áine and Elliott, as they first move in together. Soon, Áine begins to think the flat is against them, and Lanigan incisively tracks her character’s very modern descent into despair.Up until now you’ve worked as a journalist. Did you always want to be a novelist?I always wanted to write fiction, but it’s one of those jobs that feels so out of reach. It took me a long time to take it seriously and to believe that I could do it, especially when it comes to making up characters. It’s a strange departure from one where everything is factual and you can’t make up quotes.Where did the idea for your novel come from?I started writing it in 2022. I had just moved back to London after being in Belfast for part of the pandemic, working remotely. So I had to re-engage with the London rental market. At that time, landlords were desperate for you to move into their flats because they’d been empty, so their prices were quite low. If I’d left it six months later I would have really struggled. I’ve lived in London for 10 years now, so I’ve seen all the permutations of the London rental market – the book came out of that.When you look at traditional horror and ghost stories, the women are always selflessWhy was horror the right approach?I’m a big horror fan. I was reading a lot about haunted houses, and thinking about how all haunted house stories are essentially about owning property and the huge burden that places on you psychologically. And then I was thinking, I wonder what the equivalent is for us, as millennials who rent? Alongside that, I was seeing a lot of my friends – and myself – beginning to live with their partners much earlier than we had been conditioned to think you might do so, for financial reasons.That then brings complications, if you’re not quite ready to make that step. So the book is a ghost story set in the rental crisis, but it’s also about this young woman’s experience of a situation that she finds increasingly intolerable, and how she has no outlet to express that.Your protagonist, Áine, is pretty unlikable. What was your intention?When you look at traditional horror and ghost stories, the women are always selfless. They’re often wives and mothers. They hold everything together. That always annoyed me. I wanted to write about the people I actually saw. There are a lot of young women like Áine who are listless and uncertain and aren’t driven towards domesticity.The dialogue feels very realistic. Did you borrow much from real life?I have this really bad habit where, if I hear someone say something ridiculous, I write it down in the notes app on my phone. I wanted the dialogue to be naturalistic and spiky, to reflect how people actually speak to each other. The other part that is based on reality comes in the long section where Áine is scrolling through Rightmove and is terrified by the rental listings she finds. Those are all taken from real Rightmove ads. In fact I kept coming back to them over the course of writing the book because what I saw kept getting worse, so I would replace them with even crazier ones.What are your worst rental stories?I moved to London with just a suitcase – it was the most Irish thing in the world. I moved into someone’s spare room and immediately got bedbugs. I had to throw away everything and start again. It was an inauspicious start. But I think the worst experience I’ve had is the crying woman, the banshee. She was our landlord and was constantly crying that we weren’t looking after the house the way she wanted us to. I eventually took my revenge: she left a case of champagne under the stairs, and I drank it.How can the rental crisis be solved?I think there are certain things that will help, like therenters’ rights bill, if it ends no-fault evictions. Currently there is this massive power that landlords have over tenants – it feels like they can do whatever they want. It’s also about housing stock: we just don’t build enough houses. And I think there’s a problem in the way we talk about property ownership culturally. It’s completely poisonous the way some people aspire to be landlords; that there are young people who want to build property portfolios, who want to flip houses and rent them. If we talk about that as a normal career choice, that is a sign of a deeply sick culture.What books do you think best depict millennial life?One of the things I read when I was writing my book wasCommon Decencyby Susannah Dickey– it has a lot of interesting themes around surveillance in the community, and obsession. I also lovedEvenings and Weekendsby Oisín McKenna. It’s about knowing when the party’s over and when you might have to leave London. I found that very relatable.What’s your favourite literary horror story?I really likeDaisy Johnson’sSisters, andThe Yellow Wallpaper[by Charlotte Perkins Gilman]. They’re not necessarily horror stories, but stories about young women experiencing things that are not quite right, and how people around them react to that. I also like the melodrama ofThe Amityville Horror[by Jay Anson].What books are on your bedside table?I’m just about to startRejectionbyTony Tulathimuttebecause next I’m interested in writing about loners and “incels”. I want to write a novel about violent male crime and how we metabolise that as friends or people who knew the person, but also as the machine of journalism – how we turn those things into spectacles. I also have a copy of the new version ofAndrea Dworkin’sRight-Wing Women, which feels very prescient.I Want to Go Home But I’m Already Thereby Róisín Lanigan is published by Fig Tree, £16.99.

The press have barely been let near the remake’s stars, Rachel Zegler, who is of Colombian-Polish descent and plays Snow White, and Israeli actor Gal Gadot, playing the Evil Queen. And there are no dwarves.The film is forgoing a traditional Leicester Square red carpet opening this week; advance ticket sales projections are lacklustre and it hasn’t been shown to reviewers.But why should a film based on an archetypal fairy tale – of a wicked queen, jealous of her stepdaughter’s beauty, who orders her murder, only to discover that she is hiding in a cottage with seven dwarves, then poisons her with a drugged apple, causing her to fall into a deep sleep, to be awakened only by the kiss of a prince – cause so much bother?View image in fullscreenGal Gadot and Rachel Zegler with a certain item of fruit in the new movie.Photograph: DisneyGood or bad,Snow Whiteis destined for a reaction. “It’s a complete quagmire but, realistically, what did they expect?” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts in California and former executive editor of theHollywood Reporter. “You’re going into this with a movie calledSnow White. It’s hard to imagine a picture in this DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion], or post-DEI, post-woke age could be more controversial and polarising – and Disney is all about not being polarising, bringing people together and avoiding controversy at all costs.”Disney embarked on a programme of reinventing its animated back catalogue as live action withAlice in Wonderlandin 2010, continuing withCinderella(2015),The Jungle Book(2016), andBeauty and the Beast(2017). But the release ofMulanin 2020, a remake of the 1998 animated film based on a Chinese folklore tale, signalled that folk tales carry contemporary political and cultural trapdoors. There were false rumours that Disney had cast a white lead actress, and calls for a boycott afterMulan’s lead actor Liu Yifei expressed support for the Hong Kong police. The credits revealed that film-makers thanked eight government entities in Xinjiang, where Uyghur Muslims have been detained in internment camps.Actor Halle Bailey, who is Black and starred in the 2023Little Mermaidremake, faced racist backlashafter being cast as Ariel, who was white in the animated film in 1989.Zegler, the star ofSnow White, who is Latina, has suffered similar abuse. ButSnow Whitealso arrives on our screens with a different set of issues. Screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson said the 1937 classic had been gently fleshed out for a more contemporary audience and that she had “massaged the theme of her discovering and trusting her own voice and her own purpose with compassion and strength”.Zegler toldVanity Fairin 2022 that people were making jokes “about ours being the PCSnow White, where it’s like, yeah, it is – because it needed that. It’s an 85-year-old cartoon, and our version is a refreshing story about a young woman who has a function beyond Someday My Prince Will Come.” She has also been criticised for saying the prince “literally stalks” the princess in the 1937 original.View image in fullscreenSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs – the 1937 original.Photograph: Disney/AllstarDisney possibly saw controversy coming. When it reopened its renamed Snow White’s Enchanted Wish ride at Disneyland in 2021, it was hit with criticism that the upgraded experience still included Prince Charming kissing a sleeping Snow White – without her consent. The kiss was one of true love, not lust, because the prince thought she was dead, it was explained.Both Zegler and Gadot have run into trouble with political statements. Gadot, who served in the Israel Defense Forces,spokeat an Anti-Defamation League summit on antisemitism, and her stance on the Israel-Hamas war triggered calls by Palestinian groups fora boycottof the film.Zegler, on the other hand, has posted “always remember, free palestine”on X. After the US election, she wrote “may Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace” on Instagram. Zegler later apologised, saying she was “sorry I contributed to the negative discourse”.R&B legend Brandy, who played Cinderella in a 1997 remake starring Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother, has advised Zegler to remember her true audience. “You’re not taking on this role to fit the mould of the critics,” Brandy toldVariety. “You’re doing this for every little Colombian girl who has yet to see themselves in a role like a Disney princess.”And then there are the notorious dwarves, created using CGI animation.Cyranostar Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, questioned why the characters were included while Snow White was cast diversely. “It makes no sense to me. You’re progressive in one way, but then you’re still making that fucking backward story about seven dwarves living in a cave together?” he said on theWTF with Marc Maronpodcast in 2022.View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as Evil Queen in the live-action Snow White.Photograph: DisneyDisney said it has consulted members of the dwarfism community “to avoid reinforcing stereotypes” and, later, that it would replace the seven with “magical creatures”.Peter Kunze, a historian at Tulane University in New Orleans and author ofStaging a Comeback: Broadway, Hollywood, and the Disney Renaissance, says Disney has sometimes struggled to manage the transition from animation to live action, just as Walt Disney managed to make animation more realistic with Snow White than it was with Mickey Mouse.“There are questions of authenticity that come with the shift,” Kunze says. “In some ways they’re moving away from the principles of the animated film, of fantasy or embellished reality, and getting more realistic. The interesting question is not whether it’s authentic, but in what ways does Disney think it’s being authentic and how audiences respond?But updating for contemporary audiences and hiring consultants to say how authentic it is, does not necessarily resonate with audiences “who maybe are not looking for Disney to have a culturally rich, in-depth storytelling in a fairytale space. A film can only do so much to capture a culture, and then there’s the question of: whose version of that culture do you capture?” Kunze says.“In attempting to speak to more diverse audiences by putting a Latina into a Germanic narrative without acknowledging certain elements of what it means to be Latina potentially does little to make space for more Latina stories and just presents new bodies in old stories as progress,” Kunze adds.It may be that Disney is a touchstone that makes for a big, easy target in the culture wars, andSnow Whiteis the fairest target of them all in its archive. If the movie is good enough, it could cut through the cultural flak. “From the beginningSnow Whitehad red flags waving – a whiter-than-white heroine at a time when Hollywood is moving away from that, rescued by Prince Charming, when that’s a chauvinist trope, and seven dwarves, when the word dwarf is a negative. It’s not like any of this crept up on Disney unawares. ButSnow Whiteis also the classic of classics – it is to animation what Hamlet is to the theatre.”Explore more on these topicsCultureThe ObserverChildrenWomenAnimation in filmFilm industryWalt Disney CompanynewsShareReuse this content"

Which is probably why he’s given the task of unmasking a traitor suspected of stealing and selling a piece of potentially devastating technology. What complicates matters is the fact that one of the main suspects is his wife, high-ranking fellow agent Kathryn (Cate Blanchett). Others in the frame include in-house psychiatrist Dr Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris), alcoholic maverick Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke) and junior agent Clarissa Dubose (Marisa Abela).This knotty spy thriller fromSteven Soderberghattempts to distract us from a convoluted plot and baffling character motivations with fabulously chic interiors, impeccable tailoring and a general sense of dissolute luxury. And for a while it almost works: it’s always a pleasure to watch Blanchett slink expensively around a set, and Fassbender wears his serious, Harry Palmer-style thick-framed glasses with suitable gravity. But times have changed, and to audiences acclimatised to the grubby, malodorous whiff of frustration and professional disappointment that seeps out of something like the TV adaptation of Mick Herron’sSlow Horses, this all feels about as authentic as a set of dental veneers.The main problem, however, is the writing. We could probably get past the implausibly handsome cast and glossy, monied look of the production design if David Koepp’s screenplay delivered a satisfying payoff. David Holmes’s score borrows from the jazzy, percussive urgency of his work for Soderbergh’sOceansfilms, but, like much ofBlack Bag, it feels slick but superficial.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Black Bag.Explore more on these topicsThrillersThe ObserverSteven SoderberghCate BlanchettMichael FassbenderSlow HorsesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But these oversweetened, mushy foods are creating a generation of choosy consumers whose teeth are already rottingWhat to feed your baby insteadBee WilsonSat 15 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 10.37 EDTShareAcouple of years ago, nursery manager Melanie Smith, who runs Portland Kindergarten in Lincoln, noticed that many children were eating in a new way. Or rather, they werenoteating in a newway. A significant percentage of the toddlers in her care were now refusing to try any element of the nursery’s small morning meal (which always includes fresh fruit) or their lunch, which might be something like spaghetti bolognese, fishcakes with vegetables, or mild chillies and curries. This new generation of infants “just don’t seem to like texture”, comments Smith, who has been involved with the nursery for 35 years (before she took over, her mother ran it for 25 years). In the most extreme cases, Smith and her staff found themselves feeding three-year-olds who vomited at the very sight of a cooked lunch.During the 10 years that Smith has been in charge at Portland, there have always been a fair number of picky eaters. A degree of “fussiness” about food is nothing new for this age group – it can be an entirely natural developmental stage. It’s called neophobia: fear of the new. Smith says it was a normal part of nursery life to have children who struggled with certain vegetables or ones who “liked dry food but not wet food”. The difference now, Smith says, is that the nursery is seeing a lot of three-year-olds for whomfollow-on milkplus commercial baby food and other packaged snacks form “100% of their diet”. At the same time, Smith says there has been a “massive increase” in toddlers with tooth decay, as well as a rise in the number of children reaching the age of three who are more or less nonverbal. She attributes this speech delay to the fact that the skills and muscles needed for chewing are related to those needed for speech.Has this generation of children – who were born from 2020 onwards – become scared of real food? As with anything to do with post-pandemic life, the answers are not simple. Eating is a deeply social activity and we will never fully get to the bottom of the ways in which children born during or after Covid were affected by dozens of forms of social dislocation, including the closure of baby groups and play areas, the masking of faces, the rising use of screens and the isolation of their parents from friends and family. Smith says when it comes to child-rearing, “people have lost their village”.When offering your child his or her first taste of food, you can endlessly doubt yourself. I definitely did when feeding my three children, even though I was lucky enough to have cooking skills and a fully equipped kitchen. What if my baby hated my cooking? What if I gave him the “wrong” thing by mistake? Back in 1999 I fed my oldest son sloppy baby rice from a packet, followed by homemade purees frozen in ice cube trays, plus the odd jar. Given the chance to do it again, I would forget the purees and try baby-led weaning – the approach pioneered byformer health visitor Gill Rapley, in which babies are simply offered pieces of real, whole food from six months onwards and encouraged to explore it themselves. Then again, it’s easy to be wise about what to feed babies when you are not in the middle of doing it.The baby food aisle has morphed into a colourful snacktopia, colonised by brilliantly marketed and fancifully shaped fast foodsFor many families now, these are exceptionally difficult times. New parents of all social classes are feeling time-poor and uncertain, and one of the great beneficiaries of this collective state of parental anxiety has been the commercial baby food industry. Manufacturers have done a spectacular job of convincing many parents that feeding a baby with highly processed pouches, powders and crisp-like snacks is not just the convenient option but the healthier and better one. Does your baby refuse greens? A pouch will provide all the veg they require. Worried about your child choking? Give them a “melty” snack.The damage done to child health by commercial baby food in the UK – and the failure of government to do anything to protect families from the marketing of it – is one of the great untold food scandals of our time. If anyone should be protected from the ultra-processed world we are now living in, you might think it would be babies. As the World Health Organization states, good infant nutrition in thefirst three years of life is criticalto how a child will grow and develop. Babies need food that is pure, varied, minimally seasoned and nutrient-dense. Apart from meeting a child’s needs in the short term, the food they eat during their first few years of life is also equipping them with preferences for the future. Yet by the age of two to five, the average UK toddler is getting 61% of their energy from ultra-processed foods, according toa 2022 study– a significantly higher percentage than UK adults, and higher even than for children in the US (where it is 58%), let alone countries that still have a relatively strong cooking culture, such as Argentina (where it is 27%) or Colombia (18%).Have you been in the baby food aisle of a big supermarket lately? For me, it had been a while (my youngest child just turned 16). I had vague memories of lumpy purees and porridge in jars, plus crispy things in dreary packets, such as rusks and plain rice cakes. When I returned, I found that the aisle had morphed into a brightly coloured snacktopia, colonised by a series of brilliantly marketed and fancifully shaped baby fast foods. There were puffs and straws; sticks and stars; biscotti and “smoothie melts”; sweetcorn rings and fish-shaped raspberry “tiddlers”. The jars of mush I remembered were still there but were now vastly outnumbered by row upon row of colourful pouches with bright and appealing graphics on the front.When Hong Kong-basednutritionist Georgine Leunghad her first daughter in the UK 11 years ago, she mostly fed her on a homemade diet, simply mashing whatever she and her husband were eating (having been careful not to add any salt). As a baby in Hong Kong, Leung had been fed by her own mother on congee rice porridge, watery to start with, then thicker over time, supplemented with other foods such as steamed hairy gourd and little pieces of meat and tofu. When she became a mother, Leung remembers finding the illustrations on the Ella’s Kitchen pouches very “attractive”. In herNational Childbirth Trustgroup, these pouches were ubiquitous, and British parents generally felt they represented goodness and health. “There’s a huge moral angle to feeding,” Leung comments. “People feel judged.”On the subject of feeling judged for how you feed your child, one of the cleverest marketing inventions of modern times is surely the baby snack. These nibbles sell parents the idea that they are helping their child’s physical and social development – when what they are really buying is a tiny and very expensive packet of crisps or biscuits. One of the first of these snacks to be sold in the UK, back in 2006, was Organix Melty Carrot Puffs – a kind ofall-natural Wotsits– with their “no junk promise”. Carrot puffs have since been joined by a host of other “melty” snacks, all claiming to be perfect finger food for a developing child. “Delight little learners with our Melty Veggie Sticks, a scrum-veggily-umptious finger food to grab, hold and happily munch!” says the packet of Organix Veggie Sticks. The promise of meltiness preys on parents’ understandable terror of a baby choking. But these snacks – organic or not – are also one of the reasons that many infants have not learned to chew properly, because they are quite unlike the crunchy textures of real food: the crispness of toast, the chewy juiciness of roasted carrots or the crunch of an apple.What children around the world eat – in picturesRead moreBaby snacks are huge business. Over the past decade,they have risen from 10%of the total UK baby food market to 21%. Pushing snacks on babies and their parents has been one of the ways the food industry has continued to make a tidy profit out of babies despitedeclining birthrates. These finger food snacks are easily the most lucrative form of baby food for manufacturers, and halfof them are ultra-processed(whether organic or not). I recently tried my first packet of Veggie Straws,by the Kiddylicious brand, marketed as “fun and colourful for little fingers”. Veggie Straws are hollow, low on veg (tiny quantities of beetroot, kale and other vegare used more for colour than for flavour) and high on potato starch and refined rapeseed oil. I can’t say the taste thrilled me because I could hardly detect one – a slick of oil on my tongue was the main impression given by these pallid sticks, whose colours were much less vibrant than the packet art. Yet when I got to the end of the miniature 12g packet, I found myself scrabbling in the bag for more, like I did when I was a compulsive eater bingeing crisps as a teenager.Someone who has been trying to get the government to take the problem seriously is Dr Vicky Sibson, director ofFirst Steps Nutrition Trust, a charity that provides resources and reports on children’s food. Sibson tells me Smith’s experiences in Lincoln are far from unique. Two years ago, she co-authoreda report for First Stepson ultra-processed food in the diets of infants and young children in the UK. She found that between the ages of four and six months – when the official health advice is for babies not to have even started solid food yet – 34% of all babies in the UK are fed some form of industrially produced baby snacks.Even when commercial British baby foods are not technically ultra-processed (which, according to the Brazilian nutritionists who identified the concept, means foods that are made using additives and processes that would never be found in a home kitchen), they are often quite unsuitable for babies. A case in point are the “first baby food” pouches of fruit and vegetable purees that are routinely marketed for babies of four months, in contradiction ofNHS weaning guidance, which advises exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months (or using formula milk for those who are bottle feeding). Some baby pouches contain more sugars per 100ml thanCoca-Cola, yet they are sold with labels that reassure parents that they are entirely “organic” with “nothing artificial” added.View image in fullscreen‘Pouches reinforce a preference for sweetness and smoothness.’Illustration: Justin Metz/The GuardianHow is this legal? As Sibson told me, most parents imagine foods in the baby aisle are heavily regulated. Speaking on behalf of the baby food industry, Declan O’Brien of theBritish Specialist Nutrition Associationtold me that “baby foods are strictly regulated to ensure their quality and nutritional composition”. Yet there are – I was staggered to learn –no specific legal limits on sugar thresholds in any UK baby foods.The English regulations on baby food – which were set in 2003 when the market was very different – state that the amount of “sucrose, fructose, glucose, glucose syrups or honey” added to baby food shouldn’t exceed 7.5g per 100g. This is odd in itself, given that honey shouldn’t be given to babies under the age of one, due to a very unlikely risk of botulism. But the regulations say nothing about other added sugars such as fruit juice concentrate. There are also no regulations on the sugars contained in fruit purees themselves. The total carbohydrates in a baby puree would have to hit 20g per 100g to fall foul of the law. This would be very, very sweet – about the same amount of sugar per 100g as a supermarket mini sugared doughnut.When you eat a whole piece of fruit, the sugar in it is intrinsic, meaning it is part of the fruit’s natural cell structure. Thanks to the fibre it contains, it is digested more slowly. By contrast, the sugars in a processed fruit puree arefree sugarsbecause the cells of the fruit have broken down. Areport by First Steps Nutrition Trustin 2018 found that theaveragefree sugars content of a fruit-only pouch marketed as suitable for a four-month-old baby was 11.7g per 100g. Many pouches contain even more sugar than this. Ella’s Kitchen Bananas + Coconuts for four months plus contains nearly 15g of sugar per 100g: about four level teaspoons of sugar a pack. Savoury flavours are often little better: First Steps found that the majority of pouches containing vegetables as well as fruits consisted mainly of apples or pears, though most did not mention these as the main ingredient. For example, Little Freddie pouches with Spinach, Peas and Apples (since discontinued) were 82% apple and just 12% spinach and 6% peas.A study in 2020found that the UK was unusual in adding sweet fruit to savoury baby food. Researchers found that savoury meal-type purees for babies did not contain added sugars in any of the European countries studied, except for the UK and Malta.Something you never saw 20 years ago that has become entirely normal is the sight of a young child in a pushchair slurping his or her lunch from the nozzle of a pouch. One of the purposes of weaning a baby on to solid food at six months is to expose them to a range of flavours and textures so they can gradually learn to enjoy the varied diet their bodies need. By contrast, these pouches reinforce a preference for sweetness and smoothness. The era of pouch feeding started in 2006 with Ella’s Kitchen, now the UK’s largest baby food firm. The company was the brainchild of entrepreneur Paul Lindley, who quit his job at the children’s TV channel Nickelodeon and launched the company with his life savings, naming it after his daughter. Ella’s Kitchen “changed the whole landscape of baby food”, Leung says. For an occasional quick snack on the move, a pouch is undeniably handy. But for many families around the world, they have become a way of life that continues long after babyhood. An article in the Los Angeles Timeslast year featureda mother from Pittsburgh whose seven-year-old was still eating two or three pouches every day. Some of the brands explicitly push the idea of them as something for all ages of children. On one pouch of Ella’s Kitchen puree for four-month-olds, I noticed the label said: “I am also great for older little ones who will love my tastes for years to come.”One mother said the ‘lovely ingredients’ meant she didn’t have to worry about ‘too much sugar or anything like that’ in themAccording to First Steps Nutrition Trust, parents should be actively discouraged from buying these baby pouches. The NHS guidance on weaning makes no mention of them anywhere; pouch feeding goes againstNHS advicethat infants be discouraged from sucking from spouts and teats after the age of six months.In 2022, the British Dental Associationattacked pouches for putting baby teeth at risk of “erosion and decay” just as “they are erupting”. Most of the pouches have small print on the back advising that the contents should be squeezed into a bowl or on to a spoon before being offered to babies. However, the fact that Lindley – who sold the company in 2013 for £66m – posed for publicity photos sucking straight from the nozzle of an Ella’s Kitchen pouch suggests he was aware that this was how they are usually consumed. A spokesperson for the company told me that Lindley has not worked for Ella’s Kitchen since 2018, that the photograph of him posing with a pouch, from 2013, has not been used to promote the brand for over 10 years, and that “none of our promotional materials will ever show a little one feeding directly from the pouch”. They added that the company has “never marketed our weaning range as a substitute for whole or textured foods”. A baby who sucks from a pouch can neither smell nor see what they are eating, so it does not teach them to recognise or enjoy real whole fruits and vegetables. Sucking smooth, sweet puree direct from a pouch is also a recipe for tooth decay.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Four tiny packets of Organix Cheese & Herbs Puffs are £2.38 at Asda. The high price, perversely, seems to be part of the reason why these products are so popular among all classes in the UK – it wrongly reassures parents they are feeding their child something good. In 2020, a team ofresearchers interviewed 62 parents and carerswith babies aged four to six months, following up with them twice more at six-month intervals. The parents were split between those on low, middle and high incomes.One mother on a low income said she used the puree to “get the nutrients in” and the packaged finger foods “just to play with and explore the textures”. One of the wealthier mothers said she liked Ella’s Kitchen pouches because they had “lovely ingredients in them” so she didn’t have to worry that there was “too much sugar … or anything like that”. Although the pouches are costly, some of the mothers on lower incomes liked them because at least they knew the contents wouldn’t be “wasted to the bin” as one parent put it. Buying a whole bag of sweet potatoes or broccoli felt like a financial risk. A kilo bag of sweet potatoes, enough to make 10 baby portions, costs £1.19 in Aldi – about the same price as a single pouch of Ella’s Kitchen puree, or two pouches of the Aldi equivalent.Nowhere is a parent’s trust in baby food more misplaced than when it comes to “growing up milk”. These are powdered formula milks specifically marketed at infants aged 12 months and over, and they should not exist at all. When it comes to ultra-processed foods, formula milk for babies under the age of one is in a category of its own, because for babies who are not breastfed it is essential, as well as being a safe and well-regulated product in the UK. Many mothers cannot breastfeed for as long as they would like to, or at all.But if formula milk is a vital substance for some babies in the first year of life, it loses its purpose after the age of one. All the health advice says that formula milks “are not required by children aged one to five”. A one-year-old is ready to drink whole cow’s milk (or the plant-based equivalent), or to continue with breast milk if they are breastfed. Yet formula milkcontinues to be drunkby more than a third of children aged 12 to 18 months.“Growing up” and “toddler” milks are great for business, forming 48% of sales of the commercial formula market worldwide. But they are not so great for children. What most parents don’t realise is that, in contrast to formulas sold for babies from birth, the composition of which is tightly regulated and which are not allowed to be advertised (because to do so would undermine breastfeeding), growing up milks have no restrictions on marketing or ingredients in the UK. As a result, they tend to be alarmingly high in sugar, often in the form of maltodextrin, a sweetener that is made from processed starch, often corn. Maltodextrin has a higher glycaemic index than table sugar and it is known to impact tooth enamel, yet in the UK it is not labelled as added sugar. As well as these sugars, toddler milks are mainly made up of powdered milk and vegetable oil. A 350ml portion of Alpro Soya Growing Up Milk, for instance, would give a toddler 15.5% of their daily energy from free sugar: three times the recommended amount. These milks have a cloying taste, unlike the flavour of regular cow’s milk, which reinforces a child’s preference for sweet foods.How bad do things have to get in the baby food aisle before the government finally decides to protect infants – and parents – from this flood of oversweetened and highly processed food and drinks? In November, I went to Portcullis House in Westminster for the launch ofa reportfrom the House of Lords’ Food, Diet and Obesity Committee, whose remit was to consider the role of ultra-processed food in diets in Britain. The committee’s chair, Joan Walmsley, had commented in a podcast a few months earlier that the food industry had been “getting away with murder”, especially when it came to foods aimed at babies and children. One of her committee’s strongest recommendations was that the government must “act immediately to strengthen regulation on the composition and marketing” of follow-on, toddler and growing up milks, banning their promotion altogether. The committee also called for stronger standards for “commercial infant food” in general.The government’s reaction to the committee’s recommendations has been half-hearted, to say the least. In a response issued on 30 January, the Department of Health acknowledged the “concern” about growing up milks, but announced no new regulations beyond continuing to “review the evidence”. As for baby food in general, the government responded that we already “have comprehensive regulations in place”. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said it is Labour’s ambition to make “our country’s children the healthiest generation that has ever lived”. But apparently this doesn’t extend to helping them to eat healthier food during their very earliest months.How do you get children to eat vegetables? | Kitchen aideRead moreIn the absence of better regulation of baby food, perhaps the most remarkable thing is that there are still many children in the UK who have a varied and healthy diet. All the experts I spoke to agreed that there were huge variations in how children ate and that this cut across income groups. Smith told me that there were many children at Portland who did enjoy their nursery lunches. One child, from a low income household, brought in his own lunch from home each day, consisting of dishes such as rice and chicken and plantain, beautifully cooked. His food, she said, was so “amazing” that the staff often wished they could be eating it.Dr Bimpe Oki, director of public health at the London borough of Lambeth, told me that what their community dietitians see is the difference it makes for a child to be living in a household with strong cooking habits. But to feed a child on something other than pouches and powders is also a “battle against a whole range of things” including low literacy, cramped housing and inadequate kitchen equipment. “Even using a blender can seem daunting,” Oki says.When it comes to steering someone away from ultra-processed products, the key is to start early. “We don’t wait until six months,” Oki says. She is well aware that it isn’t always easy to get parents to see the benefits of homemade baby food when there are such cleverly marketed alternatives in every supermarket. Oki herself “never thought of giving my own children anything but what I cooked for them”. But the day of our conversation, she decided to check out the baby food in a local shop and found herself strangely attracted to a pack of Heinz biscotti with Peppa Pig on the label, aimed at babies aged seven months and up. “It just drew my attention.”This article was amended on 15 March 2025 to clarify the response from an Ella’s Kitchen spokespersonExplore more on these topicsChildren's healthChildrenNutrition (Life and style)Nutrition (Science)Health policyFoodFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianI was a non-swimmer, living miles away from Sydney’s glittering water belt. Taking up ocean racing felt like a badge of not only belonging to, but thriving in, this city of waterBySarah MalikSat 15 Mar 2025 15.20 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 20.19 EDTShareIt’s 7:45 am on a Saturday and my alarm blares. I am up. My swim bag is already packed; I snap on my one-piece with crisscross back straps that leaves dark slashes of tan. Gulping water and toast, I pass a carrot to Tally – who wags her tail appreciatively but is deeply unimpressed her morning walk will be delayed – and head downstairs.My ride is my neighbour R, a former life-saver hijabi. We are a well-oiled machine, carpooling for toll and petrol costs. In the quiet morning, Canterbury-Bankstown’s Palestinian flags on cars, manoush bakeries and bro-gyms give way to the skin-cancer clinics, juice bars and women in athleisure of Sydney’s eastern suburbs.We arrive in Bondi 40 minutes later, zeroing in on the free parking spots closest to Sydney’s famous east coast beach.Six years on from learning to finish a lap of a swimming pool, I have become one of the “serious” ocean swimmers I used to watch with awe.Australia’s iconic beach culture used to feel off-limits to me, as a person of colour in a post-Cronulla riots world. But after years of building up my confidence and skills with women’s swim groups like Swim Sisters and Bondi Surf life-saving club volunteer trainers, coming in to last summer I began to feel as if I had shrugged off the outsider identity that had kept me from my city’s coastline.I joined a community. I felt at ease going solo to Bondi; it had started to feel like a second home. Claiming the beach as my own place felt radical.View image in fullscreen‘After swims, I’m pounding with endorphins,’ Malik says.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianIset myself a new goal of distance swimming and begin with 1.5km every week with a new training group, filled with people who actually win races. I call them Aussie ocean Aunties, led by Zoe, an expert swimmer with decades of experience. “There’s swimmers and dippers, Sarah, and we’re swimmers,” Zoe declares matter-of-factly before one of our swims. I nod with superiority, looking at pity at the crowds splashing at the shore.My first time doing distance at the start of summer at Bondi, I’m panicked. I’ve only been beyond the break a handful of times, and each foray under the waves and beyond them feels like a miracle. At the end of the swim, I’m gasping for breath, embarrassed to be the last straggler but buoyed up by the group cheers of “good job, Sarah!”.I had worked hard to become part of a once-unfamiliar world that had no reflection of meGradually, the weekly Bondi distance swims become routine. I’m still last and struggling to keep up, kept afloat by encouraging words from the swim Aunties. After swims, I’m pounding with endorphins. Catching a rip feels like a deception, flying through the water seemingly on your own speed. This must be what white privilege feels like, I joke.“Pondi!” the group exhales, the cheerful moniker we give to Bondi when it is sweet and docile, rewarding us with shimmering clear, flat water to swim in. When the surf is rough and wild, my heart pounds as I scan the horizon and I need Zoe’s guidance to stay horizontal in the water and keep swimming through what seem like insurmountable, high-contraction waves.I navigatebluebottles, see stingrays, learn how to swim in choppy sea and try to not stray too far behind as we calculate re-entry back, spying the shore in the distance.The summer of swimming came in the wake of being made redundant and learning to navigate a more precarious freelance life, coupled with the existential stress of a milestone birthday. Beyond my personal challenges, global politics were upending every certainty, as well as the careers of so many I respect – everything felt precarious.In a city of 100 beaches, I’m not sure why I’ve never explored more of Sydney’s glittering water belt coast. Lack of familiarity with Sydney suburbs where my face is unusual, plus the time and energy it takes to drive to new areas, had made exploring the city feel prohibitive. But this summer, I have nothing but time.View image in fullscreenSwimmer Sarah Malik over came her fears of swimming and has now completed major ocean swimming racing races, Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia. 14 March 2025Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianFriends and I create a spreadsheet of NSW beaches to visit and I mark them off my list.For three months, I swim nearly every day in a pool or in the ocean. I venture for the first time beyond Bondi, Clovelly and Coogee; from expensive harbour beaches to the golf course-wrapped La Perouse and the bush-encased pools of the Blue Mountains. I swim through sparkling shoals of fish in Congwong, a pink and purple-hued sunset at Little Bay on New Year’s Day, and across Gordon’s Bay with a friend, where Canadian tourists marvel at our audacity – “You just jump in from the rocks?!”We swim across the bay at Shark beach in Vaucluse after emerging from its spacious art deco-style bathrooms; mansions pour out into piers and private beaches overlooking Sydney harbour. I settle near rocks on Parsley beach, soak into Double Bay’s Redleaf pool and wonder how much it would cost to buy a house here.Yacht owners watch us bobbing ocean swimmers, amused. As I sink into the water, grateful that I have free access to these clean, safe waterways, I remind myself: I belong here.Through swimming, I find a way to my city, and back to myself. The brick on my chest lifts a little.I feel my centre shifting, a spaciousness in my mind forming. I think of how Ramadan creates a psychological shift by focusing on the body, community and connection with something transcendent, and how swimming replicates that feeling for me. In the water, my nervous system settles; I float, stillness overtakes me and depression feels arrested. The more I swim, the greater the deluge of happy chemicals flooding my veins, pushing out the hopeless feelings and filling me with a sense of vitality.I become a swimming evangelist. I corral my family toPenrith “beach”, a lake surrounded by rolling green hills, and my mother frolics with delight in her newly bought burkini as western Sydney temperatures soar. I take a recently arrived Gazan family for their first trip to Clovelly and see their eyes lighten, their bodies relax in the water.I remember my previous self: scared, nervous, unsure, led forward by swimmers like B and R. Now confident and assured, I want to pass that confidence forward like a rope.The day before my first ocean race, I do a test drive past the Harbour Bridge and highways, just to practise getting to the race’s endpoint. The Cole Classic boasts being the world’s largest ocean race and begins at the wave-less Shelley Beach, ending at Manly.We arrive early on the February Sunday morning. Unlike trendy Bondi, Manly is more well,manly, muscular and sporty. I am not a blonde, size 8, Home and Away beach babe – and here I was setting out on an ocean race, filled with Olympians and people who looked as if they lived here and had been swimming all their life.I surprise myself with a time of 30 minutes, with several dozen swimmers behind me. Running through the blue finish blow-up, I feel elated.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen‘If I could do this, I could do possibly anything,’ …Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianFinishing my first ocean race feels like crossing more than a physical line.I realise how rushed and hard I had been on myself in both my career and personal life, comparing myself with people whose starting line was so different from mine.I felt proud of how far I had come: a western Sydney Muslim desi non-swimmer, living miles away from any water, I had found friends, aides, courage. I had worked hard to become part of a once-unfamiliar world that had no reflection of me. Ocean racing felt like a badge – of not only belonging to, but thriving in this city of water.If I could do this, I could do possibly anything.I feel a pressure release after the Cole Classic. A month later, I do the Bondi Bluewater 1km, a race I had for years tried and failed. I finish with ease on a clear Pondi day, at the back of pack. Focusing on how I feel – not how I look or the chatter in my mind – is liberating. Skin bronzed, I feel strong, radiant, alive. No longer an outsider, I lay resting on the sand, restored, happy and ravenous.Sarah Malik is a freelance writer and author of Desi GirlExplore more on these topicsSwimmingSydneyFitnessHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I don’t know that I want to die underwater. It’s very peaceful and serene down there. I think I’d like to be fired out to space in a massive cannon.It would be an awful lot of work but Elon Musk and Bezos and all the rest of it, they could make it happen. I’m sure it’s probably a service that Amazon already offers. And as you were flying up to the heavens, Bezos would probably say, “Can you just take a couple of packages with you?”What is the strangest thing that has happened at one of your live shows?At one show, there was a guy in the audience who was my doppelganger, so I was chatting to him. It was a sold-out theatre, so there were no empty seats at all. His friend, who was sat next to him, drunkenly got up and staggered out to the toilet. So I gave the guy who looked like me one of my shirts from backstage – we dressed him like me and he stood on the stage while I sat in his drunk friend’s seat in the audience. I kept performing into the mike, while this guy mimed and walked around like me on stage.So the drunk guy came back and looked up at the stage. He hadn’t clocked it was his friend up there. Eventually he came over, looked down and saw me sitting in his seat. His head exploded.Matt Moran: ‘I’ve cooked for Putin – not many people can say that’Read moreYou started out as a street juggler. What did you learn from that job?When you started the show, you’d be in the middle of a busy shopping centre and people would be going around shopping. You’d put the case down and start putting all the props out on the floor. Two people would stop, then four, then six – when you got big enough crowds, you would start the show. But there would be trucks reversing, drunk people staggering past, people with shopping bags just walking straight through the performance, little kids trying to steal your unicycle. The trick was to quickly pull out your hat and try to get as much money as you could before people walked away.For me, comedy clubs weren’t even close to juggling. The audience are sat there looking at the stage, ready to watch! There’s a roof! There’s no distractions! Standup is so much easier.What’s the weirdest place you’ve been recognised?When I went in to have my vasectomy done. One of the guys that worked at the clinic saw me and said, “Oh, that’s good, my friend’s just started doing standup!” I was going, “Can we not talk about this now?”Also, when I broke my wrist – the ambulance turned up with this older paramedic and a younger guy. The younger guy said to me, “Do your Stephen Hawking impersonation!” Can I not? Can I not be performing for drugs, please? But I did and he went, “Right, we’ll get you some morphine.”If you could change the size of any animal to keep as a pet, what would it be?A friend and I used to talk about this a lot: I want an elephant the size of a dog. Not only are elephants great, but I’d love to see it ramming into furniture. We’ve got dogs that start barking when they see a possum and stuff – I love the idea of someone ringing the doorbell and hearing a couple of little elephants trumpeting.We did this with Bill Bailey, andhe wanted a tiny elephant for his desk.That’s amazing that we both chose an elephant. He wanted to go even smaller? Bill’s house is literally full of animals from around the world that he’s rescued and saved – that’s quite a dangerous question to ask Bill.What’s the best lesson you’ve learned from someonewho you’ve worked with?Enjoy yourself. When I first started, a comedian called Anvil Springstien told me this and I always give his advice to newer comics now. Don’t do anything for the money. Don’t do anything for the fame or the status. Do it because it’ll be enjoyable.Who’s the most famous person in your phone?[Laughing] I don’t want to answer that! It is basically name-dropping, right? I’m so paranoid that somebody might hack my phone and get into my contacts, so I’ve saved some people in my phone under false names, tied to what they’re most famous for. I won’t say who it is, but there is someone in my phone saved as Scribbler.You know what I’ve done now? I’ve basically given an open invitation for somebody to hack into my phone and try and work out my cryptic crossword-style clues.What do you do when you can’t get to sleep?I’m getting better, because comics end up staying up until like four, sleep till two, then repeat. Once I had kids, that had to change. But when I’m on tour, if I don’t have to wake up the next day, I just don’t go to sleep. I’m terrible.I went through a phase of playing Johnny Cash songs in the style of George Formby, for my own amusement. One night I was sat in the hotel room, singing [in Formby’s’ accent] “I’ve shot a man in Reno!” There was a bang on the wall and I realised it was like three in the morning. I felt like an absolute twat.What is the strangest thing you have done for love?I engraved some brass hose attachments with messages of love for my wife. It’s probably her favourite present I’ve ever got her. I had asked her what she wanted for Christmas but she didn’t want anything. She said, “I need a new hose for the garden” – I couldn’t get her a hose for Christmas!So I went out and bought these brass tap and nozzle hose attachments, then went to a jewellers and said, “Can you engrave these with stuff like ‘I love you?’” There was one from the kids that said, “To mum, blah, blah, blah”. We put them on a little silk cushion and gave it to her. I thought I was an idiot. She said it was the most romantic thing I’ve ever done.You’ve lived in Australia for quite a long time now. Is there anything about this country that you still don’t understand?It’s not that I don’t understand this but I think it is the greatest thing about this country, hands down, and it very rarely gets mentioned: the Saturday morning hardware store sausage. You don’t get that in the rest of the world! It’s the fact that it’s in every single town! Pretty much every Saturday, wherever I am in the country, I’ll do a park run then go and get a sausage. I can’t believe this hasn’t been adopted around the world.Ross Noble is touring his new live show, Cranium of Curiosities, around Australiauntil September, then the UK from October;check here for all dates.

She talks ADHD, big breaks and micro-resistancesSat 15 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTShareNatasha Rothwell pops up on video from the US looking super-glamorous in a silvery-grey dress, with her hair and makeup on point. Did we miss a memo about a dress code for our interview? “I’ve just come from an event and thought, even though you’re not filming this, you could at least admire,” she laughs. “You know what they say: share the hair and never waste a face.”Rothwell is currently stealing the show as spa manager Belinda in season three of HBO hitThe White Lotus– reprising her role from season one, for which she was Emmy-nominated. Having endured the whims of Jennifer Coolidge’s needy heiress in Hawaii, Belinda has now travelled to the titular resort in Thailand to take part in its wellness training programme. She’s “cosplaying as a guest”, as Rothwell puts it – and in the process both finding romance and uncovering a potential crime.The 44-year-old was born in Kansas but spent her childhood moving around the US due to her father’s job in the air force. She studied theatre at university, before becoming a high school drama teacher in the Bronx, while appearing in comedy clubs by night. Her first professional gig in showbiz was as a writer onSaturday Night Live.She found on-screen fame in Issa Rae’s hit comedyInsecureon HBO; Rothwell was originally hired as a story editor but her script readings in the writers’ room inspired Rae to cast her as Kelli Prenny, who became a breakout heroine. Last year, Rothwell created her own Hulu sitcom,How To Die Alone, about a lonely airport employee who has never been in love.Resplendent in her finery, Rothwell discussesThe White Lotus, her daily Donald Trump protests and recent ADHD diagnosis. “Kop khun ka”, as they say in Koh Samui.Was it always the plan to come back forThe White Lotusseason three or did it come out of the blue?It definitely wasn’t the plan. It was pitched as a limited series. I put the character away, thanked her and watched season two as a fan like everyone else. When Mike [White, the show’s creator] reached out about returning for season three, I was beside myself. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity that I got twice.London is like New York with an accent. It’s walkable, the theatre is incredible, you can drink a pint on the street and no one looks twiceHow was filming in Thailand?Beautiful but too hot. It teaches you a bit of Buddhism: want is the root of all suffering. I tried to stop wanting it to be cold and it did help. I just gave into the environment. Resisting it every day for five months was not going to be fun.Lisafrom K-pop bandBlackpinkplays health mentorMook. Were lots of Lisa fans hanging around?She is huge but also wonderfully ordinary. Kind, relatable and approachable. I even met her mum. She’s just the sweetest – then you see people peeking in, like “is that her? Scream!” I can’t imagine that kind of mega-wattage celebrity. I’m quite the hermit myself, so to see someone handle it with such aplomb was cool. She’s so young but so savvy.In episode one, Belinda is so pleasantly surprised to see a black couple in the hotel restaurant that she gives them a little wave. Have you had moments like that in your own life?I actually pitched that to Mike. I told him that when you see other people of colour travelling – particularly if they’re moving in spaces that are quite homogenous – you want to let them know that you see them. It’s something subtle that happens. I remember being in Ireland, at a castle on some misty moor, and a black family came out of the fog. I was wide-eyed. I didn’t know them from Adam but I just walked over and hugged them. I was so grateful that Mike added that part in.In the first season, was it a struggle not to laugh while shooting scenes with Jennifer Coolidge?She’s so deeply funny, it’s incredible. I cut my teeth in improv and sketch comedy, so fancy myself as pretty unflappable. But the moment where I’m singing a hymn to her and she sings it back, that wasn’t in the script. I remember biting the inside of my cheek, thinking “Don’t break, don’t break”.Apparently she’s keen for her villainous ex, Greg, to get his comeuppance and messaged you saying “Go get him, girl”?(Laughs)She’s been texting me throughout the series. Jen is so supportive and such a character. Audiences miss her, so I’m a surrogate, keeping the flame alive.View image in fullscreenRothwell in the third series of The White Lotus. ‘A once in a lifetime opportunity I got twice.’Photograph: HBOWe’re midway through the series. What’s in store for Belinda over the next four episodes?Expect the unexpected. That’s kind of a piss-poor answer but I can’t say much. You’ll see sides of Belinda that emerge when she’s confronted with fear. Stay tuned.You had a stint in the UK shootingWonka, in which you played plumberPiper Benz, and are a self-confessed anglophile. What is it that you like about it here?Believe it or not, I even love the shitty weather. It’s sunny all the time in LA. I don’t trust a person who’s always happy. You need inclement weather to appreciate the sunshine. London is like New York with an accent. It’s walkable, the theatre is incredible, you can drink a pint on the street and no one looks twice. I got addicted toGoggleboxandLove Island. I even got aLove Islandwater bottle for Christmas.The Officeis one of my all-time favourites. I was a David Brent purist and only watched the BBC original. When the US version came out, I refused to watch it at first.WasInsecurea gamechanger for you?Without question. Hands down, it changed my life. I had no idea the show would be that big, let alone that I’d become an actor on it, as well as a writer.Insecureunlocked something. It showed me that black female comedy could succeed. Young, plus-size actresses who are brown still come up and say “Kelli Prenny is on my wall!” For me, that inspiration was Nell Carter on [80s sitcom]Gimme A Break!That’s why representation is so important. It allows us to dream bigger.I consider the ADHD diagnosis a gift. I’m able to unmask some of my traits and let my freak flag flyYou used to teach at a high school in the Bronx. Tell us about that.I loved teaching theatre so much. My older sister has been in elementary education for over 25 years so I definitely “phoned a friend” a time or two. I always had the call to teach. Now I have several young writers and actors in LA that I mentor. It’s important to send the elevator back down. Besides, after teaching teenagers, nothing can scare you.Was it hard to get over the disappointment ofHow To Die Alonenot being renewed for a second series?You have to accept sometimes that things are unjust or unfair. This was a huge reminder of that. You can create a critically acclaimed, award-winning show that gets great numbers and it still not be enough. I’ve had to remind myself to be proud of what I put into the world and the effect that it had on people. The industry is tricky right now. Post-strike Hollywood is operating from a place of fear and that’s no way to make art. I hope to find it another home. My middle name is Faith, so I’m not going to have the funeral quite yet.Do you think comedy is underestimated? It rarely wins Oscars, for example.Absolutely, and I think it’s much harder. Great comedians make incredible dramatists and I don’t know if the opposite is true. George Saunders defined comedy as the truth told quickly. Comedians are fearless in their confrontation of the truth. That’s why I’m so grateful forThe White Lotus. It enables me to use my comedic training in a dramatic way. Comedy needs more respect.View image in fullscreenWith Yvonne Orji in Insecure.Photograph: Raymond Liu/Warner MediaWhat projects are in the pipeline for you?A series about [internet personality]Reesa Teesa, who found viral fame after a TikTok post about how she was hoodwinked by her husband. It’s my first role where I’m playing someone who’s living. It’s such a relatable story, set on the battlefield of love. Talk about resilience: she used her platform to tell everyone how she was taken advantage of, which was a radical act of vulnerability. It inspired me to have courage to be more vulnerable, so I hope the show can do the same.We admire your dedication totweeting “You are trash”at Donald Trump every day. How did that start?It’s a necessity. I’ve been doing it since his first term. I went on hiatus during Biden’s presidency but now I’m back. It’s just a reminder that what’s going on is not normal and to speak truth to power. It’s a micro-resistance but it makes me feel better. I never planned it as a daily thing. I sent the first one and the next day was like: “that motherfucker is still trash.” Until I get it out of my system and I feel everyone’s chanting the same thing, I’m going to keep doing it. People ask if I have an AI bot that does it for me. No, I roll over in the morning and if that idiot comes to my mind, I tweet it. I love that people have tuned into something so simple. It’s just a collective nod. We’re all in agreement, so let’s keep pushing.You were diagnosed with ADHD last year. Did things suddenly make sense for you?Massively. I’ve always felt a little neurospicy but have found ways to work with it and move through the world. Before diagnosis, I’d get frustrated at some of the symptoms. Understanding that it’s just my factory setting has made me accept who I am in total. I consider the diagnosis a gift. I’m able to unmask some of my traits and let my freak flag fly.What makes you happy when you’re not working?Did my therapist tell you to ask that?(Laughs) I’m actively pursuing a hobby that has nothing to do with my vocation. I love what I do so much that work/life balance can be tricky.

Does it symbolize the worst of American excess, or is it simply delicious?Lois Beckettin Los AngelesSat 15 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 10.03 EDTShareInLos Angeles, a strawberry – yes, one individual berry – is selling for $19.99. The berries are flown in from Japan, and Erewhon, a luxury grocery store, claims they’re so popular it’s hard to keep them in stock.The $20 strawberry, which has been labeled “dystopian” and a “social experiment”, went viral after a TikTok influencer filmed herselfeating itand saying “wow”. That video – produced by an influencer who happens to bepart of the family that owns Erewhon– quickly sparked a slew of copycats: fromearnest reviewstoparodiesandpranksand even anon-camera taste testby ABC news anchors. In one TikTok video, acomedian in a blond wigeats the strawberry while crooning to the “poors” watching his video: “This is something you could never afford … I’m going to taste it for you since you never will.”The strawberry – absurdly priced, with what must be a staggering individual carbon footprint – seemed like an example of elite decadence so extreme that it could only be the product of an empire in decline.When I emailed one prominent scholar of the Roman empire about the strawberry, he referenced Petronius’ Satyricon, in which the nouveau-richeTrimalchio serves his Roman guestsappetizers arranged in the form of zodiac signs, dormice rolled in poppyseeds and a roast boar filled with live birds.My job as a journalist in this moment was clear: I needed to taste the strawberry myself, and I needed to ask more scholars if the $20 strawberry was a sign of the approaching fall of the American empire.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Hieronymus BoschLuxury fruitHigh-end fruit has long been popular in Japan, whereprized melonsregularly cost hundreds of dollars andoccasionally sellfortens of thousands. In 2016, a single bunch of Ruby Roman grapes sold for more than a million yen – about£270 a grape.Erewhon, the only grocery store to have inspired both aLouis Vuitton perfumeand aBalenciaga collection, is not the first to introduce this luxury fruit trend to Americans. Oishii, a company that grows Japanese strawberries in the US,made headlines six years agofor selling a $50 box of strawberries that became trendy with American chefs, who liked to use them as the perfect minimalist end to an ornate omakase meal.The high-end fruit company Elly Amai said in a statement that its $20 berries “require a lot of skill and special techniques to grow” and, unlike berries in the US, “are meticulously monitored for quality and taste”.“The strawberries that don’t meet qualifications are not harvested by the farmers,” Elly Amai said, describing at least “two checkpoints” for the perfection of each berry, one in Japan by the farmer, and one when the berries arrive in the US.Other companies have also stepped up to ship luxury fruit from Japan directly to American consumers. Ikigai Fruits, which launched in 2023, sells “pearl white” Japanese strawberries that cost$128 a box, andextra-large “Bijinhime” strawberriesthat cost $258.Takeru Saito, a sales assistant at Ikigai Fruits, said the company had been founded in part to provide a boost to Japanese farmers, who have struggled to attract young people interested in taking over jobs that are labor-intensive and comparatively poorly paid. “The number of farmers is declining – and it’s an ageing population as well,” Saito said. A government report last year found that80% of Japanese farmers were over age 60. By selling very-high-quality fruit to an international market, Saito said, “more farmers can make money”.In Japan, Saito said, the appeal of luxury fruit is rooted in tradition: fancy produce is a traditional gift for weddings, job promotions and other ceremonial occasions. In the United States, the expensive fruits are more of a novelty. In a statement, Erewhon said that its $20 Elly Amai strawberries “are picked at their prime” in Japan and “hit the shelves at Erewhon within 28 to 48 hours”, which it described as “faster than broccoli growing in California getting to markets in New York”.Flying the berries to Los Angeles quickly enough to preserve their freshness “costs just as much as the fruits”, the grocery store said. It did not immediately respond to a question about the strawberries’ carbon footprint.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Hieronymus BoschEerily perfect berriesCalifornia farmers, who produce 90% of strawberries grown in the US, were selling strawberries in early March for about 10 to 14 cents each, according to estimates based on data from the California Strawberry Commission. That makes Erewhon strawberries flown in from Japan as much as 200 times as expensive as a local berry. Could they be 200 times as delicious?It took me several days of calling Erewhon store locations to finally find one with the strawberry in stock. On a Thursday, an employee told me the berries might arrive in the early afternoon. I rushed to the store at 1 pm, and was rewarded with the sight of nearly 50 single berries arrayed on a shelf.Each strawberry rested on an individual pedestal, which resembles a small domed jewel case, or, as one TikToker put it, a stage. An explanatory plaque from Elly Amai promised “an explosion of flavor that elevates the ordinary strawberry to extraordinary heights”.View image in fullscreenStrawberries at Erewhon versus strawberries at a regular grocery store.Illustration: Guardian DesignI found myself overwhelmed by the task of choosing one strawberry from the crowded shelf. Given the price tag, it felt like less a supermarket purchase than the start of a relationship. Which of these eerily perfect berries was the right one to bring into my life?The Onion had just published a satirical headline about Erewhonclaiming the $19 strawberry was “designed to be split”, but I took that idea seriously. As a naturally frugal person forced to consume Erewhon products for my job, I decided the $20 strawberry had to be divided between at least three people.I let the berry reach room temperature, as Elly Amai recommended, and then carefully transported it to a friend’s house, along with a control group of cheap supermarket strawberries that cost $4.99 for a box of 16.Examined close up, the contrast between the berries was startling. The $20 strawberry wasn’t any bigger than the cheap strawberries, but it looked very different. Its color was a uniform light red, and its skin was glossy. Each pore around each of its seeds looked smooth and firm, as if it had just emerged from a high-end fruit spa.I had lived in Los Angeles long enough to know that such beauty is not natural: this berry looked as if it had a personal trainer, a facialist and a team of dedicated stylists. The ordinary strawberry, in contrast, looked blotchy, its skin uneven and some of its pores swollen. Its leaves were long and disheveled.We cut the $20 strawberry into eight slices, like a miniature cake. I popped one slice into my mouth. It was sweet, firm, neither too crunchy nor overripe. “This is the platonic strawberry,” I admitted.We tried the ordinary strawberry next, but we might not have bothered: despite its deep red color, it tasted crisp and unripe, without much strawberry essence.We went back to eating our minuscule slivers of luxury strawberry, and riffing to each other on how to describe the taste. “It’s kind of like a dog breed – it’s been cultivated to be perfect over hundreds of generations,” my friend said.The more we ate, the more unsettled we felt: there was something uncanny about the flavor of the $20 strawberry, as if the process of perfecting a natural thing had been pushed past the point of human enjoyment. As my friend noted, it was impossible to taste this perfect strawberry without thinking about the hundreds or thousands of imperfect strawberries that had been discarded along the way.In the past, we had usually eaten at least a handful of strawberries at a time, and the variations in flavor were part of the experience: one berry was more ripe, one less ripe, one a little squishy, one very sweet. As children, the surprise of each berry was mesmerizing, and even as adults it carried some nostalgic pleasure.It felt a little sad, in the end, to eat just one strawberry and to know that each bite would be exactly and perfectly the same. The experience, my friend said, felt more like sniffing a Le Labo perfume than eating a piece of fruit.But what about Rome?Now that I had tasted the $20 strawberry, I still need to understand whether it was, in fact, a sign of cultural decadence so extreme that it might lead to an empire’s fall.I emailed Michael Kulikowski, a Penn State University classics professor. He had good news: the reason many people associated the fall of the Roman empire with cultural decadence, he said, was that most people knew only a few things about Rome, including that it was very decadent, and that it fell. In fact, he said, Rome’s most famously decadent periods came “300 years earlier” than the fall of the western Roman empire, at a time of imperial power, not imperial decline.Bryan Ward-Perkins, an Oxford historian and the author of The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization, made a similar point: the Satyricon, “the great literary testimony to Roman extravagant decadence”, was written in the first century AD, “when things were going very well”.Unfortunately, Kulikowski said, there were other signs that the American empire might be nearing its fall.Kulikowski argues that one reason the western Roman empire fell in 476, while the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, survived, was because the “1%” of the western Roman empire grew so powerful that they did not need a state to function.“They can withhold their taxes. When push comes to shove, they can raise their own private armies,” he said. In the eastern Roman empire, in contrast, the aristocracy was weaker, and they still found value in supporting the bureaucracy of the state.This was bad news for the current American empire: “We have reached a very late Roman western state where the 1% does not need the state to survive,” Kulikowski said. “If the US government stops being able to do much of anything, it stops to matter to them. That’s a real parallel.”The $20 strawberry did not concern him, but the coming effects of Trump’s tariffs did: “A better sign of the fall of the American empire will be when [in a week or two] a pint of strawberries is $12 at the mid-market supermarket,” Kulikowski told me.As someone whodoes not think about the Roman empirevery often, I found this analysis upsetting. I could only hope that future historians would get it right: whatever came next in the wreckage of empire, the $20 strawberry was not to blame.Explore more on these topicsFoodLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next thing for these players is that hopefully lots of them will get picked for the Lions.“I think the players have probably created some good headaches for Andy. They’re the kind of headaches you want to have as a coach. Lots of players putting their hands up and showing they should be on that plane with the Lions. A lot of our role is to get as many of these players on that plane as possible. Hopefully there will be a lot of England players heading down under in a few months’ time.”Borthwick also clearly believes Itoje would make an excellent Lions skipper. “I think Maro’s been absolutely outstanding. He leads by example and he’s stepped up his game. He’s improved in many areas in this campaign. I’d be fully confident in Maro to lead the Lions should Andy ask him.”Itoje preferred to salute his teammates following England’s lop-sided victory. “We have been building towards this and we are showing a different side to us. You have to be consistent even when results do not go your way, no matter the outside noise and scrutiny. The challenge for our team is to grow and get better.”Among England’s other stand‑out players in this tournament has been Ben Curry, who was named player of the match in Cardiff. “This is what you dream of,” said Curry, who started alongside his twin brother, Tom. “I have not had too many opportunities over the last couple of years and I love being a part of this team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Peato Mauvaka was shown a yellow card midway through the first half for making head-to-head contact with Ben White, following his deliberate lunge at the Scotland scrum-half after play had stopped.The incident was referred for a bunker review, which came back with the finding the contact had not been dangerous. Thus, the card remained at yellow, and Mauvaka returned to the field after 10 minutes in the sin bin.France win Six Nations title after Moefana’s double sinks ScotlandRead more“The decision not to raise it to a red card was because there was not excessive force,” said Townsend. “I’m not sure that is the criterion for a non-tackle incident. That was clearly not a tackle incident. It was after the whistle. So if there was head contact and that was intentional, it shouldn’t really have anything to do with the force.”The new 20-minute red card is meant to be reserved for technical offences generally in the tackle situation, where there is clearly no intent to harm. This incident did not qualify as such, so Townsend felt the referee ought to have issued a straight red himself. Once he had referred the incident to the bunker, the only option for upgrade was to a 20-minute red, which is not meant to apply to deliberate acts after play has stopped.“It was after the play. I feel sorry for Ben White, because he did nothing. He was pushed to ground, then he got collided in the head. I don’t know how it wasn’t raised to red. Whether that had anything to do with the final result, who knows. France are a quality side and deserved champions. They were the better side in the end. But I think [the bunker review system] gives referees an out. We’ve taken decision-making away from referees. That’s the process we have now to speed up the game, but you don’t want to miss incidents that are clearly red cards.”Townsend’s captain, Rory Darge, agreed that the incident looked like a red card in the moment, but both were adamant France deserved their win. Fabien Galthié, their coach, had been furious the weekend before about what he saw as foul play by Ireland, resulting in the loss of Antoine Dupont to serious injury. But Galthié was in jubilant mood.“I’m relieved,” he said. “We’re happy because we won. That was the goal. We achieved it, so the first feeling is happiness and joy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a low-budget Mexican sitcom that ran from the 70s to the 90s, centred on an eight-year-old orphan who lives in a barrel in an apartment complex. The boy is played by Roberto Gómez Bolaños, who was in his 40s when the series began and his 60s when it ended. Pretty much all the humour is derived from slapstick: situational farce, physical jokes, people getting their heads trapped in buckets. That kind of thing.Try to imagine ChuckleVision gone global, to the point where it was a genuine cultural touchstone for hundreds of millions, to the point where Paul and Barry Chuckle have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and are unable to walk through Manhattan without being mobbed. That’sEl Chavo. Even today it remains one of the most famous comic creations in the history of television: syndicated across the Americas, enthralling successive generations long after it was decommissioned. Including – at some point in early 2000s Uruguay – a young Darwin Núñez.‘I like to do normal things’: Virgil van Dijk maintains sense of perspectiveRead moreEl Chavo del Ocho(The Kid at No 8) is Núñez’s favourite TV programme. Naturally, I have my own theories about this. El Chavo – whose real name is never revealed – is a clumsy, oversized agent of chaos, often entirely oblivious to the mayhem he creates, pursued wherever he goes by comedy sound effects but possessed of an essential purity, a credulity, a heart of gold and a homespun wisdom that makes it impossible not to root for him, even when he’s doing incredibly stupid things. El Chavo, meet thine real-life avatar. His name is Darwin.Often you will hear it said that Núñez divides opinion. In fact the basic outline of Núñez is pretty much a consensus view at this point: entertaining, endearing and erratic, a richly talented player for whomLiverpoolpaid slightly over the odds, and who probably needs to be replaced with someone more reliable sooner rather than later. We can pretty much all agree on that. In a sense, there is perhaps no player who divides opinion less than Núñez.View image in fullscreenA mural to the character Don Ramón fromEl Chavo del Ochoin Montevideo, Uruguay.Photograph: Raúl Martínez/EPAWhat people are really talking about when they talk about Núñez dividing opinion is his inconsistency. The spectacular finishes, the spectacular misses and the vague whiff of slapstick that seems to follow him wherever he goes. There was a moment during Tuesday’s Champions League last‑16second leg against Paris Saint-Germainwhen Núñez out-sprinted Luis Díaz in pursuit of Virgil van Dijk’s long ball, only to remember about the potential offside flag and start running away from it, with Díaz already having stopped. It’s the 81st minute. You’re 1-0 down. And now, for the first time in your life, you decide to worry about offside?The orthodox view of Núñez’s Liverpool career is that he is simply a poor fit for what Arne Slot is trying to do: a cat trapped in a grand piano, a maverick in a team seeking immaculate control, of emotions as well as the ball. Virtually all his metrics are significantly down from the Jürgen Klopp era: goals, expected goals, expected assists, key passes, dribbles, touches, shots and shots on target. This season Liverpool perform a goal a game worse when he is on the pitch than when he is not. A big Liverpool clearout is expected this summer and the word is they will listen to a serious offer for Núñez.And so to Wembley on Sunday and a game that feels – for Núñez and Núñez alone – like a kind of last chance. Núñez may not start theCarabao Cupfinal against Newcastle. Diogo Jota could easily slot in up front; Díaz has intermittently impressed as a false No 9. At some point, whether it is for 90 minutes or 90 seconds, the skies will darken and Núñez will make his appearance: a one-man forcefield, a player who somehow bends the waves of the game around him.He was born into poverty, suffered a cruciate injury at the age of 19 that put him out of the game for a year and a half and convinced him he would never kick a ball again. If there is any kind of vulnerability there, it is one driven by pure hunger, the high-stakes caprice of a man who still expects nothing good to last long, who will make every moment count or die trying.There is one metric in which he has significantly improved this season: tackles and interceptions. With his minutes restricted, Núñez has tried to make every single one count. His goals against Brentford, Southampton and Aston Villa have been crucial in the title challenge. And for all the focus on his missed penalty in the shootout against PSG this week, his contribution to Harvey Elliott’s winning goalin the first leghas been almost forgotten.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Signed in the wake of Erling Haaland joining Manchester City, Núñez quickly found himself fitted for the role of talisman, immediately judged by goals and goals alone. Roberto Firmino, the man he partially replaced, went 13 league games without scoring in the 2019-20 title-winning season and it was fine. Núñez has never gone that long without a goal in his life and yet the perception persists – fuelled by a projection of the player people want him to be rather than the player he is – that he is some kind of gilded failure.He misses big chances. But so does Haaland, so does Ollie Watkins, so does any striker with the faith to put himself about, to make the right runs, to try. The Premier League has only been collecting “big chance” data since 2010 but in that time the three players with the most big misses are Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Sergio Agüero. Maybe we need to chill out a bit about the missing, particularly in a team evidently scoring more than enough for now.IsEl Chavo del Ochoa comedy or a tragedy? On first viewing, El Chavo is quite clearly a ridiculous comic figure. But, of course, over time, you begin to suspend your disbelief, to invest in the story, to embed yourself in the universe the writers created. He, too, grew up in poverty, was forsaken and ridiculed, and yet despite spending most of his time in a barrel has made himself a viable life, a reason to get up in the morning, a network of friends. For all the mishaps and chaos, the bonds between them endure.The real business of any football club is not the pursuit of numbers but the pursuit of memories. Divock Origi is still remembered fondly for the big goals he scored and Sunday’s final offers a similar chance for Núñez to write himself into the club’s folklore. He may have been signed on his numbers, but will bequeath only memories. His Liverpool future may well be beyond his control. But his legacy is not.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The draw is a rosy result for Newcastle, as they are sandwiched between them and have played a game fewer so have an opportunity to leapfrog City.Match day 29 for City and Brighton fired the gun on the final 10 matches and with many teams in the chase for a shot at the European Cup, final-day excitement surely awaits.Nottingham Forest beat Ipswich to maintain Champions League pushRead morePep Guardiola concurs. “It looks like it,” he said. “Nine games until the end of the season. I’m always confident. I am a master. I find positivity in ­everything. I know it will be difficult. Bernardo [Silva was injured] today, Ederson is injured again. Many things happen and we know it. Nine games, nine finals.”He was baffled at Jérémy Doku’s second-half booking by Simon Hooper for diving when the winger leaped over Jan Paul van Hecke to avoid being cleaned out. Guardiola said: “He doesn’t jump, he can break his leg. Jeremy is not a diving player. I said to the referee that if he doesn’t jump he can be kicked hard.”Fabian Hürzeler illustrated his mentality by downplaying what was a first Brighton point at the Etihad Stadium. “It is a fact,” the manager said. “But more is a disappointing feeling that we didn’t go home with three points. It is about chasing performance, getting to the next level. We showed an impressive performance, played our style and showed we can compete with any team in the league.”In a rollercoaster finish, host and visitor went close to snatching all three points. Nico González’s header smacked off Bart Verbruggen’s left post, then Carlos Baleba skied over with Stefan Ortega’s goal gaping. A point each felt fair, though, and each side remain what they have been all term. City are a powderpuff proposition, Brighton an improving force.Guardiola’s headline selection decisions had read as curios. To bench Phil Foden, Silva, Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne jarred as a route to seek victory. He is difficult to argue with and when Omar Marmoush skipped inside, Adam Webster chopped him down and Hooper awarded a penalty Erling Haaland converted, the masterplan was up and running 11 minutes in.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland puts Manchester City 1-0 up from the penalty spot.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBut this is City 2024-25, not the vintage that reeled off the past four titles. Moments before, Kaoru Mitoma had a strike disallowed for bundling into Orgeta at close range. Brighton’s fortunes had tipped 180 degrees but a front-foot approach suggested how they would prosper.They harried City, causing loose passes from Rico Lewis and González. When Haaland weaved into position to unload, Diego Gómez flew back to execute a slide-tackle that needed to be precise.As was Pervis Estupiñán’s equaliser. To the right of City’s D, the left-back struck a howitzer of a free-kick that ranged low, pinballing off the left post, Ortega a statue when he should have dived at least.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola speaks of how his unit is built for passes, but countless times these have been misplaced, as when Ortega’s hoof went straight to Brighton. Better geometry showed when Savinho and Marmoush exchanged measured balls and the Brazilian raced at Verbruggen’s goal. But, as he pulled the trigger, Van Hecke sprinted over and the attempt ballooned wide.Ilkay Gündogan was the next culprit to be imprecise, an effort being scuffed to safety. But the German compensated via a next act. González pilfered possession, tapped to Gündogan and he tapped to Marmoush. The Egyptian took a breath, then aimed a long-range finish off the left post and City led, again, with the break approaching.Seconds after, though, City’s fragility handed João Pedro a gilded opening. From a left-back zone Josko Gvardiol passed right, Rúben Dias and Abdukodir Khusanov dawdled, and João Pedro shot, narrowly missing.Khusanov was soon to find a goal, but the wrong one. At a Brighton corner from the left Webster headed on and Jack Hinshelwood stabbed at the ball: it was going wide but Khusanov somehow steered home.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverManchester CityBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It has been credited with inspiring the recent rise in popularity of the sport and been welcomed by F1’s owners and, for the most part, by teams and drivers. But questions have been repeatedly raised over the way stories are told and edited by its production company, Box to Box Films.‘You get hooked so quickly!’ How Formula 1: Drive to Survive became the apex of TV documentariesRead moreIn the latest season, released this month, Norris plays a prominent role in his fight for the title with Max Verstappen and has earned praise for his open attitude and honesty with the film-makers.However, before the first race of the season, Norris, who went on totake pole position during qualifying, was deeply unhappy with what he believes was the way producers manipulated footage, specifically to suggest he and Verstappen were at odds when the pair remain good friends.“They need to show the truth about people more,” he said. “I’m not a fan of fake stuff. I want facts, I don’t want made-up scripts and fabricated nonsense, which there is. The portrayal of Max and how we were against each other so much. They don’t need to create.“There’s drama, they can just show the facts of the drama. They don’t need to do anything more than that. They need to come back to reality a bit more, it’s drifted too far away.”Norris won his first grand prix in Miami last season, which was portrayed in the series as a close contest with Verstappen when in fact theMcLarendriver won comfortably. Verstappen was shown looking unhappy at the result, footage that had been filmed not in Miami but at the Dutch Grand Prix later that year. It has since been declared an “error” and removed.Verstappen had been pleased for his friend’s success and went out to celebrate with him that night. Norris was concerned that viewers may form opinions based on selective editing.“To portray someone in an incorrect way, people are going to have their opinions of that incorrect person, it’s almost lying in some ways,” he said. “I just don’t think that’s correct. I don’t think you can paint someone in the wrong picture when it’s not the truth. I don’t think it’s fair for anyone in the world, especially as it has such a big following and so many people love it, people believe what they see.”Verstappen has also long been critical of the series and has limited his participation in it. “I watched two episodes, but I was not very impressed. It’s just not my thing, faking rivalries,” he has said.Netflix began filming the eighth edition of Drive to Survive at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Norris acknowledged it had contributed to Formula One’s surge in popularity and understood why its behind-the-scenes access was so popular with fans, but felt it should shift the emphasis from drama to documentary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A post on Foster’s social media account on Saturday confirmed the split, with the bag man implying the decision was Fitzpatrick’s.Rounds of 78 and 72 meant Fitzpatrick comprehensively missed the cut at the Players Championship. On six events on thePGA Tourin 2025, the Englishman has finished no higher than tied 22nd. Foster was only due to caddie at around half Fitzpatrick’s tournaments this year, including next month’s Masters, but now the relationship has ended abruptly.Rory McIlroy relishing tougher test as storms head for Players ChampionshipRead more“Well, after six great years all good things come to an end,” said Foster. “This game never stops to frustrate you and infuriate you! Unfortunately times change and ultimately it is the caddie or the coach that has to accept results are not good enough and when you stop enjoying what you are doing, it is time for a change. Thanks Matt, we had a great run and who knows where the next chapter will go. Onwards and upwards.”Foster – who previously worked for players such as Seve Ballesteros, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke – famously had never been on the bag of a major winner during more than 40 years as a caddie. Fitzpatrick ended that run amidemotional scenes at the 2022 US Open. Fitzpatrick duly branded Foster as the greatest of all time. “This means the world to Billy,” said Fitzpatrick. “It’s unbelievable for him. I know it’s something he’s wanted for a long, long, long time. To do it is incredible.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Fitzpatrick has a win each on the DP World and PGA Tours since his glory at Brookline but has not built on that major success in the manner many predicted. He sits 61st in the world golf rankings, with a Ryder Cup return later this year already in serious doubt. It is intriguing that Fitzpatrick does not apparently believe Foster’s experience can assist with an improvement in fortunes, however, Foster is unlikely to be short of new employment offers.A chaotic day three at Sawgrass saw JJ Spaun claim a one shot lead over Bud Cauley. Spaun’s 12-under-par aggregate sees him four clear of Rory McIlroy, who birdied the last for a 73. On a leaderboard that is otherwise noticeably short of stardust Patrick Cantlay lurks at seven under. Scottie Scheffler tossed his club away in disgust after over-hitting his approach to the 18th. Yet at minus five, Scheffler cannot be counted out quite yet.With storms forecast, final round starting times have been advanced.

Not a change of manager from Manchester City, not a sublime individual goal from Aoba Fujino and not even the sand on the pitch. The Frenchwoman is unbeaten as Chelsea manager after 28 games and has secured the first of a potential quadruple this season.Chelsea’s 26th victory of the season was played on a surface their midfielder Erin Cuthbert told the BBC was not fit for a final and Bompastor, who clearly had higher hopes for the facilities in her first experience of a final in English football, agreed. “That’s a bit of a shame to have this pitch for a final, especially in England where you expect to have the best pitches in the world,” she said. “I’m not sure if it was a men’s final it would be the same.”Chelsea v Manchester City: Women’s League Cup final – liveRead moreThis was the 14th edition of the modern-day Women’s League Cup final and the first final, staged just down the road at Burton Albion’s supposedly inferior Pirelli Stadium, was played on a significantly better quality surface. Rachel Brown-Finnis, the former England goalkeeper who is now a TV pundit, called the surface substandard.Derby directed inquiries towards Women’s Professional Leagues Limited, whose stance appeared to be that they had identified a venue that would have the appropriate resources to produce a high standard of pitch.Nick Cushing clearly had no intention of using it as an excuse for Manchester City’s defeat, the interim head coach saying he thought the surface would be better at their own Joie Stadium on Wednesday. The two sides meet in the second of an unusual run of four consecutive games against each another.Cushing was taking charge of his first game back at the clubfive days after the sacking of Gareth Taylorand City did cause Chelsea plenty of problems. At multiple points in the first half especially, Chelsea were under the cosh as crosses bombarded their penalty area.But Yui Hasegawa inadvertently hooked into her own net 13 minutes from time when trying to deal with Mayra Ramírez’s right-wing cross and that decided the contest. This was after a superb, swerving strike from Hasegawa’s Japan teammate Fujino, which had Hannah Hampton well beaten at her near post, brought City level in the second half.Ramírez, a handful throughout, opened the scoring early in the first half when she broke clear on the counterattack and was able to score on the rebound after her initial strike was saved by Ayaka Yamashita. The Colombian had a glorious chance to make it 2-0 but fired wide after rounding the goalkeeper in a first half that required Chelsea to produce gutsy, last-ditch defending.View image in fullscreenAoba Fujino brings Manchester City level in the second half.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersIn the second half, Hampton produced a fine save to thwart Khadija Shaw in a one-on-one and held on to a left-foot Vivianne Miedema effort but despite Chelsea not being at their best they still maintained their winning habits.“The performance was maybe not a great one but we found a way to win the game,” Bompastor said. “I know this team has more than what we showed today.”Regardless of whether or not this was a pretty Chelsea display, Lucy Bronze’s strength was evident throughout and the England right-back was crucial to the move that led to the winning goal, battling down the right before the deadly cross was supplied by Ramírez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scarcely more than 50 days into his second presidential term, hapless Trump provides daily proofs of Merton’s universal “law of unintended consequences”.Rooted in ignorance, error, wilful blindness and self-defeating prediction, Trump’s rash actions produce contradictory, harmful and often opposite results to those he says he wants. The ensuing chaos characterises what may become the briefest honeymoon in White House history.Boomeranging US tariffs – which are to American prosperity what the Titanic was to ocean travel – are the tip of the unintended consequences iceberg. Defiant foreign retaliation has broughtstock market crashes and inflation fears– the exact opposite of what Trump promised voters.Trump won a mandate to make America great again, not greater – at least, not territorially. After his threats to invade Canada, loyal subjects of King Charles III are up in arms, booing the Stars and Stripes, boycotting US goods and retaliating with their own tariffs. Single-handedly, Trump has revived the fortunes of Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party. Under the new “elbows up” leadership of the former Bank of England chiefMark Carney, it has a good chance of winning this year’s election on an anti-Trump platform. That was not the plan.Likewise, Greenland’s voters, stung by a proposed Putin-style imperialist annexation,told Trump to take a hikelast week. They are undecided about independence but definitely reject US (or Danish) domination. Had there been any tea to spare in Nuuk, they would surely have tossed Trump and it into the harbour.Trump’s Ukraine surrender policy is another calamity. Russia is the aggressor, yet he punishes the victim. US pressure for a ceasefire is all one way – on Kyiv. This is emboldening Vladimir Putin to intensify attacks, notably in Kursk, whilestringing muggins Trump along.The prospective, unintended, consequences of an unjust peace are the undeserved rehabilitation of Russia, de facto amnesty for Putin’s war crimes, a precedent-setting ceding of sovereign territory seized by force, and a deep US-Europe split. So the question arises again: is this really unintended? Whether Trump is a stooge, KGB asset or plain stupid wasdiscussed here last week. Most probably, he has no real idea what he’s doing – or just doesn’t care. How else to explain his belief that proving himself right about tariffs is worth starting aglobal recession? Or that the ethnic cleansing of two million Palestinians in Gaza can bring peace?The explanation that Trump’s main concern is China, that he is trying to prise Moscow away from Beijing, is more upside-down thinking. These two authoritarian, anti-democratic states share a pernicious agenda: weakening and usurping the western-led, rules-based global order. Deliberately or not, Trump isassisting their ambitions.Surely even Trump and the underqualified toadies who advise him (no adults in the room in this White House) must realise that handing a humiliating victory to Russia does not bring closer lasting peace but future conflict with Nato neighbours and the US itself – while encouraging lawless behaviour all around. Perhaps they don’t realise. For unintended consequences, count on clueless dunces.Perhaps the scariest unlooked-for consequence of Trump’s serial blunders is accelerating nuclear weapons proliferation“Until him, no US president had been so ignorant of the lessons of history. Until him, no US president had been so incompetent in putting his own ideas into practice,”snarled the conservative commentator Bret Stephens. “Democracy may die in darkness. It may die in despotism. Under Trump, it’s just as liable to die in dumbness.”Merton described a foolish insistence on being right, despite all contrary evidence, as the “imperious immediacy of interest”. As the writer Rob Norton explains, “an individual wants the intended consequence of an action so much that he purposefully chooses toignore any unintended effects”. This is not true ignorance. It’s wilful ignorance.Perhaps the scariest unlooked-for consequence of Trump’s serial blunders is accelerating nuclear weapons proliferation. Alarmed by his threats to withdraw US protection, and shocked at the betrayal ofUkraine, Germany, Poland and South Korea are all urgently talking about obtaining an atomic bomb. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt have similar thoughts, for different reasons.Trump claims to want a nuclear-free world. “His policies are having the opposite effect,”wrote the analyst WJ Hennigan. “Thanks to Mr Trump… the perceived value of acquiring nuclear weapons among allies appears to have quickly gone up, while confidence in extended deterrence has gone down.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his self-appointed role as godlike peace-giver, Trump told Tehran to restart nuclear talks – or else. His “bullying” hasenraged Iran’s leaders. An Iranian nuke, and military confrontation with the US and Israel, is now more, not less likely.Acolytes and hangers-on take their cue from the boss in his looking-glass land of self-inflicted cock-ups and risible own goals. Vice-president JD Vance and technobrat Elon Musk gave European “liberals”a dressing-downlast month and endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party. The results are the reverse of what they expected.German voters rejected the new fascists,Musk’s businesses are boycotted, and the EU is forging a united front against Trump and Putin both. Ironically, the Vance-Musk standup act’s repellent backing for Russia has wrongfooted “fawning” European rightwing populists, includingBritain’s Nigel Farage. Centrists like Keir Starmer are enjoying a “Trump bump”.As Trump careers uncontrollably towards the 100-day mark, his approval ratings slide. He is alreadyless popular than Joe Bidenwas at a similar stage. His honeymoon is history. Before November’s election, he claimed, falsely, that America was in an unprecedented mess. Such exaggeration is what Merton, who coined the phrase, called a “self-fulfilling prophecy”. Now, unintentionally, it’s coming true.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs CommentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s not a shred of ambiguity about thatSat 15 Mar 2025 13.07 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 13.42 EDTShareIn diplomacy, focus is often on where we disagree. But Britain and our partners are stronger when we stand together. Last week’sG7 meeting made that clear.We arrived in Canada with real momentum. Our Ukrainian and American friends deserve a lot of credit for the breakthrough at Jeddah – with British diplomacy, from the prime minister down, making a big difference behind the scenes.With presidential envoy Steve Witkoff touching down in Moscow as we met in Quebec, it was crucial that Ukraine’s allies showed unity.Some may have doubted we could find common ground. But after 36 hours of talks, we agreed a clear set of messages – for Moscow, but also for Tehran and Pyongyang.We united in wanting a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, with Ukraine remaining democratic, free, strong and prosperous. We want to see the fighting stop, and for that to endure.We united in supporting a 30-day ceasefire on air, land and sea ­without conditions. We want to use this as a window to agree terms ensuring a just and lasting peace.And we united on what is required to make this happen. As President Trump has said, Putin can choose the easy way or the hard way. We all recognise the risk that Russia tries to string this process out with unreasonable conditions, while continuing to pummel Ukraine. But however Putin chooses to play this, we are focused on action in three areas.First, keeping up the pressure on Russia. For Moscow to negotiate seriously, there can be no let-up in our efforts. We are working hard on new measures to target their energy and defence sectors and utilise frozen Russian assets.The unity of the past week has put the ball firmly in Russia’s courtSecond, keeping up our support to Ukraine. The US lifting their pause on military and intelligence support was extremely welcome. But the US is right that Europeans need to bear their share of the burden. We are stepping up, putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position now and in any peace that follows.Third, we have to create the conditions that guarantee Russia does not come back for more. Together with France, we are establishing a coalition of the willing able to deter Putin from invading again. To be credible, it will need US support. But Britain and our allies recognise that the bulk of the contribution must come from Europeans. While I was in Canada at the G7, the defence secretary was in Paris meeting his counterparts, and the national security adviser was in Washington. On Saturday, the prime minister held a further leaders’ meeting, and this week thechiefs of defence staff will conveneanother military planning meeting. At this critical moment for European security, we are stepping up and leading this effort on multiple fronts, as part of our Plan for Change with national security at its foundation.The unity of the past week has put the ball firmly in Russia’s court. Putin’s aggressive actions over many years have shown his character. The proposal for ceasefire is therefore a test. He can’t simply say he is ready to end this war – he has to prove it.The G7’s unity extended beyond Ukraine. We will keep supporting the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, that sees all hostages freed, unhindered aid into Gaza and a political pathway to a lasting solution. We will back an inclusive political transition in Syria, up the pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme, and keep the spotlight on the terrible conflicts in Sudan and DRC.Republican Russophilia: how Trump Putin-ised a party of cold war hawksRead moreAnd we agreed a new Canadian-led initiative on maritime security – an example of strong leadership from one of our closest allies. With growing threats to freedom of navigation from the Red Sea to the South China Sea, growth in all our economies relies on a strong collective response.This year marks 50 years since a small group of western leaders first met just outside Paris – the origins of the G7. Those leaders did not agree on everything. Three were from the political left, three from the right. It was a time of upheaval – war, recession, changes in the multilateral system. Many in the democratic world were pessimistic about our ability to navigate a challenging global order.But that generation of politicians rose to the challenge. The G7 format represented a willingness to try something different. The leaders were able to be honest with each other. And this allowed them to find common ground.Today, we must rise to a new set of challenges. This requires that same spirit of honesty and common purpose. We and our allies are showing that spirit right now.David Lammy is UK foreign secretaryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The behemoth in question is Meta, and whenCareless People,a whistleblowing book by a former senior employee, Sarah Wynn-Williams, came out last week, its panic-stricken lawyers immediately tried tohave it suppressedby the Emergency International Arbitral Tribunal. This strange institution obligingly (and sternly) enjoined Wynn-Williams “from making orally, in writing, or otherwise any ‘disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments to any person or entity concerning [Meta], its officers, directors, or employees’ ”. To which her publisher, Macmillan,issued a statementthat could succinctly be summarised thus: “Get stuffed.”Clearly, nobody in Meta has heard ofthe Streisand effect, “an unintended consequence of attempts to hide, remove or censor information, where the effort instead increases public awareness of the information”. The company has now ensured that Wynn-Williams’s devastating critique of it [see our review inthe New Review] will become a world bestseller.Among the many delicious ironies here is thatMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s Supreme Ruler, who has recently become a loud advocate of “free speech” – or at least free speech as understood by the Trump regime – is trying to suppress Wynn-Williams’s troublesome speech. The old-fashioned term for this is hypocrisy. But then her six years spent in the Supreme Leader’s inner circle will have inured her to that.She’s also a canny operator. Meta clearly had no idea this was coming. She adapted the playbook used by Frances Haugen,an earlier Facebook whistleblower, lodging a complaint in advance of publication with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – andbriefing theWashington Poston its contents; recording a compellinginterview with Emily Maitlistwo weeks before publication; and adding a real coup de grace – an appearance on Steve Bannon’shilarious podcast.What really infuriated him was that there was one huge area of the world – China – that was closed to himWhat comes across most forcibly from Wynn-Williams’s account is the extent to which Meta is really just a corporate extension of its Supreme Ruler’s personality, reminiscent of what Microsoft was like when Bill Gates ran it. Zuck’s special shareholding means that he has complete control of the company. In itsregular SEC filings, there is always a paragraph that makes it clear that he could even sell the company against the views of all shareholders and its board.The result is that Meta, as a corporation, always follows Zuck’s obsessions. For many years, that was about ensuring exponential growth in user numbers. Zuck viewed the world much as board-game fanatics view games of conquest. And what really infuriated him was that there was one huge area of the world –China– that was closed to him. In the 78-page document that Wynn-Williams filed to the SEC (and which theWashington Postclaims to have seen), it was alleged that Meta had for years been making numerous efforts to get into the biggest market in the world.These efforts included: developing a censorship system for China in 2015 that would allow a “chief editor” to decide what content to remove, and the ability to shut down the entire site during “social unrest”; assembling a “China team” in 2014 for a project to develop China-compliant versions of Meta’s services; considering the weakening of privacy protections for Hong Kong users; building a specialised censorship system for China with automatic detection of restricted terms; andrestricting the account of Guo Wengui, a Chinese government critic, after a Chinese internet regulator suggested it would improve cooperation. These corporate efforts only stopped after it became clear that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden viewed China as a strategic threat to the US.The time has come for Starmer & Co to grow some backbone and stop drinking the Kool Aid about AIIn her time atMeta, Wynn-Williams observed many of these activities at close range. In that sense, perhaps the most useful thing about her whistleblowing is that it provides an intimate picture of what a major tech company is really like. What strikes the reader is that Meta and its counterparts are merely the digital equivalents of the oil, mining and tobacco conglomerates of the analogue era. And they’re all US companies that have cosied up to Trump, which means that their interests are now inextricably intertwined with those of the American state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The story closely follows the instructions. The individual sentences mostly make sense. But – with the greatest respect to Jeanette Winterson, who called the story “beautiful and moving” – it is an atrocious piece of writing.The AI captures the tone of some of the worst writing around: pompous and self-satisfied, while using sentimental imagery (“a girl in a green sweater who leaves home with a cat in a cardboard box”) and dull similes (“like a stone dropped into a well”). There is repetition without development, poor structure, an over-reliance on jargon and, crucially, a lack of that slight breath of madness that makes writing human. If this were a first-year creative writing student, you’d give them feedback to help them improve, but you probably wouldn’t discourage them from pursuing other job prospects.It is in the gaps between what the author has written and what the reader imagines that writing comes to life. Readers will project meaning on to words on a page, but if those gaps are created by algorithms and chance, the act of creation on the reader’s part becomes onanistic; the death of the author requires the author to have been alive at one stage.I asked another AI model to critically evaluate the story, and it found it “compelling” and “self-aware”, employing “evocative language and imagery”. Perhaps it was not written for human eyes at all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What’s the point of a Labour MP who votes for something so cruel, tin-eared and short-sighted?John McDonnellTreating disabled and sick people callously flies in the face of all the party stands for – the government must rethink its plansJohn McDonnell accuses ministers of lacking empathy over benefit cutsSat 15 Mar 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 09.53 EDTShareEmails are pouring into MPs’ boxes from disabled people and carers, who are truly frightened by the suggestions from government sources and ministers’ speeches that the benefits they rely on are to be cut.The latest comments to a journalist from someonedescribed as a“government insider” demonstrate starkly what a tin ear some ministers have on this issue. This person accused Labour MPs who are expressing their constituents’ concerns about proposals to cut benefits of “pearl clutching”.It’s clear that some politicians have learned nothing from thewinter fuel payment debaclethat is still being raised angrily on the doorstep with Labour canvassers. More importantly, they appear to have learned nothing from the introduction of the work capability assessment for disabled people, associated with nearly600 suicide deathsin England between 2010 and 2013.As so many have said, the callousness of this treatment of disabled and sick people is not theLabourway. It prompts the question: why become a Labour MP if you are to vote for a policy that flies in the face of all that Labour has ever stood for?We’ve heard that there is a moral argument to justify the government’s plans. There is definitely a strong moral argument for providing professional and empathetic support to help people get into work if they are capable of doing so. There is no moral case for propelling even more people into poverty by cutting benefit levels, or denying access to financial support to those who have no alternative.The lack of understanding and empathy in the government’s policy planning and articulation has been shocking. Report after report has been published by thinktanks and specialist charities, including the Institute for Employment Studies, theResolution Foundationand theJoseph Rowntree Foundation, to explain the plight of sick and disabled people; how the numbers have risen and the best ways to tackle this issue.Although people are living longer, they are not necessarily living longer healthy lives. The increase in the retirement age has meant that many simply cannot physically manage to work until their retirement age. Therise in young people claiming benefitsfor sickness and disability, especially related to mental health conditions, has to be understood in the context of this austerity generation coming on to the books.Throughout my time as shadow chancellor, I, along with many charities and professional bodies, highlighted the impact the massive cuts in social care were having. They prevented those early interventions to support families and young people by social workers and expert specialists that could identify and tackle emerging problems before they worsened.We are now reaping the cumulative impact of the austerity measures sown by Tory chancellors. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, gets all this and appeared to be working to design a system whose underlying principle was supporting sick and disabled people, not penalising them. She recognised that this needs investment in the short term to bring the professional resources together, but that it would pay off in the longer term.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, obviously gets it because he was putting in place an extra8,500 mental health workersto address the mental illness challenges we have within our society.All that meaningful, positive, policy preparation seems to be being ridden over roughshod by the Treasury, whose demand for cuts appears to have risen from the£3bn planned by the Toriesto£6bn now. The obsessive and misjudged adherence to out-of-date fiscal rules by the Treasury is knocking this government off course.Ruling out increased taxes on the wealthiest when groups such as the Patriotic Millionaires are calling for them also appears dogmatic and foolish. And with such an overwhelming majority in the Commons, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have no fear of losing any votes in parliament.Dear Rachel Reeves: if there is no alternative to cuts, at least do them with care | Polly ToynbeeRead moreHowever, many Labour MPs are waking up to the fact that moves such as cutting the winter fuel payment, and now disability benefits, could very easily lose them their seats. Reform UK could exploit the unpopularity of these policies and build a base in their constituencies to springboard into the next election.There are only a few days left before the publication of the green paper on welfare benefits and just over a week before the spring statement.There is still time for the Labour cabinet to act like a cabinet, and for its members to stand up to the Treasury to halt the cuts in benefits to the sick and disabled, and to insist on a more flexible interpretation of the fiscal rules and a limited set of tax measures. That would follow Starmer’s guiding principle that the broadest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden.John McDonnell is MP for Hayes and Harlington.

(Eggs are now $30 a dozen.) You fire off a few angry tweets about abortion rights and go to bed. In the middle of the night armed police break down your door and arrest you for destabilizing the security of the state. You are detained and then – if you hold citizenship elsewhere – deported.Not so long that sort of scenario happening in the US, where the first amendment protects free speech, would have been implausible. Now, however? It’s creeping closer. As I write this, the Columbia University graduateMahmoud Khalilis in immigration detention after being arrested and marked for deportation because of his pro-Palestinian activism.The pink protest at Trump’s speech shows the Democrats aren’t coming to save usRead moreGreen card holders can normally only be stripped of their immigration status if they have been convicted of a crime, which Khalil has not. But the Trump administration is rooting around to find any possible excuse to deport Khalil and make an example of him. Earlier this week,Donald Trumpcalled Khalil’s arrest the first “of many to come”, and said he would deport students he said engage in “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity”. And let’s be very clear here: doing anything in support of Palestinians – or simply existing as a Palestinian – seems enough to count as being “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, [and] anti-American” for Trump, who has repeatedly used the word“Palestinian” as a slur.The significance of Khalil’s detention, the enormity of the current moment, can’t be overstated. “This seems like one of the biggest threats, if not the biggest threat to first amendment freedoms in 50 years,”saidBrian Hauss, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. “It’s a direct attempt to punish speech because of the viewpoint it espouses.”While the Trump administration may have instigated Khalil’s arrest, I want to be clear that what’s happening right now isn’t just down to Trump. We did not go from zero to attempting to deport green card holders for political activism in a matter of weeks. The Biden administration’s brutal crackdown on student protesters led to this moment. University officialscooperatingwith this crackdown on protesters led to this moment. The mainstream media’sdehumanization of Palestiniansled to this moment.Indifference to US-sponsored suffering in Gaza and the West Bank also led to this moment. One of the most depressing things about the past 17 months has been seeing how many people in the US seem unbothered that what many experts havetermed a genocideis being committed with their taxpayer dollars. But what’s far worse than ignorance and indifference is cowardice: the people who know a grave injustice is being committed but who are too self-interested to speak out.What I have tried to say over and over again to those people in my writing is thatyour silence will not save you. Palestinian rights, trans rights, women’s rights: these are not separate issues. Unless you are a Maga supporter at the top of the food chain, the Trump administration will be coming for you too. This crackdown on free speech and political activism is not going to end with Khalil, or with pro-Palestine activism.We are not headed to uncharted territory: examples of where Trump seems determined to head are all around us. Look at Saudi Arabia, for example, where Salma al-Shehab (who was finally freed in February) spent more than four years imprisoned on terrorism-related charges forposting tweetsin support of women’s rights and retweeting Saudi women activists. She was charged, among other things, with “disturb[ing] public order, [and] destabiliz[ing] the security of society and the stability of the state” and, at one point, was sentenced to 34 years in jail. She spent almost 300 days in prolonged solitary confinement, according to Amnesty International.Look too at Israel’s use of “administrative detention” – detention without charge or trial that can berenewed indefinitely. Last year, for example, Israeli troops took 23-year-old Layan Nasir away at gunpoint from her parents’ home in the West Bank; there were no arrest warrant or charges, and her parents weren’t notified of where she was held. She was finally released after eight months, but only – one imagines –because she is Christian and her case got the attention of people like theArchbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Thousands of other Palestinians arecurrently rottingin Israeli prisons without any sort of timeline for charges or a trial.Look at Russia, where women areincreasingly being targeted and prosecutedunder the war censorship laws. Eighteen-year-oldDaria Kozyreva, for example, is facing years in prison for criticizing the Ukraine war in a media interview and for pinning a poem of a 19th-century Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko, to his monument in St Petersburg. She was also expelled from her university for her activism.It should be clear by now that America is not exceptional; the constitution is not a magical document that will protect our freedoms simply by existing. We are sliding towards an authoritarian future at alarming speed and Khalil’s detention is an important reminder that we can’t fight for our rights in isolation. All of our freedoms are intertwined.Texas bill would make identifying as transgender a felonyThe first-of-its-kind bill would charge transgender people with “gender identity fraud” and potentially lead toup to two years in jail. It was filed by a Republican state representative, Tom Oliverson, and has no co-sponsors. Basically, it is unlikely to get passed but is a scary example of where some Republicans want to head.Abortion pill prescriptions are now being tracked in parts of the USLast year, Louisianapassed a first-of-its-kind billreclassifying misoprostol and mifepristone, commonly known as “abortion pills”, as “controlled substances”.Insider reports that, as of March, Louisiana clinicians are required to log every mifepristone and misoprostol prescription they write into a prescription monitoring database run by Bamboo Health. This sort of monitoring (of pills that were approvedmore than two decades ago!) will have serious consequences. Doctors may not prescribe abortion pills as much because they are worried they will be investigated; patients may be scared about taking them.Former Texas megachurch pastor and Trump adviser indicted for child sex crimesIt’salways the peopleyou most expect, eh?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

America raises about $3tn each year from income taxes. The nation also imports about $3tn worth of goods each year.Trump keeps saying other countries pay for tariffs. That’s not how they workSo to replace income taxes, tariffs would have to be at least 100% on all imported goods. Also, Americans would have to continue to import $3tn worth of goods every year. Neither of these is remotely plausible.The second problem is who pays.Trump keeps saying other countries pay for tariffs. That’s not how they work.Tariffs are in effect taxes on imported products. They’re paid by Americans.Say there’s a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. When Walmart imports Mr Coffee machines from China (where they’re made), China doesn’t pay the 60% tariff to the US government. Walmart does.If Walmart had bought the coffee machine for $20 before the tariff, the 60% tariff requires Walmart to pay an extra $12 – bringing the total cost of each coffee machine to $32.Walmart doesn’t want that extra $12 to cut into its profit margin, so it will try not to absorb that cost. Instead, it will pass the extra $12 on to its customers.Walmart’s CEOhas already saidit expects to raise prices in response to Trump’s tariffs in order to protect its profits.Now,targeted tariffscanbe used to protect industries critical to national security.This is what the Biden administrationdidwhen itlevied tariffson Chinese electric vehicles, solar panels,computer chipsand batteries after makingmassive domestic investmentsin these technologies.But Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on almost all imports – particularly from America’s largest trading partners.While Americans will pay more for imported goods due to tariffs, countries that export the products to America are also harmed because Americans presumably will buy fewer of their coffee makers and anything else they sell in the United States that now costs more. These countries are retaliating by raising tariffs on American exports.On Monday, China began imposing tariffs on a range of American farm products, including a 15% levy on chicken, wheat and corn.These retaliatory tariffs will hurt America’s farm belt – mostly Republican states and Trump voters.On Wednesday, after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all aluminum and steel imports coming into the United States from the rest of the world, the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on about $28bn worth of American exports, including beef and whiskey.Not incidentally, Europe’s retaliatory tariffs are on goods mostly produced by Republican states (think Kentucky bourbon). Europe is also slapping tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, made in America’s rust belt.On Thursday, in response to Europe’s tariffs, Trumpthreatened a 200% tariffon all alcoholic products from EU member states. If he follows through, Trump voters will be paying more for much of the alcohol they consume.Canada also announced new tariffs on about $21bn worth of US products.This is called a trade war. There are no winners in such a war.One of the biggest global trade wars started with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. After the 1929 stock market crash, President Herbert Hoover and Republicans thought sweeping tariffs would help the economy.They didn’t. Import prices surged, and exports plummeted because of other nations’ retaliatory tariffs. Global trade fell by66%, worsening the Great Depression.Smoot-Hawley seemed to prove that across-the-board tariffs don’t work. Then came Trump’s first term and his sweeping tariffs,largely on China.Higher prices from Trump’s first-term tariffs onthousands of Chinese importsare estimated to have cost American families close to$80bn.This cost took a larger chunk out of the incomes of poorer families than richer ones.If you make $50,000 a year, the cost of a coffee maker that rises due to tariffs affects you more than it does someone making $1m a year who can better afford the price increase.To put it another way, tariffs are a highly regressive tax.Following Trump’s first-term tariffs on China, Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs on American exports. This led China to import less from America.In the US agriculture industry alone, the result was a$27bnlossin exports from mid-2018 to the end of 2019. Even though the governmentincreased aidto affected farmers, farm bankruptcies shot up20%.Another consequence of Trump’s first-term trade war was that American manufacturingshrank,as demand for exports slumped and as raw materials used in manufacturing became more expensive.One study estimates that Trump’s first-term trade war cost nearly300,000 American jobs.Instead of learning a lesson from this fiasco, Trump is now promising even bigger tariffs –more tariff hikeson China and, starting on 2 April, 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.These new tariffs would cost the typical American household an additional$1,200this year. If Trump makes good on previous pledges to slap more tariffs on imports from around the world in addition to aluminum and steel, American families can expect to spend as much as$4,000more.Trump says he’ll use the revenue from tariffs to “offset” more of his big pending tax cut.That tax cut will disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans and big corporations, as did Trump’sfirst-term tax cut.But revenue raised from tariffs will be coming disproportionately from average working people.Hence, it will be a massive transfer of wealth from most Americans to the super wealthy and giant corporations.Will most Americans know that the higher prices they’ll pay for groceries, gas, housing and all sorts of other things will be going into the pockets of the wealthy? Will they know whom to blame?Trump was able to fool most Americans during his first term into believing he had created a marvelous economy for them and that they benefited from his tariffs and tax cuts.It was a lie, of course. But he tells lots of lies that many Americans believe. Will he be able to do it again, on a much larger scale?Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Peace at any price is no peace at allSat 15 Mar 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 13.43 EDTShareAhalt to the killing in Ukraine is a highly desirable aim. A permanent end to the war would be a truly wonderful achievement. Who would not welcome an agreement that stopped Russia’s daily slaughter of civilians and its destruction of Ukraine’s cities, and which allowed millions of displaced people to return home? But peace at any price is no peace at all, as history shows and we have repeatedly argued here. In his untutored haste, Donald Trump risks rushing into abad deal with Vladimir Putinthat could set the stage for renewed conflict in Ukraine and other vulnerable countries bordering Russia and for an overall weakening of Europe’s security.The initial 30-day truce under discussion by US and Russian officials reportedly entails a complete halt to fighting and temporary freezing of the frontlines in eastern Ukraine. It provides for the exchange of prisoners of war, release of civilian detainees and return from Russia of abducted Ukrainian children. The truce could be extended. But Russia’s president is adamant that, before it even begins, many complex, longer-term issues must be addressed, including the most fundamental:Ukraine’s future as an independent, sovereign state.This attempt by Putin to set highly problematic conditions must be firmly resisted by Trump and western leaders. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, it is a transparent bid to delay and manipulate the negotiations and win broader concessions, while allowing Moscow’s forces time to pursue battlefield gains, notably in Russia’s contested Kursk region. It is not reasonable to insist on a halt to military aid to Kyiv during a truce. Putin’s demand that the historical “root causes” of the conflict be examined is acynical trap, set to gain wider advantage.Putin’s tactics are familiar. He raises hopes of a breakthrough, then finds reasons why it must remain elusive. He lies about the situation at the front, as in his false claim that Ukrainian troops are encircled in Kursk. He flatters and plays Trump like a fish on a line, congratulating him for “doing everything” for peace and exploiting the US president’s ego-driven need to keep his promise to end the war. Putin is brutally clear about his war aims: a neutral, disarmed Ukraine led by a Moscow-friendly government. His wider objective is an end to international ostracism, the lifting of sanctions and a remaking of Europe’s security architecture to suit his post-Soviet vision. All this to be achieved by a dramatic reset in US-Russia relations, as gaily offered, inexplicably, by hisfriend in the White House.Trump should remember this war would end today if Putin wished. He should understand Putin does not want peace, he wants victoryBefore making more unforced concessions, Trump should study this threatening agenda. He should remember this war would end today if Putin wished. He should understand Putin does not want peace, he wants victory. He should stop regurgitating Russian propaganda. Most of all, he should stop bullying Zelenskyy and start applying substantial, painful pressure onRussiato stop and reverse its illegal, unjustified invasion. The fact that Trump is unlikely to do any of this goes to the heart of the problems surrounding the talks. For all his self-important bluster and insincere compassion, the “master dealmaker” does not have a plan extending beyond an immediate halt to the gunfire. Putin certainly does.Trump’s optimism that a good agreement can be reached has little basis in fact. Keir Starmer, at least, is aware of this. He says Putin is not serious about peace and should stop “playing games”. The prime minister’s latest attempt to rally European and other allies around a ceasefire deal backed by credible, in-theatre security guarantees is worthwhile. He spent Saturday discussing his “coalition of the willing” proposal via video conference.But Starmer surely knows that Trump’s mishandling of the negotiations so far, his daily attempts to win personal credit for imaginary progress, his persistent exclusion of the Ukrainians and his biased pressurising of Kyiv but not Moscow is unlikely to end well. No peacekeeping force, whether under a Nato, EU or UN flag, can be deployed inUkrainewithout viable security guarantees, principally from the US – which Trump withholds. Nor can it happen without Putin’s agreement – and he is vehemently opposed.The evident danger for Britain and Europe is that they may be strong-armed by Washington into endorsing and policing a flawed, short-term ceasefire cooked up by Trump and Putin that does not serve, and potentially undermines, their long-term objective: securing a free, sovereign Ukraine and imposing a cautionary defeat on Russian aggression. Putin says he and Trump will talk again by phone. Who knows what Trump will give away next in his hurry to claim the mantle of Nobel peacemaker, shaft his old foe Zelenskyy andappease his ex-KGB chum?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has already dashed its Nato membership hopes. He has already cut military aid and intelligence assistance once, refused to guarantee the peace and publicly shamed Zelenskyy in front of the world. And if a ceasefire fails to materialise, even in lopsided form, it’s a safe bet Trump will find a way to blame Kyiv. This man is no honest broker. He is no friend to Ukraine or Europe. Like Putin, he cannot be trusted to build or honour a just and lasting peace. A truce, on fair and reasonable terms that Kyiv can freely accept and that can be adequately monitored and effectively enforced, would be a wonderful first step. In its absence, Ukraine must fight on and Britain, as ever, must support it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He said and his colleagues knew they would be holding Labour to account, but did not expect to be as disappointed as they have been.In recent weeks, Labour has given the green light toairport expansionand vowed to change planning rules to deprioritise nature, while ministers have repeatedly disparagedbats and newtsand ridiculed measures to protect fish. The chancellor Rachel Reeves has suggested economic growthtrumps the government’s legally binding targetof reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and there are suggestions the national wealth fund, meant for green projects, will becoopted for defence.Ramsay said: “This whole depiction the government’s coming up with is completely false and actually extremely dangerous, because green spaces are crucial to people’s wellbeing, crucial to the natural environment, and we can and must do development in a way that not just protects nature … the government is signed up to a requirement to restore 30% of land and sea in the UK for nature by 2030.“And whenLabourtalks about growth versus nature, it sort of castigates communities who are working to protect their community, protect the environment from being trodden on by a planning system that that should be there to protect them, but the government’s looking at removing those safeguards.”Ramsay also questioned whether Boris Johnson was a greener prime minister than Keir Starmer, saying: “[Johnson] did have some understanding of the need to regenerate the natural world, which Labour are very weak on. While there were early signs of some positive moves on renewable energy targets, that’s now being undermined by climate-wrecking decisions around things like airport expansion.”Ramsay, who is co-leader with fellow MP Carla Denyer, has had a bruising start to his parliamentary career. One of hisbiggest criticshas been Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, who has accused him of being against renewable infrastructure.Miliband’s criticisms of Ramsay have resulted in the Green MP being labelled the “UK’s nimby-in-chief” after he used his first day in parliament tocall for a pause on plans for a route of 520 pylons passing through his constituency. Ramsay says he is representing his constituents, who want alternatives to pylons to be discussed before they are built. His critics, including Miliband, say alternatives are too slow and expensive to implement and will impede the government in reaching its target to decarbonise the grid by 2030.Before Ramsay was an MP, he was for many years a Green councillor and worked for renewables campaign groups. Of being referred to as a nimby, he said: “I think that the claims are so absurd that they are laughable. I mean, people have called me Mr Renewables, because my whole career and campaigning background since I was a teenager has been in advancing action on climate and in particular action on renewables. I’m the first to say we’ve got to see more renewables.”MPs for the rightwing Reform party have also opposed pylons as part of their drive to cancel net zero, of which Ramsay said: “Reform have jumped on a bandwagon quite recently. There’s been a cross-party group with the other four parties in East Anglia, working on these issues for some time.” He said the party was “selling people a pup” because “they’re trying to pretend that they’re there to support the ordinary person, but their policies would undermine the NHS, allow the ultra-rich plutocrats from abroad to buy up our democracy, and crucially, would stop the drive for net zero, which will bring down people’s bills and keep people’s homes warm.”There are also rumours that Labour is considering weakening plans aimed at ensuring all new homes are powered by renewables. Government sources say new homes will be “technology agnostic”, allowing housebuilders to meet climate targets how they like, rather than mandating solar panels and heat pumps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And the only reason the government wouldn’t do this is if they caved into the developers, because it’s a win-win all the way around.”Ramsay said he would continue to challenge Miliband. “My challenge toEd Milibandis, don’t undermine the whole of your national strategy by allowing this major airport expansion to go ahead,” he said.“Don’t allow the whole of your carbon plan to be completely undermined by allowing the new Rosebank oilfield. They’re failing to focus on energy efficiency, how we insulate people’s homes to bring bills down, you’ve got to look at energy reduction as well as renewables if we’re going to deliver a green future.“And in terms of nature, they’re actively opposing the nature restoration agenda with this damaging suggestion that that economic success and nature are somehow at loggerheads.

On Christmas Eve the sports fashion chain’s owner,Frasers Group, received an early festive gift: planning permission to build a 371,600 Sq metre 4m sq ft headquarters near Ansty. The vast development – which will host a hotel, shop and recreational facilities for its 7,600 workers – puts the business on a collision course with concerned local people and thousands of existing staff who the Unite union say are unlikely to be able to move from its current East Midlands head office.The plans for Antsy are a typical shock and awe move forMike Ashley, who owns 73% of Frasers. Over four decades, the billionaire has built a reputation as a relentless deal-maker who has seen off a string of powerful rivals to become the de facto king of the high street and an enigmatic figure whose motives are frequently guessed at.View image in fullscreenSports Direct’s current distribution hub, in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.Photograph: Alan Keith Beastall/AlamyHowever, with Frasers recently ejected from the FTSE 100,cutting profit forecastsand Ashleythwartedin an attempt to join the board of the online retailer Boohoo, are there signs his disparate empire is beginning to creak?From squash to shopsAshley may no longer have a seat on the Frasers board, but by many accounts, which are denied by the company, he still calls the shots at the group he built froma single sports store in Maidenhead, opened in 1982 with £10,000 from his parents.He left school at 16 with no qualifications to become a squash pro and, although that did not work out because of injury, he can now be consoled with an estimated fortune of almost £3.8bn, according to last year’s Sunday Times rich list.His group has grown to about 1,500 stores across 20 countries and employs 30,000 people with brands selling sofas to luxury casualwear, gyms and personal finance.The far-reaching collection of interests, typically collected through deals for distressed assets, has been amassed at breathless pace. In only the past three months, Frasers warred with Boohoo, launched and ditched a cut-price bid for the Norwegian sporting goods chain XXL, bought South Africa’s Holdsport, and paid £53.5m to take ownership of the site near Ansty.Last year, Frasers attempted a hostile buyout of the luxury bag brand Mulberry and snapped up a string of down-at-heel shopping malls in Luton, Doncaster and Exeter.Frasers’ array of brands – from Evans Cycles to Flannels – enables it to use its scale to make ailing companies more viable.The group also has an ever-changing portfolio of stakes in listed companies that now runs from the electrical goods retailers Currys, AO and Marks Electrical to the fashion groups Asos, Hugo Boss and Mulberry.The £100m prizeA series of controversies have often threatened to derail Frasers’ relentless expansion. Only this month MPs raised concerns about the group’srecent admissionthat two-thirds of its retail staff were on zero-hours contracts and three-quarters of its warehouse staff were still agency workers, putting the company squarely in the sights ofnew legislationthat aims to improve employment rights for the least well-off.View image in fullscreenMost of Frasers’ retail staff are on zero-hours contracts and three-quarters of its warehouse staff are agency workers.Photograph: Matt Crossick/AlamyThe high level of agency workers has concerned Unite, which also hopes to secure a boost to pay for staff. Frasers pays above the legal minimum wage but still lags behind some rivals.Ashley is no stranger to such controversies – from the early days of his company’s flotation when it emerged he hadplayeda game of spoof over a hefty legal bill – towinning a bruising court battlewith the former adviser Jeff Blue over the apparent promise of a £15m bonus, during which he described himself as a“power drinker”. Frasers’ Shirebrook headquarters in Derbyshire was described by MPsas a “Victorian workhouse”in 2016. As the owner of Newcastle United, hewent from hero to hate figureover decisions including the temporary renaming the football club’s historic St James’ Park stadium the Sports Direct Arena.Today, Frasers is officially run by Ashley’s 35-year-old son-in-law, Michael Murray, who signed up with the promise of a £100m bonus should he be able to take Frasers share price to £15 by October this year. It currently stands at less than half that – and has fallen 27% in the last six months – so pursuing potentially tricky takeover deals is not a surprise.“[Murray] always needed to make quite big leaps to get the share price up there, and the incentive encourages more risk-taking,” one analyst says.However, Murray’s strategy is in line with that laid down by his acquisitive father-in-law.Buying brands and acquiring the rights to distribute them has long been part of his playbook and key to Ashley’s dominance of the sportswear market, pushing out major rival JJB and putting pressure on JD Sports.He started with the ageing brands Donnay and Dunlop Slazenger and is now a shareholder in the fashion label Hugo Boss. The buyout of Flannels in 2012 helped build relationships with luxury labels and a much more upmarket world than his then largely cut-price Sports Direct. OnbuyingHouse of Fraser in 2018, he set a mission to become“the Harrods of the high street”.Many of the latest deals, such as Findel, now known as Studio Retail, and the tilt at control of Boohoo have been designed to build up the group’s online, financial services and logistics operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He can use a bit of trouble to shake things up and make money at the same time.”Several of those who have worked with him agree that Ashley is also motivated by wanting to win against certain people – business rivals such as the former JD Sports boss Peter Cowgill or the Boohoo founder Mahmud Kamani.Even those he has been closest to – such as Blue or the former lieutenants Karen Byers and Dave Forsey have found themselves out in the cold after fallouts. Forsey, the former chief executive, has now returned to the company to spearhead Frasers’ international operations.“He has burnt bridges with people. The mistake people can make is they think they are in the tribe but they can be thrown out,” a source says.With the explosion of online retail and thousands of vacant shops across the UK, Ashley has far less competition for deals these days. “Virtually everything on the market or in trouble comes across his desk and he doesn’t have to ask for it,” a former associate says. “It has been a perfect field for him.”The company denies that Ashley still calls the shots and says “decisions in relation to the operation and strategy of the Frasers Group” are made by its board. Ashley will only “provide advice by way of a consultancy arrangement” on instruction from the board, it says.A new kingdomIn Ansty, people are worried about traffic and noise from the giant facility, but the move from Shirebrook could also be life-changing for thousands of workers. About 4,000 of them are on agency contracts and so will have no rights to a payoff.Unite predicts few of the Shirebrook workforce will be able to make the move south and will lose their jobs. “They would be unwilling and unable to afford to travel 70-plus miles to attend the new site,” Unite’s Gary Groom says.

It was August 2017, and Yvonne’s ex-husband had suggested she ask the motor dealer, known locally as the “Jag man”, to fix her car.Yvonne* says their relationship developed slowly. “Gary” boasted he had been spending time on his 42-ft boat, claimed to own two houses, and once turned up in a Porsche to take her for a drink. As they began to see more of each other, he would arrive at Yvonne’s house with freshly cut fruit and smoked salmon, always with a wad of money on him.“He was friendly, outgoing and easy to talk to,” the 68-year-old says. “He was throwing his money around buying drinks. He was the life and soul.”But Gary Rogers’s real name was Richard Robinson, and in July 2020 he wassentenced to 10 years in jailafter pleading guilty to charges of fraud and theft. He was also convicted of witness intimidation and two counts of battery. He had conned two women, one of whom was Yvonne, out of more than £210,000 between 2017 and 2018.Robinson has now been released from prison early, after serving four years of his sentence, under a scheme brought in by the Conservative government to ease overcrowding.Speaking for the first time since his release, Yvonne told theObservershe has fled the UK, fearing for her safety. She lost more than £115,000 to Robinson during their relationship and says he was violent towards her, including once trying to throttle her.Cases of romance fraud are on the rise in the UK, increasing by 27% between 2020 and 2024, according to data from a Freedom of Information request toAction Fraud. There were 8,548 cases of romance fraud in the UK last year, with more than £92m lost by victims. Yvonne worked with her bank’s fraud department to recover £31,000 of the money Robinson took from her. But she says the money is a drop in the ocean compared to the overall impact the ordeal has had on her life.Robinson was supremely charming, an “utter master”, she says. He would go out of his way to help her. Yvonne was a carer for a disabled man at the time, and Robinson took advantage of the fact this left her isolated. “I couldn’t get out of the house,” she says. “I couldn’t leave [the man I was caring for] … He was in a hospital bed. So I had no respite. I had no help. It was very, very difficult. Robinson exploited my exhaustion.”The man she had been caring for died and, on the day of his funeral, in February 2018, Yvonne says Robinson took her to the bank. She had taken diazepam after being prescribed it by her GP. “That day is quite fuzzy. I can remember I wanted to go to bed after the funeral and instead somehow he led me into the Range Rover and said ‘come on, we’ll go to the bank’. I ended up transferring money to him.” Robinson managed to convince her to transfer him £50,000 that day.A month later, Yvonne received an anonymous letter telling her that she was at risk, with newspaper clippings about Robinson’s history of fraud. He had beenjailed in 2013for similar offences. Yvonne confronted him. He denied her accusations and grew incensed, she says. “His forefinger and thumb were pinching my nose so I couldn’t breathe. And his left hand was round my left shoulder and his huge thumb was pressing into my windpipe so I couldn’t breathe. I was choking to death.” Yvonne managed to break free and lock herself in a bathroom to call the police.After her ordeal, Yvonne was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She has no current plans to return to the UK. “As long as that man is breathing, I’m not safe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many romance fraudsters often continue to operate with impunity, she said, as not enough are brought to justice.Although Yvonne met her fraudster in person, there has been a surge in romance fraud since the pandemic due to an “explosion” in dating apps and more people looking for love or friendship online.“I hope my story will help others,” Yvonne says. “When will crimes of fraud against women be taken seriously?

On the side is a black and white picture ofNigel Faragewith a quote from the Reform UK leader: “We are going to have to move to an insurance-based system of healthcare.”The starting gun has been firedin the byelection that has been on the horizon since the sitting MP Mike Amesbury announced his intention to resign, and which could prove a huge test for Keir Starmer’s government.Although a date has yet to be set for the vote, on Thursday eveningLabourselected Karen Shore, a teacher and local councillor, to be its candidate. A source from Reform, Labour’s main challenger, said its candidate would be announced early next week.In July last year, Labour easily won the seat, securing more than 50% of the vote, but now things are looking more difficult for the party. Depending on which poll you choose to rely on, Labour will either just hang on to the seat or lose to Reform.The byelection was triggered by Amesbury’s suspension from the Labour party after he was filmed punching a constituent in a late-night altercation in Frodsham, a town in his constituency.He received a 10-week prison sentence and was briefly jailed before his prison term was suspended on appeal. Shortly after his release, he announced his intention to wind down his office and resign from parliament.Yet despite the reasons behind the byelection, it is not Amesbury’s name that disgruntled voters here most often cite among reasons for not voting Labour, but Starmer’s.A Reform source said the party’s chances were likely to be boosted as they are also picking up support from Conservative voters similarly disappointed in their own party. “I think our message resonates to both,” they said.In Runcorn, Ruth Hayter, 76, seems to speak for a chunk of the electorate when she says she voted Labour, but has found the party to be a “bit of a disappointment”.View image in fullscreenRuth Hayter.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I thought they were more for the working class, [but] they don’t seem to be any more,” she said.Andrew McClean, 80, said he would not be voting at all. He voted Labour at the general election, but he said: “They took everything off us, the winter fuel, the savings, TV licence.”Lynne Bennett, 70, voted Labour in July, but this time, she said she would vote Reform, adding: “A lot of our family is going to do the same.”“I won’t be voting Labour, put it that way,” she said. “And my family [has been] Labour, all our lives.”Reform voters in Runcorn do not seem to have been put off by the party’s latest row, with the Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe suspended and reported to the police after the party alleged he had made threats against its chair.Lowe said he had instructed lawyers and suggested “untrue and false allegations” had been made about him after he criticised Farage.“That’s one of the things that hasn’t put me off,” Helen, a 32-year-old business owner, said, adding she will vote Reform because: “I’m convinced taxes are going up because [the government] is spending too much on other people.”Matthew Roberts, a 22-year-old painter and decorator, is also unbothered by the in-fighting: “I hope they win,” he said. “I like Nigel Farage.”Bennett also said it had not put her off. “I mean, it’s the same with Labour,” she said, “with that Amesbury.”Reform’s support is likely to be buoyed up by the fact that pensioners in particular are “very angry,” the source said, and “more elderly people are most likely to turn out in the byelection”.“It’s an uphill battle,” they added, pointing to Amesbury’s sizeable majority. “It should be an expected Labour hold, but I think these are unprecedented times.”Shore defended Labour’s record in government, saying the party had “hit the ground running, delivering an extra 2m NHS appointments earlier than promised, delivering security and dignity for working people, and raising the minimum wage for 12,000 people locally”.“This is only happening because we have a Labour government and it’s a Labour government that’s only just getting started,” she said. “Now we need a strong, local voice for Runcorn and Helsby at the heart of government, to keep delivering the real change we need.”The constituency is almost one of two halves, with Reform being Labour’s main opponent in Runcorn, to the north, but in the affluentCheshirevillages to the south, the Conservatives do better.View image in fullscreenGreen party candidate Chris Copeman.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn some of the villages, the Greens also see success; Chris Copeman is a local councillor for Helsby, and has been confirmed as the party’s byelection candidate.He hopes he may do well enough to push the Conservatives into fourth place on polling day.“I think we could do fairly well in this election,” he said. “It’s difficult to know, maybe there could be a bit of a squeeze because people are really worried about Reform getting in.”He would counter suggestions that progressive parties should step aside for Labour, saying: “You haven’t got some inherent right to rule the country, you have to prove to people that you’re good enough, and you’re going to be offering things and are going to do things that are what people want to see.”In Helsby, voters are more sympathetic to Labour and conscious of the fact that the polls are pointing to the possibility of a Reform MP.“I feel like I have to vote because I’m a woman,” Alice Linton, 28, said. “But I don’t really know who to vote for this time.” She is worried, she said, that Reform may win, and may consider voting Labour to try to stop that.“It is tempting,” her brother, Charlie Linton, 25, who shares her concerns about Farage’s party, added.“I wouldn’t be a Starmer fan,” Teresa Bergin, 69, said, adding that she has concerns about some of the government’s actions, including cuts to winter fuel allowance and personal independence payments (Pip), but said she would still vote Labour.“I’ve got concerns about Reform full stop,” she said, “never mind Reform winning.”Explore more on these topicsByelectionsReform UKNigel FarageKeir StarmerCheshireLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He penned very careful notes and presented one of his notebooks to Davy, hoping for a job at theRoyal Institutiondespite his working-class background and rudimentary education.The notebooks shed light on the workings of Faraday’s mind and reveal he made intricate drawings to visualise the scientific experiments and principles he was learning about at the lectures. “He’s taking the time to make his own publication and grounding what’s being taught to him in his own understanding,” said New. “He’s heavily illustrating his notes to understand the principle that’s been taught to him.” He even wrote an index for each notebook, she said, just for his own use and personal research. “This is at a time when paper is taxed. It shows how he’s really trying to understand the science within.”When Faraday gave Davy the notebook, he expressed his “desire to escape from trade, which I thought vicious and selfish, and enter into the service of Science”.Although Davy initially declined to help him, the notebooks – and Faraday himself – seemed to make a good impression. Davy wrote to Faraday soon afterwards to say that he was “far from displeased with the proof you have given me of your confidence, which displays great zeal, power of memory and attention”.When a lab assistant at the Institution got into a brawl and was fired in February 1813, Davy remembered the 22-year-old Faraday and offered him the job – which involved taking a pay cut, but gave the young man access to the laboratory, free coal, candles and two attic rooms.Faraday later gave an account of this job offer: “At the same time that he [Davy] gratified my desires as to scientific employment, he advised me to remain a bookbinder, telling me that Science was a harsh mistress… poorly rewarding those who devoted themselves to her service.”Despite Davy’s advice, Faraday accepted the job. It was a decision that would prove to be seminal for science. Over the next 55 years, while working for the Royal Institution, Faraday discovered several fundamental laws of physics and chemistry – including hislaw of electromagnetic induction in 1831, which illuminated the relative motion of charged particles.View image in fullscreenOne of Faraday’s inventions, used in electromagnetic field experiments.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesIt was thanks to Faraday’s trailblazing experiments at the institution that he discovered electromagnetic rotation in 1821, a breakthrough that led to the development of the electric motor and benzene, a hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid, in 1825. He became the first scientist to liquefy gas in 1823, invented the electric generator in 1831 and discovered the laws of electrolysis in the early 1830s, helping to coin terms such as electrode, cathode and ion. In 1845, after finding the first experimental evidence that a magnetic field could influence polarised light – a phenomenon that became known as the Faraday effect – he proved light and electromagnetism are interconnected.Today, Faraday’s law of induction is widely credited as enabling Einstein, who kept a framed picture of Faraday on his wall, to develop his theory of relativity.Throughout his career Faraday continued to draw his apparatus in his notebooks when making these groundbreaking discoveries. “It’s something that he starts here, with these illustrations, and carries on through,” New said.A curated selection of key pages from the notebooks will be launched online for the first time on the Royal Institution website on 24 March, to mark 200 years since Faraday founded the annualRoyal InstitutionChristmas lectures.Inspired by Davy’s talks to pursue a career in science, Faraday established these lectures in 1825 in the hope of encouraging others in the same way. “He was very strong on educating yourself, but also on educating everyone,” New said. “That principle remains fundamental to everything that the Royal Institution does today – we’re still hoping to inspire the next generation of scientists from all walks of life and backgrounds.”Eventually, every page of Faraday’s notebooks will be digitised and made searchable online, she added.Explore more on these topicsPhysicsThe ObserverChemistryAlbert EinsteinRoyal InstitutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Now a group of doctors and researchers –from Cambridge and Oxford universities and King’s College London– are preparing to use deep brain stimulation to try todecrease addicts’ yearningsand to boost their self-control.“Deep brain stimulation acts like a pacemaker,” the project’s chief investigator Prof Valerie Voon, of Cambridge University’s psychiatry department, told theObserver.“Just as we can use a pacemaker to stabilise abnormal electrical rhythms in a person’s heart, we believe we can use a brain implant to act like a pacemaker and normalise deviant electrical brain rhythms that are linked to addiction. This trial will show if this is a practical idea.”The use of brain implants has become popular with doctors treating brain disorders in recent years. More than a quarter of a million people are fitted with them to control symptoms of a range of conditions. In the case of Parkinson’s disease, implants deliver impulses to movement centres in patients’ brains and halt symptoms that include tremors and involuntary movements.Several recent small proof-of-concept studies have suggested the technique could be expanded for use as a treatment for alcohol and opioid addicts. Scientists are now finalising plans for the first full clinical trial of deep brain stimulation to determine if it could be expanded to counter the growing crisis of alcohol and drug addiction in the UK and other countries.Several hundred thousand people are dependent on alcohol in the UK and about a quarter of those require treatment for anxiety and depression and other associated health problems.Opioid addiction is also a serious health problem. Almost half of all fatal drug poisonings now involve opiates such as heroin and morphine.“Most people are highly disabled if they become seriously addicted to alcohol or opioids,” said Voon. “Nor does their craving affect only them. Their families, their parents, their siblings, their spouses and their children also suffer. Addiction is never just an individual disorder.“Addicts are unable to work and also face the danger of taking overdoses. It has become a very serious issue for modern society.”A total of six alcoholics and six opioid addicts will be picked for the trial, which is called Brain-Pacer (brain pacemaker addiction control to end relapse). To be selected, these individuals will have to have suffered at least five years of addiction and had at least three relapses. They will also have to have previously received conventional medications or psychotherapy.Each person in the trial – which will be carried out at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge and King’s College hospital in London – will have a slender electrode placed in precise locations in the brain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The electrodes will then be connected to a pulse generator that is implanted in their bodies, most likely in their chests. This device will deliver the electrical impulses that will moderate the neural activity that is triggering their addiction, it is hoped.“The aim is to decrease a person’s craving and increase their self-control by providing these electrical impulses,” added Voon.Crucially, the trials will be randomised so that electrical signals will not be turned on at all times while the brain activity of addicts will be recorded. In this way, the team hopes that they will not only develop new treatments for addiction but will generate fresh understanding of the brain mechanisms that drive alcohol and opioid cravings.Keyoumars Ashkan, professor of neurosurgery at King’s College hospital and the lead surgeon for the study, said deep brain stimulation was clearly a powerful surgical technique that could transform lives.“It will be a major leap forward if we can show efficacy in this very difficult disease with a huge burden to the patients and society.”Explore more on these topicsHealthThe ObserverParkinson's diseaseAlcoholismDrugs (Society)AlcoholOpioidsDrugs (Science)ShareReuse this content"

This means that if you’re teaching or having computer problems when hours are released, you can end up with no lessons at all,” the letter states, which has been coordinated by the Tefl Workers’ Union. “This Uberfication of teaching needs to stop.”Teachers used to be directly employed by the British Council, which is funded by the Foreign Office to foster good cultural relations with other countries. But after the pandemic, the council’s commercial arm, which generates £700m annually, started recruiting teachers via partner agencies.It comes as the government pushes ahead with legislation to ban “exploitative” zero-hour contracts. Ministersannouncedthis month that firms will have to offer agency workers a contract that guarantees a minimum number of hours every week to stop employers evading restrictions.There are growing concerns about exploitative gig economy practices spreading into new sectors of the economy and professional jobs. Unions have warned that the modern types of casualisation pioneered by Uber and Deliveroo are creeping into high streetshopsand education, with even Oxford University now puttingacademicson gig-style contracts.The foreign secretary, David Lammy, isanswerableto parliament for the “policies, operations and performance” of the British Council. The Tefl union understands that at least one parliamentarian may raise the treatment of the teachers with the government.View image in fullscreenUp to 350 teachers based in the UK, US, Canada and Australia have to race each other to book classes.Photograph: ScreengrabTeaching jobs on the platform are advertised by the British Council, but they are not directly employed by the public body, which was set up by the Foreign Office in the 1930s to improve Britain’s international standing. In the UK, teachers are employed by the Impellam Group.A teacher, who asked not to be named, said at first the British Council gave her the option to work regular hours. “I wasn’t worried about paying bills [when I started in 2021]. It felt like a proper job.” While she was on maternity leave, the British Council stopped offering guaranteed hours. She said she was left without any income for a month when she returned to work: “I had nothing… it was absolutely abysmal.”She added her job was less secure than her partner’s bar work. “To get this job, I had to show copies of my master’s and teaching diploma, which took years to get. But I am paid less and less predictably than my partner, who works in an entry-level bar job…it’s very insulting.”Internal British Council staff message boards covering the last 10 months – which a whistleblower has shared with theObserver– describe the weekly releases of lessons as “10 minutes of manic button pressing, panic and expletives”, which is getting worse because “the number of teachers is growing a lot faster than the number of classes being uploaded”.Some are left with only a couple of lessons each week, which pay £13 for an hour-long group lesson and £7.50 for a 30-minute private lesson in the UK. One teacher complains: “These days I rarely get more than a couple of lessons.” Another notes that “every other class I clicked on was already assigned” which was “demoralising” and “humiliating”. A teacher with primary school-aged children says she was forced to book late-night classes at 10pm and 11pm because they were the only slots available, but it left her “too tired to function the next day”.Marina Goncharova, a former British Council teacher who has added her name to the letter, said teachers were living in fear of having no income. “I couldn’t sleep [when I worked for the British Council],” she says. “I couldn’t hang out with my friends. I couldn’t even have a day off because I needed to be ready to book lessons. I was so scared I would be left without work.”Tom Liebewitz, lead organiser forTeflWorkers’ Union, said teaching shouldn’t come with constant uncertainty: “With zero-hour contracts and agencies like Impellam profiting from a gig-economy model, teachers are left scrambling for hours in a ‘feeding frenzy’, unable to plan for a future, whether that means starting a family or securing a mortgage.”The British Council said the English Online portfolio offered flexibility to students and teachers. “Teachers benefit from the flexibility of working from home and choose their own hours by assigning themselves to the classes that suit them. During recruitment, teachers are made aware that there is no guaranteed minimum number of hours, and that they should not rely on English Online as their primary income.” A spokesperson added: “We recognise our duty of care to colleagues, are committed to their wellbeing, and comply fully with local employment laws.”Impellam said: “We cannot comment on individual cases but as a recruitment company, Impellam and all its subsidiaries are fully compliant with UK employment law and committed to treating contingent workers fairly.”The Foreign Office said: “The British Council is operationally independent of government and is responsible for its own employment practices, strategy and policy.”Explore more on these topicsGig economyThe ObserverTeachingZero-hours contractsOnline learningEmployment lawDavid LammyTeflnewsShareReuse this content"

But in practice, high standards too often means high standards for some. Our ambition is high standards for all.“We must therefore drive high aspiration and raise standards for the significant groups of young people for whom our current curriculum and assessment system creates barriers to their progress, in order to ensure the best life chances for all young people.”The chair of the government’s expert advisory group for inclusion,Tom Rees, told the conference he backed calls to reform the way children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are supported. “I think we need to just acknowledge that it’s a bad system,” he said.Phillipson to ask schools to end exam ‘tunnel vision’ and look to wellbeingRead moreHe explained that the growing number of children with special needs, including fast-growing diagnoses of ADHD and autism, meant the school system needed to adapt.“If we’re talking about 40% of a school population, that’s such a big number in a classroom, that’s 12 children out of 30,” he said. “We’ve got to think about how we can make sure that schools and classrooms are able to better deal with this variation of need.”He also said the “medicalised model” of Send as a prescriptive label was no longer useful, given the wide range of needs and abilities it covers. “I’d like to see a world where we can retire the label of Send because we’ve become much more precise in our understanding of different needs,” he said.The shadow education minister, Neil O’Brien, accused the government of “dumbing down”. “Ministers need to start being honest,” he said. “They want to get more time for arts subjects by chopping back rigorous content in the core academic subjects.”Explore more on these topicsNational curriculumSatsEnglish baccalaureateExamsSpecial educational needsSchoolsCurriculumsShareReuse this content"

He had a 15-month contract and a transit visa, enabling him to travel to Milford Haven in Wales, where the 174-metre vessel was anchored.But in a last-minute change of plan, his Mumbai agent told him to head to Southwick in West Sussex, England, to board a scallop trawler, the Noordzee.Something was wrong, he felt, but his agent said he would be dropped at the tanker. Sharma tried to discuss it with the captain of the Noordzee. “I told him, ‘This is not my ship. I am not a fisherman.’” He could no longer reach his agent, as there was no wifi network onboard.“I felt alone and afraid,” says Sharma, 32.At sea, there was no easy way out. He was threatened with deportation if he did not work, he says.“They told me, ‘We will call the police, you don’t have the right documents, you will go to jail.’”“It is very dangerous work,” he says. “You can’t argue with the captain, when the ship is rolling and pitching. Anything could happen. You are at sea. It is scary.”I wanted to stay in the UK until I got justiceVishal SharmaFor the next three weeks, he worked 18 to 20 hours a day, without safety equipment or proper meals, he claims. He had little access to the bathroom and developed urinary problems, he says.His ordeal ended after he was transferred on to another boat, where other migrant fishers had reported being exploited and mistreated to police. When the boat docked at Portsmouth, immigration officers were waiting and Sharma and the others were taken to a police station. “The police said to me, can you explain everything that has happened to you? They said, ‘We are with you. You are in the UK, a safe country.’”Sharma was recognised as a victim of modern slavery by the Home Office and agreed to help police by giving evidence in a criminal case. “I wanted to stay in the UK until I got justice,” he says.Sharma appeared on a BBC documentary,Disclosure: Slavery at Sea, which broadcast in 2024. The BBC, which also ran a radio documentary on the issue, revealed he was one of 35 men who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies, owned by the Nicholson family, and were recognised as victims of modern slavery between 2012 and 2020.But justice has been elusive. TN Trawlers and its associated companies were the subject of two lengthy criminal investigations, but no cases of human trafficking or modern slavery have come to trial, although some of the men waited years to give evidence.The Crown Office in Scotlandacknowledgesthat Sharma is a victim of a crime. But the criminal investigation into what happened to him was dropped after he could not identify the perpetrators in a video.Now, after years of helping the authorities inScotland, Sharma is facing deportation back to India, where he fears his life is in danger. Word got back to his agents in Mumbai that he had spoken to the police, he claims. His father was assaulted by the agents, he says, and he has received death threats. He has suffered bouts of depression.View image in fullscreenVishal and Sukhdeep Sharma at home in Bradford with their son, Humraj.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverWhile in this legal limbo, he has built a life for himself in Bradford. He worked fitting shop fronts and married Sukhdeep, 27, a business student and Indian national. In December 2020, they had a son, Humraj.“She’s my wife, my best friend, she has given me moral support,” he says.In a letter sent to Sharma and his family in February, the Home Office rejected their asylum claims and told them to leave the UK. It said: “It is considered that any subjective fear you may have of returning to India is not objectively well-founded.”Joy Gillespie, the CEO of Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scotland, an NGO that has supported many of the 35 migrant fishers who appeared on the BBC’s documentary, says: “These men have done everything they could to help make a prosecution happen. But when it doesn’t work out, they are of no value and they are left in the lurch. If we are to bring these difficult trafficking prosecutions, we have to be more victim focused and give them our support.”Chris Williams, of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), says fishing is a “blind spot” for potential labour exploitation of migrant workers. The system ties them to one vessel, where they are at the mercy of the skipper.“Unfortunately, what happened to Vishal and others could happen again,” Williams says. The ITF is calling for fishers to be included in the Fair Work Agency, a new state enforcement agency being proposed in the government’semployment rights billgoing through parliament.View image in fullscreenThe BBC documentary Slavery at Sea featured migrant workers who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies.Photograph: BBCStephanie Hill and Carolin Ott, solicitors for Leigh Day, are investigating a number of claims for other exploited migrant fishers.“We are concerned that the exploitation of migrant fishers and seafarers for the purposes of forced labour and other forms of modern slavery are not being properly investigated by the police and the Home Office, who have a duty to investigate instances and risks of trafficking and forced labour,” they say.On Sharma’s case, a spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service says: “The case was carefully considered and a decision was taken that we could not prosecute due to insufficient evidence. The findings of an independent review supported the original decision.Further areas of investigation were identified and are under consideration.”‘Losing hope with every day that passes’: torment of the ships’ crews abandoned at seaRead moreA spokesperson for the Home Office says the government is determined to tackle “the scourge of modern slavery” but adds: “The right to claim asylum in the UK is an entirely separate process from the support an individual may be entitled to as a victim of modern slavery.”The Guardian was told that TN Trawlers no longer exists. A legal representative of the TN group said they did not wish to comment on this article.Last year, a spokesperson for TN Grouptold the BBCit disputed suggestions that workers were mistreated or were victims of modern slavery.The spokesperson said it always provided food and accommodation to workers and that they were “always free to come and go when ashore”.“The overwhelming experience of our workers was that they were well treated and well remunerated. We dispute many of the accounts put to us, in some cases over a decade on.“We absolutely refute any allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking and our many testimonials and long-term employees are testament to that.”Explore more on these topicsModern slaverySeascape: the state of our oceansFishing industryImmigration and asylumFishingIndiaScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A second strike targeted a car as it evacuated those injured by the first attack.The Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists in all.The Israeli military said it initially struck two people operating a drone that posed a threat to soldiers in the area, then launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment. The army identified all of those targeted as suspected militants, without providing evidence.Hamas accused Israel of “deliberate killings” that aimed “to undermine the ceasefire agreement and deliberately destroy any chance of completing the agreement and exchanging prisoners, in a blatant challenge to the mediators and the international community”.The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that Israeli fire had killed 19 people in the past 48 hours. The death toll in the 15-month Israeli offensive in Gaza now totals more than 48,500, mostly civilians. Hamas still has 59 hostages, of whom 35 are believed to be dead.In a statement, Hamas clarified an offer torelease a living American-Israeli hostage,saying it would only hand over 21-year-old Edan Alexander if Israel implements the ceasefire agreement which came into effect in January.The US has already rebuffed the offer, made on Friday, and accused the Islamist militant organisation of “stalling” bymaking “impractical” demands.Alexander, who grew up in the US and was fighting as a soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces, was abducted from his military base during Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack that killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and triggered the war. He is the last living US citizen held in Gaza.There was no immediate comment from Israel on the new statement from Hamas. On Friday, the office of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused the group of “psychological warfare”.The US said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire for several weeks to allow the negotiation of a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.The indirect talks, which are being held in Egypt and Qatar, are expected to continue during the coming week.For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal.Hamas however said on Saturday that it would only release hostages if Israel lifted its blockade, withdrew from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt and freed more Palestinian prisoners.The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of the population.The ceasefire’s first phase included the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza’s border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East peace talksGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Following the exclusion of Georgescu, he is the most prominent figure on the far right still in the running.Șoșoacă, a 49-year-old Euro MP known for her pro-Russia views posted on Facebook: “I am proof that we do not live in a democracy.” She said she would appeal the ruling.Romanian court rejects appeal by far-right politician to lift candidacy banRead moreOn Thursday, she donned boxing gloves as she filed her candidacy, declaring herself ready to “fight the system once again” as she bids to “makeEuropeand Romania great again”, borrowing Trumpian terms.Șoșoacă has been accused of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda and antisemitic views.She opposed anti-Covid measures during the pandemic and, in July 2024, was expelled from the European Parliament in Strasbourg after loudly interrupting debates.Her small party, SOS. Romania, won 24 seats after securing about 7% of votes in December’s legislative elections.Simion’s AUR said banning Șoșoacă’s candidacy “represents a further blow to Romanian democracy and a serious violation of fundamental rights and freedoms”.The eastern European state has been plunged into chaos since Georgescu’s surprise emergence in November on the back of a huge TikTok social media campaign, which was marred by suspicions of Russian interference.In a shock decision, the November election was cancelled and this week Georgescu was definitively excluded from the election, the first round of which is scheduled for 4 May.Georgescu’s exclusion led to some violent protests.On Saturday, several thousand people marched through Bucharest to express their attachment to the EU.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaThe far rightEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sana’a airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The extent of the damage was not yet clear.“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in asocial media post.“No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy.The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters offYemenin response to Israel’s blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in the US strikes on Sana’a, the Houthi-run health ministry said on Saturday evening.Six other people, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Sa’ada, Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported.The Houthi rebels have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 until January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect.The attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment.The Houthi media office said the US strikes hit “a residential neighborhood” in Sana’a’s northern district of Shouab.The Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the US, according to a US official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region.Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.The USS Harry S Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three navy destroyers and one cruiser, is in the Red Sea and was part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.“These relentless assaults have cost the US and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHouthisYemenUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

These texts detail the minutiae of government and reveal a complex bureaucracy – the red tape of an ancient civilisation.These were the state archives of the ancient Sumerian site of Girsu, modern-day Tello, while the city was under the control of the Akkad dynasty from 2300 to 2150BC.“It’s not unlike Whitehall,” said Sébastien Rey, the British Museum’s curator for ancient Mesopotamia and director ofthe Girsu Project. “These are the spreadsheets of empire, the very first material evidence of the very first empire in the world – the real evidence of the imperial control and how it actually worked.”mapGirsu, one of the world’s oldest cities, was revered in the 3rd millennium BC as the sanctuary of the Sumerian heroic god Ningirsu. Covering hundreds of hectares at its peak, it was among independent Sumerian cities conquered around 2300BC by the Mesopotamian king Sargon. He originally came from the city of Akkad, whose location is still unknown but is thought to have been near modern Baghdad.Rey said: “Sargon developed this new form of governance by conquering all the Sumerian cities of Mesopotamia, creating what most historians call the first empire in the world.” He added that, until these latest excavations, information on that empire was limited to fragmentary and bombastic royal inscriptions or much later copies of Akkadian inscriptions “which are not completely reliable”.Of the new discovery, he said: “It is extremely important because, for the first time, we have concrete evidence – with artefacts in situ.” He has been astonished by the detail in those records: “They note absolutely everything down. If a sheep dies at the very edge of the empire, it will be noted. They are obsessed with bureaucracy.” The tablets, containing cuneiform symbols, an early writing system, record affairs of state, deliveries and expenditures, on everything from fish to domesticated animals, flour to barley, textiles to precious stones.View image in fullscreenThe tablets were found at the site of a large state archive building, made of mud-brick walls and divided into rooms or offices.Photograph: Alberto Giannese/The Girsu Project/British MuseumDana Goodburn-Brown, a British-American conservator, is cleaning the tablets so that they can be transcribed. The work is both painstaking and exciting, she said: “People just think things come out of the ground and look like you see them in the museum, but they don’t.”One tablet lists different commodities: “250 grams of gold / 500 grams of silver/ … fattened cows… / 30 litres of beer.” Even the names and professions of the citizens are recorded, Rey said: “Women, men, children – we have names for everyone.“Women held important offices within the state. So we have high priestesses, for example, although it was a society very much led by men. But the role of the woman was at least higher than many other societies, and it’s undeniable based on the evidence that we have.”The jobs listed range from stone-cutters to the sweeper of the temple floor. Rey said: “Being able to sweep the floor where the gods and the high priest were located was very important. The cities of ancient Mesopotamia in theory all belonged to the gods. The society worked for the temple state.”The tablets were found at the site of a large state archive building, made of mud-brick walls and divided into rooms or offices. Some of the tablets contain architectural plans of buildings, field plans and maps of canals.The finds were made by archaeologists at the Girsu Project, a collaboration between the British Museum and the Iraqi government’s State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, funded by Meditor Trust, a charitable foundation.The site was originally excavated in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was targeted by looters after the two Gulf wars: “Tablets of the Akkad period were either looted or carelessly removed from their archaeological setting and thus decontextualised. So it was very difficult to understand how the administration worked.“The key thing now is that we were able to excavate them properly within their archaeological context. The new finds were preserved in situ, so in their original context, and we can say for sure that we have indeed the very first physical evidence of imperial control in the world. This is completely new.”The finds have been sent to the Iraq Museum in Baghdad for further study, ahead of a possible loan to the British Museum.The Akkadian empire lasted for only about 150 years, ending with a rebellion that secured the city’s independence.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyThe ObserverMuseumsIraqMiddle East and north AfricaBritish MuseumnewsShareReuse this content"

The new crew were scheduled to arrive early on Sunday at about 3.30am GMT, and Williams and Wilmore – along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – are expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.The mission became entangled in controversy after PresidentDonald Trumpand his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, claimed without evidence that former president Joe Biden had abandoned Williams and Wilmore on the station for political reasons. The two astronauts rejected this accusation.They arrived at the ISS in June 2024 on a Starliner spacecraft built by Boeing, an aerospace rival to SpaceX. Nasa planned to return the two astronauts to Earth on the craft until problems were found with some of its thrusters, which would have played a crucial role in slowing down the spacecraft before re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.Leaks of helium from the craft’s propulsion system were also discovered, andNasachose not to risk using Starliner to take Williams and Wilmore back to Earth. Instead, the empty spaceship was undocked from the ISS and flown back for an automated, parachute-assisted landing in the New Mexico desert while the two astronauts were kept aboard the ISS to await a flight home on a scheduled crew rotation mission, even though this meant keeping them in orbit for months.Williams this month told reporters that she was looking forward to returning home to her family and two dogs. “It’s been a rollercoaster for them, probably a little bit more than for us,” she said.Explore more on these topicsInternational Space StationThe ObserverNasaSpaceXSpaceDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

We keep having skills mentioned as a big issue, but below-the-line skills don’t get spoken about. We need a masterplan and a widening of the net to get people from a more diverse range of backgrounds into the industry.”At Pinewood – where the number of exhibitors has doubled to 50 since the first Futures Festival in 2022 and includes the George Lucas-founded, Disney-owned special effects giant Industrial Light & Magic – one company cites estimates that, in the lighting sector alone, as many as 500 workers are close to retirement age and will need replacing.While initiatives such as those run by Pinewood and Leavesden are doing their bit when it comes to attracting the next generation of workers, film and TV has one enduring problem – it seems everyone wants to be a star.View image in fullscreenReporter Mark Sweney being detained by the forces of the Empire at Futures Festival.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Observer“I’m actually an actor, so I thought I’d turn up, speak to people, network, get involved in anything I can, really,” says Harmony Reid, 24. “I’m interested in creating, maybe directing, but I’m a presenter also.” However, she concedes that events like this one are focused on work “predominantly behind the camera”.Attempts to woo young people into production roles have been hindered by a lack of up-to-date figures from the industry. The British Film Institute’s 2022 Skills Review estimated that, based on the growth of the industry, almost 21,000 more full-time-equivalent employees would be needed by this year.However, the market has changed dramatically since then and the BFI no longer stands by this figure, but it is yet to publish an updated review.Industry skills body ScreenSkills, whose testimony at the culture select committee chair Dinenage recently characterised as “underwhelming”, is working on the first all-encompassing look at gaps and shortages, due to be published next month.“Production is fragmented and everyone goes their separate ways afterwards,” says Jordan Fisher, training manager at 3D scanning company Clear Angle, which has worked on films includingDeadpool & Wolverineand the sequels toGladiatorandDune. “Because of that, sometimes it feels like it is no one’s responsibility. That is why events like at Pinewood are important.”A mix of factors buffeting the UK film and TV sector in recent years have made skills shortages a complex problem.The industry feasted for a decade onmega-budgets provided by Netflix and its rivalsin pursuit of global screen dominance – halcyon times that led to huge expansion. The high-end TV market ballooned from £640m in 2012 to a peak of £5.1bn in 2022, driven by the post-Covid need to restock content libraries.The industry experienced huge cost inflation – and profits – partly fuelled by frenetic demand for workers and companies to keep that content pipeline flowing. Film and TV studio announcements and expansionsbecame the normamid a production space squeeze.However, in the last three years streamers have cut profligate spending to focus on sustainable profitability, while theHollywood actors’ and writers’ strikeswreaked further havoc.At the same time, the domestic UK TV market hit what bosses at ITV and Channel 4 calledthe worst advertising recession since 2008. The resultingcuts to content budgetsdrove many producers to shut, merge or struggle to stay viable.Recent testimony to the culture select committee has amplified the picture of a market in contraction – from the star and director of hit seriesWolf Halltaking a big pay cut, to the BBCshelving premium TV projects due to a lack of co-funding deals.Many new studio-building projectshave been scrapped, with investors looking at new growth areas such as data centres, which are also part of the plan for a smaller-scale studio expansion by Pinewood.So, given there has been such market contraction, shouldn’t there be a surfeit of talent to choose from? The issue is complicated by an uneven recovery that means the abilities of those out of work do not necessarily match where the growth now lies.View image in fullscreenInterior scenes at Diagon Alley at the Harry Potter World tour at Leavesden Studios.Photograph: eye35/AlamyWhile investment in film production, driven by Hollywood blockbusters, bounced back last year to pre-pandemic levels at £2.1bn, the work crisis continues in the TV industry. High-end TV spending last year was up about £1bn on pre-pandemic levels, at £3.4bn, but the industry is still struggling with the“reset” in the amount of work– and for the vast majority made for less than £1m an hour,tight broadcaster budgetsmean work remains precarious for many.Last month, a report by the Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre found that nearly 60,000 creative industries workers were not fully proficient in their roles. It said a particular challenge in addressing the growing skills gap – up 15,000 since 2017 – related to the introduction of new technology, including but not limited to AI. It found that 65% of “hard to fill” vacancies in the industry were attributable to skills shortages.Laura Mansfield, the chief executive of ScreenSkills, compared the situation to a rockpool: “Some areas of the industry are underwater, some have slivers of water and some are as dry as rock. It isn’t a one-size-fits-all tidy answer and that means variability in the situation around skills.“We did have skill shortages, where there was poaching like mad, where people got pulled in too fast and promoted too quickly and were exposed. But now we are much more in a universe that is about skills gaps, which is different.”The industry also continues to lobby heavily fora change to the government’s apprenticeship levy, which employers with a wage bill of over £3m pay into, because much of the film and TV industry is project-based using freelance workers, which makes it difficult to meet the criteria for taking on an apprentice on a 12-month contract. Nevertheless, despite the challenges, there are hopes that a new generation of potential workers is waiting in the wings who may not even know their perfect job exists.“I didn’t know this was a thing,” says João Villar, 19, at the Pinewood skills fair. “It is mind-blowing. It is really cool for people to find out that some of these niche jobs even exist … It is so inspiring.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessThe ObserverFilm industryTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was killed last Friday alongside 24 of his neighbours by crowds of people from surrounding Sunni villages who chanted anti-Alawite slogans while they rounded up men in Arza’s village square and shot them dead in a rampage that lasted about three hours.The killings in Arza happened during four days ofshocking violence in north-west Syrialast week that leftmore than 1,000 people dead– including at least 745 civilians – in some of Syria’s deadliest days of fighting since the beginning of the country’s civil war in 2011.The wave of bloodshed three months on from the fall of Bashar al-Assad stunned Syria and brought to light the deep faultlines which threaten totear the country apart after 14 years of civil war. Widespread revenge attacks against civilians have mostly targeted Alawites, a minority Islamic sect from which the ousted Syrian president hailed, though most Alawites had nothing to do with the previous regime.The killings ended the jubilant mood which had prevailed over the country after the toppling of Assad on 8 December by a rebel coalition led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which now leads the interim government.Fighting started after about 4,000 militants loyal to the Assad regime launched a wave of attacks against Syrian security forces on Thursday, attacking more than 30 checkpoints simultaneously across Syria’s coast. Blindsided by the attacks and unable to regain control over the situation, the Syrian government issued an urgent call over Telegram for fighters to head to Syria’s coast.View image in fullscreenRelatives of the men slain in Arza tried to burn their clothes, but some failed to light – four days later, the clothes were still soaked in blood.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianThe call to arms was repeated in mosques across the country and spread like wildfire over social media. Soon, thousands of militia members and armed civilians flooded north-west Syria.Civilians and factions affiliated with Syria’s government began to massacre mainly Alawite civilians and unarmed prisoners, as well as loot and pillage the villages on Syria’s coast.Horrific videos began to emerge: men in military uniforms forcing unarmed people to bark like dogs while they beat them and gloating over the corpses of a woman’s children while their mother watched; and women wailing on their knees in front of dozens of bodies piled on top of one another.map of Syria showing location of Arza in the north-west of the country, north of Homs, and Latakia and Tartus on the coast to the westHow did deadly Syria clashes start and who is responsible for civilian killings?Read moreAccording to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, 529 civilians and prisoners were killed by armed individuals and Syrian government forces. Two Turkish-backed factions, the Hamzat division and Abu Amsha’s Sultan Suleiman Shah division, which are officially a part of the new Syrian army but not yet under its full command,were responsible forthe majority of civilians killed by Syrian government forces, according to SNHR.In addition, Assad loyalists killed 225 civilians and 207 members of Syrian government forces, the war monitor added.In Arza, local people say they know who their killers were. Three survivors accused the residents of Khattab, a nearby Sunni village, of being behind Friday’s massacre.Abu Jaber, a religious notable in Khattab and a former opposition fighter who had returned to the village, described how he and others entered homes, and forced men on to the town’s roundabout, with the purpose of displacing them from the village.“But then people who had their families killed [by the regime] came, and they opened fire,” he said.View image in fullscreenSyrian security forces on patrol in Latakia, Syria, on Thursday 13 March.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersA survivor of the attack described how the killers left the bodies on the roundabout and began to loot houses, killing any men they saw while they pillaged. They said members of the Syrian general security tried to protect town residents, but were quickly overwhelmed.“They came in the town chanting that they wanted 500,000 Alawites for the people they lost. They came into my house and took my brother and killed him in cold blood,” said a woman who was retrieving her belongings from her looted home, breaking down in tears.A Guardian reporter saw spent bullet casings and an empty Kalashnikov magazine on the ground at the roundabout during a visit to Arza this week.An official from the Syrian ministry of information initially denied that anyone was killed in Arza, but then said three people were killed. They insisted that the killings were not motivated by sectarian reasons and said security forces had arrested looters once reinforcements arrived.View image in fullscreenBlood stains a rock at the site of the Arza killings, four days after the attack.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianWhile Abu Jaber denied personally killing anyone, he said the people of Arza deserved their fate. He claimed that during the civil war the town’s residents had extorted and abused the residents of Khattab, and so the killings last Friday were merely people “claiming their rights”.He recalled a time when a regime official from Arza had bludgeoned a Khattab resident to death with a stone – and claimed the whole of Arza had celebrated after the killing. “What would you imagine that the villages that live around Arza, which committed these acts, what should they do? You think we should give them flowers?” he said.Abu Jaber acknowledged that he did not know if any of the perpetrators of the crimes he listed were still in Arza, but insisted that he thought that most, if not all, of Syria’s Alawite sect were guilty.His rhetoric echoed that of the Assad regime, which was notorious for its indiscriminate attacks against civilians in opposition areas. He condemned anyone who rebelled against Syria’s new state, using an old Assad-era slogan to praise the country’s new president: “We sacrifice our soul and blood for you, O Sharaa.”Survivors of the Arza massacre admitted that select regime officials from the town did kill residents of Khattab,but said those officials had fled after the fall of Assad, and those left in the town had nothing at all to do with the previous abuses.“We also suffered from the regime, the whole world was being attacked by them. But I’m not related to them, how is it my fault?” said a resident of Arza.View image in fullscreenA Syrian Alawite family rides in a truck to return home in Latakia.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersExperts have said that for Syria to survive under its new rulers, an urgent, earnest process of reconciliation and transitional justice was key.“Revenge must not be taken by your own hands, don’t take revenge against perpetrators. For both victims and perpetrators, this is a complex process,” said Fadel Abdulghany, the founder of SNHR.In his first speech as Syria’s president, Sharaa promised to establish “real transitional justice”, which includes accountability for Assad-era officials who committed human rights violations. He issued a blanket amnesty for all regime employees, with exception for those who were complicit in war crimes.After last week’s killings, Sharaa set up a committee to investigate the violence on the coast. “We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain. No one will be above the law,” he said.In Arza, people said they could not imagine returning to live, no matter what the government promised them. Most were thinking of going to Lebanon, joining at least 6,000 Alawites who fled to the neighbouring country last week.Arza was completely deserted on Wednesday when the Guardian visited, except for a few people coming to retrieve whatever belongings remained in their homes. A building’s roof had collapsed, others had their windows broken and appliances stolen.View image in fullscreenA Syrian family leaves the Hmeimim airbase to return to their village in Latakia province.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/Reuters“We fled with only the clothes on our back, that’s it. There’s nothing left for me there,” said an Arza resident who planned to smuggle himself to Lebanon over the weekend.Referring to the displacement of the Alawite residents in the area, Abu Jaber said it was only fair that they should experience dispossession, just as he did during Syria’s civil war. “My advice to the people of Arza: if you are planning to return, think twice about it. We were displaced for 14 years in the north. So, be patient for a year or two years, maybe there will be justice then,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, Rubio linked to a Breitbart story about a talk Rasool had given on Friday as part of a South African thinktank’s webinar in which he spoke about actions taken by theTrump administrationin the context of a US where white people would soon no longer be a majority.Rasool pointed to Elon Musk’s outreach to far-right figures in Europe, calling it a “dog whistle” in a global movement trying to rally people who see themselves as part of an “embattled white community”.He must leave by 21 March, a state department spokesperson said on Saturday.Rasool is a former anti-apartheid campaigner who served time in prison for his activism and went on to become a politician in the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela, the country’s first post-apartheid president.The expulsion of an ambassador is a very rare move by the US, although lower-ranking diplomats are more frequently targeted with persona non grata status.In response, South Africa’s presidency said in an online post that it had noted the“regrettable expulsion of South Africa’s ambassador”and urged everyone to maintain the “established diplomatic decorum” on the matter.It is the latest development in rising tensions between Washington and Pretoria. In February,Trump froze US aid to South Africa, citing a law in the country that he alleges allows land to be seized from white farmers.Last week, Trump further fuelled tensions, saying South Africa’s farmers were welcome to settle in the US after repeating his accusations that the government was “confiscating” land from white people.View image in fullscreenThe South African embassy in Washington DC where a statue of Nelson Mandela stands.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPATrump posted on his Truth Social platform that “any farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to citizenship”.One of Trump’s closest allies is the South African-born billionaire Musk, who has accused the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s government of having “openly racist ownership laws”.South Africa was ruled by white Afrikaner leaders during apartheid, which violently repressed the country’s black majority, including forcing them to live in segregated townships and rural “homelands”. Afrikaners are descended mainly from the Dutch, who began colonisingSouth Africain 1652, as well as French Huguenot refugees sponsored by the Dutch.More than three decades after white minority rule ended, South Africa remains hugely unequal, with land and wealth still largely concentrated among white people who make up 7% of the population, about half of whom are native Afrikaans speakers, while black people are 81%.However, some white South Africansclaim they are discriminated against, often citing the country’s affirmative action laws.During a G20 event in South Africa last month, Ramaphosa said he had a wonderful call with Trump soon after the US leader took office in January. But relations later “seemed to go a little bit off the rails”, he said.In Friday’s webinar, Rasool, speaking by videoconference, used academic language to talk about the Trump administration’s crackdowns on diversity and equity programmes and immigration.The South African ambassador said: “The supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the Maga movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white.”With Agence France-Presse and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricaUS foreign policyTrump administrationMarco RubioElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

The trio appears to have a perfect dynamic, but on the first night, two friends descend into a gossiping session about the third, crystallising unspoken tensions in the group.Gossip drives all kinds of dramas – it’s the central force behind every series ofBridgerton, the beating heart of teen dramaGossip Girl. Where would Jane Austen’s characters, or even Hilary Mantel’s imagining of Thomas Cromwell, be without insider secrets?But there may be nothing more compelling than a real-life secret – and now insider information as a form of entertainment is big business. The podcastThe Rest is Entertainment, hosted by Marina Hyde and Richard Osman, which offers readers a peek behind the showbiz curtain, is downloaded 4.5m times a month, according to its producer, Goalhanger.Each week one episode answers reader queries about what goes on behind the scenes – and there’s no shortage of questions, according to lead producer Neil Fearn, who says Osman and Hyde have “years of experience” in TV and media and connections to other insiders. “It gives a watercooler moment,” Fearn says. “The number of people I hear who say they’ve tried to pass off stuff they’ve heard on the show as their own, then will be called out on it by someone else who heard the show.”He adds: “The distance between celebrities and Joe Public is becoming smaller and smaller. The mechanisms of the media, all those things we take for granted, suddenly we can get these questions answered.” From queries about how theCountdownclock works to the scoop on so-called “villain edits” in reality TV, the show has already covered much ground.View image in fullscreenRichard Osman and Marina Hyde, co-hosts of the hit podcast The Rest Is Entertainment, at a live event.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIt is not the only one, either: the podcast Normal Gossip, which began in 2022, discusses tales submitted by listeners about the lives of people the hosts and audience have never met. Its creator, Kelsey McKinney, published a book last month,You Didn’t Hear This From Me: Notes on the Art of Gossip.The intimacy of podcasts can mirror the act of gossiping with friends. “There are certain podcasts where the whole premise is: let us invite you in and show you behind the velvet rope,” says Chris Lochery, the former editor of the gossip newsletterPopbitch,which had a podcast offshoot,Allegedly. “You’re welcomed into that world: it makes you feel like one of the in-crowd.”WhenPopbitch, which shares secrets from the worlds of music, TV, sports, media and beyond, started a couple of decades ago, it was rare to get a peek behind the curtain, Lochery says. Now that we have more direct exposure to public figures, “there’s a base level of entitlement to the inner lives and thoughts and workings of the industry.“Revealing these inner workings hasn’t led to a sating of that hunger – it’s created an even bigger hunger.”There are different definitions of gossip, but “everybody does it”, says Dr Kathryn Waddington, emerita fellow in psychology at the University of Westminster and author ofGossip, Organization and Work: A Research Overview.View image in fullscreen‘The central force behind Bridgerton’: Luke Newton as Colin and Nicola Coughlan as Penelope have a chat.Photograph: Liam Daniel/Netflix“There’s an evolutionary psychology argument that language evolved to enable people to gossip. Gossip is a form of knowledge. It’s about being in the know.”Something qualifies as ­gossip when it is “evaluative”, says Waddington. “There is a judgment of something: is it good, is it bad? Is it right, is it wrong?” In past research, she compared men and women’s experiences of gossip and found “women were more comfortable with the term”. Men still gossiped, but framed it differently.“Men would say, ‘I’m not one to gossip, but … ’,” Waddington says. “Historically, gossip has been seen as pejorative, negative ‘women’s talk’. But the tide is turning, which I think is really good.”View image in fullscreenYou Didn’t Hear This From Me, the new book by the creator of the Normal Gossip podcast, Kelsey McKinney.Comedians Alison Spittle and Poppy Hillstead, who are launching a new gossip-based podcast,Magazine Party,in May, agree. Spittle says: “Sikisa[the lawyer and standup comedian] has a joke about this – ‘When women gossip it’s looked down on, but when men gossip, it’s a podcast.’ And that is so true. Anything women do is looked down upon or domesticated. But men do talk about their lives so much.”Lochery has a broad definition of gossip. “It’s very useful and vital in certain circumstances, especially when there’s a concerted effort to try to hush things up. It can also be fun, cathartic and interesting. It can be as simple as having an interest in people and fun stories, and the illicit thrill of knowing something that you weren’t supposed to know.”Audiences love stories even when they don’t know the people they are about.Popbitchand other outlets run “blind items” – stories where the central character is unnamed. “Sometimes it’s a story you can’t fully legally get over the line,” Lochery says. “Sometimes it’s just a fun story where you don’t want to embarrass the person involved.”Hillstead and Spittle’s podcast will be fuelled by the gossip of strangers, inspired by secrets-laden magazines such asTake a Break,ChatandThat’s Life!. They love these publications because “it puts it all into perspective”, says Spittle. “I might not have any money, but at least my mum isn’t having an affair with a ghost.” There’s often darkness, but it feels cathartic: “It’s likeLoose Womenif Shane Meadows directed it.”View image in fullscreenAlison Spittle, left, and Poppy Hillstead, co-hosts of the forthcoming gossip podcast Magazine Party.Photograph: Matt StrongeThey are both veterans of the form: Hillstead co-hosted the podcastGossipmongers, while Spittle hosted BBC Sounds’Wheel of Misfortune. All three shows ask the public to send in their own gossip, which is passed on to listeners.OnMagazine Party, the pair will be sharing gossip about themselves too. There’s something liberating about this, says Spittle: “When you self-gossip, you free yourself from the judgment of your peers. We’re all sharing things together, holding each other’s hands and saying: isn’t it mad that we do this? It’s a reciprocal thing.”There can be helpful explorations of what’s ethical and normal, Spittle says. While one person might share gossip thinking it’s scandalous, when others disagree, it can start conversations about what’s socially acceptable. Hillstead says: “It’s collective consciousness. Reflecting on things. And sometimes being like: actually, this is fine.”Gossip serves many purposes, says Waddington. “One of the evolutionary functions of gossip is: who can you trust, who’s a freeloader, who’s a bullshitter? Think about the #MeToo movement: it can have a protective function in terms of who you can and can’t trust.”In more serious cases, gossip should prompt action, Waddington believes – hearing open secrets about something unjust could be the catalyst to change. “Often, things like this start small. If there is a grain of truth in the gossip and you can get to that truth and expose it, that’s an example of good gossip.”But there’s “bad” gossip too, which can ruin reputations unjustly. There are responsibilities attached to spreading it. “As a professional gossip, you’ve got to think carefully about [whether] personal animus is driving something, what is mean-spirited, what is not in the public interest,” says Lochery. “But then, there should be a record of some of these things, so that in 20 years you aren’t blindsided by anotherP DiddyorR Kelly, or 100 names I could say … Sometimes there’s no real way to get that out, aside from gossip.”If you’re starved of gossip, you haven’t got the day-to-day information that keeps people togetherDr Kathryn WaddingtonNo topics are off limits onThe Rest Is Entertainment, says Fearn, with the show covering recent allegations against presenterGregg Wallaceand TV chefGino d’Acampo,and the use of NDAs by rich people, but occasionally there are challenges. “The only time we can’t answer a question is when there are certain legalities,” Fearn says. “There are certain things we might talk about … then questions come in, but it’s too difficult to answer. But generally everything is fair game, because we never feel we’re looking down on anything. There’s no snobbery.”On the lighter side, “a positive function of gossip is ‘social glue’,” says Waddington. “If you’re starved of gossip, you haven’t got the day-to-day information that keeps people together. It’s a reflection of our interest in other people, that bit that makes us human.”Lochery points to patently silly stories, such as a rumour about the actor Paul Mescal running away at the end of dates. “People didn’t seem to be sharing it with malice or conviction that it was true: it was just a funny urban legend.”Hillstead recalls a tale of a male comedian cooking two roast dinners in the same day to seduce two different women. “People would’ve been sharing this stuff around a campfire. This is our version of that, British folk tales.”Explore more on these topicsCultureThe ObserverPodcastingDigital mediaInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus, deliciously chaotic fun at a much-loved East End cafe, and a vital but uncomfortable retelling of recent racism in BritainMiranda SawyerSat 15 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTShareWhere Politics Meets HistoryLBCDown the CaffDown the CaffArchive on 4: No Blacks No IrishRadio 4/BBC SoundsI try, honest, but all these history podcasts just don’t do it for me. Also, while I’m in the confessional podcast booth, nor do many political ones either. The audio charts are full of both, but – sorry, clever bro-chatters! – they leave me cold.So, as you might imagine, I approachedWhere Politics Meets History, the new show from LBC’s Iain Dale and historian Tessa Dunlop, with some trepidation. Though only a bit: I have a soft spot for Dale, though I disagree with him about many things. He’s a warm broadcaster, whose political stance is researched, rather than kneejerk. He’s happy to go against the grain and to say when he’s wrong (though, like many, he tends to crow when he’s right). Dunlop is less established as an audio host, though you might recognise her fromCoaston the telly.Anyway, Tuesday’s first show was a bit of a mess. Dunlop was initially quite hesitant (there was an awkward moment of silence when Dale asked her to explain who he was), and later, a little too dominant. A stronger structure might have helped – though as I listened to Dale describing his recent holiday in Germany, referring to his hotel and Kaiser Frederick, husband of Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter, I thought: perhaps sticking to the point isn’t the aim of the show? The pace and topics weather-vaned between Dunlop’s intense info-dumping and silly whimsy from Dale (another story: when a young woman in a lift was rude about Americans, he spoke in an American accent, just to embarrass her).The views of the public on race, in No Blacks No Irish, were so awful I can’t even write them downTo her credit, Dunlop had an interesting overarching point: there were, she said, several parallels between the current standoff/negotiation between Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin and the one between Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin in 1943. But she needed to make her point more quickly, and perhaps without all the lengthy historical quotes, which she got Dale to read out in a silly voice. As an experienced podcaster, Dale was more relaxed, and as phenomenally well-informed as ever. If the dynamic between the two can be smoothed out (they clearly like each other, so I’m sure it can), and the structure of the show made clearer, then this will develop into a fascinating listen for those of you who can cope with a concept we might call Active News Terror Plus The Important Past.When it comes to history, it’s social history that I like. Not the moves of the bullyboys in charge, but the small yet consequential stuff that unpowerful people do with their lives. Which brings me toDown the Caff, a podcast from E Pellicci’s cafe in east London, a Bethnal Green institution. With an intro voiced by Ray Winstone (“surviving two world wars and one cereal cafe… real cockneys, a word often used but not often understood”), every episode bangs straight into, well, mayhem.What a completely bananas show this is. There are too many voices, and they’re not introduced. There are too many in-jokes that aren’t explained (someone’s got an Irish wife, which is repeatedly mentioned). The celebrity guest often goes off mic, or doesn’t seem to know why they’re there. Everyone shouts all over each other. It’s nuts.‘Packed with life’:watch Tommy Mallet down the caff with Anna and Nevio Pellicci.Having said all that, thevibeis sensational: friendly, upbeat, packed with life, really fun. And as you listen on, everything gradually reveals itself. Our two hosts are, it turns out, brother and sister Nevio and Anna (Nevio’s the one with the Irish wife). They’re the third-generation owners of the cafe – full-on characters who bring out a side to their guests I’m not sure anyone else could even locate. Last week’s guest, Tommy Mallet, designer and ex-Towieperson, is someone I’d never heard of, but their interview with him was so off-the-wall I couldn’t stop listening. We heard about him doing a seance, about how he can’t stand posh restaurants, and how his wife lived off Deliveroo and “bowls of Crunchy Nut”. I loved him. Episodes feature Annie MacManus, Róisín Murphy, Kevin Rowland, Tom Grennan. Tuck in!View image in fullscreenNo Blacks, No Irish podcast presenters Tony Phillips and Peter Curran.Photograph: Radio 4While we’re on social history, let’s turn toArchive on 4, always packed with excellent examples.No Blacks No Irish, hosted by Peter Curran, who’s white and from Belfast, and Tony Phillips, who has Caribbean heritage, was a fascinating and shocking delve into the UK’s upsettingly recent history of racism. Some of the recorded archive was eye-wateringly prejudiced – the views of the public, from landlords to sex workers, were so awful I can’t even write them down – but there was delight in there too.Don Warrington, who played Philip inRising Damp, gave a particularly lovely interview about what the show had achieved. “It turned a racial stereotype on its head,” he said. “Philip became the ideal of a white person… Rigsby was the one who suffered from all kinds of incontinences, he could not in any way contain himself… Philip was utterly contained… Philip was a toff, he was a prince, and that has great currency in this country.”And coming up on 22 March isSection 28: Right to be Gay, another fantastic listen. Presented by actor turned activist-MP Michael Cashman, the programme carefully details the atmosphere in the UK in 1988, when the appalling section 28 of the Local Government Act – which banned the “promotion of homosexuality” in schools – was passed. Cashman gets emotional as he recalls the protests, his voice choking as he recalls the unity, the chanting. I remember those protests myself, how angry and vital, as well as funny, they were. But it all happened. Exactly the history I’m here for.Explore more on these topicsRadioMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioPodcastingDigital mediaInternetSocial historyRacereviewsShareReuse this content"

The image showed a boy chasing a football on a pitch. But some of the wildflowers on the grass floated without stems. Half the goal net was missing. The boy’s hands were misshapen.View image in fullscreenPhotographer Oliver Fiegel, 47, said after 18 years in the industry he can no longer earn a living from his trade alone.Photograph: Oliver Fiegel/Guardian CommunityIn previous years, many of Fiegel’s photography clients had been newspapers and magazines. But that work has dried up recently. This image, he felt, showed one reason why: “generative illustration”, the supplied caption said.Fiegel was frustrated: the use of artificial intelligence instead of a human creative symbolised how his craft, on which he had spent years training, was being undermined and erased by the advent of generative AI tools that were cheaper and quicker, he felt, though often with worse results.“AI’s had the most devastating effect on the industry,” said Fiegel, one of dozens of people who have revealed to theObserverhow the rise of generative AI tools is changing their working life – for the better or worse – amid seismic economic shifts. “It’s happening very fast.”Fiegel, who has been a photographer for about 18 years, said he could no longer make a living and had been forced to radically diversify his income streams. Now he is ­considering opening a natural wine bar instead.For advanced economies such as the UK, Germany and the US, about60% of jobs are exposed to AI, an International Monetary Fund study concluded last year, with approximately half of them potentially negatively affected. In the UK alone, AI coulddisplace up to 3m private sector jobs, according to the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, although some job losses may be offset by new roles in a changed economy.“I only know a couple of photographers who still can live off this trade,” said Fiegel. “It’s not easy – I’ve identified as a creative my whole life.”View image in fullscreenKarl Kerner, a longtime translator, said AI tools had negatively affected him.Photograph: Karl Kerner/Guardian CommunitySince 1994, Karl Kerner has worked as a translator – between English, German and Norwegian – focusing on nonfiction scientific texts. This kind of translation, he said, required specialist knowledge and careful terminology.“I am now basically out of business,” said Kerner. “This AI has come like a tsunami.”Amid the surge in AI-driven translation and editing tools in the past few years, “the number of [work] requests just dwindled”, he added.The loss of his identity has had a huge impact, said Kerner, who was born in New York and now lives in Tønsberg, Norway. “Overnight, all this linguistic culture stuff is just worthless, really. It does something to you, because that’s who you were professionally. [It’s like] somebody takes the rug from under you.”Kerner, 64, has begun working for an agriculture consultancy. “It’s not a good age to be on the job market – it wasn’t easy,” he said.But technology is also helping him with the few translation jobs he still gets. Instead of translating word by word, he can feed a text into automated translation software, then use his knowledge to weed out inaccuracies and mistranslations, drastically reducing labour time.“I’m not a technophobe – I find it fascinating,” he said.Other workers have had a more positive experience as they integrate AI into their daily work.Alexander Calvey, a self-employed locum GP in Surrey, said using an AI scribe to write up his notes had saved him time and improved their ­quality. The results mean that he is able to “focus more on the patient than the notes”.‘Do I think doctors are going to be out of a job? Not at all’: the ex-radiologist bringing AI to healthcareRead moreCalvey, who also works for a private GP provider, added that he had managed to increasethe number of patients he sees, in some cases from four to five an hour. In future, as the technology improves, Calvey feels, AI will have further uses for guiding questioning and treatment.TheChatGPTchatbot has become a sounding board for Paul, a 44-year-old university researcher on mathematics and philosophy based in Stockholm. He said the tool was helpful for summarising literature and brainstorming research questions.“It knows a little about a lot – it knows other things people have done that I have no clue about,” allowing him to research those topics in greater depth, he said.But professional work isn’t the only thing Paul uses ChatGPT for. He also uses it for personal tasks, such as offering him an analysis if he experiences a strange dream.View image in fullscreenA pencil portrait of her mother by freelance illustrator Jenny Turner, who has seen a collapse in bespoke commissions since AI.Illustration: Jenny Turner/JETurnerArt/Guardian CommunityDespite this functionality, he is worried about the amount of information that companies controlling generative AI tools learn about their users. He said he was “very concerned” about “the power of a few corporate tech giants”.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, meanwhile, has said he wants AI to be“mainlined into the veins”of the nation to boost productivity and economic growth. But this month, the TUC has called for urgent government action toprotect workers in ­creative industriesamid disruption and job loss risks.For Jenny Turner, a 33-year-old freelance illustrator in north-east England, the drop in demand for commissions has been “very sudden” and coincided with the proliferation of AI image tools. Turner previously sold work through Etsy. She would charge, for instance, about £100 for a coloured, pencil-drawn portrait. But over the last couple of years, she began to see AI-generated images below her work in the “You may also like” section, with some prices below £10.“I can no longer compete … it’s sold at a price I could never drop to,” she said. “It’s hit me really hard, made me feel sort of empty, like you’ve kind of wasted everything – it’s just upsetting, and it makes you angry.”Turner said, after drawing since childhood and studying at art college then university, she had now delisted her illustrations on Etsy and had been forced to consider other lines of work. “If that happens in everything,” she said, “how many people are not going to have jobs?”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverChatGPTChatbotsPhotographyGPsDrawingOnline shoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a fusion best expressed across his five albums since 2015’s debut EPNocturne, while his collaborations with other artists delve into related influences, such as lo-fi UK rap on 2016’s2nd Exitwith MC Lester Duval, and downtempo R&B on 2020’sEpochwith singer Emmavie.Mist’s latest project,44th Move, is a duo with drummerRichard Spaventhat explores rhythm. Harnessing Spaven’s astounding capacity to play time-shifting yet metronomically perfect grooves, the duo’s debut album,Anthem, is a mighty showcase of beats and keys. Tracks such as the title number and 2nd September channel the classic Mist sound, featuring reverb-laden Rhodes chords and a laidback groove over an earworming motif, yet it’s whenAnthemdeparts from the formula that itbecomes most engaging.Free Hit finds Spaven playing through warped breakbeats as Mist artfully accompanies. Second Wave touches on moody drum’n’bass, while Barrage moves into dub territory with a hypnotic, echo-laden groove.

At any given time, I have at least four blocks in my fridge, ready to be softened and whipped into cakes or rubbed into flour for pastry. There is a camp of people who prefer to use salted butter for baking, and while there are definitely instances where that has its place (think shortbread and cookies), I find it much easier and more consistent to be able to control the salt level myself, especially because it varies so much between brands.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

But a shared passion for playing music grew into something James could do – brilliantlyJohn HarrisSat 15 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 09.53 EDTShareIstart playing songs to my son James from the moment he is born. If I’m given the job of rocking him back to sleep, I usually put on reggae: Junior Murvin’s Police and Thieves and Dawn Penn’s You Don’t Love Me (No, No, No) tend to do the trick. If my partner Ginny or I sing along to whatever is on the CD player, it brings him a gurgling kind of delight. In this, he is – obviously – no different from any other child. But not long after his first birthday, I get a sharp sense that music might speak to him in a particularly vivid, mood-altering way.I play James the title track of Clear Spot by Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band only once. Its mixture of discordant guitar, growling vocals and knock-kneed drumming, I suspect, might strike him as curious and funny, like a big, monster-centred production number from Sesame Street or The Muppet Show. But it has pretty much the reverse effect: within a few seconds, his face is suddenly filled with an expression of absolute panic, he screams in protest, and I instantly know I have to turn it off and never put it on again.When James is just over 18 months old, he starts to walk, and he begins to talk a few months afterwards – both a little later than our parenting books suggest. There are very quirky aspects of the way he interacts with the world. When he is happy or excited, he flaps his arms – sometimes so animatedly that the effort required completely consumes him. Everyone notices this. Our friends think it’s cute; so, therefore, do we.On Sundays, I usually take him to an expanse of pebbles and rocks on a river bend about 15 minutes’ walk from where we live. He walks some of the way; when he gets tired, I carry him on my shoulders. Once there, he happily plonks stones into the water. Doing so never seems to become boring or reach any kind of conclusion. And whether we stay there for 30 minutes or two hours, the suggestion that it is time to leave is always met with a burst of rage and upset, so loud and traumatic that it sometimes takes both of us the rest of the day to recover.Some of his more benign rituals are about music, or the stuff around it. One happens at the start of every day. “Fi pee bus,” he says. He then waddles over to the bookcase, where there are around 70 books about the Beatles. (It’s that kind of house – I am an obsessive fan who spent the first 15 or so years of my working life as a music writer; Ginny used to be a press officer at Parlophone, the Beatles’ first record label, and we first met at a Beatles launch). He tries to pick up one big book that breaks down the band’s career into a daily chronicle, and then gets very excited when I intervene, stopping at a page that contains a picture of the coach that had been driven around the West Country during the making of Magical Mystery Tour. This carries on for weeks, and I realise that he is asking to “find a picture of the bus”.When James is about to turn two, we buy him a tiny toy piano. Knowing that as long as he plays the white keys it will sound in tune with anything in the key of C, I show him how to play random notes in a 4/4 rhythm. As I play the guitar, for five or six minutes at a time, he hammers the keys in perfect time. Every eight or so bars, he looks up with an expression of complete delight.One day, I put on the Beatles’ Paperback Writer. He fixes me with an intense and very happy look and does his best to precisely repeat all the words, which he has obviously learned phonetically, soaking them up whenever he hears them. He does the entire song, pretty much faultlessly: “Dee Sir Madah, will you ree mah book …”This seems a thing of wonder. By now, though, I am also experiencing pangs of worry. By the standards of the other kids at his nursery, he is quiet and withdrawn. A few times, people we meet say he seems “placid”, a word that always rattles around my head for days. Sometimes, I hear other kids of his age talking, and suddenly think, James doesn’t do that. But we are first-time parents: between the fact that he talks and walks and those few apparently striking abilities, we have enough to bat away any worries and blithely muddle on.View image in fullscreenJohn with a seven-year-old James at Camp Bestival, Dorset, 2014.Photograph: courtesy of John HarrisJust before James turns three, he is joined by a sister, Rosa. When the day comes to bring Ginny and Rosa home from the hospital, James picks his way to where they are with an air of hesitation. When Ginny extends her arms so Rosa is closer to him, he looks at her with a curiosity that seems to be combined with shock, and pulls back. Back at home a couple of weeks later, he bursts into tears. What he says leaves us in no doubt about what the matter is: “Why Rosa?”Two months pass, and we move house, from Hay-on-Wye, in Wales, to Frome, in Somerset – another town seemingly filled with resting actors, bohemians and members of the Green party, only bigger. James is obviously thrown by the move, and the arrival of his sister: he is quiet – often to the point of silence – and sometimes unsettlingly distant. I notice that even the things that used to be certain to lift his mood – music, a walk to the park, the right programme on CBeebies – no longer seem to work.In the early summer, we spend a week in the Welsh seaside resort of Tenby. One day, we go to Pembroke Castle. I take James to the top of one of the towers, hold him up and ask: “What can you see. James? Look how small the cars are. Can you see the houses?” He doesn’t follow any of this, at all. His eyes are glazed, and in a faint whisper, he comes out with a burbling stream of words he has seemingly soaked up from the TV, like a human tape recorder: “When the night is black and the stars are bright / And the sea is dark and deep … Time for Teletubbies / Time for Teletubbies / Time for Teletubbies.”That night, we put him to bed, and I go back to check on him half an hour later. As I climb the stairs, I hear the same murmured scripts, and feel a mounting sense of panic. Inside his room, I find him lying faceup with his eyes focused nowhere in particular. It is as if he is in a trance. And then it all comes again: “When the night is black and the stars are bright / And the sea is dark and deep …” I put my face in front of his and say his name, but nothing changes. In some very unsettling, inexplicable way, he isnot here.I try to make light of all this, but I sound like a facetious idiot. “James has gone bonkers,” I say. We have no idea whether we should be concerned. But amid nappies, wine, baby food and broken sleep, we blithely muddle on.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pal Hansen/The GuardianThen, back in Frome, something happens. One afternoon, Ginny returns from the nursery James has been going to for three weeks. At drop-off and pickup, we have started to detect a feeling of unease from the people we speak to.“They’ve just told me a load of things about him,” she says. She looks out of the window; I sense that if she turns her eyes to me, she’ll lose it.That is exactly what happens: everything else comes out in panicked fragments. When they call the kids to snack time or tell them they can go outside, he doesn’t notice. When the others all take off their shoes, or get ready to leave, he never does anything like that. They say that the TV talk is just about all he comes out with.By now, she is crying. I get up from my chair and hold her. “They think he might be autistic,” she says. Everything seems to stop.What happens next is brutal. My perception of James changes. Before, he was simply full of life and joy and quirks. Now, he suddenly looks lost and fragile. Because most of what we are told by experts and professionals is about supposedly normal things that he is unable to do, everything he says or does is freighted with worrying portents.There were plenty of signs of James’s autism, though we either had not seen them, or failed to appreciate their significance. Now, as we pick through websites and pamphlets, there is a terrifying clarity to everything.“Autistic people have difficulties with interpreting both verbal and non-verbal language like gestures or tone of voice. Some autistic people are unable to speak or have limited speech.”We should have noticed that James neither points, nor waves hello or goodbye. If we try to draw his visual attention to something, getting him to focus on the same thing is often impossible. In general, imitation is a strange, alien skill.At first, when we asked him questions, he didn’t answer; now, he has taken to responding to them with a strange truncated echo:“Do you want a biscuit or some cake?”“Biscuit or some cake?”“After lunch, do you want to go into town?”“Go into town?”“Autistic people may also repeat movements such as hand flapping, rocking or the repetitive use of an object such as twirling a pen or opening and closing a door.”The way he flaps his arms when he is excited or happy – one of his most endearing traits – is “self-stimulatory behaviour” or “stimming”, which is how some autistic people use movement to soothe themselves.On and on it goes: a great list of problems that strips any magic away and leaves everything pathologised. His habit of precisely reciting whole passages from books or TV programmes is explained in one of the books I buy. “The repetition of words may have little meaning for the child and this empty echoing, like a parrot, is called ‘echolalia’,” it says.And there is one realisation that really stings. Change can be hugely difficult for autistic people, and there is a whole world of online advice about “transition strategies”. We have just presented James with two classic examples: the arrival of his sister, and a house move. No wonder he has been tired and withdrawn.It is September, a time of the year I always associate with fun receding and the demands of the real world suddenly tightening their grip. After going to see our GP, an endless series of form-filling for us and developmental tests for James begins. An educational psychologist comes to the house with a box of paraphernalia and tries – in vain, mostly – to get James to build towers out of small blocks and pick up tiny beads, while she puts ticks or crosses on her paperwork. There are two meetings with speech and language specialists. Eventually, Ginny and I sit for a long scripted interview with an NHS paediatrician, which results in a completely obvious verdict that arrives in the post.“In conclusion,” it says, “James meets the criterion for an autistic spectrum disorder.” Implicitly, the brisk two-page letter has another message: that all the fuss and questioning is now pretty much over, and we are going to have to cope as best we can.James sings along to I Am the Walrus without a mistake; Can’t Buy Me Love makes him perform joyous circuitsLife feels panicked, myopic and weird: all about James, and what we might be able to do to help him. If I pick a fear, Google will instantly deliver. Only 22% of autistic people, I read, have a job; 80% of the parents of autistic children say they are often “stretched beyond their limits”. The parents of children with an autism diagnosis have a much greater chance of divorce than couples as a whole.What keeps us going is the delight and fascination James gets from music. Again and again, he takes us back to the Beatles. James sings along to I Am the Walrus without a single mistake: he has perfectly memorised all of its details. When he puts on Paperback Writer, he knows all the words and the falsetto parts that come after each verse. Can’t Buy Me Love and All My Loving make him perform joyous circuits of the kitchen. Because he can confidently operate the iPod, he habitually flits through all the Beatles’ albums, and finds the other songs that are becoming part of his personal repertoire: Help!, Here Comes The Sun, I Feel Fine.One Saturday, I buy him the DVD of the Yellow Submarine movie: that 90-minute fantasia in which the evil Blue Meanies invade a harmonious utopia called Pepperland, outlaw music and turn everyone to stone. Then, summoned from Liverpool by an escapee called Old Fred, John, Paul, George and Ringo set out on an odyssey that leads to Pepperland’s liberation and the Meanies’ conversion to love and peace.I know when something he watches is a hit: he puts his face no more than six inches from whichever screen he is looking at, and it is impossible to pull him away. He adores the When I’m Sixty-Four sequence, when the Beatles shrink back to being little kids and then rapidly age, sprouting huge grey beards and moustaches as the animated clocks speed forwards. I find it on YouTube: for at least a week, at least 10 times a day, he responds to it with a beaming grin and delighted hand- flapping.In time, he will meticulously memorise the year each of their albums was made, and where each sits in the sequence, so that Please Please Me is number one, and Let It Be is album 12. Since I was James’s age, I have had a deep sense of the Beatles’ brilliance; now he has discovered it, too.In the months leading up to James’s fifth birthday, we are plunged into a grinding struggle with our local council over what he’ll require if he’s going to go to a mainstream school. He needs a whole system of one-to-one support, therapy for his sensory and language issues, and much more besides. Our request for a formal assessment is turned down flat, so we have to launch a legal appeal. Then, just as we are about to reach a tribunal, we are told that the council will give us roughly what we want. A long run of arduous meetings then starts; when I get back from the last one, I burst into tears.Finally, a huge day arrives: James in his Clarks shoes, white polo shirt, bottle-green jumper and grey trousers. He has had a handful of practice visits to his new school, but that doesn’t ease the anxiety we’re all feeling. The first time I drop him off, all I can think of is a Tears for Fears lyric that I used to think of as being unintentionally funny, but which now seems as serious as its writer intended: “Went to school and I was very nervous / No one knew me / No one knew me”. In the classroom, he does what he always does when he is overwhelmed, alternating between hand-flapping and whispered echolalia, and small stretches of stillness and silence. Straight away, I notice the things that really highlight James’s difference: the instinctive way that most of the kids effortlessly settle into groups; the fact that clapped hands or a single word – “Right!” – instantly get their attention.Because he can’t tell me much about what he does at school, I look for other signs of what he is getting out of it, and how it makes him feel. There is not much to go on – but one morning, when I ask him who else in his class, he slowly lists 10 or 11 names. This leaves Ginny and me in bits.These are the kinds of things that keep us going: for the moment, life is not about huge leaps or hideous crises, but small steps forward, and a fragile calm.In time, though, our fear and worry come roaring back. James’s system of support starts to slip, and so does his mood. There are suggestions that he should have his own daily schedule with little or no academic elements in it, and hints that he should go to a special school. He resurfaces thanks to a change of personnel and a brilliant idea: rewarding him for doing short bursts of work with five or 10 minutes in the hall, where the speaker system blares out I Am the Walrus, Yellow Submarine and the Clash’s London Calling.Before long, another big change comes into view. In Somerset, we have middle schools, which amount to the terrifying prospect of nine-year-olds suddenly having to cope with timetables and regular changes of classroom. For James, some of this will be smoothed over by his tutors, but it will be another rupture for him – and, for Ginny and me, an anxiety about whether everything will work out that slowly builds through the summer.For the last two years, I have been chairing political discussions at Glastonbury, in the big top known as the Left Field. Most of what happens there is put together by the singer Billy Bragg. He lives on the Dorset coast; when the time comes to discuss who we fancy asking to take part and what they ought to discuss, he graciously drives up to Frome, and spends several hours at our house, thrashing everything out.The 14-year-old who bought his first two albums is still inside me somewhere: when I offer him tea and custard creams and we throw around the names of climate protesters, Labour MPs and trade union leaders, I feel a frisson of starstruck amazement. Back then, I used to listen to his songs while I did my morning paper round. Now, here he is, in the corner of the kitchen where I keep my acoustic guitar.View image in fullscreenJames with Billy Bragg in 2016.Photograph: Courtesy of John HarrisHe asks Ginny and me how James is doing. We mention that as we have started to talk to him about the end of his time at his first school and what will happen at the next one, he has been singing a defiant three-word mantra. When we explain this, Billy reaches for the guitar and combines James’s line with two chords; the result sounds like the chorus of an as-yet-unwritten parody of the Clash.I go and get the microphone and amplifier we keep in the music room. Sitting next to him, James tentatively joins in, as we film it. “Louder!” says Billy.On a Thursday morning two weeks later, his class is honoured with a leavers’ assembly. Behind-the-scenes lobbying by James’s new tutor Lisa has made sure that it has the perfect opening. Ginny and I watch from the back of the school hall. A big projection screen is unfurled, the lights are dimmed, and there is James’s 19-second punk-rock answer to all his ups and downs.He sings it with a glint of mischief:No more school, no more schoolNo more school, no more schoolNo more school, no more schoolNoMoreSchoolFor a long time, a thought has been nagging at me: if James can read so prodigiously, and has such an ear for music, isn’t it time we found someone to teach him an instrument? Now, with the return of some stability and calm, we decide to do something.I take a Monday morning off work, and start searching online for “special needs piano teachers”. I can find only one, and she lives an hour away. The fact that this will entail a two-hour round trip doesn’t even occur to me: my mind is in super-drive, and it feels like something good is going to happen.Hajnalka, who is Hungarian, lives in two rooms. At right angles to a small kitchenette, next to shelves full of sheet music, there is a Yamaha keyboard fitted with a music stand, and two chairs. I sit near the front door. James takes his place at the keyboard. “What can you play, James?” she says. I was expecting this, so we have prepared something: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star in C, which took him about 90 seconds to learn.He plays it. “OK,” she says. “Let me try something.”The keyboard has its own drum machine. She sets it to a fast tempo – boom-crash/boom-boom-crash – and asks James to play again.He does it beat perfect.She then changes the rhythm setting to a waltz – boom-crash-crash/boom-crash-crash – and asks James to do it again. Putting music in a different time signature is not easy: all the emphases change. But he does it as a matter of instinct.“Amazing,” she says.“Amazing,” I reply, and I really am amazed.Getting James to practise at home, though, is hard. Most of the pieces – Girls and Boys, Come Out to Play, Austrian waltz, Oats and Beans – are rather charmless. He sometimes reacts with shrieks: “I DON’T WANT TO DO KEYBOARD PRACTICE I WANT TO GO ON THE COMPUTER.” To maintain his cooperation, I soon have to use one of the token boards he uses at school. The best is based on the sleeve art for Abbey Road. Each Beatle has a little Velcro dot on his back, and as James gets each part of a task right, they are stuck to the zebra crossing – first George, then Paul, then Ringo, then John, at which point he earns a break.Not long after the lessons have started, I teach him something. First on the iPod, and then Spotify, James has become fixated on yet another song: I’m Waiting for the Man by the Velvet Underground, Lou Reed’s insouciant portrait of scoring heroin in uptown Manhattan.I think I know why he likes it: it is something to do with its amazingly repetitive music. This was a Velvet speciality. In a different form, it reached its peak on Sister Ray, the 17-minute closing track on their second album, before surfacing spectacularly in the mesmerising version of What Goes On included on 1969: The Velvet Underground Live.Music with this incessant quality tends to impress James – he has a similar obsession with the Kraftwerk song Autobahn. It seems to reflect the autistic fondness for what the diagnostic manuals call “rigid and repetitive” behaviour, and his habit of playing small parts of songs over and over. Maybe there is something synaesthesia-ish at work, to do with some autistic people’s liking for enclosed spaces: the sense that in creating such a thrillingly confined feeling, repetitive songs deliver a deep comfort.Or maybe, like millions of other people, he just likes songs like that. Anyway, I know how to play I’m Waiting for the Man. I set the keyboard’s drum machine to “Rock 2” – boom-crash/boom-boom-crash – and off we go. Five chords, and five verses: while I chug along on the guitar, James only has to trigger the correct music with his left hand – E, A, G sharp, F sharp – and shout and sing the words, which he loves: even as phonetic sounds, he clearly thinks such lines as “PR shoes and a big straw hat” are fantastic. If we were in a recording studio, I would say that he nails it on the first take.Another September. James starts at middle school, in a new maroon uniform. As a result, things still feel fragile and fitful, but James starts to make progress. His weekly highlight is the music class led by a teacher called Miss Parsons, who looks like a retired ballet dancer, and is full of warmth, but also unbelievably ordered and together. Miss Parsons always shows James songs and riffs he can play on the keyboard, and, at the end of each lesson, she also lets him select songs to play from Spotify to the whole class. He is regularly allowed to spend some of his lunch break doing as he pleases with the instruments in the music room.Eventually, Miss Parsons tells us about her department’s annual production. It’s called Oakfield’s Got Talent, and she wonders whether James might perform? When I ask him, I get a fervent yes; to reduce the chances of anything unexpected happening, she agrees to the suggestion that I should accompany him on an acoustic guitar.View image in fullscreenSet and fashion styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists using Active Silver and Charlotte Tilbury. Suits: with thanks tobeatlestyle.com.Photograph: Pal Hansen/The GuardianIt happens just over a fortnight later. We decide to perform When the Saints Go Marching In and I’m Waiting for the Man, both of which have been extensively practised, and then played in three dress rehearsals.We will be the first act on. The school hall is packed, and I am full of churning anxiety. James does not seem nervous at all.An introduction – “This is James Harris, and his dad!” – and off we go. The keyboard’s swing jazz preset begins gurgling and thumping away and James plays the first notes of The Saints on its trumpet preset, whereupon the mums and dads in the audience instantly start clapping along, on the “on” beat. This throws him. He drops out of the rhythm, then drops back in, then drops out again. We may be about to implode.But, as ever, James is great at correcting his mistakes. At the start of our second and final verse, everything coheres, and he plays the rest perfectly. A beatific smile breaks out on his face. He presses the “end” button on the keyboard, and in a final flurry of booms and crashes and one last chord, we finish. The applause this triggers is quite something: a great warm burst of encouragement and appreciation that makes me well up.I reach for a piece of paper that is serving as a cue card, and James reads it out: “This next song was originally by the Velvet Underground, and it’s called” – he then slows down – “I’m. Waiting. For. The. Man.”When we play it, James sounds like Mark E Smith from the Fall, barking out the words, and rising to the conclusion of each verse – “Oh, I’m waiting for mah man” – with a loud sense of triumph. A few times, he drifts away from the microphone, and yells the words into the air. We have worked out a procedure for this: I say “Microphone! Microphone!” out of the side of my mouth, and he returns to the right spot.Here is something James can do on the same terms as everyone else. Better still, he loves doing itI don’t know if many of the audience quite understand what they are listening to: a less-than-wholesome song about copping dope in 1960s Manhattan, the grimness of withdrawal, and the rapturous pleasure of yet another hit of heroin. But they like it: we get a second round of applause, and I do that showbiz thing of camply extending my arm in James’s direction. There are a few whoops, and he picks his way down the wooden stairs to the right of us, before taking a seat in the audience.Ginny and Rosa are there. To us, the meaning of the six minutes James and I have just spent on the stage is pretty obvious. If you are repeatedly told what your child can’t do, it starts to eat at you. Certain words hover over you: “severe”, “profound”, “impairment”. You miss superlatives; whatever successes your child achieves, they don’t tend to feel like the same ones other kids experience. But here is something James can do – brilliantly, fantastically, wonderfully – on the same terms as everyone else. Better still, he loves doing it, and it makes him the centre of attention.It is a gorgeous summer evening, and everything feels as if it is surrounded by a lovely glow. When we get home, James does not sleep, but I do not mind at all. “I want to do that again,” he says. “I want to do that again!”This is an edited extract from Maybe I’m Amazed: A Story of Love and Connection in 10 Songs by John Harris (John Murray Press, £16.99).

We had just been friends but it wasn’t long before we became an item. I’d dreamed of sleeping with millions of people as soon as I became single, but it didn’t turn out that way. I only slept with one other person before this became an exclusive thing. And I think that’s due to the sex I was having with Alfredo.It was really exciting because I’d been in a fairly sexless entanglement that had brought me down mentally. So to be out of that and sleeping with someone who was actually interested in me was so refreshing. He was so attentive – I’d never had someone go down on me so much before in my life. It was amazing.I knew I would have some kind of baggage around sex due to my previous relationship, but I didn’t know how it would manifest. Alfredo and I have now been together for three years, we live together, so things have slowed down, though we make sure to have sex at least once a week. I’ve noticed that I’ve lost that initial burst of confidence I had, which I think is a hangover from my previous relationship.I have a fear of doing things wrong, that it will push him away and make him not want to have sex with meI have a fear of doing things wrong; that it will push him away and make him not want to have sex with me. This stems from my own insecurities, but there has been the odd time he’s said something unintentionally that’s made me feel self-conscious, like when he said he didn’t like blowjobs. I’m trying to work out if he means mine specifically or blowjobs in general. He’s said it’s the latter, but I can’t help feeling it’s me, which is a bit stressful.But he also has his own insecurities. When we have penetrative sex, he usually climaxes before me, sometimes after a few minutes. He’s so considerate with his hands and tongue that it’s never been an issue. There’s have only been a couple of times where I’ve thought: I really fancy more today, so it’s a shame he’s already finished.We’ve now got to the point where we both want to develop things in the bedroom, experiment and just try to have the best sex we can.Alfredo, 32Now that I have sex consistently, it’s like it’s fallen down on my priority list, because in theory we can have sex whenever we wantAna Sofía is my first girlfriend. At the beginning it was extremely exciting. Her previous relationship had recently ended so I assumed that she wouldn’t want to get into something straight away, and that our sex life might end at any point. I think that elevated the sex and our desire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve noticed that now we have sex consistently and whenever we want, it has fallen down my priority list. Now that I have it, I need it less. The fact that things have slowed down is not a problem because, in the end, I’m still having more sex than ever before. If you boil it down to numbers, I’m still winning.I never thought that climaxing too early would be an issue of mine. But it happens sometimesThe biggest challenge is the expectation of my prowess. I never thought climaxing too early would be an issue. But it happens sometimes and I think that was because alcohol or other drugs – which can delay ejaculation – were often a social lubricant when I was single. Now Ana Sofía and I mainly have sober sex. It’s not a big problem as there are ways around it. I try to do things to control quick release like counting how many deep thrusts I do in comparison with shallow ones. I used to try thinking about other things, but I’ve stopped that because sometimes my mind really does just go elsewhere. Once I realised I’d forgotten to take the bins out, which I then said out loud while we were still having sex.But I think the main way we get around it is foreplay. I try to ensure that Ana Sofía has at least one orgasm. That’s really important to me. When I was a teenager I read a book called She Comes First about the importance of women climaxing first. All the sex education I’d previously had was just about the very functional ways of sex. So from this I learned about the importance of cunnilingus and all these other ways of pleasuring women. That for me was an early eye-opener.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s been following the news carefully and is eager to make a request for an assisted death. I hear you’ll be providing this service here in Victoria – courageous! I look forward to your assessment. Summary of his file is below.” I read it twice to myself before sharing it with Karen, my office manager. We look at each other for a short moment before I break the silence. “His name is Harvey. I’m going to need a chart.”While Karen makes a chart for Harvey – demographics on the front sheet, blank request forms in the back – I dial his number. His wife, Norma, answers. As Harvey isn’t mobile, I agree to meet them at their home.Three days later, I stand in my bathroom brushing my teeth and practising what I will say, the tone I want to set. If Harvey meets all the criteria, he will be the first patient to whom I will offer medical assistance in dying (MAiD), following its legalisation in Canada just a few days earlier, in June 2016.At the time I had been practising medicine for more than 20 years, trained as a family physician, and focused on maternity and newborn care, preparing women and their families for the profound transition a new baby would bring to their lives. But when it became clear the law was about to change to allow MAiD, I changed course with it, learning everything I could about this newly emerging field so that I could support people with their final wishes and their transition at the other end of life.When I arrive at Harvey’s home for the assessment, a man in his 70s with a bushy grey moustache opens the door and smiles sadly as he extends his hand. “Hi, thanks for coming. I’m Rod, Harvey’s brother-in-law.”I cross the threshold and am ushered upstairs, where I see a man in a bathrobe and a woman sitting close together on a couch. “Hello, Doctor, thank you for coming,” she says, smiling. “I’m Norma.” Her hands fidgeting, she appears slightly nervous, or maybe just awkward. I recognise the same feeling within myself.Dressed in grey pyjamas and covered with a warm blanket, Harvey looks years older than Norma. I notice his protuberant, fluid-filled abdomen and papery, yellowed skin, signs that his liver failure is advanced. I see his frail hands and gaunt, unshaved face. He likely has only weeks left to live.“Good to meet you,” I say as I give his hand a squeeze. It is cool and bony, mottled with purple, and has little musculature left, but he holds on a little tighter and just a moment longer than I expect, slowly shifting his gaze to look me straight in the eye before letting go. I sit down in front of Harvey and ready myself to begin what I have been practising all morning. “I’d like to start by breaking the first rule of medical school.”Harvey musters a sly grin, intrigued, but doesn’t say anything, which I take as an invitation to continue.“In medical school, they taught me that when I meet a new patient, I should let them speak first … But I want to start by telling you something about myself. I want to tell you that I am pretty direct,” I say.Harvey is egging me on with a slow, wobbly nod.“We’re going to talk about death today, and we’re going to talk about dying,” I continue. “We’re going to talk about your death, and we’re going to talk aboutassisteddying. We’re also going to talk about what’s important to you. I’m going to talk about these things frankly. I’m not going to use euphemisms or talk about ‘passing over meadows’.” I pause and lower my voice, addressing Harvey directly. “You OK with that?”I am relieved to see he is smiling. “Yes, that’s exactly what I hoped for,” he says. “No more bullshit.” His voice is a bit gravelly, but this last word comes out strong, emphatic. “We’re going to get along just fine,” he adds.What to wear? All black seems morbid, bright colours too festive. I want to look professional but not cold, casual but no jeansI get down to the essentials. “Why do you want to die?”Harvey smirks. “I don’t! I’d rather live. I’ve had a great life. But it seems I no longer have much say in the matter.”It’s my turn to nod.“I’ve got great friends, great kids, we’re blessed with family all around us. I know I’m lucky. I’ve been married to this gal here for 52 years … ” He trails off, holds Norma’s hand, shakes it at me a bit and swallows some emotion before continuing. “I really wanted to make it to 52 years, and I did.” He’s quieter now, his energy already drained. “Now I’m ready.”Harvey is straightforward with me. He knows he is dying, that it will not be long, but he wants to control the how and the when.“I want Norma and the kids with me at the end,” he says with a flash of spirit, “here, in my home, in my own bedroom … I want to do it my way. I want to have my friends over this weekend, have one last bash, maybe even sneak a sip of a beer.” He smiles at the thought. “I’ve seen friends linger on at the end … in bed … out of their minds. I’m not interested in putting myself or my family through that.”Harvey ticks every box of eligibility. He is capable of making his own decisions, he is making a voluntary request, and he has a grievous and irremediable condition. He will need to sign an official request form, and Norma assures me it will be completed by the end of the day, witnessed by two independent people. After that, a mandatory 10-day reflective period can begin. The law also requires a second clinical opinion, so I will call a local colleague to see if he is available.The next few days are busy. As is expected with his liver failure, Harvey continues to decline cognitively. If he declines too much, too quickly, he won’t be able to give his final consent immediately before the procedure, which is required. Because the second doctor and I agree this risk is imminent, we are allowed to shorten the waiting period. Harvey chooses a date three days out.True to his word, two days before his scheduled death, Harvey and Norma host an open house for friends and neighbours to celebrate his life and say goodbye. Meanwhile, I review all the practicalities and guidelines. I am keenly aware that if I get anything wrong, I could be liable for criminal charges. The words “up to 14 years in prison” keep flashing in the back of my mind. No one yet has a sense of the mood of the prosecutors. Are they waiting to meticulously comb through each case and make an example of a clinician who makes a mistake? I’m not willing to leave anything to chance. Harvey isn’t just my first assisted death. His is the first on Vancouver Island and among the first in Canada. I am aware that I need to get this right – for myself, for the MAiD programme but, most important, for Harvey.It’s 16 June 2016, the day Harvey has chosen to die. This is all about him, but it’s momentous for everyone involved. This morning I stood in my bedroom, staring into my closet, considering choices and discarding them immediately. What does one wear to a scheduled death? All black seemed morbid, bright colours too festive. I wanted to look professional but not cold, casual but no jeans. How could this be the hardest part of my day? I’ll  be picking up the medication at 10am, I’m expected at Harvey’s by 11 and I suspect he’ll be dead before noon.I pull up outside, close enough to have arrived, far enough that no one from inside can tell I’m here yet. I take a deep breath. In medical school, the saying was “see one, do one, teach one”. But in this case, there has been no way for me to “see one”. The law changed only a few days ago. I am about to take a big, blind step.I leave the car and stride to the door. Once inside, I head upstairs. I catch Norma’s eye from across the room, but before I can get over to greet her, I meet Jessica, the nurse practitioner who will assist me, standing at the top of the stairs in her scrubs and stocking feet. All I can think of is that I do not want the family to suspect we have never actually met. I don’t want to do anything that might remind them I have never done this before.There are eight close family members in the house. I ask to speak privately with Harvey for a few minutes and am told he’s in his bedroom, so I head there. Sitting in the chair by the bed, I begin, “How was your night?”“It was what it was,” he replies. “I’m ready to go. I need this to be over today.”The official purpose of this talk is for me to verify that Harvey is still clear of mind, that he still wishes to proceed and, if so, to obtain his final consent.“Are you having any second thoughts?”“No, none at all.”Harvey reassures me that his affairs are all in order; his funeral plans have been made, the names of his lawyer and his accountant have been written out for the family. He expresses some concern about those he will be leaving behind. I try to reassure him I will provide them with some resources.“Thank you for making this possible.”I don’t recall who reached out first or when we began holding hands, but, once again, he is holding mine a little longer and a little tighter than expected.“You know, I’m a little scared.”“Of course you are … that’s OK.”We talk, take the time we need. No one is in a rush.“What do you think comes next, Dr Green?”“I really don’t know, Harvey. What do you think?”“I’m not a religious man, not even very spiritual. But I do not believe this is the end. It just can’t be.”View image in fullscreen‘I join the family in the living room, explain the order of events, the number of syringes.’Photograph: Rachel Pick/The Guardian“OK. But what if it were, Harvey?” I ask. “What would you change, do differently?”He continues to hold my hand. I hear his regrets – there are few – and of what he is most proud. I learn so much from Harvey. I am already grateful that he is my first MAiD patient.At some point we both fall silent. I explain that I will go speak with his family about what to expect. By now I’ve reassured myself that he is still capable of making this choice. I hand him the required form and watch as he scratches out an unsteady version of his signature, then I join the family in the living room. I explain the order of events, the number of syringes – Harvey has chosen the intravenous option for his final medications – and the time for last words. I ask if there is any ritual or ceremony they’d like to incorporate, then I get down to the details. “The first medication is an anti-anxiety drug. It will make Harvey relax, feel pretty good, pretty sleepy. He’s already quite weak, so I expect he’ll fall quickly into a nice light sleep. We might hear him snore; that’s one way you’ll know he’s truly comfortable.”I am trying to be as transparent and informative as I can.“The second medication is a local anaesthetic to numb the vein. It may not be necessary if he is sleeping already, but some of the other medications can sting a bit, so I’ll use this to be sure he won’t feel any discomfort.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I recognise relief on Norma’s face and see blank stares on the others’ … the reality is starting to sink in.“The third medication is the stuff we would normally give someone for an operation, except it’s a much larger dose. With this, Harvey will go into a much deeper sleep, down into a coma over the course of a couple minutes. If you’re looking carefully, you might notice his breathing begins to space out with this medication.”I am using my hands now to gesture what is going to happen. “His breathing will become more shallow and will most likely stop.”I am looking around, trying to judge reactions.“Even though I expect Harvey will die with this third medication, I will go ahead and use the fourth in our protocol, which ensures there is no muscular movement in the body. I will let you know when his heart has stopped. This whole process is likely to last between eight and 10 minutes.” I lower my voice a little. “I do not expect you will see any gasping or twitching or anything unsettling. My goal is to make this as comfortable and as dignified as possible. But there is a real possibility his breathing will stop before his heart does. If that’s the case, you will likely see a paling of his face, maybe a bit of yellowing. His mouth might drop open slightly. His lips may turn a bit blue. If you find yourself uncomfortable at any time, please feel free to step back, sit down or step out. There is no medal for staying in the room. I will be focused on what I am doing, so I’ll need you to take care of yourselves in those few moments, if necessary. OK?”Muted nods. A few people breathe out as if they hadn’t realised they were holding their breath.“That’s the nuts and bolts of it. I expect it’s all feeling a bit real right now. Any questions?”There’s a pregnant pause, then a previously quiet man in his mid-70s asks, “You got any extra of that anti-anxiety stuff, Doc? I could use a dose myself right now.”Harvey’s wife tells him to let go. As on most nights of his life, hers are the last words he hears as he falls asleepBack in Harvey’s room, he is calm, he is smiling, and he appears certain. His love for family has been evident from the start and they are all here with him now. We are huddled in closely around his bed. I ask if anyone has anything left unsaid. Harvey’s son reaches out from beside me and places his open palm directly on Harvey’s chest. He repeats that he loves Harvey and thanks him for being such a great dad. Harvey reminds them all that this is what he wants and asks them not to be sad.I take hold of Harvey’s left arm. Only after he looks me in the eye and thanks me one last time do I think to begin. When I announce I will start, I sense Jessica reach out from behind me. I didn’t realise how tense I was until she put her hand on my back. I feel myself relax as I push the first medication through the syringe.“Maybe now is a good time to think of a great memory,” I begin, “doing something you loved, with someone you loved … Go to that place now, feel that moment again … If you feel sleepy, go ahead and close your eyes, you’ve earned it. We’re all here with you.”Then Harvey dies exactly as he wished: being held by his children and gazing into the eyes of his wife as he begins to feel sleepy. They connect, forehead to forehead, whispering to each other as I continue. She holds his face in her hands, strokes his head and tells him it’s OK. She tells him she loves him, that she will miss him, but that she is all right. She whispers inaudible words, evoking private memories, and he smiles. The intimacy of this moment is so absorbing that I struggle to focus on what I’m doing. She tells him to let go, that she is here with him, and as on most nights of his life, hers are the last words he hears as he falls asleep.View image in fullscreen‘By February 2017 I’d become known for my work in assisted dying, and the number of referrals to my office continued to climb.’Photograph: Rachel Pick/The GuardianHarvey musters a light snore. Norma recognises the sound and dabs at her eyes. I continue with my protocol, and Harvey soon stops breathing; no one says anything, but I am certain we all take notice. I understand in that moment that I am witnessing this event as much as I am orchestrating it. I continue on to the final medication and immediately notice it doesn’t flow as smoothly as the others did. I have an instant of panic, wondering if my IV line is blocked, but it takes only a moment for me to understand it’s because Harvey’s blood is no longer circulating. I am certain his heart has stopped, but I continue nonetheless. Only after the last medication is delivered do I cap and lock the IV. Only after the empty syringes are resealed within the plastic container do I reach for my stethoscope. And only after I listen for a complete 60 seconds do I announce, “He’s gone.”Only then do his family members allow themselves to be overcome by their loss. There are sobs, tight-clenched hugs and flowing tears. To my utter astonishment, there is also an immediate outpouring of gratitude for what I have just done, and for this, I’ll admit, I was unprepared.By February 2017 I’d gone from being a beginner in a new field of medicine to feeling more certain of what I was doing. I was becoming known among local family practitioners and specialists for my work in assisted dying, and the number of referrals to my office continued to climb. The latest concerned a patient called Edna, whose worsening multiple system atrophy was affecting every aspect of her life. Two weeks earlier, her palliative care physician, Dr Vass, had been visiting when she’d asked him for MAiD by scratching out letters on a whiteboard. It was one week after her 77th birthday, just after she’d returned home from a hospitalisation, and she had repeated her plea several times since.Edna managed a slight smile upon my arrival at her home a few days later, but her eyes seemed locked in a blank gaze. I noticed her frail body was strapped into her padded chair to stay upright. Before I even began, Edna was already scratching on the whiteboard. I waited for her to finish, three letters that said it all: “D-i-E”.I was surprised and thankful she was still able to write. She looked up and I thought she was done. She uttered a sound I didn’t understand, then brought the marker down forcefully, drawing my attention to her message. “D-i-E P-L-S-!”Request received.Edna was close to her sister, Mindy, from whom I learned that Edna had been a pioneer for most of her life, one of only two women to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in biology from her college back in 1960. She taught high school science for two decades, did a few stints as the principal of two schools, then retired from her post as superintendent of the school district at 68. An avid hiker and a supporter of women’s rights, Edna had remained active and involved in various volunteer positions until her diagnosis overwhelmed her.Edna was now unable to walk or talk, and had become dependent on others for care. Recently, she’d been losing the ability to swallow, and had landed in hospital last month after aspirating food into her lungs. There was talk of inserting a feeding tube into her stomach. She didn’t want that. She saw no reason to prolong her life as it was, but did not wish to starve to death.I spoke again to Dr Vass and two weeks later I returned to Edna’s bedside with the news that I was convinced she was eligible, and I was willing to help her. She drew a happy face … no eyes, just a smile. We then turned to practical matters. Edna had been raised in a religious home and still had family who were deeply faithful. She’d been worried about their reaction, so she’d kept much of the decision-making to herself. Now she would share her choice, and hoped they’d be willing to join her on the day of her death. With Mindy’s help, we discussed some of the obstacles she foresaw, and I arranged for a hospice counsellor to facilitate what everyone expected would be a difficult conversation.It didn’t go well. The counsellor said she had encouraged people to express their feelings and listen to others’ points of view, but much of the meeting had felt like a sermon: “As her brother was talking, she took the time to write out ‘CHRiStN ANtAgONiSM’. I’d say she’s determined to proceed.” When I returned to talk about choreographing the day of her death, Edna informed me that her relatives would not be joining us.‘I will probably not be given the chance to die in my favourite place’: Esther Rantzen on the right to choose a good deathRead moreOn the afternoon of Edna’s scheduled death, I arrived at her home expecting it would be a quiet affair. Instead, I walked into a chaotic scene. I could hear a man’s voice yelling as I opened the front door. Edna’s nephew Andrew and his wife were standing at the foot of her bed, pleading with her to reconsider.“They have poisoned your mind!” Andrew thundered. “The church will never condone this. Your soul will never rest.” His anger was mounting. “We will never condone this!”“Good afternoon,” I announced loudly. The yelling stopped immediately. “I’m Dr Green.”Edna looked calm, but her face was hard to read. I asked Andrew and his wife if we might talk in another room. I told them I respected their position, but it really didn’t matter what they wanted or believed: “This decision is Edna’s and Edna’s alone.”Andrew lapsed into silence. He stood up abruptly, then sat back down. “How can it be possible that, as a close family member, my arguments won’t be taken into account?” he asked.I assured him his arguments were important but only in relation to his own healthcare and no one else’s. “This is unconscionable!” he began ramping up again. “If you proceed, I’ll call the police. In fact, I’ll call them anyway. This must be stopped. You cannot just kill my aunt.”I was concerned to see him so upset, but Edna’s diagnosis was clear and she had made a voluntary, formal request. I felt sorry for her family, I understood they would need support, but I would not be bullied out of my responsibilities, nor would I let them bully Edna.“You can call,” I said. “I suspect they will be helpful in enforcing the law and escorting you out of this house.” Then I checked my tone and took a breath. “It would be a shame if that were Edna’s final memory of you.” We stared at each other in silence.“I see,” he said, and stood up once more. “Alice, we are leaving. We’ve done what we could. Aunt Edna will pay the price. I will not attend her murder.”And with that, they walked out. Mindy was just arriving, but they did not stop to talk. I was saddened to see them go, but I was also relieved.In an odd twist of fate, I was alone at this procedure. There had been a conflict in scheduling, so Jessica had come by earlier to start the IV, then left. In the end there was just Edna, Mindy and me in the bedroom, and Edna used the whiteboard to provide her consent. When I asked if she was ready to begin, she grunted and nodded slightly, then grabbed my hand and squeezed firmly, three times. I didn’t really know what her hand squeezes meant, but they felt like a thank you to me. For a woman who couldn’t speak any more, I thought she’d communicated beautifully. I began.Later, alone in my car, I ran over the events in my mind. Andrew referring to Edna’s death as a murder had been upsetting, even though I knew it was purposeful hyperbole. I had to remind myself it was Edna’s disease that was killing her and my role was only to facilitate her free will. Afterwards I asked colleagues if they’d ever encountered such resistance, and I’m sorry to say I wasn’t alone. Much more common, though, were friends or family members who declined to attend, citing differences in values, but remained respectful of their loved one’s right to do as they pleased.I spent several weeks worrying about whether Edna’s event might lead to a complaint to the professional licensing body. I was confident of the outcome, but dreaded having to go through the process. I took comfort in the fact that, in the end, Edna died with dignity, holding the hand of a person who loved her, confident in her decision and empowered by a rights-based legal system. I’m happy to report no complaint was made.This is an edited extract from This Is Assisted Dying: A Doctor’s Story of Empowering Patients at the End of Life by Stefanie Green, published by Simon & Schuster on 27 March at £20.

He was headed toward a Tesla showroom in Salem, and his cart appeared to be loaded with molotov cocktails, according to court documents. One by one, he took out the handmade explosives, lit them on fire and lobbed them at the glass-walled dealership.By the time Salem police arrived, the showroom window was shattered, a fire was burning on the sidewalk out front, a nearbyTeslasedan was ablaze and the alleged vandal had fled. The whole scene was caught by security footage, according to an affidavit from a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The showroom’s general manager estimated $500,000 in damages, with seven vehicles struck and one completely destroyed.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Bullet holes left in the window of Tesla DealershipBottom: A damaged Tesla dealershipPhotograph: Salem Police DepartmentThe vandalism incident is one of dozens to hit Tesla dealerships, cars and the electric vehicle maker’s charging stations across the country since Trump took office. Many bear explicit messages protesting againstElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and a senior adviser to the president. Musk is the head of the unofficial so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and has made it his prerogative to overhaul the federal government – ordering the firing of tens of thousands of employees, slashing agency budgets and eliminating entire departments. His hardline approach, which takes aim at institutions including the National Weather Service, the Department of Education and the Social Security Administration, has elicited backlash and criticism nationwide.Thousands have attended peaceful protests at Tesla showrooms in cities and towns across the country. In the 54-odd days since the inauguration, those protests have grown from ahandful of people in cities like San Franciscochanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Elon Musk has got to go” to massive demonstrations across the US replete with live bands, Musk-as-Hitler costumes and heavy police presence. They have also crossed the Atlantic, with demonstrations occurring in the UK and Germany.As the protests have multiplied, so has vandalism against Tesla’s brick-and-mortar business and individual vehicles. The Guardian has tracked at least three separate incidents involving molotov cocktails, the coordinated theft of nearly 50 Tesla tires and spray-painted swastikas on Tesla facilities from New York to New Mexico. Nearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set, while dozens of owners have had their cars egged, pooped on and hit with Kraft cheese singles.Like the protests, the defacement and destruction of Tesla facilities has also gone international, with sedans and Cybertrucks targeted in at least five other countries. In France, authorities in Toulouse reported thata dozen cars were torchedat a Tesla showroom earlier this month. Another showroom in the Netherlandswas graffitiedwith slogans such as “fuck off fascist” and others that called Musk a Nazi. One vandal as far away as Tasmaniawrote“do you really want to drive a swasticar” across a dealership window.Musk and Tesla did not return requests for comment. In response to a police report of Tesla vandalism in Massachusetts, Muskposted on X, “Damaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!” Musk also reposted an interview with Valerie Costa, an organizer of the nonviolent Tesla Takedown demonstrations, andaccused herof “committing crimes”.Trump said earlier this week that he wouldlabel the violence against Tesla showroomsas domestic terrorism as he stood next to Musk in front of the White House. “I’m going to put a stop to it,” Trump said. “Because they’re harming a great American company.”View image in fullscreenTrump and Musk speak to the press from inside a Tesla on the South Portico of the White House on 11 March 2025 in Washington, DC.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesA day later, the House speaker Mike Johnson boosted the proposed designation. “Congress will investigate the sources of these attacks and help the DOJ & FBI ensure those responsible are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Johnsonposted on X, the social media platform Musk owns.Musk thanked Johnson on X, adding both a salute and American flag emoji.Hurling molotovs and firing semi-automaticsIn Salem, one month after the suspect first hurled molotov cocktails at the Tesla dealership, he returned. This time he came armed with what police believe to be a semi-automatic rifle.At around 4am, surveillance footage shows him firing multiple rounds into the empty Tesla showroom, once again shattering windows and hitting a car parked inside the building. Investigators collected bullet fragments, logged surveillance video and sent the leftover molotov cocktails to an FBI lab in Alabama for fingerprint dusting. No one was injured.ATF agents believe both incidents are linked to Salem resident Adam Lansky, who has been apprehended and charged. Lansky’s lawyer did not return a request for comment.In the small Colorado town of Loveland, police rushed to a Tesla showroom in response to a report of a fire burning by a Cybertruck on 29 January.Underneath the vehicle, they found a spent molotov cocktail.As with the Salem incident, the suspect in the Loveland case returned to the scene, according to court documents. Four days later, the word “Nazi” was spray painted on the dealership’s sign. Over the following weeks, the showroom was targeted three more times with molotov cocktails and graffiti. Lucy Grace Nelson, a resident from a nearby town, was charged for the series of incidents. Her lawyer declined to comment on the case.Police in North Charleston, South Carolina, are also investigating a vandal who threw a molotov cocktail at a Tesla charging station earlier this week, setting both it and himself on fire and forcing officials to cut the station’s power. The words “long live the Ukraine” were spray painted in red on the pavement next to the charging stations, according to theAssociated Press. The incident came after Trump rolled back US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, a move that Musk embraced.View image in fullscreenA person clad in black clothes hurling a molotov cocktail.Photograph: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF)Deliberate fires have also been set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations throughout the US without molotovs. Earlier this month, in Littleton, Massachusetts, seven Tesla charging stations were set ablaze in one night,according to CBS. Police found the first station thick with dark smoke and flames. Fires were also set at a Tesla facility in rural New Mexico and in an electric vehicle holding lot in Seattle, Washington, this week.The Seattle fire department told the Guardian it found four Cybertrucks engulfed in flames when it arrived on the scene at around 11pm last Sunday. Local news station Komo Newsflew a drone over the wreckageand filmed one Cybertruck reduced to “little more than a charred hunk of metal”. Another was so badly burned that the windows melted, according to Komo. The Seattle police declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Salt Lake City, swastikas and the word “Nazi” were found at both a Tesla Service Center and a separate charging station, according to local police. Black swastikas were alsopainted on a charging stationin the small mountain town of Meyers in California. In Ithaca, New York, along with swastikas, “Hail Hitler” and “Tesla is Fascist” wereemblazoned on the superchargers.At a Tesla facility in Lynnwood, Washington, vandals targeted a cluster of six Cybertrucks but left other vehicles there untouched.“I observed red spray paint on each of the cyber trucks,” reads a police report from Lynnwood obtained by the Guardian. “The graffiti wrote ‘Fuck Elon’ and a multitude of swastikas were spray painted onto the body panels of the vehicles.”Egged, spray painted and pooped onSome vandals have opted for incapacitating Musk’s cars rather than destroying them. In League City, Texas, 44 wheels were stolen off cars in an overflow parking lot for a Tesla dealership. The lot was hit on two separate occasions, with a total of 13 vehicles damaged. Jose Ortega, a spokesman for the League City police, said the case is inactive due to a lack of leads. Nearby surveillance cameras weren’t recording and “the cameras on the Teslas were not active since they were powered off”, Ortega said.Much of the vandalism targeting Teslas involves minor, less destructive methods than molotov cocktails and spray paint. Tesla owners around the country have had their cars plastered with anti-Musk stickers and flyers, as well as hit with eggs and dog feces.The owner of a golden Cybertruck in Southborough, Massachusetts, discovered that someone had put a “Nazis fuck off” sticker on his bumper last month, hetold local media. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, police in Brooklinearresteda 39-year-old man earlier this month and charged him with six counts of defacing property over allegedly putting stickers depicting Musk giving a fascist-style salute on people’s cars.Other Tesla drivers have seen their vehicles pelted with foodstuffs, including a Maryland woman whotold the Washington Postthat her car was hit with around a dozen eggs while she was driving home. In Dallas, Texas, a man had Kraft singlesthrown at his Tesla.Vandalism incidents can turn into viral social media content, likea post on X, viewed 25m times, that showed a Cybertruck in Brooklyn, New York, covered in broken eggs and dog feces. OneTikTokthat received over 700,000 views showed a man weaponizing the administrative state against a Tesla vehicle: he called a parking attendant when he saw a Cybertruck allegedly parked in a loading zone in hopes of getting it ticketed or towed.Tesla owners turn against Musk: ‘I’m embarrassed driving this car around’Read moreThe fears of vandalism and questions over what to do about their car’s association with Musk have become hot topics of discussion in online communities dedicated to Tesla. A thread started last month about “dealing with anti-Tesla sentiment” on Tesla Motors Club, an independent online forum for Tesla owners, received over 400 replies until it was closed to further posts. Bumper stickers that state “I bought this before Elon went crazy” are now widely available online and have been spotted on Teslas around the country. Other social media posts show people trying to disguise their Teslas bychanging their hood and bumper ornamentsto mimic brands like Honda or Toyota. Some Tesla owners areselling their vehicles at a lossto rid themselves of the stigma.Police have also been seen guarding Cybertrucks and dealerships during demonstrations. A widelyshared TikTok videotaken last week during the New York City Women’s March showed a group of New York police department officers surrounding a Cybertruck parked on the street while a protester held a “no to Tesla” sign up behind them. Crowds at a Mardi Gras celebration earlier this month in New Orleansbooed a Cybertruckand hurled beads at its windows, forcing it off a parade route as police attempted to shield it from harm.The wave of vandalism doesn’t seem to be ebbing. Back in Loveland, Colorado, almost two weeks after Nelson was arrested for lobbing molotov cocktails at the Tesla showroom, the same facility was targeted on 7 March, just after midnight.Using an incendiary device, someone ignited a fire between two Teslas and threw rocks at the showroom – breaking windows and damaging several cars. No injuries were reported and police say the incident doesn’t appear to be connected to Nelson, the prior suspect. Loveland’s police chief dubbed the act “copycat behavior”.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Democratic members of Congress accused Trump of “criminalising dissent”. Others havedescribedthe administration’s actions as “the greatest threat to free speech since the Red Scare”.The resulting uproar over the manner and legitimacy of Khalil’s arrest has been accompanied by accusations from Jewish groups and others that Trump is exploiting justified concerns over antisemitism as cover for a much broader assault on universities, dissent and diversity programmes.Mahmoud Khalil ‘felt as though he was being kidnapped’, lawyers sayRead moreProf Marianne Hirsch, a member of Columbia Jewish Faculty Group, said that “it should be obvious to everyone that what is happening on this campus, or to this campus, is not about protecting Jews”.“My committed Jewish faculty colleagues and I have warned that the false characterisation of [Columbia University] as a hotbed of antisemitism would be used as an alibi for what’s actually at stake for the Republican establishment and now the Trump administration: strict control of speech, of protest, and of higher education at large,” she said.A federal judge has temporarily blocked Khalil’s deportation and is considering an appeal to move him from a detention centre in Louisiana back to New York.But the administration shows no sign of backing down in its determination to round up foreign students at the forefront of pro-Palestinian protests as part of a broader campaign against what it regards as liberal and leftist dissent on campuses across the country. It is also no coincidence that it has a particular ire for Columbia as a crucible of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes so deeply despised by the administration.View image in fullscreenActivist and social liberation groups marched to decry the detainment and show support for Mahmoud Khalil on Wednesday.Photograph: Dave Decker/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe day before Khalil’s detention the Trump administration pulled $400m in federal funding for Columbia, ostensibly because of its failure to curb antisemitism, even though the universitycracked downon protests against the war in Gaza and the Biden administration’s support for it, including facilitating the arrest of students and banning groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine.The US education department has warned 60 other colleges and universities that it is scrutinising their responses to allegations of antisemitism on campus and that they may face “enforcement actions”, widely taken to mean more funding cuts.That action was followed by anotherannouncementthat it would investigate 45 universities for “race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs”.There can be no ‘Israel exception’ for free speech | Kenneth RothRead moreProf Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and a leader of the campus branch of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), described the combined cut to federal aid and Khalil’s arrest as a “pincer attack” by Trump. He said that Columbia may have drawn the administration’s ire as a bastion of liberal elitism but other universities should not delude themselves that they are not also targets.“There’s an attack on people’s rights with one hand and on their livelihoods with the other,” he said.“Both of them are equally dangerous in their own way. It’s no secret that the right wants to defund the left and that they see universities as bastions of the left … It won’t stop with Columbia. They want to suppress all dissent.”The White House piled additional pressure on Columbia by accusing it offailing to cooperatein the arrest of other named individuals the administration accused of “pro-Hamas activity”, and said the university would have to make major changes to disciplinary and antisemitism policies as a condition of restoring its funding. On Thursday, the school announced a slew of disciplinary measures, including expulsions and suspensions, against students who occupied a school building last year.Columbia’s leadership has warned students who are not US citizens against social media posts sympathetic to the Palestinians, saying that these are “dangerous times” and that “nobody can protect you”.One of Khalil’s lawyers, Samah Sisay, accused the White House of victimising her client, who has not been accused of any crime, for political ends.“What we are seeing from the Trump administration, as we’ve been seeing since the inauguration in January, is an attempt to show power and to say that anyone who disagrees with this administration, or who publicly speaks out against this administration, could be targeted,” she said.The rationale for Khalil’s detention is an obscure immigration provision allowing for the deportation of people deemed to harm US foreign policy. That rationale will almost certainly be used against others denouncing Israel’s war in Gaza in which about 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, a majority of them believed to be women and children, although some studies put the figuresignificantly higher.View image in fullscreenPalestinians walk amid the rubble of buildings destroyed by Israeli attacks on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Friday.Photograph: APAImages/Rex/ShutterstockLast year, the rightwing Heritage Foundation drew up a deportation action plan as part of itsProject Esther, named after the biblical character who was pivotal in saving the Jewish people from extermination during the Persian empire, that alleged hundred of professors have supported Hamas directly or indirectly. The initiative was backed by some pro-Israel groups, including the Zionist Organization of America.Other pro-Israel activists have also identified students to the Trump administration for detention and deportation. These includeBetar US, modelled on a century-old Zionist paramilitary youth organisation, which says it has given “thousands” of names to the administration.Pro-Israel group says it has ‘deportation list’ and has sent ‘thousands’ of names to Trump officialsRead moreSeveral Jewish groups and leaders have spoken up against the push for deportations, including T’ruah, a rights network led by rabbis.“To frontload [immigrants] as the primary threat to Jewish security is not only morally irresponsible, but dangerous for the Jewish people and for American society,” the group said in a letter signed by hundreds of rabbis.Sisay said the arrest and other actions against the universities were a response to mass protests over the Biden administration’s support of Israel’s assault on Gaza, including the supply of weapons.“This is not just creating a chilling effect for students on university campuses but for anyone engaged in activism, where you may be going against the administration not just on Palestine but other issues like environmental justice. That’s the wider message being sent here.”Thaddeus acknowledged that Columbia was vulnerable to political attack as an elite institution with billions of dollars in its trust fund while taking $400m in taxpayer subsidies as well as billions of dollars in research grants.“Of course we are vulnerable. We have a gigantic endowment but we would burn through that endowment in no time flat if federal funds and tuition funds were taken away,” he said.Columbia and other universities have been left more open to Trump’s political attacks by mainstream Democratic politicians, such as Senator Chuck Schumer, who sided with pro-Israel activists inpainting protests as inherently antisemitic.Universities struggle to respondThe universities have also been a focus of Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.The administration has rapidly followed a blueprint offered by Christopher Rufo, a rightwing activist who served as a trustee of New College of Florida where he was instrumental in Governor Ron DeSantis’s abolition of its DEI department.Rufo advised Trump to move swiftly and decisively to do the same across US academia and to ignore the inevitable outrage, a strategy the administration would appear to be following.More than 240 colleges in 36 states have scrapped at least part of their DEI initiatives, according to theChronicle of Higher Education. Some have dropped requirements to complete diversity courses in order to graduate. Others have taken down websites, given DEI new names and massaged course content to make it less unpalatable to Trump’s minions.View image in fullscreenProtesters rally in support of detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil outside Columbia University on Friday.Photograph: Jason DeCrow/APTrump also threatened to withhold funding from colleges that do not promote “patriotic” education.Some universities are pushing back. Princeton’s president, Christopher Eisgruber, said the university would not act on every order from the Trump administration but waituntil their legal status is clear.The AAUP joined other groups in filing a lawsuit against the DEI ban as unconstitutional.Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdalla,saidhe appealed to Columbia for protection a week before his arrest amid “an intense and targeted doxing campaign”.“Anti-Palestinian organisations were spreading false claims about my husband that were simply not based in reality. They were making threats against Mahmoud and he was so concerned about his safety that he emailed Columbia University on March 7,” she said.She said “he begged the university for legal support” but it did not respond.Columbia’s president, Katrina Armstrong, responded to Khalil’s arrest by telling faculty and students that she understood “the distress that many of you are feeling” about the presence of immigration officials around the campus but that the university would “follow the law”.Armstrong said Columbia was facing a “challenging moment” but that it would continue to fight for “freedom of expression, open inquiry, a wide range of perspectives, and respectful debate”.She added that the university was “engaged with several federal agencies and are doing all we can to be responsive to their legitimate concerns and to take corrective action, under the law, to restore funding”.Critics accused Armstrong of implicitly justifying the Trump administration’s actions by using the phrase “legitimate concerns”.Thaddeus described the university response to Trump’s attacks as “tepid” and “bland”.“It’s disappointing. There’s obviously a great deal of pressure on them. It’s time to stand up and defend the values of American education, intellectual life, freedom of expression, and not least, the freedom of students and faculty not to be arrested by immigration police,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesMahmoud KhalilDonald TrumpTrump administrationProtestUS constitution and civil libertiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And swearing.“I wear on purpose the girliest, pinkest, most colourful outfit to an event of tech-Bros,” she tells the Guardian from her home in New Zealand’s capital, Wellington.“I like them thinking: ‘Who the fuck is that and why is she here?’ and then slowly start to realise when I open my mouth and talk: ‘Oh, she knows what she’s talking about.’”Blakiston is the founder of the online media platformShit You Should Care About, a company that says it “cuts through the bullshit” to make global issues and news accessible for broader and younger audiences.She trawls news websites to pull together easy-to-read stories on everything from celebrity culture to news on conflicts, which she then boils down to digestible snippets to share on Instagram, X and TikTok. Fans can also subscribe to a free newsletter and tune into podcasts, while paying subscribers fund the business.View image in fullscreenThe Shit You Should Care About website, as seen on Lucy Blakiston’s computer.Photograph: Eva Corlett/The GuardianWhat began as a blog with her friends Ruby Edwards and Olivia Mercer in 2018, Shit You Should Care About has since amassed nearly four million followers onsocial media, including celebrities Bella Hadid, Madonna and, to Blakiston’s surprise, Joe Rogan. It has more than 80,000 newsletter subscribers, and has spawned a podcast series and book titledMake It Make Sense. Nearly half of the platform’s followers are based in the US, with another roughly 30% in the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.The company’s success lies in meeting Blakiston’s generation where they are: social media.Research by theReuters Institutehas found that engagement with news, especially among young people, has steadily declined over the past decade.Still, young people are using social platforms to source their information as trust in mainstream media also declines. In recent years, news aggregation accounts haveproliferated on TikTokand Instagram.“Lucy figured out really early they would have to show up in the places [young people] are and you have to speak the language,” said Duncan Greive, a media commentator and co-founder of The Spinoff, a New Zealand-based online news magazine. “Picking Instagram as a platform, and then using the stylistic choices she made around how to make it presentable and palatable in those environments – that was the genius.”There’s a tension over where these platforms sit in the broader news ecosystem or act as a substitute for legacy news sites, Greive said.Either way, he said, “there are lessons in style, tone and distribution legacy media would do well to observe”.Harry Styles is a ‘Trojan horse’Between 2022 and 2023, Blakiston’s fellow co-founders left the business to follow other pursuits, leaving Blakiston to run her media business alone from a small desk in her candy-coloured bedroom.Blakiston’s home is a visual echo of her online world, embracing politics, pop culture and whimsy. The red-black-and-white flag of Māori sovereignty hangs in her hallway,Charli xcx’s record bratis displayed on her living room wall and tiny ceramic mushrooms peep up out of plant pots waiting to be moved into an outside “fairy garden”.Online, Blakiston sandwiches bulletins on climate change, war and Indigenous rights between deep-dives into cultural shifts, “mundane polls” – like “Do you keep your eyes open or closed at the dentist?” – and “timeline cleanses” of celebrity crushes, primarily Blakiston’s hero, singerHarry Styles.View image in fullscreenLucy Blakiston in her home in Wellington.Photograph: Eva Corlett/The Guardian“Using Harry Styles can Trojan Horse people into caring about the news,” Blakiston said, adding that fandom – particularly when experienced by women and girls – is often derided but can be a powerful tool.“The world is so happy to take money from fangirls, but it won’t take them seriously,” she said. “If you love a sport, you can become a sports commentator or sports journalist – but if you love a boyband, what options has the world told you you have?”Blakiston “owes much” of Shit You Should Care About to loving One Direction. The skills she gained running a One Direction fan account as a teenager were instrumental to the construction of her media company – from editing and Photoshopping to mobilising large groups.Her celebration of Styles is an antidote to the onslaught of bad news. “The ethos,” she said, “is giving you the news, without the blues.”But amid the fun and frivolity, Blakiston also uses her platform to explore difficult subject matters – medicating depression and navigating grief after her brother’s sudden death in 2019, for example, and deeply researched coverage of global crises.The latter, she views as complementary to – rather than a challenge against – legacy media. “I see it as an ecosystem,” she said, describing herself as a middle man. “I couldn’t exist without good journalism.”Her venture was born from her own frustrations in trying to understand global issues while studying media and international relations at university in 2018. Around the same time, she travelled to Myanmar, where her exposure to theRohingya crisisignited a sociopolitical awakening.“I was looking around one day and thinking: ‘Is anyone else struggling to make sense of all of this?’” she said, recounting her days sitting in her classes.Blakiston texted her friends proposing a blog where they could write what they wanted: “Harry Styles, or the Bachelor or gay rights in India”.“It has not strayed from those initial texts whatsoever, which I am deeply proud of,” she said.View image in fullscreenLucy Blakiston founder of Shit You Should Care About.Photograph: Eva Corlett/The GuardianBy June 2020, their Instagram account had 200,000 followers. Then, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, her platform helped cut through misinformation, winning over celebrity fans, who – by sharing her posts – catapulted her page’s following to a million by July.Blakiston remembers thinking: “We have Ariana Grande coming to a Kiwi … who’s just been laid off from her waitressing job from Covid, sitting at her mum’s kitchen table.“It was the scariest time and the most exciting time … we went into panic mode … but it wasn’t a deterrent, it was a moment of: ‘OK, you need to learn Lucy’.”Since then, the self-described “obsessive” has thrown everything into the company. It’s both a job and a hobby, she said, rising at 5am to spend hours digesting news, factchecking sources, and sending out newsletters and social media posts.When she is not up-skilling in technology, or presenting to international summits, she is cooking, reading and spending time with her friends – a close-knit group she said keeps her grounded and happy.“Most of my days are thinking and pottering … watching Love Island, then trying to find a way to explain a big foreign policy announcement,” she laughs. “But otherwise its a pretty normal fucking life.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time, the three biggest issues for voters were all economic: reducing the cost of everyday items, inflation and interest rates, and access to affordable housing.View image in fullscreenPierre Poilievre at a news conference in Ottawa in December 2024.Photograph: Justin Tang/APThe first few weeks of Donald Trump’s second presidential term have changed some of that, at least for the time being. According to a newsurvey, “dealing with US president Trump” is now the most important issue influencing Canadian votes, ahead of the economy.Canadian polls point to a remarkable political shift: Poilievre’s predicted landslide victory appears to have vanished into thin air. His party is stillpredicted to win, and is still polling above its 2019 and 2021 levels of support, but Poilievre’s perceived proximity to Maga politics has boosted the centre-left Liberals to only a few points behind the Conservatives.Canadian opinion polls“The tariffs imposed by Trump are reshaping our political landscape,” said Richard Nantel, a 65-year-old from Montreal, Quebec.“A pro-Trump Conservative party was predicted to win the upcoming federal election. This party is now scrambling to save what was a sure win. It’s now less likely that the Conservatives will win the election.”Scott Duncan, 54, a management consultant, said: “Since Trump began to threaten Canada with becoming the 51st state, the Canadians around me have become much more aligned politically.” Duncan is also from Quebec, the predominantly French-speaking province that has recently hada resurging separatist movement. “People like my mom’s partner, who were pro-Trump before, no longer are. I have been very surprised by the fierce Canadian nationalism displayed everywhere.”“Those that boasted to support Trump – colleagues at work – have quieted down for the meantime,” said Nicholas Mickelsen, a 35-year-old structural firefighter from Edmonton, the capital of Alberta – a province that has long been considered a Conservative fortress, and where the newly minted prime minister, Mark Carney, grew up.View image in fullscreenCanadians protesting outside the US consulate general in Montreal, Quebec last week.Photograph: Vouli/Guardian CommunityNantel, Duncan and Mickelsen were among hundreds of Canadians who shared with the Guardian how they, those in their social circles and their communities had been grappling politically and privately with the US-Canadian trade war and political standoff.‘We’re ground zero’: Canada steel town is frontline of Trump’s tariff trade warRead moreMarkets have been reacting with gradually rising panic to retaliatory tariffs and rhetoric between the two North American neighbours, with many Canadians now bracing for a recession and worrying about their jobs and investments.Various people expressed growing concerns about China’s decision to imposeharsh retaliatory tariffson some Canadian farm and food imports last weekend, but despite these shock developments, the primary worry for many voters is now the US president.“Family and friends who are more to the right and left have come to the centre to fight Trump,” said Andrea, 59, a teacher from Toronto.Longtime Tories and leftwing New Democratic party (NDP) or Green voters in her social circle, Andrea said, had recently joined the Liberal party and were all planning to vote for Carney in the next general election.“Trudeau’s legacy is looking very different now,” she said, pointing to the outgoing prime minister’sremarkable popularity comebackover the past few weeks.Retired Fiona Mackey, 63, from Comox, British Columbia, had been planning to lend her support to the leftwing NDP, until Carney threw his hat in the ring.“I signed up to the Liberal party to vote for Carney to replace Trudeau, as I felt he would be the best person to steer us in the right direction with tariff threats, Trump, world stability, and so on,” she said.“A lot of Canadians haven’t yet heard of him, as he was ‘poached’by the Bank of England. I like his views on the EU, and would be happy for Canada to join!”Mackey was among many Canadians who said they felt Poilievre and his Conservatives had merely “cashed in on Trudeau’s unpopularity” and “would not stand up to Trump”.“Anti-Trump sentiment”, she said, had united Canadians behind controversial politicians such asDoug Ford,the polarising, rightwing populist premier of Ontariowho just won a third term after vowing to “fight against Donald Trump”. He was “universally very popular” now, Mackey felt, because he was “standing up to the US”.View image in fullscreenFiona and Nick Mackey have decided to back Mark Carney’s Liberals because of Trump’s threats.Photograph: Fiona/Guardian Community“I guess it’s ‘in the moment’ politics, he’s stuck his neck out forCanada. My west coast friends who are NDP-leaning like him for what he’s doing for Canada at the moment.”Katie, a mother of three from Ontario in her 40s, said that although there were still people sympathetic to Trump and his politics in her community, other voters seemed to be “rapidly returning to [their] comfort zone, which is a Liberal majority”.A recording of Ford admitting to caucus and supporters that he had been a Trump supporter until the trade war began seemed to reflect a broader sentiment in Canadian society among rightwing voters, Katie added.While many left-leaning Canadians who got in touch reported feeling relief that Trump had knocked some wind out of the Conservatives’ sails, various people pointed out that strong anti-Trump sentiment had allowed politicians to ignore other pressing issues and had helped beleaguered politicians with poor track records – such as Ford and Trudeau – regain popularity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According toa survey, 29% of Albertans would have voted for Trump, compared with 21% of Canadians. The Alberta premier, Danielle Smith, who accepted an invitation by Trump to Mar-a-Lago in January, has repeatedly cautioned against tariff retaliation, in sharp contrast with other Canadian leaders.View image in fullscreenKentucky bourbon and rye whiskey on sale at Edmonton airport in Alberta.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock“Donald Trump’s comments about Canada becoming the 51st state have overnight createdadvocacy groups for merging with America,” said John Bourassa, 42, from Vancouver. “There are debates on where new electoral lines should be drawn, if Canada should be a territory or a state.”Trevor*, a farmer from Saskatchewan who will be affected by the new 100% Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola oil, said the election of Trump had restored his faith in the wisdom of the average voter.“Personally, I am in favour of joining the US but pretty sure that’s not a majority position. A common currency is much less controversial.“I await the arrival of Poilievre as our new PM and his adoption of Trumpian policies to reduce waste in our government and other administration spending,” he said, hoping this would “help reduce the national overdraft”. “Mr Poilievre and the Conservatives will have a substantial majority in my constituency, I know nobody who will have changed their mind.”Although tariffs could mean “a temporary financial hit”, he thought a long-term benefit was “entirely possible”.Trevor was critical of “the ongoing belligerence on the part of Trudeau, Doug Ford and, of course, Carney” and feared that the markets, political opposition and “an almost wholly hostile press, worldwide” could totally derail Trump’s plans for the US and the west.Poilievre, Trevor felt, should continue with his “already effective” criticism of Canadian housing costs and housing shortages, and “should not distance himself from Mr Trump” or “say anything to devalue his standing” with the US president.While many respondents stressed that being proudly Canadian had been a sort of antithesis to Trump and the US for a long time, scores of people reported having fallen out with American family, friends and colleagues since Trump’s second term began, and feeling an unprecedented sense of hostility towards the US.Kelly Ann Grimaldi, 39, from Welland, Ontario, said her family in Canada and Italy had stopped speaking with most of their US family members, because even those who did not support Trump could not understand why Canadians did not want to be American. “I look at America as our enemy,” she said.View image in fullscreenSarah from Montreal.Photograph: Sarah/Guardian Community“I find myself feeling a lot of anger at Americans I interact with, even though I understand that many of them will suffer much more than I will under this administration,” said Sarah, 26, a retail worker from Montreal. Assurances from Americans that they opposed Trump, she felt, were “self-serving” in the absence of action to support their Canadian neighbours.Pamela, a middle-aged professional from Ontario, said she had not bothered to vote in the last general election, as she had felt things had been “working just fine in Canada”.“This time, I definitely want to vote, on the issue of who will best deal withDonald Trump. I anticipate unprecedented turnout, since so many Canadians know that our nation and way of life are at stake.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeGlobal economyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

(The other novel was Conrad’s Lord Jim.) Thirty eager country boys, under the guidance of a priest, learned all about baronets and country seats and single girls and marriage plots, and Lyme and Bath. While most guys in the class believed themselves to be Captain Wentworth, or at least Admiral Croft, I thought I was Anne Elliot, but quietly and secretly and not all the time.Then an extraordinary thing happened. The school authorities – this was a diocesan boarding school in County Wexford – thought that we should all lose our country accents, the bumpkin sounds we made when we spoke. People would, it was intimated, laugh at us if we ever went to Dublin. They found us an elocution teacher. Over weeks, she made each of us read a passage from some book so she could correct our horrible vowel sounds.It came to the turn of one boy from a remote farm. I don’t think I had ever heard him speak much before. He was a nice, quiet fellow. He chose the passage from Persuasion that is Wentworth’s letter, the one that begins “I can listen no longer in silence”. He read it with coiled and wounded passion, using his own country accent. He read it like he meant it. Wentworth’s desperation to make himself clear to Anne had entered this boy’s spirit. He managed to put the elocution teacher in her place.And what about the book?It is a novel of loss. At 14, Anne Elliot lost “her dear mother”, and five years later, through bad advice, lost the possibility of a fulfilling marriage with Wentworth, a navy captain. Now, as the novel opens, she has, at 27, lost the freshness of youth. Also, she and her father and her sister have lost Kellynch Hall, the family seat; it is to be rented to strangers, and the Elliots must move to Bath.Even though it all had happened more than 150 years before, we were lured by Austen’s genius into that foreign worldAnne, when she meets Captain Wentworth after eight years, must face the fact that “the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look”.Loss gives Anne a kind of autonomy. It allows her to relish her own solitude, it offers depth to her intelligence, her powers of analysis and her social tact. Wentworth, in the final pages of the book, notices Anne’s aloneness as a heightened form of being. As he listens to her speak, he writes to her: “You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice, when they would be lost on others.”Although the original advice not to marry Wentworth came from a close friend of the family, Lady Russell,Jane Austenis careful not to judge the lady too harshly. Lady Russell is sensible and kind, but she is also alert to the importance of rank. She lives in the real world in which Anne Elliot, the daughter of a baronet, should not marry a penniless navy captain.What changes over eight years are not the characters – they stay remarkably the same. What changes, in fact, is England. This is a novel that captures a pivotal decade in the life of the nation. In the time of peace after Trafalgar and Waterloo, members of the navy, self-made men, could become figures of distinction, characters to be reckoned with.Austen knew the navy through her brothers Francis and Charles. When Persuasion was published in 1817, five months after her death, her brother Francis wrote: “I do not know whether in the character of Capt Wentworth the authoress meant in any degree to delineate that of her Brother: perhaps she might – but I think parts of Capt Harville’s were drawn from myself.”The members of the navy on land live fluidly in a liminal social space which is effectively the space of the novel, the sort of in-betweenness where Anne herself lives, where she seems at home with both posh Lady Russell and poor Mrs Smith, and seems comfortable also moving from place to place in the book, having lost the dry land of her father’s house.So, too, us rural Irish schoolboys in 1971 lived in a liminal social space called literature. Even though it all had happened more than 150 years before, and it was in another country, and we had nothing in common with any of these people, we were lured by Austen’s genius into that foreign world until each of us, in our own accents, could follow Wentworth to say as clearly as he could: “I can listen no longer in silence.”Colm Tóibín is the author ofLong Island.EmmaChosen by Katherine RundellView image in fullscreenMia Goth and Anya Taylor-Joy in the 2020 film adaptation of Emma.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyAusten wrote, in the season before she began Emma, “I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.” I like Emma, passionately: but even more, I love Austen for daring to write a heroine who is snobbish, meddling, a stranger to her own heart. I loathe the rule that a heroine must be persistently likable – Emma rejects the idea that the moment a woman missteps, she is no longer worth our attention. Emma is vividly human to us, which is far better than perfection; sitting still in a drawing room, she has the kinetic energy of a runaway train. It is the novel I love most: the book I have read more times than any other.The plot of Emma is either almost nonexistent or vast, depending on where you stand to look at it. Austen famously wrote that it was “the delight of my life” to work on “three or four families in a country village”. This is the only one of her major works that is exactly that, a story that barely leaves the village of Highbury; and a book that shows as much of the sweep of the human heart, of fear, love, morality, untruth, foolery and triumph as a Shakespearean drama.It’s a book riddled with riddles, puzzles, charades: they work as a salute to the ways in which humans baffle and confound each other. The burning warmth of its comedy means that the satire never becomes merely punitive, but it is a novel that refuses to let the reader off the hook. The text is, I think, formally perfect. It insists that details are the dwelling place of rich meaning, wit, love – Mr Knightley’s generosity in providing the baked apples to Miss Bates, Mr Woodhouse and his gruel, Mrs Weston and her baby’s caps – and, equally, it has the formal patterning of a fairytale. Each new arrival to Highbury, Jane Fairfax, Frank Churchill, Mrs Elton, appears almost as an apparition to Emma; each forces her to confront something painful and unflattering in her own character in seeing it externalised in them.Emma is unique in being the only Austen novel in which the heroine does not marry into wealth, but it is nonetheless a book shot through with money, from Mrs Elton’s £10,000, to Frank Churchill’s dependency on his aunt, to Harriet’s nothing. It’s a novel that refuses to pretend that love – and it is real love, the love that powers the novel – takes place in a vacuum, divorced from class and wealth and place and moment. It refuses, too, to let us pretend. Emma is “an heiress of thirty thousand pounds”, equivalent to perhaps £3m today. Austen’s voice neither approves nor condemns; she merely shows us, over and over, the ways in which it gives Emma freedom.A 19th-century critic wrote of Austen: “She contemplates virtues, not as fixed quantities, or as definable qualities, but as continual struggles and conquests, as progressive states of mind, advancing by repulsing their contraries, or losing ground by being overcome.” Emma is a novel that never ceases to shift; it understands confinement, repression, revelation, transformation. As the Irish poet Thomas Moore wrote in 1816, the year after its publication: “Let me entreat you to read Emma – it is the very perfection of novel-writing.”Katherine Rundell is the author ofImpossible Creatures.Pride and PrejudiceChosen byRebecca KuangView image in fullscreenKeira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen in 2005’s Pride and Prejudice.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyWhen my father came to the US from China for graduate school, he was determined to learn English by gorging himself on the best of anglophone culture. He bought a book on great American films; he read everything by George Orwell. But he adores Jane Austen most of all: his written English carries an Austenian diction. His favourite joke: that my mother’s nerves are his oldest friends.Several years later, when the rest of the Kuangs made our home in the US, my father took me to the library and filled up a basket of abridged versions of English classics. I recall Robinson Crusoe, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Oliver Twist, Moby-Dick, and of course, Pride and Prejudice. I was to read the best of the English canon. This was how I would acquire good English.“Good English” – a loaded phrase, an idea that slips too quickly towards xenophobia and self-loathing. I wasn’t thinking in those terms, and I doubt my father was, either. We just wanted to be taken seriously. I found my way to a comfortable relationship with English eventually, but only after years of debilitating shyness, a speech impediment that resembled muteness, and elocution drills that involved jamming a pen between my teeth. English is now my dominant language, and yet I still mix metaphors, I still mispronounce words I’ve only encountered in text (“debris”, “Beaujolais”), and I still conflate “r” and “l” sounds when I am speaking too quickly.It was Austen’s acute observations of desperate players manoeuvring a punishing game that kept me readingPride and Prejudice proved too challenging for an eight-year-old, and I didn’t attempt Austen again until I had graduated college. I didn’t major in English, and classics of any kind intimidated me.Back then, I felt Austen’s protagonists, with their “principals” and “allowances”, didn’t have anything to do with me. I would never speak the Queen’s English, and I no longer wanted to pretend.Nearly 20 years on, I discovered what my father was responding to. Austen is not pompous at all; the pretension is not the point. The Bennets are of little means. Mrs Bennet’s nerves are agitated because she can only secure her daughters’ futures by pairing them off. Why wouldn’t she be stressed? The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy may be charming, but it was Austen’s acute observations of desperate players manoeuvring a punishing game that kept me reading.My father is a viciously funny man who adores wordplay in any language. To him, I realised, good English meant Austen’s ruthless turns of phrase (“Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how”), and her elegant, parallel constructions (“I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine”). To my father, good English meant the unexpected word which sums up a person’s demeanor, an awkward dynamic, or an entire matrix of gender and class.I’ve since been married off myself, and to a man named Bennett, no less. My father is delighted. He won’t stop asking my husband about my nerves.Rebecca Kuang is the author ofYellowface.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

There, I’ve said it, phew. It’s a Christmas bauble – attractive, shiny, pleasing every time you look at it; Austen herself called it “rather too light, and bright, and sparkling” – but what comes after Austen’s best-loved novel is a dark, darkly glittering gem: Mansfield Park is her bleakest, most complex book.The gravitational pull of the twin suns of romance and economics within which all of Austen’s novels orbit has taken on here a unique torsional force that subjects both to severe stress. All the romancing, some of it morally suspect, comes to nought, and Fanny’s and Edmund’s union in the very last pages is rushed (it occupies barely three pages),and hardly convincing.But that is not the point; rather, the question to ask is why this should be so. In this novel about nature and nurture, about education and character, about desire or impulse versus morally informed duty, Austen tests the limits of all these values and concepts within the structure of the family; so severely that the family in question, the Bertrams, is left in tatters at the end.Much has been made of Sir Thomas’s ownership of – and, quite possibly, trade in – slaves in his plantation in Antigua, which is the source of his wealth, and the foundation of the parks and trees and gardens that bring Fanny so much solace and joy. Is Sir Thomas a newly rich baronet or has the title – and wealth – been passed down the generations? Why is he so anxious to rush his eldest daughter, Maria, to an economically advantageous marriage – and Fanny, too, of course – when he knows, with absolute certainty in the case of Fanny, that affections are not involved?The novel also marks a turning point for Austen in terms of technique. It is here that we first see Austen moving from her early “light realism” to what was to become the dense rendering of surroundings, places, objects, appearances in the realist novel of the mid-19th century, and also to the connection between a character’s interiority and the “objective correlatives” of the outside world. The passage in which Fanny looks with horror at the greasy, dusty remains on a table in Portsmouth is a succinct masterclass in this. Then there is Austen’s beautiful development of what has come to be known as free indirect discourse (surely she was the first writer to try this most agile and supple form of narration), that almost imperceptible sliding between narratorial voice and a character’s thoughts that we first see clearly in Mansfield Park.Neel Mukherjee is the author of Choice.Northanger AbbeyChosen by Sarah MossLike any book to which one returns, Northanger Abbey has appeared differently to me at different stages of life. I read it first when I was younger than its 17-year-old heroine, Catherine, and I read it, not incorrectly, as a defence of women’s fiction. Catherine is one of the genre’s silly girls, like the younger Bennet sisters and, more dangerously, the Bertram sisters in Mansfield Park and Louisa Musgrove in Persuasion. She’s barely educated, not especially pretty, naive, physically active in a way that undermines her claim to heroism among the fragile bodies and sensitive minds of 19th-century literary heroines. She dislikes sewing, isn’t much interested in fashion, and the only books she enjoys are sensational gothic novels, which she reads with the eagerness now seen in young women devouring “romantasy”. Austen’s narrator is robust in defending young women’s literary culture from snobbish disdain, outraged by girls’ shame at being caught reading novels: “work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed … the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.”That interestingly present omniscient narrator is what most intrigues me now, a character I once took for granted who now seems to establish the novel as metafictional beyond the obvious intertextual play. “If the heroine of one novel be not patronised by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard?” (“Patronised” here means “given patronage” rather than “insulted”, a telling shift in meaning.)Austen is always an anti-romantic novelist, frank in her distrust of the happy ending, deeply cynical about the genreThe question of the heroine’s right to “protection and regard” is central. At first it seems that Catherine’s addiction to gothic fiction has misled her. She goes to stay with her friend Eleanor and Eleanor’s attractive brother Henry in their ancient stately home, complete with military father, ruins and gothic stonework. Surely, Catherine thinks, grumpy General Tilney must have done away with his wife, or imprisoned her down an underground passage, surely the handwritten notes in a chest in Catherine’s bedroom must be important messages (no, laundry lists). Silly Catherine.Except that she’s right. When General Tilney realises that she’s not after all an heiress, he throws her out, leaving her to make her own way across the country by public transport, a journey that might trouble the parent of a sheltered teenaged girl in any century. And as ever in Austen, the romantic hero’s attractions are questionable. Henry says, “the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute – neither vigorous nor keen”. Later he tells Catherine, “a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex, as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take”. Patronising git (old and new meaning). He loves her youth, her naivety, her malleability. She loves his authority and his looks. It’s not promising. Austen is always an anti-romantic novelist, frank in her distrust of the happy ending, deeply cynical about the genre: “my readers … will see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity.” Fine then, we’re out of paper, have the wedding.Catherine’s fears are only slightly misdirected. The patriarchy is out to get her after all. The gothic is – always – real.Sarah Moss is the author ofMy Good Bright Wolf.View image in fullscreenAlan Rickman in Sense and Sensibility (1995).Photograph: Cinematic Collection/AlamySense and SensibilityChosen byNaoise DolanI first read Sense and Sensibility during an Austen binge in my early teens. Since then I’ve reread the tale of sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood a few times, most recently a couple of years ago in Italian. I find Austen translations an excellent way to learn foreign languages: she’s not too abstract and I know the plots inside out.As a teenager I couldn’t stand Marianne, since I uncomfortably recognised in her my own lovergirl ways. Not only do I idealise relationships, but poetry and music and falling leaves. Like Marianne, I sort everyone into one of two categories – “special to me” or “not” – and the special people can do no wrong. I trust them instantly, forgive them endlessly and await explanations and apologies that never come. Time and logistics are irrelevant: frisson matters more to me than banal considerations such as how long we’ve known each other and whether we even live in the same country.I used to judge my inner Marianne – and project that judgment on to her character – but now I militantly refuse to give up on romance. It’s braver to live with intermittent heartbreak than with permanent suspicion and ennui.The heroes lack charm, but Sense and Sensibility is the Austen novel with the most nuanced relationship between sistersAusten does not wholly share my championing of Marianne, yet she crafts no character beyond the reach of sympathy. Even Marianne’s faithless paramour Willoughby can be read as cowardly rather than evil. It is hard to call off an intoxicating flirtation before the other party gets attached; it is also hard to surrender your worldly prospects in order to be with them. His failure to commit is spineless, but not beyond human comprehension. Willoughby’s seduction and abandonment of Colonel Brandon’s ward is more difficult to interpret charitably – but we only get Brandon’s account of this, and he is hardly impartial. Male manipulators recognise their own. I suspect Brandon is just as slimy as Willoughby and that experience has made him more strategic.He bides his time with Marianne, anticipating Willoughby’s inevitable desertion while buttering up her family. Nor is blander-than-celery Edward Ferrars a winsome match for the subtly acerbic Elinor.The heroes lack the charm of Darcy, Wentworth, Knightley or Tilney, but Sense and Sensibility is the Austen novel with the most nuanced relationship between sisters. Anne Elliot’s are the worst, full stop, while the siblings of Fanny Price and Catherine Morland barely exist. Lizzy and Jane Bennet are too uncomplicatedly amicable for how close they are in age, and the youngest three Bennets are mere objects of condescension. Emma Woodhouse is a consummate only child. Only Elinor and Marianne offer a close sisterhood that feels real: mutual respect and boundless frustration, where they would equally kill for or kill one another. (The youngest Dashwood girl, Margaret, gets the Price/Morland treatment, though.)Norms have changed since Sense and Sensibility. We no longer resolve personal disputes with pistols at dawn, and if a man requested a clip of our hair we’d call the police. But there will always be Elinors and Mariannes – and Willoughbys, I fear.Naoise Dolan is the author of The Happy Couple.Explore more on these topicsJane AustenFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Rubio linked to a Breitbart story about a talk Rasool had given on Friday as part of a South African thinktank’s webinar in which he spoke about actions taken by theTrump administrationin the context of a US where white people would soon no longer be a majority.Rasool pointed to Elon Musk’s outreach to far-right figures in Europe, calling it a “dog whistle” in a global movement trying to rally people who see themselves as part of an “embattled white community”.He must leave by 21 March, a state department spokesperson said on Saturday.Rasool is a former anti-apartheid campaigner who served time in prison for his activism and went on to become a politician in the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela, the country’s first post-apartheid president.The expulsion of an ambassador is a very rare move by the US, although lower-ranking diplomats are more frequently targeted with persona non grata status.In response, South Africa’s presidency said in an online post that it had noted the“regrettable expulsion of South Africa’s ambassador”and urged everyone to maintain the “established diplomatic decorum” on the matter.It is the latest development in rising tensions between Washington and Pretoria. In February,Trump froze US aid to South Africa, citing a law in the country that he alleges allows land to be seized from white farmers.Last week, Trump further fuelled tensions, saying South Africa’s farmers were welcome to settle in the US after repeating his accusations that the government was “confiscating” land from white people.View image in fullscreenThe South African embassy in Washington DC where a statue of Nelson Mandela stands.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPATrump posted on his Truth Social platform that “any farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to citizenship”.One of Trump’s closest allies is the South African-born billionaire Musk, who has accused the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s government of having “openly racist ownership laws”.South Africa was ruled by white Afrikaner leaders during apartheid, which violently repressed the country’s black majority, including forcing them to live in segregated townships and rural “homelands”. Afrikaners are descended mainly from the Dutch, who began colonisingSouth Africain 1652, as well as French Huguenot refugees sponsored by the Dutch.More than three decades after white minority rule ended, South Africa remains hugely unequal, with land and wealth still largely concentrated among white people who make up 7% of the population, about half of whom are native Afrikaans speakers, while black people are 81%.However, some white South Africansclaim they are discriminated against, often citing the country’s affirmative action laws.During a G20 event in South Africa last month, Ramaphosa said he had a wonderful call with Trump soon after the US leader took office in January. But relations later “seemed to go a little bit off the rails”, he said.In Friday’s webinar, Rasool, speaking by videoconference, used academic language to talk about the Trump administration’s crackdowns on diversity and equity programmes and immigration.The South African ambassador said: “The supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the Maga movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white.”With Agence France-Presse and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaAfricaUS foreign policyTrump administrationMarco RubioElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Theorganizations chargethat the Trump administrationunlawfully invokedthe Alien Enemies Act.In the lawsuit, ACLU and Democracy Forward argued the act has been invoked only three times in the history of the US: the war of 1812, first world war and second world war.“It cannot be used here against nationals of a country – Venezuela – with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States,” the lawsuit stated.“The government’s proclamation would allow agents to immediately put noncitizens on planes without any review of any aspect of the determination that they are alien enemies,” the lawsuit added.At remote hearing before Boasberg, both ACLU and Democracy Forwardaskedthat the temporary restraining order be broadened to everyone in danger of removal under the act, the civil liberties organizations said.The president had previouslyorderedhis administration to designate Venezuela’s Tren De Aragua gang as a foreign terrorist organization.With Trump characterizing the gang as a foreign force that is invading the US, civil liberties organizations such as the ACLUfearedTrump would invoke the 1798 act “unlawfully during peacetime to accelerate mass deportations, sidestepping the limits of this wartime authority and the procedures and protections in immigration law.”The 227-year-old law is designed to primarily be used in wartime, and only Congress has the authority to declare a war. But the president does have the discretion to invoke the law to defend against a “threatened or ongoing invasion or predatory incursion”, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan authority on law and policy.“This law shouldn’t be invoked because migration is not an invasion, and we’re not in a war time,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, the deputy director of federal advocacy for United We Dream, an immigrant rights organization. “It’s extremely horrifying that we, as immigrants, are being labeled as terrorists, as invaders.”Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act could be deported without a court hearing or asylum interview, and their cases would be governed by wartime authority rather than by immigration law.The Alien Enemies Act specifically allows the president to detain, relocate, or deport immigrants based on their country of ancestry – and crucially covers not only citizens of hostile nations but also “natives”, which could include people who may have renounced their foreign citizenship and sought legal residency in the US.The centuries-old law was also used to arrest more than 31,000 people – mostly people of Japanese, German and Italian ancestry – as “alien enemies” during the second world war, and played a role in the mass removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during the war.Trump has been building his case for invoking the act for years by characterizing the influx of migrants at the southern border as an “invasion”. He also previewed his invocation in an executive order on his inauguration day, directing the secretaries of state to plan by preparing facilities “necessary to expedite the removal” of those subject to the act.“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil, including our cities and inner cities,” he said in hisinaugural address.Though anti-immigrant politicians and groups have long advocated for the use of the act in response to unlawful border crossings, Macedo do Nascimento said a number of executive orders and congressional policies have already broadened the federal government’s authorities to detain and deport immigrants.“There are already laws that allow for mass detention. There are already laws, like the Laiken Riley Act, that would broaden the dragnet of people who can be detained,” Macedo do Nascimento said. “So the idea of him invoking the Alien Enemies Act feels kind of needless. To me, it is really about building the narrative to label immigrants as terrorists.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, the three biggest issues for voters were all economic: reducing the cost of everyday items, inflation and interest rates, and access to affordable housing.View image in fullscreenPierre Poilievre at a news conference in Ottawa in December 2024.Photograph: Justin Tang/APThe first few weeks of Donald Trump’s second presidential term have changed some of that, at least for the time being. According to a newsurvey, “dealing with US president Trump” is now the most important issue influencing Canadian votes, ahead of the economy.Canadian polls point to a remarkable political shift: Poilievre’s predicted landslide victory appears to have vanished into thin air. His party is stillpredicted to win, and is still polling above its 2019 and 2021 levels of support, but Poilievre’s perceived proximity to Maga politics has boosted the centre-left Liberals to only a few points behind the Conservatives.Canadian opinion polls“The tariffs imposed by Trump are reshaping our political landscape,” said Richard Nantel, a 65-year-old from Montreal, Quebec.“A pro-Trump Conservative party was predicted to win the upcoming federal election. This party is now scrambling to save what was a sure win. It’s now less likely that the Conservatives will win the election.”Scott Duncan, 54, a management consultant, said: “Since Trump began to threaten Canada with becoming the 51st state, the Canadians around me have become much more aligned politically.” Duncan is also from Quebec, the predominantly French-speaking province that has recently hada resurging separatist movement. “People like my mom’s partner, who were pro-Trump before, no longer are. I have been very surprised by the fierce Canadian nationalism displayed everywhere.”“Those that boasted to support Trump – colleagues at work – have quieted down for the meantime,” said Nicholas Mickelsen, a 35-year-old structural firefighter from Edmonton, the capital of Alberta – a province that has long been considered a Conservative fortress, and where the newly minted prime minister, Mark Carney, grew up.View image in fullscreenCanadians protesting outside the US consulate general in Montreal, Quebec last week.Photograph: Vouli/Guardian CommunityNantel, Duncan and Mickelsen were among hundreds of Canadians who shared with the Guardian how they, those in their social circles and their communities had been grappling politically and privately with the US-Canadian trade war and political standoff.‘We’re ground zero’: Canada steel town is frontline of Trump’s tariff trade warRead moreMarkets have been reacting with gradually rising panic to retaliatory tariffs and rhetoric between the two North American neighbours, with many Canadians now bracing for a recession and worrying about their jobs and investments.Various people expressed growing concerns about China’s decision to imposeharsh retaliatory tariffson some Canadian farm and food imports last weekend, but despite these shock developments, the primary worry for many voters is now the US president.“Family and friends who are more to the right and left have come to the centre to fight Trump,” said Andrea, 59, a teacher from Toronto.Longtime Tories and leftwing New Democratic party (NDP) or Green voters in her social circle, Andrea said, had recently joined the Liberal party and were all planning to vote for Carney in the next general election.“Trudeau’s legacy is looking very different now,” she said, pointing to the outgoing prime minister’sremarkable popularity comebackover the past few weeks.Retired Fiona Mackey, 63, from Comox, British Columbia, had been planning to lend her support to the leftwing NDP, until Carney threw his hat in the ring.“I signed up to the Liberal party to vote for Carney to replace Trudeau, as I felt he would be the best person to steer us in the right direction with tariff threats, Trump, world stability, and so on,” she said.“A lot of Canadians haven’t yet heard of him, as he was ‘poached’by the Bank of England. I like his views on the EU, and would be happy for Canada to join!”Mackey was among many Canadians who said they felt Poilievre and his Conservatives had merely “cashed in on Trudeau’s unpopularity” and “would not stand up to Trump”.“Anti-Trump sentiment”, she said, had united Canadians behind controversial politicians such asDoug Ford,the polarising, rightwing populist premier of Ontariowho just won a third term after vowing to “fight against Donald Trump”. He was “universally very popular” now, Mackey felt, because he was “standing up to the US”.View image in fullscreenFiona and Nick Mackey have decided to back Mark Carney’s Liberals because of Trump’s threats.Photograph: Fiona/Guardian Community“I guess it’s ‘in the moment’ politics, he’s stuck his neck out forCanada. My west coast friends who are NDP-leaning like him for what he’s doing for Canada at the moment.”Katie, a mother of three from Ontario in her 40s, said that although there were still people sympathetic to Trump and his politics in her community, other voters seemed to be “rapidly returning to [their] comfort zone, which is a Liberal majority”.A recording of Ford admitting to caucus and supporters that he had been a Trump supporter until the trade war began seemed to reflect a broader sentiment in Canadian society among rightwing voters, Katie added.While many left-leaning Canadians who got in touch reported feeling relief that Trump had knocked some wind out of the Conservatives’ sails, various people pointed out that strong anti-Trump sentiment had allowed politicians to ignore other pressing issues and had helped beleaguered politicians with poor track records – such as Ford and Trudeau – regain popularity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According toa survey, 29% of Albertans would have voted for Trump, compared with 21% of Canadians. The Alberta premier, Danielle Smith, who accepted an invitation by Trump to Mar-a-Lago in January, has repeatedly cautioned against tariff retaliation, in sharp contrast with other Canadian leaders.View image in fullscreenKentucky bourbon and rye whiskey on sale at Edmonton airport in Alberta.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock“Donald Trump’s comments about Canada becoming the 51st state have overnight createdadvocacy groups for merging with America,” said John Bourassa, 42, from Vancouver. “There are debates on where new electoral lines should be drawn, if Canada should be a territory or a state.”Trevor*, a farmer from Saskatchewan who will be affected by the new 100% Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola oil, said the election of Trump had restored his faith in the wisdom of the average voter.“Personally, I am in favour of joining the US but pretty sure that’s not a majority position. A common currency is much less controversial.“I await the arrival of Poilievre as our new PM and his adoption of Trumpian policies to reduce waste in our government and other administration spending,” he said, hoping this would “help reduce the national overdraft”. “Mr Poilievre and the Conservatives will have a substantial majority in my constituency, I know nobody who will have changed their mind.”Although tariffs could mean “a temporary financial hit”, he thought a long-term benefit was “entirely possible”.Trevor was critical of “the ongoing belligerence on the part of Trudeau, Doug Ford and, of course, Carney” and feared that the markets, political opposition and “an almost wholly hostile press, worldwide” could totally derail Trump’s plans for the US and the west.Poilievre, Trevor felt, should continue with his “already effective” criticism of Canadian housing costs and housing shortages, and “should not distance himself from Mr Trump” or “say anything to devalue his standing” with the US president.While many respondents stressed that being proudly Canadian had been a sort of antithesis to Trump and the US for a long time, scores of people reported having fallen out with American family, friends and colleagues since Trump’s second term began, and feeling an unprecedented sense of hostility towards the US.Kelly Ann Grimaldi, 39, from Welland, Ontario, said her family in Canada and Italy had stopped speaking with most of their US family members, because even those who did not support Trump could not understand why Canadians did not want to be American. “I look at America as our enemy,” she said.View image in fullscreenSarah from Montreal.Photograph: Sarah/Guardian Community“I find myself feeling a lot of anger at Americans I interact with, even though I understand that many of them will suffer much more than I will under this administration,” said Sarah, 26, a retail worker from Montreal. Assurances from Americans that they opposed Trump, she felt, were “self-serving” in the absence of action to support their Canadian neighbours.Pamela, a middle-aged professional from Ontario, said she had not bothered to vote in the last general election, as she had felt things had been “working just fine in Canada”.“This time, I definitely want to vote, on the issue of who will best deal withDonald Trump. I anticipate unprecedented turnout, since so many Canadians know that our nation and way of life are at stake.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeGlobal economyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He has no prior elected experience and does not have a seat in the House of Commons, making him a rarity in Canadian history.Carney is expected to announce an election in the coming days, reflecting both the urgency of Canada’s trade war with the US, and the awkward reality that as prime minister without a seat in parliament, he is unable to attend sessions of the House of Commons.The effects of Donald Trump’s economic attack onCanadaare so wide-ranging and so damaging that they are likely to overshadow all other issues in the coming months. US trade tariffs, if held in place for an extended period of time, could push Canada’s fragile economy into a recession and unleash a cascading chain of knock-on upheavals.View image in fullscreenMark Carney is sworn in as prime minister during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockAsked about the comments by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Friday morning that “economically speaking Canada would be better as the 51st state of the United States”, Carney replied: “It’s crazy. That’s all you can say.”On Friday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Carney and called for the two countries to deepen their ties. “I am grateful to Canada for its unwavering support in deterring Russia’s military aggression. I look forward to deepening cooperation between our states,” Zelensky wrote on social media.An election would also put limits on spending for political parties, which disproportionately affect the cash-flush Conservative party. The Conservatives lead the polls, but the lead is narrowing.Earlier on Friday morning, Justin Trudeau formally resigned as prime minister, capping a nearly decade-long tenure that saw a rise in favourability in his final weeks as he stared down threats to Canadian sovereignty pushed by Trump. “Thank you, Canada – for trusting in me, for challenging me, and for granting me the privilege to serve the best country, and the best people, on Earth,”Trudeau said on social media.In announcing his new, smaller cabinet, Carney left key ministers in cabinet. The finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, was shifted to minister of international trade, the foreign affairs minister, Mélanie Joly, kept her role, and the industry minister, François-Philippe Champagne, took on the role as finance minister. Bill Blair remained as minister of national defence.Notably, Carney brought his former leadership rival Freeland back into cabinet, as she assumed the role of transport minister. Freeland has previously served as foreign minister, finance minister and deputy prime minister.Canada pollsCarney removed some key ministers who served in Trudeau’s cabinet and were seen as close allies of the former prime minister, including the health minister, Mark Holland, who endorsed Freeland in the leadership race and the immigration minister, Marc Miller, a longtime friend of Trudeau.Also absent was the former government house leader Gould, who placed third in the Liberal leadership race.“I am committed to supporting our government as we defend Canada from Donald Trump and his ill-conceived and unjustified trade war,” Gould wrote on social media. “I will continue to stand up for my constituents … and fight for a fairer, more inclusive, more prosperous Canada in Ottawa.”In recent weeks, the Liberalshave reversed a political freefall, sharply rebounding to such a degree that a previously expected Conservative majority in the next general election looks increasingly unlikely. The shift in the polls has been so dramatic that pollsters have struggled to find any historical precedent.A newly released poll from Abacus Datashowed the Conservative support had shrunk to 38%, with 34% going to the incumbent Liberals.In a result likely to concern Conservatives, Abacus asked respondents who was best qualified to handle tasks as future prime minister, including finding common ground, standing up to a bully and helping people manage household expenses. Carney was seen as more skilled at six of the eight.Heading into the event, the former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Carney “will do very well”, adding: “He is respected internationally.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They make it harder for 14- to 18-year-olds charged with serious break-and-enter and motor vehicle theft offences while on bail to get bail again.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLawrence, sources say, warned that the government had created a problem of its own making amid calls for an even tougher approach. At a community rally in Kempsey last month, convened bya local Nationals MP, there were calls for even tougher bail laws.The Labor backbencher pointed out that when the Nationals raised concerns about youth crime in the regions towards the end of 2023, the party was only calling for an inquiry, not a tightening of youth bail laws. Now, the Nationals have called for the government to go harder and automatically refuse bail to young people accused of being repeat offenders.The Nationals also proposed reversing the current onus on police to prove children aged between 10 and 14 who allegedly committed an offence had criminal intent and knew what they were doing was wrong.Minns – who wants to extend the bail laws to 2028 before the trial expires later this year – has argued the laws are working because 90% of children covered by the laws have been locked up on remand instead of being released on bail.Number of NSW children in youth detention up by one third, new data showsRead moreLabor MLC Cameron Murphy has also come out against the laws, telling Guardian Australia that restricting bail for young people was a “mistake”.“We know from evidence that it simply doesn’t work in terms of community safety. The reason that young people are out committing crime is because home is not a safe place to be,” he said late last week.Locking them up was not a solution because, in the long term, teenagers that had been in jail instead of school ended up on a path of crime which, ultimately, “made the community less safe”, Murphy said.During a budget estimates hearing in February, the premier was grilled by the opposition over what Labor was doing to reduce regional youth crime. Minns pointed to a police force boost and the fact remand figures had increased under his government.Minns, during budget estimates, also said the government had increased youth engagement to tackle the issue, and he flagged a new bail accommodation centre for alleged young offenders, which was expected to open in Moree in June.“We’re in a situation where we have to provide both safety and rehabilitation for young people in NSW,” he said.But former magistrate David Heilpern told Guardian Australia success should be measured by whether or not youth crime rates had been reduced –not how many young people were in custody.According to Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research crime statistics for 2024, youth crime remained steady, with a slight uptick in shoplifting offences. A number of regional communities say violent break-ins and car thefts by young people are ongoing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He argued they would not make his community safer in the long-term, as the longer a young person was in contact with the criminal justice system, the more likely they were to continue to reoffend.There has been previous internal dissent over the youth bail laws policy.In July 2024,a motion was defeated at the NSW Labor state conferencecalling for the laws to be repealed. Darcy Byrne, the Labor mayor of the Inner West Council anda vocal critic of the laws, told the conference “there’s no mandate from this conference for this policy” and that advocates and “rank and file Labor party members do not support incarcerating more Aboriginal kids”.Two supreme court judges have also criticised the laws in court, with justice Stephen Rothman commenting they defied “the principles of equal justice” and justice Julia Lonergan suggesting the changes treated “children’s freedom in a less favourable way than an adult’s freedom in exactly the same circumstances”.The NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, told Guardian Australia the laws were “carefully calibrated” and had been criticised by some for being too strong and by others for not going far enough.“The government is concerned about youth crime and will have more to say about further measures designed to help keep people safe,” he saidMinns and his police minister, Yasmin Catley, are also facingmounting calls for an inquiryinto whether they misled MPs and the public before controversial hate speech and religious worship bills were rushed through state parliament.Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsChris MinnsNew South WalesLabor partyYouth justicenewsShareReuse this content"

That figure is far higher than the government’s estimate.One protester, Milenko Kovačević, said: “I expect that this will shake his authority and that Vučić will realise that people are no longer for him.”Police said they had arrested a man who rammed his car into protesters in a Belgrade suburb, injuring three people.Tensions were running high before the demonstration, after the president’s supporters began setting up a camp in a park in front of the presidential palace. Vučićwarned earlier this week that the security forces would use force against peopleat the rally.Belgrade city transport was cancelled on Saturday in an apparent effort to prevent people from attending the rally, while huge columns of cars jammed the roads leading into the capital. The transport company said the move was made “for security reasons”.Vučić, who has dominated Serbian politics since becoming prime minister in 2014 and then president in 2017, said the demonstrators would never force him to stand down. “You will have to kill me if you want to replace me,” he said.Authorities have faced near-daily protests since last November whena station roof collapsed killing 14 peoplein Novi Sad, Serbia’s second city. Many blamed rampant corruption for the disaster at the station, which Vučić had inaugurated in 2022 after renovations.View image in fullscreenFarmers with tractors take part in the protest.Photograph: Mitar Mitrovic/ReutersThe leaderless protest movement has been largely peaceful, but Vučić has claimed that protesters “will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end” and predicted that “many will end up behind bars” on Saturday.Agence France-Presse reported that known ultranationalists, including members of a former militia linked to the assassination of then prime minister,Zoran Djindjicin 2003, have been seen among the group of activists camped near the presidential palace.Djindjic, who led street protests that deposedSlobodan Miloševićin 2000, wasassassinated 22 years ago this weekby a paramilitary police group known by its unofficial name, the Red Berets.Vučić “has mobilised criminals, thugs and Red Beret members, bringing people from Kosovo and stationing them in Pionirski Park, knowing hundreds of thousands will gather there on Saturday,” Dragan Djilas, the leader of the opposition Freedom and Justice party, wrote on X.Vučić and his Serbian Progressive party, which has successfully marginalised the official opposition, have beenthrown off balance by the student protests, a movement seeking root-and-branch reform but without a clear plan for democratic change.Protesters aredemanding accountability for the disaster at Novi Sad, as well as transparent institutions based on the rule of law. More than a dozen people have been charged in relation to the canopy collapse. The then prime minister, Miloš Vučević, a former mayor of Novi Sad when renovation of the station began,resigned in January, as did the serving mayor.View image in fullscreenProtesters wave Serbian flags as they gather near the Serbian parliament.Photograph: Marko Drobnjaković/APVučić, widely seen to have sacrificed his prime minister to protect his position, has ruled out forming a transitional government and holding elections in six months. Echoing Russian narratives, he has described the protests as a western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power and destroy Serbia.Dušan Spasojević, a professor at the University of Belgrade’s political science faculty, told AFP that the government’s use of provocative language was likely to be an attempt to discourage people from joining the demonstration.Vučić was probably “hoping that protesters will spark some violence, giving the police justification to intervene and causing most people to withdraw from the protests”, Spasojević said.Foreign observers are increasingly concerned about violence against demonstrators, after incidents where cars drove into protesters and some anti-corruption protesters were hospitalised.“Serbia’s response to these protests will be a decisive test of its commitment to EU standards,” a cross-party group of members of the European parliament wrote in a letter to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, this week.Serbia has been an EU candidate country since 2012, but progress has stalled under Vučić’s leadership and its pro-Russian stance over the war in Ukraine.The MEPs, spanning conservatives to radical left-wingers, argue that the EU has been “too lenient and indulgent” towards Serbia’s government. The group urges von der Leyen to ensure Serbia has “free and fair elections, an independent judiciary, pluralistic media, and the rule of law” before releasing any EU funds.Serbia is due to receive €1.5bn (£1.26bn) in grants and cheap loans under an EU “growth plan” between 2024 and 2027.Organisers have vowed that the protests will continue after Saturday. “We are not taking the final steps – we are making tectonic changes. If our demands are not met, we will remain on the streets, in blockades, in the fight until justice is served,” they wrote on Instagram.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSerbiaProtestEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Following the exclusion of Georgescu, he is the most prominent figure on the far right still in the running.Șoșoacă, a 49-year-old Euro MP known for her pro-Russia views posted on Facebook: “I am proof that we do not live in a democracy.” She said she would appeal the ruling.Romanian court rejects appeal by far-right politician to lift candidacy banRead moreOn Thursday, she donned boxing gloves as she filed her candidacy, declaring herself ready to “fight the system once again” as she bids to “makeEuropeand Romania great again”, borrowing Trumpian terms.Șoșoacă has been accused of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda and antisemitic views.She opposed anti-Covid measures during the pandemic and, in July 2024, was expelled from the European Parliament in Strasbourg after loudly interrupting debates.Her small party, SOS. Romania, won 24 seats after securing about 7% of votes in December’s legislative elections.Simion’s AUR said banning Șoșoacă’s candidacy “represents a further blow to Romanian democracy and a serious violation of fundamental rights and freedoms”.The eastern European state has been plunged into chaos since Georgescu’s surprise emergence in November on the back of a huge TikTok social media campaign, which was marred by suspicions of Russian interference.In a shock decision, the November election was cancelled and this week Georgescu was definitively excluded from the election, the first round of which is scheduled for 4 May.Georgescu’s exclusion led to some violent protests.On Saturday, several thousand people marched through Bucharest to express their attachment to the EU.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaThe far rightEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

They want to improve their situation on the battlefield,” Zelenskyy told a group of journalists in a briefing at the presidential administration.He said Ukraine had shown its willingness to agree toUS proposals for a temporary ceasefireduring which terms for a more lasting deal could be discussed, as agreed last week at talks in Saudi Arabia.“Today, Putin is the one who doesn’t agree with what [Donald] Trump has proposed,” he said.Zelenskyy said Russia’s attempts to impose conditions on a ceasefire should be rejected out of hand.“This is a ceasefire for 30 days; it’s not for ever, it’s 30 days, during which all sides have the chance to demonstrate their willingness to end the war,” he said.Although it is clear that any potential agreement would probably require Ukraine to accept de facto Russian control of some Ukrainian land, he ruled out formally ceding any territory to Russia.0:50Volodymyr Zelenskyy says territory issue is 'complicated' – video“Our position is that we do not recognise the occupied Ukrainian territories as Russian in any case,” he said. Zelenskyy called the territorial issue complex and said it should be “resolved later, at the negotiating table”.Trump’s right, Putin can take the hard or easy way on Ukraine. He has to prove he wants peace | David LammyRead moreWriting in theObserver, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, also taunted Putin, saying he had been put on the spot by Ukraine’s agreement to a ceasefire and the moves, led by the US president, Donald Trump, to end the conflict.“The proposal for a ceasefire is therefore a test. He can’t simply say he is ready to end this war – he has to prove it.”Lammy, who attended a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada last week, said the group of nations known as the “coalition of the willing” was determined to create the conditions “that guarantee that Russia does not come back for more”.Referring to the security guarantee that these nations plan to offer, Lammy added: “To be credible, it needs US support. But Britain and our allies recognise that the bulk of the contribution must come from Europeans.”Asked about whether he discussed seizing Russian assets with his counterparts, Starmer said it had been on the agenda but added it was “a complicated question”.Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine launched drone attacks overnight, each reporting more than 100 enemy drones entering their respective airspaces.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverUkraineRussiaEuropeEmmanuel MacronVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

And he can tell Trump that these cunning Ukrainians are trying to trick you, and so on.” Putin’s trademark “yes, but” answer to the US ceasefire ­proposal was essentially a carefully packaged “no”, according to many Kremlin observers.“They are trying not to reject it fully, because it can spoil the ­relationship with Trump and ­complicate things, so they have to say ‘Yes, we agree, but…’ And then this ‘but’ makes it impossible,” said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya.Putin is very dangerous when he’s directly talking to Trump. He knows how to charm him, how to give ­compliments.Russia has no interest in a ­ceasefire for the sake of it, she said, and is only interested in talks that would bring about a final ­settlement advantageous to the Kremlin. “Russians don’t want a ceasefire unconditionally – they have been saying it for a long time,” she said.According to Stanovaya, Putin still believes there is a “real Ukraine” that exists in parallel to Zelenskyy and other supposed radicals in Kyiv, and that these real Ukrainians want good relations with Russia.“They are not saying it explicitly, but the idea is that with Ukraine as it is now, with Zelenskyy in power, there won’t be a deal, there will be nothing. Ukraine must admit it has lost the war, it has no chances to reverse the military situation, and that the only way to get out is to start talking to Russians about Moscow’s peace terms,” she said.That, of course, is a far cry from what Kyiv and most of Ukraine’s western allies have in mind for a lasting peace.Discussions, led by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, to rally western nations into providing some kind of military able to police an eventual peace, appear to be far removed from the reality of the Kremlin’s current position.The decisive question will be whether or not Trump is ready to really push Moscow when the scale of Putin’s “nuances” becomes clear. Putin put his position to Trump’s negotiator Steve Witkoff in closed-door talks on Thursday in Moscow. In a time-honoured tactic, he­reportedlyunderlined the power dynamic of the meeting by ­keeping Witkoff waiting for eight hours before receiving him for discussions. In a social media post yesterday, Trump insisted “there was no wait whatsoever”, accusing those who suggested otherwise of being “sick degenerates”.At least one positive for Ukraine last week was the apparent reset of relations with the Americans after the White House debacle, at talks in Saudi Arabia. Instead of JD Vance or others in Trump’s circle known to have a dislike for Ukraine, the White House sent secretary of state Marco Rubio and national ­security adviser Mike Waltz, seen as two of the more traditional foreign policy thinkers among the eclectic mix of those around Trump.Instead of Zelenskyy, who communicates with raw emotion, the Ukranian delegation was led by chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, known for speaking quietly and drily. The talks went on for eight hours with only a short break for lunch, and those involved said they were marked by methodical back-and-forth, rather than emotional appeals.“Historians underestimate the role of human exhaustion in ­making historical decisions,” Heorhii Tykhyi, spokesperson for Ukraine’s ­foreign ministry, wrote on Facebook after the talks. “It is in these last hours, when fatigue is already ­making itself felt, that a way out of the impasse and even difficult compromises suddenly become possible.”After the two ­delegations called their respective presidents, an agreement was made: Ukraine would agree to a 30-day ceasefire, and the US would resume intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries – a return to the status quo that after the preceding fortnight felt like a diplomatic victory.Witkoff was not in Saudi Arabia, while Rubio and Waltz did not travel to Moscow, leaving it an open ­question as to how coordinated the US dealmaking is. Keith Kellogg, the retired general whom Trump ­initially appointed his Ukraine and Russia envoy, and who was known to be a supporter of Kyiv, appears to have been completely sidelined from the process, with reports that the Kremlin asked him to be removed from high-level meetings.If, against the odds, Trump can persuade Putin to agree to the 30-day ceasefire, discussions will then move on to the more difficult question of how to turn that into a sustainable peace. Even before that, there would be the issue of how such a ceasefire is monitored, along the long and unstable frontline.“A ceasefire can’t be based only on political statements,” said Fesenko. “The military would have to sit down and agree on the contact line, the monitoring procedure.It’s all harder now – before, there was just artillery, now there are drones. Who is going to control or at least monitor this?”Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpRussiaEuropeKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

Thedemonstrations against government corruptionand incompetence have so far been overwhelmingly peaceful.Hundreds of government supporters, mostly black-clad young men wearing baseball caps, many with matching black backpacks, gathered in Belgrade’s Pionirski Park, opposite the Serbian parliament, one of the focal points of the demonstration. Local reports suggested there were members of organised football hooligan groups among them, as well as veterans of the Red Berets special forces unit implicated in the 2003 assassination of Serbia’s liberal prime minister Zoran Djindjić.A thick cordon of police ringed the assembly building and separated the Vučić supporters from the protesters, who also gathered in front of a stage set up in nearby Slavija Square.View image in fullscreenRiot police cordon off the area near the parliament building in Belgrade.Photograph: Armin Durgut/APIn the mid-afternoon, protesters close to the state broadcasting headquarters in central Belgrade were told by police to move as there was a threat of an attack by a pro-government mob.Intercity trains had been cancelled for the day in what the state railway company said was a security measure for passenger safety but which was widely seen as an attempt by Vučić to limit the size of the protests. Some city transport services were also suspended in the capital. But long convoys of cars converged on Belgrade from across the country, flying national flags and banners in support of the student cause.In the roads leading into the city, scores of tractors joined the procession, signalling farmers’ support for the protest movement, as well as hundreds of bikers, riding into town in a phalanx.The European Union and the United Nations both appealed to the government ahead of the rally to respect the right to demonstrate. Western governments have been hesitant in their approach to the protests over the past four months, partly out of a desire to cultivate good relations with Vučić in the hope of luring him away from Moscow’s orbit.Vučić has cultivated Donald Trump, approving the construction of a Trump hotel in Belgrade, and on Thursday gave an interview to the US president’s son Don Jr, who echoed the Serbian government’s unsubstantiated claims that the protest movement was fuelled by foreign funding.The younger Trump suggested the protests had been “weaponised … to incite, potentially, a revolution”, airing conspiracy theories about how the protests were organised and paid for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Public outrage was fuelled by an apparent attempt by government officials to cover up unsafe construction methods and potential corruption in the Chinese-led refurbishment.The demonstrations have been led by students who have focused on demands for better governance and for state institutions to provide the services they are supposed to, without the need for bribes or personal connections.The students, who make collective decisions rather than elect a leadership,have kept their distancefrom opposition parties, which they blame for being complicit in the atrophy and cynicism of the public sector.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaThe ObserverEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "10h ago11.50 EDTClosing summaryIt is approaching 6pm inKyivand 7pm inMoscow. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find the Guardian’s latest Russia-Ukraine coveragehere.Here is a summary of the key headlines from today:Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Saturday he had urged Kyiv’s western allies to give “a clear position” on security guarantees including about a potential foreign troop contingent on Ukrainian soil with a US backstop.His comments came after UK prime minister Keir Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelenskyy, where Starmer said a “coalition of the willing” would help secure Ukraine “on the land, at sea and in the sky” in the event of a peace deal with Russia.Starmer called for the “guns to fall silent in Ukraine” as he said military powers will meet next week as plans to secure a peace deal move to an“operational phase”.The UK prime minister said Vladimir Putin’s “yes, but” approach to aproposed ceasefirewas not good enough, and the Russian president would have to negotiate “sooner or later”. Starmer also condemned Russia’s “barbaric attacks on Ukraine”.Starmer accused Putin of trying to delay peace, and said it must become a reality after more than three years of war.The UK prime minister was speaking at a press conference in Downing Street after a virtual meeting of the “coalition of the willing”. The meeting was addressed by Starmer, Zelenskyy, the French president, Emmanuel Macron and the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte.1:29Putin's response to Ukraine peace plan not good enough, says Starmer – videoZelenskyy said on Saturday that Russia wanted to achieve a “stronger position” militarily before committing to any ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.“They want a stronger position before the ceasefire,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference in Kyiv. At the same event, Zelenskyy said the question of territory in Ukraine’s war with Russia was “complicated” and should be discussed in detail at a later date.The Ukrainian president also accused Putin of “lying to everyone”.In a post on X on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Putin was lying “about the situation on the ground, especially about what’s happening in the Kursk region, where our Ukrainian forces continue their operations” and “about how a ceasefire is supposedly too complicated”.Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged Starmer to seize frozen Russian assets to fund more support for Ukraine. Responding to Saturday morning’s meeting of the “coalition of the willing”, Davey said: “Putin could end this war today if he wanted peace, but it’s clear he’s only interested in destroying Ukraine’s sovereignty and turning it into a vassal state of Russia.” Asked about whether he had discussed seizing Russian assets with his counterparts, Starmer said it had been discussed, but added it was “a complicated question”.Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Putin’s first prime minister and now an opponent of the Russian president, said Moscow was only interested in a conditional ceasefire. Kasyanov told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “He rejected this proposal for an unconditional ceasefire, he wants conditional, he wants a ceasefire on his terms.”A retired US general charged with helping sell theTrump administration’sUkrainepeace plan wrote a string of op-eds and reports for a rightwing thinktank in which he repeatedly questioned whether Ukraine had a legitimate part to play in peace negotiations.Keith Kellogg also blamed the war on the machinations of a US “military-industrial complex” and “[Joe] Biden’s national security incompetence” rather thanRussia’s 2022 invasion, which has been condemned across the globe and resulted in a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives.Zelenskyy said on Saturday that Kyiv’s forces were still fighting in Russia’s Kursk region and that they were not facing an encirclement. In a statement on social media, he added that the situation near the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk had stabilised but that Russian forces were accumulating across the border from Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region. Earlier on Saturday, the Russian defence ministry said that its troops had recaptured the villages of Rubanshchina and Zaoleshenka in its western Kursk region.Ukraine said on Saturday it had downed 130 Russian-launched drones across the country at night.Kyiv’s air force said the Iranian-made Shahed drones were downed over 14 regions and that Moscow had also attacked with two ballistic missiles.Kyiv also said that the number injured in a Russian strike a day earlier on Zelenskyy’s home town Kryvy Rig rose to 14.On Friday, officials said Russia attacked a residential area of the central Ukrainian city. “Fourteen people were wounded, among them two children,” the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Sergiy Lysak, said on Telegram.Russia deployed almost 200 firefighters to help put out a fire at an oil depot caused by a Ukraine drone strike in the southern Krasnodar region, authorities said. The governor of the Krasnodar region Veniamin Kondratyev said in the early hours of Saturday that a petrol reserve station in the Black Sea city of Tuapse was “attacked by the Kyiv regime”. The government of the Krasnodar region said 188 people were involved in putting out the fire.Akif Çağatay Kılıç, a foreign policy adviser to Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said that one of the main obstacles to a peace settlement between Ukraine and Russia is a “loss of trust” between the two sides.He referred cryptically to a group of politicians, no longer in power, who he claimed scuppered the initial February 2022 talks in Istanbul, noting that the conditions under which Ukraine is able to negotiate now have changed.Ukraine’s largest private energy provider said on Saturday that overnight Russian airstrikes had damaged its energy facilities in the Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions.In a statement, DTEK said “damages are significant” and that some consumers in both regions were left without power.ShareUpdated at11.54 EDT"

Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sana’a airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The extent of the damage was not yet clear.“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in asocial media post.“No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy.The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters offYemenin response to Israel’s blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in the US strikes on Sana’a, the Houthi-run health ministry said on Saturday evening.Six other people, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Sa’ada, Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported.The Houthi rebels have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 until January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect.The attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment.The Houthi media office said the US strikes hit “a residential neighborhood” in Sana’a’s northern district of Shouab.The Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the US, according to a US official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region.Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.The USS Harry S Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three navy destroyers and one cruiser, is in the Red Sea and was part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.“These relentless assaults have cost the US and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHouthisYemenUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A second strike targeted a car as it evacuated those injured by the first attack.The Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists in all.The Israeli military said it initially struck two people operating a drone that posed a threat to soldiers in the area, then launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment. The army identified all of those targeted as suspected militants, without providing evidence.Hamas accused Israel of “deliberate killings” that aimed “to undermine the ceasefire agreement and deliberately destroy any chance of completing the agreement and exchanging prisoners, in a blatant challenge to the mediators and the international community”.The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that Israeli fire had killed 19 people in the past 48 hours. The death toll in the 15-month Israeli offensive in Gaza now totals more than 48,500, mostly civilians. Hamas still has 59 hostages, of whom 35 are believed to be dead.In a statement, Hamas clarified an offer torelease a living American-Israeli hostage,saying it would only hand over 21-year-old Edan Alexander if Israel implements the ceasefire agreement which came into effect in January.The US has already rebuffed the offer, made on Friday, and accused the Islamist militant organisation of “stalling” bymaking “impractical” demands.Alexander, who grew up in the US and was fighting as a soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces, was abducted from his military base during Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack that killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and triggered the war. He is the last living US citizen held in Gaza.There was no immediate comment from Israel on the new statement from Hamas. On Friday, the office of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused the group of “psychological warfare”.The US said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire for several weeks to allow the negotiation of a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.The indirect talks, which are being held in Egypt and Qatar, are expected to continue during the coming week.For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal.Hamas however said on Saturday that it would only release hostages if Israel lifted its blockade, withdrew from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt and freed more Palestinian prisoners.The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of the population.The ceasefire’s first phase included the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza’s border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East peace talksGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

These texts detail the minutiae of government and reveal a complex bureaucracy – the red tape of an ancient civilisation.These were the state archives of the ancient Sumerian site of Girsu, modern-day Tello, while the city was under the control of the Akkad dynasty from 2300 to 2150BC.“It’s not unlike Whitehall,” said Sébastien Rey, the British Museum’s curator for ancient Mesopotamia and director ofthe Girsu Project. “These are the spreadsheets of empire, the very first material evidence of the very first empire in the world – the real evidence of the imperial control and how it actually worked.”mapGirsu, one of the world’s oldest cities, was revered in the 3rd millennium BC as the sanctuary of the Sumerian heroic god Ningirsu. Covering hundreds of hectares at its peak, it was among independent Sumerian cities conquered around 2300BC by the Mesopotamian king Sargon. He originally came from the city of Akkad, whose location is still unknown but is thought to have been near modern Baghdad.Rey said: “Sargon developed this new form of governance by conquering all the Sumerian cities of Mesopotamia, creating what most historians call the first empire in the world.” He added that, until these latest excavations, information on that empire was limited to fragmentary and bombastic royal inscriptions or much later copies of Akkadian inscriptions “which are not completely reliable”.Of the new discovery, he said: “It is extremely important because, for the first time, we have concrete evidence – with artefacts in situ.” He has been astonished by the detail in those records: “They note absolutely everything down. If a sheep dies at the very edge of the empire, it will be noted. They are obsessed with bureaucracy.” The tablets, containing cuneiform symbols, an early writing system, record affairs of state, deliveries and expenditures, on everything from fish to domesticated animals, flour to barley, textiles to precious stones.View image in fullscreenThe tablets were found at the site of a large state archive building, made of mud-brick walls and divided into rooms or offices.Photograph: Alberto Giannese/The Girsu Project/British MuseumDana Goodburn-Brown, a British-American conservator, is cleaning the tablets so that they can be transcribed. The work is both painstaking and exciting, she said: “People just think things come out of the ground and look like you see them in the museum, but they don’t.”One tablet lists different commodities: “250 grams of gold / 500 grams of silver/ … fattened cows… / 30 litres of beer.” Even the names and professions of the citizens are recorded, Rey said: “Women, men, children – we have names for everyone.“Women held important offices within the state. So we have high priestesses, for example, although it was a society very much led by men. But the role of the woman was at least higher than many other societies, and it’s undeniable based on the evidence that we have.”The jobs listed range from stone-cutters to the sweeper of the temple floor. Rey said: “Being able to sweep the floor where the gods and the high priest were located was very important. The cities of ancient Mesopotamia in theory all belonged to the gods. The society worked for the temple state.”The tablets were found at the site of a large state archive building, made of mud-brick walls and divided into rooms or offices. Some of the tablets contain architectural plans of buildings, field plans and maps of canals.The finds were made by archaeologists at the Girsu Project, a collaboration between the British Museum and the Iraqi government’s State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, funded by Meditor Trust, a charitable foundation.The site was originally excavated in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was targeted by looters after the two Gulf wars: “Tablets of the Akkad period were either looted or carelessly removed from their archaeological setting and thus decontextualised. So it was very difficult to understand how the administration worked.“The key thing now is that we were able to excavate them properly within their archaeological context. The new finds were preserved in situ, so in their original context, and we can say for sure that we have indeed the very first physical evidence of imperial control in the world. This is completely new.”The finds have been sent to the Iraq Museum in Baghdad for further study, ahead of a possible loan to the British Museum.The Akkadian empire lasted for only about 150 years, ending with a rebellion that secured the city’s independence.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyThe ObserverMuseumsIraqMiddle East and north AfricaBritish MuseumnewsShareReuse this content"

He was killed last Friday alongside 24 of his neighbours by crowds of people from surrounding Sunni villages who chanted anti-Alawite slogans while they rounded up men in Arza’s village square and shot them dead in a rampage that lasted about three hours.The killings in Arza happened during four days ofshocking violence in north-west Syrialast week that leftmore than 1,000 people dead– including at least 745 civilians – in some of Syria’s deadliest days of fighting since the beginning of the country’s civil war in 2011.The wave of bloodshed three months on from the fall of Bashar al-Assad stunned Syria and brought to light the deep faultlines which threaten totear the country apart after 14 years of civil war. Widespread revenge attacks against civilians have mostly targeted Alawites, a minority Islamic sect from which the ousted Syrian president hailed, though most Alawites had nothing to do with the previous regime.The killings ended the jubilant mood which had prevailed over the country after the toppling of Assad on 8 December by a rebel coalition led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which now leads the interim government.Fighting started after about 4,000 militants loyal to the Assad regime launched a wave of attacks against Syrian security forces on Thursday, attacking more than 30 checkpoints simultaneously across Syria’s coast. Blindsided by the attacks and unable to regain control over the situation, the Syrian government issued an urgent call over Telegram for fighters to head to Syria’s coast.View image in fullscreenRelatives of the men slain in Arza tried to burn their clothes, but some failed to light – four days later, the clothes were still soaked in blood.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianThe call to arms was repeated in mosques across the country and spread like wildfire over social media. Soon, thousands of militia members and armed civilians flooded north-west Syria.Civilians and factions affiliated with Syria’s government began to massacre mainly Alawite civilians and unarmed prisoners, as well as loot and pillage the villages on Syria’s coast.Horrific videos began to emerge: men in military uniforms forcing unarmed people to bark like dogs while they beat them and gloating over the corpses of a woman’s children while their mother watched; and women wailing on their knees in front of dozens of bodies piled on top of one another.map of Syria showing location of Arza in the north-west of the country, north of Homs, and Latakia and Tartus on the coast to the westHow did deadly Syria clashes start and who is responsible for civilian killings?Read moreAccording to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, 529 civilians and prisoners were killed by armed individuals and Syrian government forces. Two Turkish-backed factions, the Hamzat division and Abu Amsha’s Sultan Suleiman Shah division, which are officially a part of the new Syrian army but not yet under its full command,were responsible forthe majority of civilians killed by Syrian government forces, according to SNHR.In addition, Assad loyalists killed 225 civilians and 207 members of Syrian government forces, the war monitor added.In Arza, local people say they know who their killers were. Three survivors accused the residents of Khattab, a nearby Sunni village, of being behind Friday’s massacre.Abu Jaber, a religious notable in Khattab and a former opposition fighter who had returned to the village, described how he and others entered homes, and forced men on to the town’s roundabout, with the purpose of displacing them from the village.“But then people who had their families killed [by the regime] came, and they opened fire,” he said.View image in fullscreenSyrian security forces on patrol in Latakia, Syria, on Thursday 13 March.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersA survivor of the attack described how the killers left the bodies on the roundabout and began to loot houses, killing any men they saw while they pillaged. They said members of the Syrian general security tried to protect town residents, but were quickly overwhelmed.“They came in the town chanting that they wanted 500,000 Alawites for the people they lost. They came into my house and took my brother and killed him in cold blood,” said a woman who was retrieving her belongings from her looted home, breaking down in tears.A Guardian reporter saw spent bullet casings and an empty Kalashnikov magazine on the ground at the roundabout during a visit to Arza this week.An official from the Syrian ministry of information initially denied that anyone was killed in Arza, but then said three people were killed. They insisted that the killings were not motivated by sectarian reasons and said security forces had arrested looters once reinforcements arrived.View image in fullscreenBlood stains a rock at the site of the Arza killings, four days after the attack.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianWhile Abu Jaber denied personally killing anyone, he said the people of Arza deserved their fate. He claimed that during the civil war the town’s residents had extorted and abused the residents of Khattab, and so the killings last Friday were merely people “claiming their rights”.He recalled a time when a regime official from Arza had bludgeoned a Khattab resident to death with a stone – and claimed the whole of Arza had celebrated after the killing. “What would you imagine that the villages that live around Arza, which committed these acts, what should they do? You think we should give them flowers?” he said.Abu Jaber acknowledged that he did not know if any of the perpetrators of the crimes he listed were still in Arza, but insisted that he thought that most, if not all, of Syria’s Alawite sect were guilty.His rhetoric echoed that of the Assad regime, which was notorious for its indiscriminate attacks against civilians in opposition areas. He condemned anyone who rebelled against Syria’s new state, using an old Assad-era slogan to praise the country’s new president: “We sacrifice our soul and blood for you, O Sharaa.”Survivors of the Arza massacre admitted that select regime officials from the town did kill residents of Khattab,but said those officials had fled after the fall of Assad, and those left in the town had nothing at all to do with the previous abuses.“We also suffered from the regime, the whole world was being attacked by them. But I’m not related to them, how is it my fault?” said a resident of Arza.View image in fullscreenA Syrian Alawite family rides in a truck to return home in Latakia.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersExperts have said that for Syria to survive under its new rulers, an urgent, earnest process of reconciliation and transitional justice was key.“Revenge must not be taken by your own hands, don’t take revenge against perpetrators. For both victims and perpetrators, this is a complex process,” said Fadel Abdulghany, the founder of SNHR.In his first speech as Syria’s president, Sharaa promised to establish “real transitional justice”, which includes accountability for Assad-era officials who committed human rights violations. He issued a blanket amnesty for all regime employees, with exception for those who were complicit in war crimes.After last week’s killings, Sharaa set up a committee to investigate the violence on the coast. “We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain. No one will be above the law,” he said.In Arza, people said they could not imagine returning to live, no matter what the government promised them. Most were thinking of going to Lebanon, joining at least 6,000 Alawites who fled to the neighbouring country last week.Arza was completely deserted on Wednesday when the Guardian visited, except for a few people coming to retrieve whatever belongings remained in their homes. A building’s roof had collapsed, others had their windows broken and appliances stolen.View image in fullscreenA Syrian family leaves the Hmeimim airbase to return to their village in Latakia province.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/Reuters“We fled with only the clothes on our back, that’s it. There’s nothing left for me there,” said an Arza resident who planned to smuggle himself to Lebanon over the weekend.Referring to the displacement of the Alawite residents in the area, Abu Jaber said it was only fair that they should experience dispossession, just as he did during Syria’s civil war. “My advice to the people of Arza: if you are planning to return, think twice about it. We were displaced for 14 years in the north. So, be patient for a year or two years, maybe there will be justice then,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy.”NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it wasestablished to cut down on political interference in the NHS– something Streeting described as an act of “backside-covering” to avoid blame for failures.1:31'We are abolishing biggest quango in the world': Wes Streeting welcomes end of NHS England – videoBut on Thursday, Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid “duplication”.In his Sunday Telegraph article, Streeting suggested more was to come, saying the new NHS England chair, Penny Dash, had “identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration”.The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Streeting, who in January said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS.He told the Health Service Journal he could spend “a hell of a lot of time” on reorganisation “and not make a single difference to the patient interest”, saying instead he would focus on trying to “eliminate waste and duplication”.But in the Telegraph article, Streeting said he had heard former Conservative health ministers “bemoan” not abolishing NHS England, adding: “If we hadn’t acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn’t have been possible.”The government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save “hundreds of millions of pounds” that can be spent on frontline services.But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.The Guardian reported on Friday that the jobs cull from the government’s radical restructuring of the NHS will be at least twice as big as previously thought.The staff shakeout caused by NHS England’s abolition and unprecedented cost-cutting elsewhere will mean the number of lost posts will soarfrom the 10,000 expected to between 20,000 and 30,000.Manythousands more people who work for the NHS’s 42 integrated care boards (ICBs) in England will see their roles axed, as well as the 10,000 working for NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) who have already been earmarked to go.ICBs, regional health service bodies which oversee groupings ofNHStrusts, employ 25,000 people between them.Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingLabourHealthPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

We have entries who suffered hair loss and very serious skin conditions that led them to create their own treatments which they later started to sell.“All these people went on to build successful beauty brands making products people love, creating jobs, contributing decent sums to the public finances and of course making many of us look and feel a lot better along the way.”Phoebe McDowell, beauty and interiors director of the Sunday Times, said: “Beauty is big business, and this inaugural list demonstrates the power of creativity and innovation in the sector. These entrepreneurs have not only built brands but changed the way we think about hair, makeup, and skincare.”The list excludes individuals and families where a company accounts for less than 25% of their estimated wealth.The entrepreneurs on the Sunday Times Beauty Rich List top 30 and their estimated worth:1 Charlotte Tilbury – Charlotte Tilbury (£350m)2 Mark and Mo Constantine – Lush (£249m)3 Sanjay Vadera – The Fragrance Shop (£240m)4 John Frieda – John Frieda (£150m)5 Vishal Karia – Affinity Fragrances (£114m)6 Elliot Isaacs – Medik8 (£100m)6 Sacha Mascolo-Tarbuck and family – Toni & Guy (£100m)6 Paige Williams – P.

I don’t feel that I would be able to function without it.”Gabsi receives his Pip disability benefit for multiple sclerosis, with which he was diagnosed 18 years ago, when he was 21.“It’s supposed to cover the costs you incur due to being disabled. My powered chair that I’m ­currently travelling on and my bed are ­powered by electrics – so increased  electricity and travel costs. Some ­disabled people, myself included, have to travel quite frequently by black cab because not every Underground station is accessible.”Gabsi is one of the nearly 3.7 ­million Pip claimants, mostly in England and Wales, who are ­waiting to hear this week’s expected announcement ofLabour’s plans to cut around £5bnfrom disability benefit spending.One move reportedly being considered would affect current claimants – a freeze in the cash value of payments in the 2026-27 financial year, meaning they wouldn’t keep pace with inflation: a real-terms benefit cut.Downing Street considers U-turn on cuts to benefits for disabled peopleRead more“Some of the costs of needed equipment are very high, and that’s now, without even adding the ­inflation that could potentially be coming,” says Gabsi. “It’s essential payments that cover costs disabled people cannot afford to live without. As a wheelchair user, how can I not charge my chair?”Plans to impose a real terms cut to Pip were floated last week, but after a backlash across theLabourparty neither Downing Street nor the DWP were this weekend prepared to rule out a U-turn.If a freeze were applied without exemptions, it could hit the roughly 30,000 people who receive Pip under end-of-life rules because they are thought to have less than a year to live.Welfare cutsThe government could exempt end-of-life claimants from a freeze – they make up 1% of Pip claims – but that leaves ­everyone else, those who are not dying but whose ­disability makes employment an unrealistic expectation.“The jobs are not there,” Gabsi says. “For someone who has a serious stomach issue, such as myself, what is being suggested? Because working from home, the amount of jobs that are offered that are [fully] work from home is just not even viable.”Even if the mooted freeze is dropped, many of these claimants would be hit by another leaked  ­proposal – real-terms cuts for­universal credit(UC) claimants judged too ill or disabled to either work or prepare for work.Unlike with Pip, the health ­element of UC is limited to those out of work, but while the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ­publishes much less data on the­disabilities of this caseload than it does for Pip, severely disabled Pip claimants such as Gabsi are likely to be out of work and receiving the UC health element too.John McDonnell accuses ministers of lacking empathy over benefit cutsRead moreMany of the government’s plans appear to be based on the notion that Pip is too easy to claim. “Have they ever tried? Claiming benefits is one of the most difficult ordeals I’ve ever been through,” says Gabsi, who before winning his appeal saw his application for old-style ­disability benefits rejected when he first applied.“What the DWP doesn’t take into account is the anxiety caused even by receiving a brown envelope. So when you receive a brown envelope, you know what is inside is going to be an assessment – that they’re coming for my money, which ­essentially I need to live a life.”Gabsi is now co-chair of ­disabled people’s organisationInclusion London. “Since Labour got in, I’ve had to ease concerns because there’s been talk of ‘The cuts are coming, the cuts are coming’, which then increases anxiety, and anxiety then causes stress, and stress causes relapses. And the real-time effect on disabled people is very clear.”Explore more on these topicsDisabilityThe ObserverWelfareBenefitsState benefitsLabourUniversal creditEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I thought [it] would not be regarded as very fair. What I did try to do was reform Pip.”Balls, who is married to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, infuriated Downing Street by saying on the same podcast that the plan would not work if its aim was to get more people back into work, adding that “it’s not aLabourthing to do”.At a tense cabinet meeting last Tuesday, several serving members raised their concerns about how the Labour government would be viewed if it froze Pip and made it more difficult to receive payments.Any plan to freeze Pip or change ­eligibility rules would require ­primary legislation, running the risk that they could become the focus of a sizeable Labour rebellion in the Commons and the Lords. Several Labour MPs have made it clear to theObserverthat they could not support the plans in any parliamentary vote.View image in fullscreenWork and pensions ­secretary Liz Kendall said protecting people in ­need was a principle Labour would not compromise on.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/ShutterstockSpeaking to theObserver,Liz Kendall, the work and pensions ­secretary, insisted that Labour was sympathetic to those unable to work because of disability.“I know as a constituency MP for 14 long years under the Tories that there will always be some ­people who cannot work because of the severity of their disability or health condition,” she said. “Protecting people in ­genuine need is a principle Labour will never compromise on.”But she also insisted that the ­system badly needed reform to ensure that people did not spend a lifetime on benefits and to prevent the overall benefits bill from soaring even higher. “Being trapped on benefits if you can work is terrible for people’s ­living standards, health and opportunities,” Kendall said.She added: “It’s terrible for the country too, as spending on the costs of failure soar. The sickness and ­disability bill for working age ­people has increased by £20bn since the ­pandemic, with a further £18bn rise to £70bn projected over the next five years.We must fix this broken system for the people who depend on it and the country as a whole.”In a further measure to placate ­furious Labour MPs, sources said Kendall would move to legislate to create “a right to try” guarantee to ensure sick and disabled people could take a job safe in the knowledge that they would not be forced to undergo a new reassessment and the possibility of losing their benefits as a result.‘How can I not charge my wheelchair?’ The real effects of benefit cuts for millions of disabled peopleRead moreOne million people would see their benefits reduced under the government’s ­proposed reforms, according to theTimes.The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that it would be the biggest cut to disability benefits since the Office for Budget Responsibility was created in 2010.Ministers are said to be examining changing eligibility for Pip in such a way that it would not be available for people who need someone else to help them wash below the waist, or need to be reminded to go to the toilet to prevent them having an accident.The new rules would, in effect, mean that only the most severely ­disabled would receive Pip, while those with mental health conditions would not.Ministers are also planning to scrap the work capability assessment, which is used to decide if people receiving universal credit are fit for work. It is separate from Pip, which is intended to help cover the extra costs of being disabled, whether or not they can work.About 4.8 million people receive Pip or the benefit it was designed to replace, the disability living allowance.Campaigners say the problem ­facing disabled people is that even those who are desperate to return to the workforce find they cannot cope, or employers are not willing to accommodate them.A government programme that supported 286,000 disabled people over the past seven years who wanted to find work was only able to secure jobs for one in five.View image in fullscreenFormer shadow chancellor Ed Balls criticised the proposed welfare cuts for disabled people as ‘not a Labour thing to do’.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/ShutterstockAnna Stevenson, a benefits expert at the disability charity Turn2us, said: “These were people who, although they were unwell, thought they were probably well enough to work and really keen to work.”Stevenson said that if the ­government was serious about helping more disabled people into work, it needed to change employment law.“If you want very high employment among disabled people, one of the things you need to change is how easy it is for employers to fire people when they’re ill. But that has the potential to ­distort the labour market. There are always trade-offs.”In the 1970s, employers would put workers on “light duties” if they were unable to do harder, physical jobs, but that practice has all but vanished, leaving disabled people to rely on the state instead.“We have a duty to get the welfare bill on a more sustainable path and we will achieve that through meaningful, principled reforms rather than arbitrary cuts to spending.“That why as part of our Plan for Change we will bring forward our proposals for reform shortly that will unlock work to help us reach our ambition of an 80% employment rate, and is fairer to all.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsThe ObserverDisabilityWelfareKeir StarmerWork & careersPodcastsEd BallsnewsShareReuse this content"

He penned very careful notes and presented one of his notebooks to Davy, hoping for a job at theRoyal Institutiondespite his working-class background and rudimentary education.The notebooks shed light on the workings of Faraday’s mind and reveal he made intricate drawings to visualise the scientific experiments and principles he was learning about at the lectures. “He’s taking the time to make his own publication and grounding what’s being taught to him in his own understanding,” said New. “He’s heavily illustrating his notes to understand the principle that’s been taught to him.” He even wrote an index for each notebook, she said, just for his own use and personal research. “This is at a time when paper is taxed. It shows how he’s really trying to understand the science within.”When Faraday gave Davy the notebook, he expressed his “desire to escape from trade, which I thought vicious and selfish, and enter into the service of Science”.Although Davy initially declined to help him, the notebooks – and Faraday himself – seemed to make a good impression. Davy wrote to Faraday soon afterwards to say that he was “far from displeased with the proof you have given me of your confidence, which displays great zeal, power of memory and attention”.When a lab assistant at the Institution got into a brawl and was fired in February 1813, Davy remembered the 22-year-old Faraday and offered him the job – which involved taking a pay cut, but gave the young man access to the laboratory, free coal, candles and two attic rooms.Faraday later gave an account of this job offer: “At the same time that he [Davy] gratified my desires as to scientific employment, he advised me to remain a bookbinder, telling me that Science was a harsh mistress… poorly rewarding those who devoted themselves to her service.”Despite Davy’s advice, Faraday accepted the job. It was a decision that would prove to be seminal for science. Over the next 55 years, while working for the Royal Institution, Faraday discovered several fundamental laws of physics and chemistry – including hislaw of electromagnetic induction in 1831, which illuminated the relative motion of charged particles.View image in fullscreenOne of Faraday’s inventions, used in electromagnetic field experiments.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesIt was thanks to Faraday’s trailblazing experiments at the institution that he discovered electromagnetic rotation in 1821, a breakthrough that led to the development of the electric motor and benzene, a hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid, in 1825. He became the first scientist to liquefy gas in 1823, invented the electric generator in 1831 and discovered the laws of electrolysis in the early 1830s, helping to coin terms such as electrode, cathode and ion. In 1845, after finding the first experimental evidence that a magnetic field could influence polarised light – a phenomenon that became known as the Faraday effect – he proved light and electromagnetism are interconnected.Today, Faraday’s law of induction is widely credited as enabling Einstein, who kept a framed picture of Faraday on his wall, to develop his theory of relativity.Throughout his career Faraday continued to draw his apparatus in his notebooks when making these groundbreaking discoveries. “It’s something that he starts here, with these illustrations, and carries on through,” New said.A curated selection of key pages from the notebooks will be launched online for the first time on the Royal Institution website on 24 March, to mark 200 years since Faraday founded the annualRoyal InstitutionChristmas lectures.Inspired by Davy’s talks to pursue a career in science, Faraday established these lectures in 1825 in the hope of encouraging others in the same way. “He was very strong on educating yourself, but also on educating everyone,” New said. “That principle remains fundamental to everything that the Royal Institution does today – we’re still hoping to inspire the next generation of scientists from all walks of life and backgrounds.”Eventually, every page of Faraday’s notebooks will be digitised and made searchable online, she added.Explore more on these topicsPhysicsThe ObserverChemistryAlbert EinsteinRoyal InstitutionnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes as the counciltries to buy up housing around Liverpoolto relocate homeless families there.Councils have legal obligations to support and rehouse homeless people, but they can terminate these duties if a household refuses a “reasonable” offer of housing.That offer must be affordable, but councils havemore leeway around location, and the housing affordability crisis in London and other high-demand areas has seen large numbers of homeless people relocated around the country.Enfield has recently taken a particularly aggressive approach. A reportpublished last yearby Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth (HASL) found that 94% of Enfield council’s offers of private rented housing to homeless people in 2023 were outside the capital, with 59% in the north-east. Perhaps as a result, three-quarters of their offers were rejected, the highest refusal rate of any London council.“It’s outrageous,” Enfield-based housing and union activist Paul Kershaw told theObserver. “These are people who are going to have families – they can be vulnerable, and as far as the council is concerned, they’re just being ripped away from their social connections and sent to totally inappropriate locations.”“You have families here with kids and everything, and what happens is that all your community networks break down,” added Charith Gunawardena, a former Enfield councillor who defected from Labour to the Greens, partly because of dissatisfaction with the council’s housing policies.“If you just move people to the north, where they have no community links or never lived in these areas, they have a house but everything else is broken down.”The rising costs of temporary accommodation for homeless ­people have squeezed Enfield’s finances, triggering a reaction from council bosses.At a council meeting in September 2023, Enfield council’s housing improvement director, Duane Dyer, said it would take a stricter approach to homeless households, allowing them fewer choices of alternative housing. “We are going to enforce our policy hardline,”he told the meeting. “I think the weakness is that we have not been as hardline as we should have been.”“I was horrified that they could possibly imagine they weren’t being hard enough on people who are desperate,” said Matt Burn of campaign group Better Homes Enfield. “We have a very significant problem in terms of our homelessness numbers. It comes largely from the housing benefit cap – ­[people] simply can’t afford private rents, and housing benefit doesn’t cover it.“Sooner or later, they’re issued with an eviction notice, and they then present themselves to the council as on the verge of homelessness.”London councils buy £140m of property to move homeless people out of cityRead morePart of the problem is that, for a long time, more expensive inner London boroughs with their own housing crises have relocated their homeless households to Enfield, leading to a rise in rents and using up housing stock that Enfield might otherwise have used for its own homeless people.But Enfield has also failed to build enough social housing. Its troubled Meridian Water regeneration scheme initially had no socially rented homes planned for the first two phases, though the council told theObserverthis position has changed and social housing is now part of the programme.An Enfield council spokesperson said: “To ensure that residents have access to secure, long-term and ­stable homes, we have taken the ­difficult but necessary decision adopted by other London local authorities to look into the possibility of buying a small number of residential properties in more affordable areas.“Where possible, we continue to seek housing solutions closer to Enfield. We’re focused on building homes. We will continue to work with the government to address our housing needs.”Explore more on these topicsHousingThe ObserverLocal governmentLondon politicsCommunitiesPovertyLondonSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home.“It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler county, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.”In Arkansas, three storm-related deaths have been confirmed in Independence county with an additional 29 people injured in eight counties,according tothe Arkansas division of emergency management on Saturday morning.Three people were killed on Friday in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo county in theTexaspanhandle, according to Sgt Cindy Barkley of the state’s department of public safety. One pileup involved an estimated 38 cars.“It’s the worst I’ve ever seen,” Barkley said, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. “We couldn’t tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.”This morning's (March 15) visible@NOAASatellitesimagery shows the deep low pressure system centered in Minnesota/Wisconsin.

Grenada county has been hit the hardest, Reeves said. A shelter has opened up in the Grenada City auditorium for those in search of refuge.At least 26 tornadoes were reported but not confirmed to have touched down late on Friday night and early on Saturday as a low pressure system drove powerful thunderstorms across parts of Arkansas, Illinois,Mississippiand Missouri, said David Roth, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center.“Today there is a high risk for more tornadoes acrossAlabamaand Mississippi, the chance is 30%,” he said. “That’s pretty significant.”As the storms regain strength, the highest possible risk of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms was on Saturday night, forecasters said.The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings early on Saturday morning for areas in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi,Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana and Texas.The agency has warned residents not to seek refuge in vehicles outside or under overpasses, as well as not to seek shelter under trees. Instead, it urged residents to get off the road and drive to a designated shelter, basement or safe room. The next best option for shelter is a small, windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor of a sturdy building, according to the agency.Extreme weather and powerful winds predicted for 100 million AmericansRead moreEvacuations were ordered in someOklahomacommunities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The state patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.Forecasters said the severe storm threat would continue into the weekend with a high chance of tornadoes and damaging winds on Saturday in Mississippi and Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the east coast on Sunday.Experts say it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.“What’s unique about this one is its large size and intensity,” said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. “And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.”The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the Saint Louis area. Several buildings were damaged.The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph (160km/h) possible.“Potentially violent” tornadoes were expected on Saturday in parts of the central Gulf coast and deep south into the Tennessee valley, according to the National Weather Service.The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida panhandle.Wildfires in the southern plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered on Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.A blaze in Roberts county, Texas, north-east of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 sq km) to an estimated 32.8 sq miles (85 sq km), the Texas A&M University forest service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening.About 60 miles (90km) to the south, another fire grew to about 4 sq miles (10 sq km) before its advance was halted in the afternoon.High winds also knocked out power to more than 300,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma,Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according the website poweroutage.us.The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far easternSouth Dakotastarting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in (7.6-15.2cm) were expected, with up to a foot (30cm) possible.Winds gusting to 60mph (97km/h) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherTexasMinnesotaSouth DakotaMissouriTornadoesAlabamanewsShareReuse this content"

The new crew were scheduled to arrive early on Sunday at about 3.30am GMT, and Williams and Wilmore – along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – are expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.The mission became entangled in controversy after PresidentDonald Trumpand his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, claimed without evidence that former president Joe Biden had abandoned Williams and Wilmore on the station for political reasons. The two astronauts rejected this accusation.They arrived at the ISS in June 2024 on a Starliner spacecraft built by Boeing, an aerospace rival to SpaceX. Nasa planned to return the two astronauts to Earth on the craft until problems were found with some of its thrusters, which would have played a crucial role in slowing down the spacecraft before re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.Leaks of helium from the craft’s propulsion system were also discovered, andNasachose not to risk using Starliner to take Williams and Wilmore back to Earth. Instead, the empty spaceship was undocked from the ISS and flown back for an automated, parachute-assisted landing in the New Mexico desert while the two astronauts were kept aboard the ISS to await a flight home on a scheduled crew rotation mission, even though this meant keeping them in orbit for months.Williams this month told reporters that she was looking forward to returning home to her family and two dogs. “It’s been a rollercoaster for them, probably a little bit more than for us,” she said.Explore more on these topicsInternational Space StationThe ObserverNasaSpaceXSpaceDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t believe it’s legal, and they do it in total coordination with each other,” he added.On Saturday, government-employed journalists at Voice of America (VoA) were put on administrative leave, a day after Trump signed an order eliminating the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), VoA’s parent company, along with six other federal agencies.Reporters at VoA, which broadcasts news, information and cultural programming in nearly 50 languages to a global audience, were placed on “administrative leave with full pay and benefits until otherwise notified”,according to an internal memo obtained by the Hill, adding that it is “not being done for any disciplinary purpose”.The decision to place VoA employees on administrative leave came a day after its parent moved to terminate contracts with the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, and told its journalists on Friday to stop using material from the wire services.Kari Lake, the former broadcaster turned Republican politician who was selected by Trump to run VoA, estimated the move would save $53m and said: “We should not be paying outside news organizations to tell us what the news is.” Lake is a Trump loyalist and immigration hardliner who endeared herself to him with dogmatic commitment to the falsehood that both she and Trump were the victims of election fraud.The latest moves come as disputes between media outlets covering the White House and the administration have grown more numerous in recent weeks, with the White House moving to take control of the press pool away from the White House Correspondents’ Association.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,said last monththat members of the White House press pool will now be selected by administration officials.That came after a highly publicized dispute between the White House and the Associated Press over the wire agency’s decision not to adopt the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico into its stylebook.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a court challenge seeking to overturn the White House ban, an attorney for the AP described the ban as a “constitutional problem”.“We’re not arguing that the president of the United States has to answer the Associated Press’s questions,” said Charles Tobin. “The issue is that once he lets the press pool in he can’t say, ‘I don’t like you. You’re fake news. Get out.’”But the White House argues that access to the president in the Oval Office and onboard Air Force One is a privilege, not a legal right. Last month, a federal judge refused to immediately restore the AP’s access, saying the news organization had not demonstrated it had suffered any irreparable harm.A subsequent hearing on the issue is set for next week, but Trump has said he plans to keep the AP out “until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.

Already, it had been a trying few days for the world’s richest man, who was facing aTeslastock selloff and fierce backlashover his attempts to radically overhaul the federal government. His net worthdeclined over $22bnon Monday alone.After Musk jokingly brushed off initial questions about the mounting pressure, host Larry Kudlow asked the Tesla andSpaceXCEO how he was managing to run his numerous companies amid the chaos.“With great difficulty,” Musk answered, at first chuckling then taking a long sigh and staring off into the middle distance. “I mean … yeah”.‘Major brand worries’: Just how toxic is Elon Musk for Tesla?Read moreThe past 10 days have marked several of the most significant setbacks for Musk in months. Tesla, arguably his marquee company, continued to fall in value as investors worried about thethreat of trade warandpossible recession– as well as declining profits. Escalating protests against the company over the billionaire’s role in the government also grew in number and intensity across the US, coupled with rising cases of vandalism andsocial stigmaagainst his cars. SpaceX has also struggled, with one of its rocketsdramatically explodingin midflight last week and then an announcement on Wednesday that it wasdelaying a rescue missionto retrieve “stranded” astronauts. The companytried againtwo days later.Adding to Musk’s headaches, his social media platform, X, experiencedwidespread outages throughout the dayon Monday. During his Fox Business interview, he claimed that it was the result of a “massive cyberattack” that the company had traced to the area of Ukraine.Musk is also dealing with increasing pushback over his role at Doge. Multiple outlets reported that the “first buddy”, as he’s christened himself, gotinto a heated exchangewithMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, during a White House meeting last week, which ended withDonald Trumpappearing to rein in Musk’s power to make staffing decisions at government agencies with aTruth social post. A federal judge in California alsoissued a preliminary injunctionon Thursday to reinstate thousands of the workers that Doge mass fired. Meanwhile, polling this week from Quinnipiac University shows that despite Musk repeatedly declaring that the public loves what Doge is doing, astrong majorityof people disapprove of his initiative.After a long string of victories for Musk that included soaring share prices and a period of seemingly unchecked power following Trump’s inauguration, some signs of strain are beginning to show on his grip on his empire. He has lost around $119bn this year so far, although staggeringly still boasts a fortune $100bn greater than the next richest man in the world, and facesquestions from investorson whether his political activity ishurting his companies.Rather than step away from his role in the White House, however, Musk appears to be doubling down.Musk turns to Maga world to turn Tesla’s fortunes aroundTwo days after his labored appearance on Fox Business, Musk was once again in front of the cameras. This time, he was smiling alongside Trump on the White House lawn as thepresident cooed overa new red Tesla Model S and gushed to reporters about what a wonderful car it was.“Everything is computer,” Trump said, sitting in the driver’s seat. “That’s beautiful!”At the climax of the transformation of the White House into a car dealership, Trump announced that he had bought the Model S. He likewise spoke out in support of Musk and told reporters that Americans should “cherish” the billionaire. Others in the Maga world soon followed suit, declaring their backing forTeslaand urging their followers to do the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the display also gave the impression that Musk needed Trump to reverse his string of losses and quell the backlash against him. Trump stated at the event that he would label demonstrations against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism. Attorney general Pam Bondiannounced on Fridayshe would launch an investigation into vandalism targeting the company.“They fought the law and the law won,” Musk posted on X above news that Bondi was threatening vandals with up to 20 years in prison forattacking Tesla dealerships.The backlash against Tesla does not appear to be slowing; more protests against Tesla are set for the coming week. In response, Musk is deepening his embrace with the Maga world, including its most distasteful denizens. He spent a sizable part of Friday afternoon posting support for Tesla and Doge from rightwing media influencer accounts and Fox News clips. At one point, he retweeted a post that compared attacks against Tesla vehicles and dealerships to Kristallnacht, the infamous Nazi pogrom against Jewish-owned businesses that took place at the onset of the Holocaust.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationTeslaSpaceXDonald TrumpXUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The first group of 10 countries, which includes Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Cuba and North Korea, among others, would be set for a full visa suspension.In the second group, five countries – Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and South Sudan – would face partial suspensions that would affect tourist and student visas as well as other immigrant visas, with some exceptions.In the third group, a total of 26 countries including Belarus, Pakistan and Turkmenistan, among others, would be considered for a partial suspension of US visa issuance if their governments “do not make efforts to address deficiencies within 60 days”, the memo said.The list has yet to be approved by the administration, including the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and could be amended, officials told the outlet.The memo follows an executive order issued on 20 January that requires intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats, and directed several cabinet members to submit a list of countries for partial or full suspension because their “vetting and screening information is so deficient”.During the first Trump administration, in 2017, a partial ban imposed on travelers from predominantly Muslim-population nations was labeled a “Muslim ban” by Trump and his aides.Fourteen months earlier, after an Islamic State-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Trump had called for “a total and complete” shutdown of Muslims entering the US “until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on”.A new set of restrictions, outlined in the memo, would follow pledges by the president to institute an immigration crackdown. In October 2023, Trump pledged to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and “anywhere else that threatens our security”.Any move to ban or restrict immigration from the list of 43 countries would come in tandem with Department of Homeland Security efforts to deport undocumented migrants affiliated with newly identified terrorist crime networks, including Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, El Salvador’s MS-13 and the Mexican-American 18th St.At the same time, the Trump administration is moving to cancel immigration status and deport several foreign-born university graduates, including Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, who led campus protests against Israel’s war on Gaza last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The press have barely been let near the remake’s stars, Rachel Zegler, who is of Colombian-Polish descent and plays Snow White, and Israeli actor Gal Gadot, playing the Evil Queen. And there are no dwarves.The film is forgoing a traditional Leicester Square red carpet opening this week; advance ticket sales projections are lacklustre and it hasn’t been shown to reviewers.But why should a film based on an archetypal fairy tale – of a wicked queen, jealous of her stepdaughter’s beauty, who orders her murder, only to discover that she is hiding in a cottage with seven dwarves, then poisons her with a drugged apple, causing her to fall into a deep sleep, to be awakened only by the kiss of a prince – cause so much bother?View image in fullscreenGal Gadot and Rachel Zegler with a certain item of fruit in the new movie.Photograph: DisneyGood or bad,Snow Whiteis destined for a reaction. “It’s a complete quagmire but, realistically, what did they expect?” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts in California and former executive editor of theHollywood Reporter. “You’re going into this with a movie calledSnow White. It’s hard to imagine a picture in this DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion], or post-DEI, post-woke age could be more controversial and polarising – and Disney is all about not being polarising, bringing people together and avoiding controversy at all costs.”Disney embarked on a programme of reinventing its animated back catalogue as live action withAlice in Wonderlandin 2010, continuing withCinderella(2015),The Jungle Book(2016), andBeauty and the Beast(2017). But the release ofMulanin 2020, a remake of the 1998 animated film based on a Chinese folklore tale, signalled that folk tales carry contemporary political and cultural trapdoors. There were false rumours that Disney had cast a white lead actress, and calls for a boycott afterMulan’s lead actor Liu Yifei expressed support for the Hong Kong police. The credits revealed that film-makers thanked eight government entities in Xinjiang, where Uyghur Muslims have been detained in internment camps.Actor Halle Bailey, who is Black and starred in the 2023Little Mermaidremake, faced racist backlashafter being cast as Ariel, who was white in the animated film in 1989.Zegler, the star ofSnow White, who is Latina, has suffered similar abuse. ButSnow Whitealso arrives on our screens with a different set of issues. Screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson said the 1937 classic had been gently fleshed out for a more contemporary audience and that she had “massaged the theme of her discovering and trusting her own voice and her own purpose with compassion and strength”.Zegler toldVanity Fairin 2022 that people were making jokes “about ours being the PCSnow White, where it’s like, yeah, it is – because it needed that. It’s an 85-year-old cartoon, and our version is a refreshing story about a young woman who has a function beyond Someday My Prince Will Come.” She has also been criticised for saying the prince “literally stalks” the princess in the 1937 original.View image in fullscreenSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs – the 1937 original.Photograph: Disney/AllstarDisney possibly saw controversy coming. When it reopened its renamed Snow White’s Enchanted Wish ride at Disneyland in 2021, it was hit with criticism that the upgraded experience still included Prince Charming kissing a sleeping Snow White – without her consent. The kiss was one of true love, not lust, because the prince thought she was dead, it was explained.Both Zegler and Gadot have run into trouble with political statements. Gadot, who served in the Israel Defense Forces,spokeat an Anti-Defamation League summit on antisemitism, and her stance on the Israel-Hamas war triggered calls by Palestinian groups fora boycottof the film.Zegler, on the other hand, has posted “always remember, free palestine”on X. After the US election, she wrote “may Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace” on Instagram. Zegler later apologised, saying she was “sorry I contributed to the negative discourse”.R&B legend Brandy, who played Cinderella in a 1997 remake starring Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother, has advised Zegler to remember her true audience. “You’re not taking on this role to fit the mould of the critics,” Brandy toldVariety. “You’re doing this for every little Colombian girl who has yet to see themselves in a role like a Disney princess.”And then there are the notorious dwarves, created using CGI animation.Cyranostar Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, questioned why the characters were included while Snow White was cast diversely. “It makes no sense to me. You’re progressive in one way, but then you’re still making that fucking backward story about seven dwarves living in a cave together?” he said on theWTF with Marc Maronpodcast in 2022.View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as Evil Queen in the live-action Snow White.Photograph: DisneyDisney said it has consulted members of the dwarfism community “to avoid reinforcing stereotypes” and, later, that it would replace the seven with “magical creatures”.Peter Kunze, a historian at Tulane University in New Orleans and author ofStaging a Comeback: Broadway, Hollywood, and the Disney Renaissance, says Disney has sometimes struggled to manage the transition from animation to live action, just as Walt Disney managed to make animation more realistic with Snow White than it was with Mickey Mouse.“There are questions of authenticity that come with the shift,” Kunze says. “In some ways they’re moving away from the principles of the animated film, of fantasy or embellished reality, and getting more realistic. The interesting question is not whether it’s authentic, but in what ways does Disney think it’s being authentic and how audiences respond?But updating for contemporary audiences and hiring consultants to say how authentic it is, does not necessarily resonate with audiences “who maybe are not looking for Disney to have a culturally rich, in-depth storytelling in a fairytale space. A film can only do so much to capture a culture, and then there’s the question of: whose version of that culture do you capture?” Kunze says.“In attempting to speak to more diverse audiences by putting a Latina into a Germanic narrative without acknowledging certain elements of what it means to be Latina potentially does little to make space for more Latina stories and just presents new bodies in old stories as progress,” Kunze adds.It may be that Disney is a touchstone that makes for a big, easy target in the culture wars, andSnow Whiteis the fairest target of them all in its archive. If the movie is good enough, it could cut through the cultural flak. “From the beginningSnow Whitehad red flags waving – a whiter-than-white heroine at a time when Hollywood is moving away from that, rescued by Prince Charming, when that’s a chauvinist trope, and seven dwarves, when the word dwarf is a negative. It’s not like any of this crept up on Disney unawares. ButSnow Whiteis also the classic of classics – it is to animation what Hamlet is to the theatre.”Explore more on these topicsCultureThe ObserverChildrenWomenAnimation in filmFilm industryWalt Disney CompanynewsShareReuse this content"

ThenDonald Trumpreturned to power.The Trump administration is conducting a sweeping overhaul of the US economy,using tariffs– levies on foreign goods, paid for by importers – in an effort to reset the country’s trade ties with the world, revive its industrial heartlands and force its neighbors to address illegal immigration and drug trafficking.“Tariffs are easy, they’re fast, they’re efficient, and they bring fairness,” Trump said earlier this month.The reality has proven more complex, and confusing, than the bold rhetoric. Threats have been leveled and then dropped; deadlines declared and delayed; tariffs imposed and postponed. Chaos reigns.View image in fullscreenThe bottling, distilling, and packaging area at Brough Brothers’ first distillery location on the west side of Louisville.Photograph: Andrew Cenci/The GuardianVictor Yarbrough, CEO of Brough Brothers, does not want tariffs. But he would take the certainty of tariffs over the current racket emanating from the White House around whether they will, or won’t, be imposed; when; and on which markets.“They’re happening. They’re not happening. They’re on. They’re off. It doesn’t allow us the timeframe we need,” Yarbrough said in an interview. “We can’t plan.”Yarbrough spoke to the Guardian the week after Trump declared there to be “no room left” for an economic peace deal with Canada; imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on US exports from the country; and accused its prime minister of using the dispute to cling to power; only to offer a one-month reprieve.During the interview, the president lashed out against Ontario’sdecision to retaliateagainst his tariffs with a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota,announcingthat tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum exports to the US would be doubled. Hours later, the threat was revoked.View image in fullscreenBrough Brothers distillery near Waterfront Park in downtown Louisville, Kentucky.Photograph: Andrew Cenci/The GuardianBrough Brothers, Kentucky’s first African American-owned distillery, was “in the middle of getting a deal done” to start selling its spirits in New Brunswick when Trump took aim at Canada, straining economic ties with a typically reliable market for US exporters. “We’ve effectively had to put the deal on hold indefinitely,” said Yarbrough.Tensions are flaring worldwide. The day after the interview, the EUunveiled a €26bn ($28bn/£22bn) list of US targets– including bourbon – that it plans to hit with retaliatory tariffs, after Trump hiked US tariffs on steel and aluminum. In response, the US presidentthreatened a 200% US tariffon European alcohol.Several Canadian provinces meanwhileremoved US liquor from store shelvesas part of the dispute between Washington and Ottawa; a move that some American producers said was worse than a tariff. The question of how much it might cost to sell a product into a market was supplanted by whether it could be sold there at all.“Having all US alcohol pulled from the shelves in Canada is a huge blow for the industry,” said Yarbrough, who just a few months ago had planned to start selling into markets including Canada, the UK, Germany, France and South Africa. “Now we’re Plan B.View image in fullscreenA distribution map at Brough Brothers’ first distillery location.Photograph: Andrew Cenci/The Guardian“It’s Canada today. It’s the UK, it’s the European Union, in a couple of weeks. It’s China now. Is there another country [on which] they’re going to implement tariffs?” he said. “Can we pivot to a Brazil? Can we pivot to a Colombia? Can we pivot to a Panama? Or are they going to have tariffs the next month? It’s just difficult to facilitate any kind of plan, just because there’s so much uncertainty.”A day after we spoke, the EU vowed to impose steep tariffs on acarefully targeted list of US exportsafter Trump hiked US duties on steel and aluminium. Bourbon whiskey was among them.Yarbrough knows trade, having previously imported bourbon from the US and exported English cider while based in the UK. He knows tariffs, too. “Ultimately it’s a tax,” he said, noting that the real increase in costs is likely to be higher than the official rate, as the duty twists each link of the supply chain.A 25% tariff, for example, would probably prompt both the importer and the retailer to adjust their costs, according to Yarbrough. “You’re not just speaking about that 25%. That’s just the baseline,” he said. “These incremental costs add up. It’s beyond just the 25%.”View image in fullscreenBarrels of bourbon are seen at Brough Brothers’ new distillery location.Photograph: Andrew Cenci/The GuardianThe tariffs mess is rattling this deep red state. Louisville has so many bourbon production plants that locals say they can often smell the whiskey in the air. A vast bottle of Old Forester towers over the headquarters of Brown-Forman, the drinks conglomerate.Kentucky Republicans have urged Trump to dial down his tariff threats. The Republican senator Rand Paul has warned duties would “inevitably” raise prices and invite retaliation that would reduce bourbon exports. As a stock market sell-off took hold, he wrote on social media: “When the markets tumble like this in response to tariffs, it pays to listen.”Lobbyists insist the spirits sector is a model of the “fair and reciprocal” approach on trade that Trump claims to be seeking. In the two decades after the US and EU eliminated tariffs on most spirits in 1997, bilateral trade grew by 450%, according to the DistilledSpiritsCouncil of the US.“Tariffs back and forth would be catastrophic for the industry,” Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the council, told the Guardian.View image in fullscreenBrough Brothers’ first distillery location on the west side of Louisville, Kentucky.Photograph: Andrew Cenci/The GuardianSure, he said, the US does have a trade deficit with key markets on spirits – importing more from markets like the EU, UK, Canada and Mexico than it exports to them. “But it’s not because of trade barriers. It’s because American consumers love scotch. They love Irish whiskey … American consumers love tequila, and Canadian whiskey.”Within these global markets, however, free trade – without tariffs, or barriers – has set the stage for the US industry’s rapid growth, Swonger claimed, with the number of distilleries surging from 60 to about 3,100 in about two decades. “It’s a great American success story,” he said.Trump, who rarely speaks in minimal terms, has conceded his grand economic reset might cause “a little disturbance” for companies and consumers. The spirits sector, so often caught in the crossfire of trade disputes, fears the turbulence may well be bigger than billed.Operators are calling on the White House to prioritize talking over tariffs. “I get it. Two brothers are fighting,” said Yarbrough. “Let’s go have a drink and figure this out. Let’s go have a bourbon and figure this out.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicsKentuckyCanadaSpiritsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And in an interview with the Guardian, Tsai said: “I hope his involvement with [Doge] is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses.”The chief investment officer and president of Tsai Capital, which reportedly manages a portfolio of about $137m, made it a point to say that his stated hope does not constitute a loss of faith in Musk or his company’s earning potential, despite opinion polls establishing the Tesla boss’s unpopularity with the American public and his net worth evidentlytumblingabout $23bn in recent days.Tsai said the stock markets also reacted negatively when Musk bought Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, in 2022 for $44bn. Yet he said Tsai Capital – which holds about 75,000 shares inTeslaas of its most recent quarterly filings – had made more than six times its money since first investing in the company in February 2020, even with the downturn in performance of late.A president touting Musk’s cars from the White House shows this: the Tesla boycott really irks him | Gaby HinsliffRead moreTsai recently told his investors ina letterthat his firm considers Tesla to be more of a creator of advanced electronics and software that it attaches to cars rather than a traditional automotive manufacturer and he insisted that the EV maker remained “on a path to become one of the most valuable companies on the planet”.Nonetheless, he said “the market … reacting unfavorably to Elon Musk’s recent involvement in politics” was real. And though he said he thought Musk’s self-professed belief that government reforms are needed was genuine, Tsai expressed a hope that the Tesla boss’s role in Doge ultimately proved to be like other temporary commitments he had previously taken on.Tsai’s comments on what is his firm’s largest holding come at a time when Musk – who prominently supported Trump’s successful run for a second presidency – has advised the White House on the widespread firings of government employees and the dismantling of various services. Those services include US humanitarian aid and development work, with experts warning that their elimination could have life-threatening consequences.If a CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS is any indication, such measures have not gone over well with the public. Thesurveyshowed 53% of Americans disapproved of Musk, and 35% approved – leaving him about 18 points underwater.Those results werereleasedon Wednesday, two days after Tesla’s stock fell more than 15% amid public protests against the company and vandalism reported at some of the brand’s dealerships.Tsai’s descent from a lineage of legendary investors sets his voice apart from some of the others who have weighed in on Musk, Doge and Tesla at the two-month mark of the second Trump presidency.His paternal grandmother was Ruth Tsai, who became the first woman to trade on the floor of the stock exchange in Shanghai, China, in 1939 during the second world war. Her earnings helped her send her son – Tsai’s father, Gerald – to college in the US, where he ultimately settled and made a name for himself as a financier and fund manager.Gerald Tsai Jr also eventually became the chief executive officer of the financial services giant Primerica, which – along with its subsidiary Commercial Credit Group – helped build Citigroup, as the New York Times hasreported.A notable aspect of Tsai’s trajectory was his father’s acquaintance with Trump when the latter was primarily a real estate mogul in Manhattan. The families were close enough that, in his youth, Tsai considered Donald Trump Jr his best friend, vacationing with him and once going to a baseball game with his siblings, their mother and their father.Tsai said the younger Trump was one of the first people to whom he came out as a gay man, doing so before he did to Gerald. “That’s cool,” Tsai recalled Trump Jr telling him, while he said Gerald took a longer time to accept it.A registered Democrat, Tsai said he had not had “a meaningful conversation with any member of” the president’s family since a lunch with Donald Jr in January 2014 – more than two years before Trump Sr clinched the Republican White House nomination and won his first presidency. Tsai said they just “went in different directions” as the Trumps moved into politics, and their family patriarch aligned himself closely with Musk as he clinched the White House a second time in November’s election.Meanwhile, the elder Tsai, who married and divorced four times and once survived crashing in a helicopter into New York’s Hudson River before his death in 2008, did not pass on much of his larger-than-life personality to Christopher.The younger Tsai for instance has been married to his spouse – with whom he is raising teenaged twins – since 2005.But, as Christopher put it, Gerald Tsai Jr did teach him to learn about – and love – trading stocks in his childhood. He began investing at 12 and started his capital firm in 1997 at age 22.Tsai said some of the principles to which he adheres – whether as a philanthropic donor to artistic as well as environmental causes – were inherited from the first Chinese American to be CEO of a Dow Jones Industrial company.“My father would say you have to do deep work in order to figure out where value is and to uncover great situations,” Tsai said. “Our job as investors is to figure out what’s real, what’s not real, what that’s worth, what’s priced into the stock and where the company’s valuation is going.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

It has been credited with inspiring the recent rise in popularity of the sport and been welcomed by F1’s owners and, for the most part, by teams and drivers. But questions have been repeatedly raised over the way stories are told and edited by its production company, Box to Box Films.‘You get hooked so quickly!’ How Formula 1: Drive to Survive became the apex of TV documentariesRead moreIn the latest season, released this month, Norris plays a prominent role in his fight for the title with Max Verstappen and has earned praise for his open attitude and honesty with the film-makers.However, before the first race of the season, Norris, who went on totake pole position during qualifying, was deeply unhappy with what he believes was the way producers manipulated footage, specifically to suggest he and Verstappen were at odds when the pair remain good friends.“They need to show the truth about people more,” he said. “I’m not a fan of fake stuff. I want facts, I don’t want made-up scripts and fabricated nonsense, which there is. The portrayal of Max and how we were against each other so much. They don’t need to create.“There’s drama, they can just show the facts of the drama. They don’t need to do anything more than that. They need to come back to reality a bit more, it’s drifted too far away.”Norris won his first grand prix in Miami last season, which was portrayed in the series as a close contest with Verstappen when in fact theMcLarendriver won comfortably. Verstappen was shown looking unhappy at the result, footage that had been filmed not in Miami but at the Dutch Grand Prix later that year. It has since been declared an “error” and removed.Verstappen had been pleased for his friend’s success and went out to celebrate with him that night. Norris was concerned that viewers may form opinions based on selective editing.“To portray someone in an incorrect way, people are going to have their opinions of that incorrect person, it’s almost lying in some ways,” he said. “I just don’t think that’s correct. I don’t think you can paint someone in the wrong picture when it’s not the truth. I don’t think it’s fair for anyone in the world, especially as it has such a big following and so many people love it, people believe what they see.”Verstappen has also long been critical of the series and has limited his participation in it. “I watched two episodes, but I was not very impressed. It’s just not my thing, faking rivalries,” he has said.Netflix began filming the eighth edition of Drive to Survive at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Norris acknowledged it had contributed to Formula One’s surge in popularity and understood why its behind-the-scenes access was so popular with fans, but felt it should shift the emphasis from drama to documentary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A post on Foster’s social media account on Saturday confirmed the split, with the bag man implying the decision was Fitzpatrick’s.Rounds of 78 and 72 meant Fitzpatrick comprehensively missed the cut at the Players Championship. On six events on thePGA Tourin 2025, the Englishman has finished no higher than tied 22nd. Foster was only due to caddie at around half Fitzpatrick’s tournaments this year, including next month’s Masters, but now the relationship has ended abruptly.Rory McIlroy relishing tougher test as storms head for Players ChampionshipRead more“Well, after six great years all good things come to an end,” said Foster. “This game never stops to frustrate you and infuriate you! Unfortunately times change and ultimately it is the caddie or the coach that has to accept results are not good enough and when you stop enjoying what you are doing, it is time for a change. Thanks Matt, we had a great run and who knows where the next chapter will go. Onwards and upwards.”Foster – who previously worked for players such as Seve Ballesteros, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke – famously had never been on the bag of a major winner during more than 40 years as a caddie. Fitzpatrick ended that run amidemotional scenes at the 2022 US Open. Fitzpatrick duly branded Foster as the greatest of all time. “This means the world to Billy,” said Fitzpatrick. “It’s unbelievable for him. I know it’s something he’s wanted for a long, long, long time.

He sits 61st in the world golf rankings, with a Ryder Cup return later this year already in serious doubt. It is intriguing that Fitzpatrick does not apparently believe Foster’s experience can assist with an improvement in fortunes, however, Foster is unlikely to be short of new employment offers.A chaotic day three at Sawgrass saw JJ Spaun claim a one shot lead over Bud Cauley. Spaun’s 12-under-par aggregate sees him four clear of Rory McIlroy, who birdied the last for a 73. On a leaderboard that is otherwise noticeably short of stardust Patrick Cantlay lurks at seven under. Scottie Scheffler tossed his club away in disgust after over-hitting his approach to the 18th. Yet at minus five, Scheffler cannot be counted out quite yet.With storms forecast, final round starting times have been advanced.

Kupp added 33 catches for 478 yards and six TDs in the postseason for the Rams, including the winning touchdown in their Super Bowl win over Cincinnati.Kupp was plagued by injuries the past three seasons and didn’t have 900 yards receiving during that span.

But the IBA, run by Umar Kremlev, a Russian businessman with close links to the Kremlin, criticised the IOC during the Games forallowing Algeria’s Imane Khelifand Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei, who had been banned by the IBA as a result of a chromosome test a year earlier, to compete.‘I am a woman’: Imane Khelif hits back in gender row after claiming goldRead moreA bitter war of words ensued between the two organisations and dominated the headlines. “I would not consider this a real crisis because all this discussion is based on a fake news campaign coming from Russia,” said Bach, speaking in Pylos, the southern Greek seaside resort where his successor will be elected on Thursday. “This was part of the many, many fake news campaigns we had to face from Russia before Paris and after Paris.”Several such campaigns happened before Paris, including what the IOC said at the time were repeated hacking attempts. Russian athletes competed as neutrals in Paris after the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended for conducting Olympic elections in Ukrainian territories occupied following the Russian invasion in 2022.Bach said the dispute over the boxers would have been a non-issue were it not for the IBA, given the two had competed for years, including at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, with no problems. “It has nothing to do with the reality,” Bach said. “These two female focuses were born as women, they were raised as women, they have been competing as women, they have been winning and losing as every other person.”The IOC does not have a universal rule on the participation of transgender athletes or athletes with differences of sexual development, with each federation drawing up its own regulations.1:36'We will not take part in a culture war': Bach defends Khelif's right to fight at Olympics – videoBach also said he had no concerns about the preparation of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, calling the US president, Donald Trump, a strong supporter and promoter of the project. “Let the organising committee … continue to work with President Trump and his administration because they have established very good relations,” Bach said when asked what his advice to his successor would be regarding the LA Olympics and Trump. “The IOC should have confidence in their American partners and friends, and confidence that President Trump from the beginning was a strong supporter and promoter of theOlympic Games.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which may be whyField of Dreamswas about building a baseball stadium in Iowa for Shoeless Joe Jackson and the ghosts of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox rather than, say, Daniel Levy constructing a football stadium in Haringey for Vincent Janssen and the remnants of the 2019Tottenham Hotspurteam.In the past week, Manchester United haverevealed plans for a new £2bn stadium, capacity 100,000, next to Old Trafford, while Newcastle are reported to be looking to move from St James’ Park to a65,000-capacity stadium on Leazes Park. Everton will move into a new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock next season. Wrexham are building a 5,500-capacity Kop. New stadiums suddenly are fashionable again after a period in which they came to seem almost an afterthought. That, perhaps, is an unintended consequence of profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).The England job drives people mad but Thomas Tuchel has shot to make it workRead moreMost clubs find that moving to a new stadium works out in the long term – at least in terms of attracting fans. Perhaps the biggest single reason for Manchester United’s status as the largest club in England – albeit Manchester City’s revenue is now higher – is that in 1910 they moved into Old Trafford, at the time the biggest and best stadium in the country.Arsenal’s average attendance these days is a little more than 60,000, while Highbury’s capacity was just 38,000. Tottenham similarly get about 61,000 as opposed to 36,000 at White Hart Lane. There have been times when Sunderland’s Stadium of Light, capacity 48,000, has felt pretty empty, but average attendance is about 40,000 as opposed to 21,000 in the final season at Roker Park, despite being a division lower. Even West Ham, whose fans have a distinctly ambivalent attitude to the London Stadium, have seen attendances climb to 62,000 from 35,000 since leaving Upton Park.Look at the emptiest grounds in England – MK Dons, Port Vale, Tranmere Rovers, Colchester United and Wigan Athletic – and there tend to be specific issues that have caused the disparity between stadium size and support that go beyond the hubris of building an overly large stadium.Perhaps it could be argued that Colchester were overambitious in building a stadium with a capacity double their average attendance even when they were in the Championship, but 10,000 hardly seems excessive for somewhere that markets itself as Essex’s largest entertainment venue and has hosted Elton John, Lionel Richie and Olly Murs.But there is a cost. Arsenal always offered the cautionary tale. It was their misfortune that they made the bold decision to leave Highbury – which, for all its charms, simply wasn’t big enough to allow them to compete with Manchester United – at just the wrong time. It took nine years from beginning the process in 1997 to the first game at the Emirates and, by the time they got there, the financial landscape had changed utterly.View image in fullscreenThanks to the cost of their grand new stadium, Tottenham didn’t make a single signing during the 2018-19 season.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockNot only had broadcast revenues increased to reduce the significance of gate receipts and corporate hospitality, but Roman Abramovich had taken over at Chelsea. Just as his money, unchecked by any form of financial fair play (FFP), was transforming the Premier League, Arsenal were having to curtail their spending to meet interest payments on the stadium debt.The precise moment at which Arsène Wenger’s gifts began to wane can be debated, but Arsenal’s struggles to keep up with Chelsea and United after winning the title in 2003-04, at least initially, were caused in large part by the financial restrictions they were operating under.That was a not unfamiliar story. Nottingham Forest had taken a similar gamble in 1979-80, beginning work on a new stand that took a decade to pay off and was, in its way, just as responsible for Forest’s failure to build on their two European Cup successes as the falling-out between Brian Clough and his longtime assistant Peter Taylor.Tottenham’s league form was already in decline when they reached the Champions League final in 2018-19, a season in which, thanks to the cost of their grand new stadium, they didn’t make a single signing.But FFP regulations mean the sort of splurge undertaken by Abramovich is no longer possible. Domestic television rights have plateaued and while overseas rights continue to climb, the sense is they are nearing their peak. Clubs having to generate their own revenues for PSR purposes have turned to two exigencies: the sale of homegrown talent and revenue generated by the stadium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year’s financial results show match receipts up to £117m and commercial revenues, which include sponsorship, merchandising, visitor attractions, conferences and events at the stadium, up to £227.7m of a total revenue of £549.6m.As Spurs have scratched around the lower half of the Premier League this season there has been much sneering at the emphasis given to American football, boxing and concerts, but the problem is less the way revenue is generated than the fact so little of it ends up being spent on players.For Newcastle, the new stadium would seem to come with few risks. Investment in infrastructure is exempted from PSR calculations, so a new revenue-generating stadium is a way for Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to put significant money into the club that would yield a return and be within the regulations. The benefits may take a few years to be felt, but far less time than they would if the stadium were funded by a standard loan.And that’s where Manchester United must be careful, however powerful the case for moving after two decades of neglecting Old Trafford. They already have interest repayments of about £50m a year, so, even if public funding is secured, it is hard to see how they would not at least be doubling that at a time when money is required for a complete overhaul of the squad.Build it and they would almost certainly come to a new Old Trafford, but as Tottenham have found, as Arsenal and Forest found in the past, some thought has to be given to what they would be watching once they are there.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedInside footballTottenham HotspurFinancial fair playFinancescommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a low-budget Mexican sitcom that ran from the 70s to the 90s, centred on an eight-year-old orphan who lives in a barrel in an apartment complex. The boy is played by Roberto Gómez Bolaños, who was in his 40s when the series began and his 60s when it ended. Pretty much all the humour is derived from slapstick: situational farce, physical jokes, people getting their heads trapped in buckets. That kind of thing.Try to imagine ChuckleVision gone global, to the point where it was a genuine cultural touchstone for hundreds of millions, to the point where Paul and Barry Chuckle have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and are unable to walk through Manhattan without being mobbed. That’sEl Chavo. Even today it remains one of the most famous comic creations in the history of television: syndicated across the Americas, enthralling successive generations long after it was decommissioned. Including – at some point in early 2000s Uruguay – a young Darwin Núñez.‘I like to do normal things’: Virgil van Dijk maintains sense of perspectiveRead moreEl Chavo del Ocho(The Kid at No 8) is Núñez’s favourite TV programme. Naturally, I have my own theories about this. El Chavo – whose real name is never revealed – is a clumsy, oversized agent of chaos, often entirely oblivious to the mayhem he creates, pursued wherever he goes by comedy sound effects but possessed of an essential purity, a credulity, a heart of gold and a homespun wisdom that makes it impossible not to root for him, even when he’s doing incredibly stupid things. El Chavo, meet thine real-life avatar. His name is Darwin.Often you will hear it said that Núñez divides opinion. In fact the basic outline of Núñez is pretty much a consensus view at this point: entertaining, endearing and erratic, a richly talented player for whomLiverpoolpaid slightly over the odds, and who probably needs to be replaced with someone more reliable sooner rather than later. We can pretty much all agree on that. In a sense, there is perhaps no player who divides opinion less than Núñez.View image in fullscreenA mural to the character Don Ramón fromEl Chavo del Ochoin Montevideo, Uruguay.Photograph: Raúl Martínez/EPAWhat people are really talking about when they talk about Núñez dividing opinion is his inconsistency. The spectacular finishes, the spectacular misses and the vague whiff of slapstick that seems to follow him wherever he goes. There was a moment during Tuesday’s Champions League last‑16second leg against Paris Saint-Germainwhen Núñez out-sprinted Luis Díaz in pursuit of Virgil van Dijk’s long ball, only to remember about the potential offside flag and start running away from it, with Díaz already having stopped. It’s the 81st minute. You’re 1-0 down. And now, for the first time in your life, you decide to worry about offside?The orthodox view of Núñez’s Liverpool career is that he is simply a poor fit for what Arne Slot is trying to do: a cat trapped in a grand piano, a maverick in a team seeking immaculate control, of emotions as well as the ball. Virtually all his metrics are significantly down from the Jürgen Klopp era: goals, expected goals, expected assists, key passes, dribbles, touches, shots and shots on target. This season Liverpool perform a goal a game worse when he is on the pitch than when he is not. A big Liverpool clearout is expected this summer and the word is they will listen to a serious offer for Núñez.And so to Wembley on Sunday and a game that feels – for Núñez and Núñez alone – like a kind of last chance. Núñez may not start theCarabao Cupfinal against Newcastle. Diogo Jota could easily slot in up front; Díaz has intermittently impressed as a false No 9. At some point, whether it is for 90 minutes or 90 seconds, the skies will darken and Núñez will make his appearance: a one-man forcefield, a player who somehow bends the waves of the game around him.He was born into poverty, suffered a cruciate injury at the age of 19 that put him out of the game for a year and a half and convinced him he would never kick a ball again. If there is any kind of vulnerability there, it is one driven by pure hunger, the high-stakes caprice of a man who still expects nothing good to last long, who will make every moment count or die trying.There is one metric in which he has significantly improved this season: tackles and interceptions. With his minutes restricted, Núñez has tried to make every single one count. His goals against Brentford, Southampton and Aston Villa have been crucial in the title challenge. And for all the focus on his missed penalty in the shootout against PSG this week, his contribution to Harvey Elliott’s winning goalin the first leghas been almost forgotten.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Signed in the wake of Erling Haaland joining Manchester City, Núñez quickly found himself fitted for the role of talisman, immediately judged by goals and goals alone. Roberto Firmino, the man he partially replaced, went 13 league games without scoring in the 2019-20 title-winning season and it was fine. Núñez has never gone that long without a goal in his life and yet the perception persists – fuelled by a projection of the player people want him to be rather than the player he is – that he is some kind of gilded failure.He misses big chances. But so does Haaland, so does Ollie Watkins, so does any striker with the faith to put himself about, to make the right runs, to try. The Premier League has only been collecting “big chance” data since 2010 but in that time the three players with the most big misses are Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Sergio Agüero. Maybe we need to chill out a bit about the missing, particularly in a team evidently scoring more than enough for now.IsEl Chavo del Ochoa comedy or a tragedy? On first viewing, El Chavo is quite clearly a ridiculous comic figure. But, of course, over time, you begin to suspend your disbelief, to invest in the story, to embed yourself in the universe the writers created. He, too, grew up in poverty, was forsaken and ridiculed, and yet despite spending most of his time in a barrel has made himself a viable life, a reason to get up in the morning, a network of friends. For all the mishaps and chaos, the bonds between them endure.The real business of any football club is not the pursuit of numbers but the pursuit of memories. Divock Origi is still remembered fondly for the big goals he scored and Sunday’s final offers a similar chance for Núñez to write himself into the club’s folklore. He may have been signed on his numbers, but will bequeath only memories. His Liverpool future may well be beyond his control. But his legacy is not.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

England may have done all they could to put France under some pressure – and Scotland went on to exert a bit more, testing France as few others can – butLes Bleuscan play rugby any which way. They ran through the full gamut in the third quarter, blasting and slashing Scotland with equal facility to take the game away from the visitors and the championship from everyone else.They are worth it and then some. The Stade de France rang out euphorically, as its darlings returned home after three matches on the road.It was the first of those– in London – that cost France the grand slam they were surely good for. Carelessness blighted their every genius move against England that day, and we wondered if they had it in them, despite it all. But they have been unplayable since and claim a first title since 2022.France 35-16 Scotland: Six Nations 2025 – live reactionRead moreRecords were collected along the way. Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored his eighth try of thisSix Nations, a record. France surpassed the 29 tries England scored in 2001 to set a collective try-scoring record too.Scotland were the perfect foils. These two have been the best teams to watch this championship. Scotland lack France’s power but they can weave all the same patterns – and here they did again. France looked rattled for around 45 minutes. England dared to dream. A lot of the old questions regarding their temperament bubbled up for a few minutes, only to be answered in such decisive fashion.That France went in at the break ahead owed as much to the grace of the gods as it did to their own prowess. Scotland thought they had scored their second try, the game’s third, on the stroke of half-time. A brilliant counter by the full-back of the tournament, Blair Kinghorn, set up the position from which Finn Russell, in his best matador form, switched play to the right to put over Tom Jordan.That would have earned Scotland an 18-16 lead, with the conversion to come, but the television match official advised the referee that Kinghorn’s elbow had clipped the touchline as he offloaded. The try was chalked off without further consultation, and France retained their narrow lead.View image in fullscreenDave Cherry and Peato Mauvaka clash after the France hooker was only given a yellow card following an incident with Ben White.Photograph: Dave Winter/Inpho/ShutterstockMore fortune had come their way earlier in the half, when Peato Mauvaka was sent to the sin-bin for a bunker review of the gratuitous way he lashed out at Ben White with the ball dead. Mauvaka had not looked as if he were trying to head-butt White, but his head did clip the Scotland scrum-half, whose reaction was disappointinglyde trop. The card stayed at yellow, because the incident was not high danger – but certainly his action represented a glaring lapse of discipline. As such, it was more deserving of a red card than every other red card we have seen this championship.France had a real match on their hands. They started with confidence, coaxing a yellow card for Jamie Ritchie, who was sent to the bin early for dragging down an advancing lineout and drive. France capitalised a few minutes later, when Thomas Ramos turned the ball inside to Gaël Fickou, who sent Yoram Moefana to the line to open up a 10-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russell’s long ball found Huw Jones, who danced down the right. Moments later, Russell expertly changed direction close to the ruck to find Darcy Graham on his inside shoulder. Scotland’s deadly winger hared between multiple pairs of clutching hands to the line.Russell levelled with five minutes to half-time, when he landed his second penalty. Jean-Baptiste Gros received yellow this time for a high tackle during more inventive Scottish attack. But Ramos converted his third penalty with two to go for the lead that Jordan’s disallowed try would not overturn.France made their move in the third quarter. First by the rapier – albeit thrust into their hand by the opposition – and then by the bludgeon.View image in fullscreenLouis Bielle-Biarrey scores France’s second try.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/ReutersScotland came out of the break looking as dangerous as ever, when Russell and Graham tried one switch too many. The ball went to floor, and Romain Ntamack was way. Bielle-Biarrey, who else, appeared on his shoulder to run the ball home for his Six Nations record.So much for the rapier. In the few minutes that followed, on came six of the seven forwards France keep on their bench. On came enormous pressure.France sent a penalty to touch and drove deep into Scotland’s 22. After the next penalty went to the right corner, those forwards drove to the brink, before allowing the rapier-types thecoup de grace. Damian Penaud’s pass found Ramos and France’s full-back added a try to all those other points he has been accruing for a record of his own. Here he passed Frédéric Michalak as France’s top point-scorer.More pertinently, France suddenly had a 14-point lead, which became more or less unassailable when Bielle-Biarrey’s footwork paved the way for a second try for Moefana, France’s fourth. That was the bonus point sewn up. That was the championship too.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025The ObserverFrance rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Their tutor was a former England international and one of the finest midfielders to have worn black and white stripes.“Rob Lee was the last player to score at Wembley for Newcastle,” says Guimarães. “So, when we met, I touched Rob’s feet to give me a little bit of luck.”Eddie Howe holds emotion as he seeks to end Newcastle’s 70-year droughtRead moreBy now the Brazil midfielder is proving so charmingly engaging that no one quite has the heart to tell Newcastle’s captain that Lee scored the goal in question with his head. It arrived in 2000 and was an equaliser in an FA Cup semi-final Chelsea proceeded to win 2-1.Lee, twice a losing FA Cup finalist with Newcastle in the late 90s, is 59 now and will be at Wembley to cheer on his old team on with his son and grandson. Guimarães hopes they will depart having seen Newcastle end a domestic trophy drought stretching back to 1955 when Jackie Milburn scored Newcastle’s opening goal in a 3-1 FA Cup final triumph against Manchester City.“Seventy years is too much to wait,” says Guimarães, who describes the meeting with Liverpool as “our World Cup final”. “Hopefully we can finally bring a trophy back to Newcastle. We just want to make thousands and thousands of Geordies happy.”Guimarães and his teammates said much the same two years ago but they failed to rise to the Wembley occasion asManchester United cantered to a comfortable 2-0 League Cup victory. This time Guimarães senses it will be different.“Now I’ve got normal hair so I can, maybe, be more lucky,” he says, stroking a hand through a fashionable dark close crop after a dalliance with the bleached blond look of the 2023 final. “But the hair colour’s my choice, not Eddie Howe’s.”Critics of Howe’s decision to make the 27-year-old Newcastle’s captain certainly had reason to revise such opinions as his high-wattage charisma defied the manager’s aim of keeping Wembley preparations understatedly low key. No matter that Liverpool are England’s champions elect and Mohamed Salah has scored 13 times in 14 games against teams managed by Howe, Guimarães’s sheer positivity seems almost elemental.“We see this as a big opportunity to make history for this club,” he says. “At our best we’re a really great team. We’re not seeing Sunday as pressure, we’re seeing it as a privilege.”View image in fullscreenNewcastle United’s Bruno Guimarães (left) sports his blond look during the 2023 Carabao Cup final at Wembley.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockEyebrows were raised in January 2022 when he walked into a relegation fight after arriving from Lyon for £35m. At the time he had widely been expected to join Arsenal but swiftly endeared himself to a new public by declaring that he regarded Newcastle as “definitely bigger” than the north London club.Back then, an interpreter helped Guimarães explain that the club’s Saudi Arabian owners had sold him their idea of a “project” involving the ultimate collection of the Champions League trophy. For the moment, though, any silverware will do.“We know if we win this one it’s going to be massive for the city, massive for the project,” says Guimarães. “The most difficult step is always the first one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I see this as my best opportunity. It’ll be a very difficult game but we’re on it, our confidence is very high. On our day we can beat any team in the world.”He feels infinitely older and wiser than two years ago when he burst into tears at the final whistle. “Against Man Utd we were really average,” he says. “Now we’re in a much better moment.”Guimarães’s relocation to a No 8 role after Sandro Tonali switched to the 6 position has ­amplified his attacking instincts, not to mention helped Sweden’s Alexander Isak score 22 goals this season. Isak waxes­lyrical about his captain’s ­contribution.“Bruno was always amazing but he’s taken further steps forward as a player and a leader,” he says. “The games he controls, we ­usually win.He’s the heart of the team and it’s nice he’s become an 8 because he’s closer to me on the field. I love to play with Bruno. As a captain, his passion for this club and for football is contagious. It gives us all energy.”Salah has spoken of how he channels his emotions through an amalgam of meditation, yoga and visualisation exercises, and Guimarães is a big fan of the last of these.“I’ve visualised walking up the Wembley steps to collect the trophy,” he says a smile. “I’ve done that many times. I’m always emotional but I want to be happy at the end. We want everything to be amazing this time.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedThe ObserverCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not a change of manager from Manchester City, not a sublime individual goal from Aoba Fujino and not even the sand on the pitch. The Frenchwoman is unbeaten as Chelsea manager after 28 games and has secured the first of a potential quadruple this season.Chelsea’s 26th victory of the season was played on a surface their midfielder Erin Cuthbert told the BBC was not fit for a final and Bompastor, who clearly had higher hopes for the facilities in her first experience of a final in English football, agreed. “That’s a bit of a shame to have this pitch for a final, especially in England where you expect to have the best pitches in the world,” she said. “I’m not sure if it was a men’s final it would be the same.”Chelsea v Manchester City: Women’s League Cup final – liveRead moreThis was the 14th edition of the modern-day Women’s League Cup final and the first final, staged just down the road at Burton Albion’s supposedly inferior Pirelli Stadium, was played on a significantly better quality surface. Rachel Brown-Finnis, the former England goalkeeper who is now a TV pundit, called the surface substandard.Derby directed inquiries towards Women’s Professional Leagues Limited, whose stance appeared to be that they had identified a venue that would have the appropriate resources to produce a high standard of pitch.Nick Cushing clearly had no intention of using it as an excuse for Manchester City’s defeat, the interim head coach saying he thought the surface would be better at their own Joie Stadium on Wednesday. The two sides meet in the second of an unusual run of four consecutive games against each another.Cushing was taking charge of his first game back at the clubfive days after the sacking of Gareth Taylorand City did cause Chelsea plenty of problems. At multiple points in the first half especially, Chelsea were under the cosh as crosses bombarded their penalty area.But Yui Hasegawa inadvertently hooked into her own net 13 minutes from time when trying to deal with Mayra Ramírez’s right-wing cross and that decided the contest. This was after a superb, swerving strike from Hasegawa’s Japan teammate Fujino, which had Hannah Hampton well beaten at her near post, brought City level in the second half.Ramírez, a handful throughout, opened the scoring early in the first half when she broke clear on the counterattack and was able to score on the rebound after her initial strike was saved by Ayaka Yamashita. The Colombian had a glorious chance to make it 2-0 but fired wide after rounding the goalkeeper in a first half that required Chelsea to produce gutsy, last-ditch defending.View image in fullscreenAoba Fujino brings Manchester City level in the second half.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersIn the second half, Hampton produced a fine save to thwart Khadija Shaw in a one-on-one and held on to a left-foot Vivianne Miedema effort but despite Chelsea not being at their best they still maintained their winning habits.“The performance was maybe not a great one but we found a way to win the game,” Bompastor said. “I know this team has more than what we showed today.”Regardless of whether or not this was a pretty Chelsea display, Lucy Bronze’s strength was evident throughout and the England right-back was crucial to the move that led to the winning goal, battling down the right before the deadly cross was supplied by Ramírez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m always confident. I am a master. I find positivity in ­everything. I know it will be difficult. Bernardo [Silva was injured] today, Ederson is injured again. Many things happen and we know it. Nine games, nine finals.”He was baffled at Jérémy Doku’s second-half booking by Simon Hooper for diving when the winger leaped over Jan Paul van Hecke to avoid being cleaned out. Guardiola said: “He doesn’t jump, he can break his leg. Jeremy is not a diving player. I said to the referee that if he doesn’t jump he can be kicked hard.”Fabian Hürzeler illustrated his mentality by downplaying what was a first Brighton point at the Etihad Stadium. “It is a fact,” the manager said. “But more is a disappointing feeling that we didn’t go home with three points. It is about chasing performance, getting to the next level. We showed an impressive performance, played our style and showed we can compete with any team in the league.”In a rollercoaster finish, host and visitor went close to snatching all three points. Nico González’s header smacked off Bart Verbruggen’s left post, then Carlos Baleba skied over with Stefan Ortega’s goal gaping.

When Haaland weaved into position to unload, Diego Gómez flew back to execute a slide-tackle that needed to be precise.As was Pervis Estupiñán’s equaliser. To the right of City’s D, the left-back struck a howitzer of a free-kick that ranged low, pinballing off the left post, Ortega a statue when he should have dived at least.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola speaks of how his unit is built for passes, but countless times these have been misplaced, as when Ortega’s hoof went straight to Brighton. Better geometry showed when Savinho and Marmoush exchanged measured balls and the Brazilian raced at Verbruggen’s goal. But, as he pulled the trigger, Van Hecke sprinted over and the attempt ballooned wide.Ilkay Gündogan was the next culprit to be imprecise, an effort being scuffed to safety. But the German compensated via a next act. González pilfered possession, tapped to Gündogan and he tapped to Marmoush. The Egyptian took a breath, then aimed a long-range finish off the left post and City led, again, with the break approaching.Seconds after, though, City’s fragility handed João Pedro a gilded opening. From a left-back zone Josko Gvardiol passed right, Rúben Dias and Abdukodir Khusanov dawdled, and João Pedro shot, narrowly missing.Khusanov was soon to find a goal, but the wrong one. At a Brighton corner from the left Webster headed on and Jack Hinshelwood stabbed at the ball: it was going wide but Khusanov somehow steered home.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverManchester CityBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Anthony Elanga constantly roamed in the pockets of space across the frontline, ultimately leading to his double in Forest’s 4-2 victory, while Callum Hudson-Odoi and Neco Williams often switched positions on the left flank.Nottingham Forest have a Champions League place within their graspRead moreBut the one constant was Morgan Gibbs-White. Captaining the side and spurred on by “England’s No 10” chants and profanities aimed at Thomas Tuchel from the away support, Gibbs-White took charge in the middle of the pitch. His assist for Forest’s fourth marked his 40th Premier League goal involvement for the club, just four shy of Ian Woan’s club record.“What they have to do is what they did today,” said Nuno of his players left out of Tuchel’s squad. “Work, play good, stay focused and humble and for sure Thomas Tuchel will take them because they are talented players that can help England.“[Gibbs-White] is experienced enough to know that in this world, there are decisions to be made. One of the things we have is the versatility of our players. Some of our midfielders can play in the wide areas but Morgan can also drop back and give us another option. Plus his ability on the ball, his vision of the game. He dictates the tempo. Huge talent.”Early on, he combined with Elanga and Hudson-Odoi to win a corner, which led to a Nicolás Domínguez chance, before winning the ball back and laying it off to Elliot Anderson, whose shot hit Chris Wood’s back as the striker tried to duck out of the way.The visitors’ first shot on target came when Gibbs-White’s cross from the right found a speeding Wood. Situated between Luke Woolfenden and Jacob Greaves, the striker was perfectly placed to score the first goal of the game, but his header landed straight in Alex Palmer’s arms.View image in fullscreenJota Silva celebrates scoring Forest’s fourth goal with Nikola Milenkovic (right) who scored the first.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersForest’s dominance was rewarded with a 35th-minute opener after a mix-up at the back led to a corner that Ipswich’s Liam Delap failed to clear. Nikola Milenkovic was the quickest to react to the resulting cross, lashing a shot straight into the roof of the net to give the visitors a deserved lead. The second came two minutes later as Elanga got the better of a retreating Greaves after receiving a crisp pass out wide from Anderson. The winger quickly cut inside to shift the ball on to his left and bend the ball into the far corner.And despite it being a sunny day, Forest proved rather quickly – as countless teams have done this season – that when it rains at Portman Road, it pours. Four minutes later, Elanga latched on to a long ball from Milenkovic. One touch with his head got the ball down, the second afforded him a yard of space before the third, a confident, slotted finish, tucked the ball under Palmer.“The first and third goals in a six-minute spell turned a stable game into an impossible task at 3-0 down at half-time,” said Kieran McKenna. “The goals and the speed in which they came took away the opportunity for us to compete. They were terrible goals [to concede].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the south-coast club with very different horizons in 2025, this was a most costly defeat.If Thomas Frank’s hopes of taking his team into Europe already relied on a collision of coefficients, coincidences and collapses then Bournemouth’s fade has come at a bad time. To repeat the pattern of their recent slide, Andoni Iraola’s team lost their early flow and were then sunk by the set-piece expertise that brought goals for Yoane Wissa and Christian Nørgaard. “Small margins,” said Iraola. “But when that’s happening in every game, we need to improve in both boxes.”Bournemouth v Brentford: Premier League – liveRead moreBournemouth’s fourth defeat in six Premier League matches was Brentford’s fifth successive away victory. Untimely for Bill Foley, Bournemouth’s highly ambitious owner, who spoke this week of planning for continental competitions. The declaration in the matchday programme that he will not stand in the way of players wanting to leave, accompanied by “we can compete salary-wise with just about anybody”, was aimed at circling Big Six vultures.“We gave it away so easily,” said Dean Huijsen, one of those key assets. “It can’t be that easy to score set pieces like that against us.”Though both teams are known for fast starts, Bournemouth began playing Total Football, Dorset style. The equally coveted Milos Kerkez, previous mullet close-cropped, tried an early shot and Huijsen strode forward from defence, his shot deflected. The home fans were soon accusing Brentford of slowing play. Not that there is a lack of grit within Bournemouth. They entered the weekend third-placed on yellow cards collected, having committed the most fouls of any Premier League team. The tactical foul is no stranger to the Vitality.Brentford, second-bottom in fouls, last for yellow cards, are committed – fully – to attack. Where earlier this season that brought supremacy at home, it is away from the Gtech that they now excel. “I like this kind of team, I enjoy playing against them,” said Wissa of the vanquished opponents. “We suffered a lot, especially in the second half.”Frank, keen to remind everyone of his own small club’s achievements, said: “I think it was the first time in a long time where it was an even game and we edged it, so I’m really pleased. This is our 50th Premier League win and there’s only 10 clubs who have done this quicker than us. That’s crazy. Taking it into consideration, our journey, our size, I think that’s a day we should be proud of.”Soft-centred defending has cost Brentford all season long. Bournemouth’s goal came easily, by Brentford’s own hand, the shoulder of Vitaly Janelt to be precise, after Antoine Semenyo had released Kerkez on the underlap to cross.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa rises to head Brentford’s opening goal.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersBrentford’s Premier League legacy has been returning set pieces to prominence. It was Keith Andrews, special-teams coach, who Wissa celebrated with after nodding his equaliser from Bryan Mbeumo’s corner. Kepa Arrizabalaga’s missed punch had played its part.“Keith is doing a very good job, the players are doing a very good job and the coaching around is very good,” said Frank. “Set pieces are crucial and they won us the game today.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were frustrations whenever Brentford blocked off passages to goal. Fatigue among a squad that has ridden out an injury crisis and the nervous energy associated with those pressures are now having a lag effect. Marcus Tavernier picking up a yellow for one of those tactical fouls when hauling back Wissa suggested mounting tension.Then came the setback that some wobbly defending had suggested was always possible. With Andrews advising, Kevin Schade launched a throw. Bournemouth defenders dithered as the ball bounced.

The noise of the crowd when Jake O’Brien cutely nodded in a late leveller against West Ham may well have been heard down at the docks and beyond, but Everton could – and perhaps should – have won it through Carlos Alcaraz.Manchester City 2-2 Brighton, Ipswich 2-4 Nottingham Forest and more: football – liveRead moreMoyes’s substitutions made a telling difference after a stodgy performance from the hosts for the best part of 70 minutes. Tomas Soucek, who had been a pillar of Moyes’s West Ham when the Scot signed him in 2020, struck a smart opener just after the hour. But from the moment the Everton manager ushered on Youssef Chermiti, Armando Broja and Tim Iroegbunam in the 79th minute, there was a blue onslaught.Some will wonder why Moyes did not take action sooner. Another five minutes and they might have won it. “The subs changed the game for us,” he said. “Tim and the two forwards gave us a new impetus at the end of the game. We’ve not had that. We found a way of getting a result, great resilience from the players.”On O’Brien, who scored the leveller at Brentford last month, he said: “He’s beginning to get a couple of goals. I’m pleased for big Jake, he’s improving. He’s a young centre-back making his way as a false right-back. It was an important goal for us.”View image in fullscreenTomas Soucek celebrates after opening the scoring for West Ham.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersMoyes stressed Everton had “no divine right” to breeze past a West Ham team largely built by him. He joked he had “spent most of their money”, but the visitors were largely as blunt as their former manager’s response, reliant on counterattacks and testing Jordan Pickford with potshots.Their principal threat was the former Moyes favourite Jarrod Bowen, who laid on the assist for Soucek’s opener and was an outlet throughout, showing why he was included in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad.For the goal, Bowen teased O’Brien on the left, although Soucek still had work to do, stepping inside and caressing the ball into the far corner.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Everton wobbled for a moment, with Pickford scrambling to save from Bowen and Soucek again just seconds after the opener. Then came the inevitable Goodison roar and the changes from Moyes to set up a grandstand finish.West Ham retreated too deep. The equaliser seemed like it was coming long before O’Brien nodded in from Idrissa Gueye’s volleyed cross. Alphonse Areola parried away Chermiti’s shot but Everton maintained the pressure. Gueye’s ball was begging to be headed home and O’Brien supplied the decisive touch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should not matter too much in the scheme of things, this draw keeping Everton and West Ham level on 34 points, 17 clear of the drop zone and indisputably safe. Both managers will feel their team can climb the table next season.“We did a lot well, we restricted Everton to not too much and played well in the second half,” said Graham Potter. “But at the same time when you’re 1-0 up at Everton with the atmosphere here, you feel the pressure.“Our performance quietened things down, but the crowd are always in the game. As an away ground it’s as tough as it gets when the crowd are up and at you.”Everton and West Ham have more in common than many may care to admit. In 2016, the Hammers left a crumbling historic ground for a shiny new ­stadium and (eventually) enjoyed a renaissance, its apexthe 2023 Europa Conference League successmasterminded by Moyes.Whether Everton can ever write such a fairytale at their new home remains to be seen.

I’m feeling this with my heart and it’s a project I want to take with both hands.”The early signs suggested it could be Southampton’s day as they looked to claim their first victory since 1 February when they beat their fellow strugglers Ipswich. Lesley Ugochukwu drove into space and laid the ball off to Joe Aribo but the midfielder blazed his shot from the edge of the area over the crossbar.Typical of their season, any positives were outweighed by poor defending as Southampton fell behind. The Wolves winger Jean‑Ricner Bellegarde was allowed all the time in the world to whip a cross on to the head of Strand Larsen and he nodded past Aaron Ramsdale from close range to open the scoring after 19 minutes.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen strikes his second goal of the afternoon.Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty ImagesPereira, who was full of praise for the Norwegian striker, said: “In the last game he didn’t perform at this level because he got an injury. He broke a bone in his hand two days before Everton but he told us he wanted to try. For a striker it’s impossible to do work with a broken hand.“Today, one week after, he adapted, he didn’t have the same pain as the Everton game, he’s a player with a strong personality and he proved that he’s a team player and he has quality. It was not only the goals, for me he worked defensively and offensively.”Ivan Juric’s decision to replace the midfielder Mateus Fernandes at half-time prompted boos and chants of “You don’t know what you’re doing” from the home crowd, before Strand Larsen doubled Wolves’ lead early in the second half. The towering forward Onuachu was beaten in the air by Emmanuel Agbadou and, after a few simple forward passes, the ball found its way to the unmarked Wolves striker on the edge of the box and he drilled his shot into the bottom‑left corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farke considered starting with the defensive midfielder Ilia Gruev but instead opted for a more attacking approach, which backfired as goals from Koki Saito and Steve Cook put Rangers, who had lost their previous four matches, into a surprise lead.Morgan Fox’s own goal gave the visitors a much-needed boost before the interval and Jayden Bogle equalised soon after the restart. QPR ended the match with 10 men after Saito was sent off in stoppage time for a studs-up challenge on Dan James.Farke said: “I’m a bit unhappy with myself because I thought, until the early hours in the morning, to bring Ilia Gruev in. But I was a bit too greedy and wanted to dominate the game. This was the problem in the first 25 or 30 minutes. The goals were too cheap. And then when you’re 2-0 down you don’t need to bring on more defensive awareness, you need to take some risks.”Burnleymoved second with a comfortable 2-0 victory atSwansea. The result never looked in doubt from the moment skipper Josh Brownhill tapped home an easy opener inside four minutes and then played a part in his side’s second midway through the first half, which was scored by Jaidon Anthony.

It’s never a penalty in a million years and I do not get it,” said Robins. “He [Josh Coburn] attaches himself to our player, threads his arm through our player’s arm, grabs him, rolls, drags him down with him and then he [the referee] has got a decision to make, but the decision isn’t a decision.”Siriki Dembele struck eight minutes from time to giveOxforda crucial 1-0 victory over 10-manWatfordand their first win in 10 league matches. The winger fired home right-footed from 10 yards after referee Bobby Madley played a good advantage when Mark Harris was fouled. It was Dembele’s first goal for the club and came just three minutes after Watford had James Abankwah sent off for a second bookable offence when he fouled Przemy Placheta.Stefan Thordarson scored just his second goal of the season to earnPrestona late 2-1 victory overPortsmouth. The 26-year-old showed impressive footwork to net the winner in the 87th minute of a game that only really burst into life in the latter stages. Ryan Porteous struck his first goal for Preston in the 76th minute before Colby Bishop equalised with his second goal in three matches.At the bottom of the table,Plymouthcame from 2-0 down against fellow strugglersDerby, only for Marcus Harness to win it for the Rams with two minutes to go. Harness’s second of the game came from a move he started and finished in the 88th minute, passing the ball out wide to Elder on the left, who crossed for Harness to touch home.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipThe ObserverLeeds UnitedQPRMillwallStoke CityBurnleySwansea CitynewsShareReuse this content"

The champions Bayer Leverkusen, who are in second place, have a game in hand and travel to face Stuttgart on Sunday.Vincent Kompany’s Bayern began on the front foot and set up camp in Union’s half but the hosts were compact in defence and largely limited their opponents to long-range efforts.Serge Gnabry had Bayern’s best chance of the goalless first half in stoppage time when Michael Olise played him through on goal, but his shot from a tight angle was kept out by Frederik Rønnow.Bayern kept probing after the interval, with Jamal Musiala and Harry Kane fluffing their lines from promising positions, before the substitute Leroy Sané finally broke the deadlock in the 75th minute when he fired in Olise’s cutback.For all their early dominance, Bayern’s lead lasted just eight minutes. Union, who had been content to sit back and absorb pressure for much of the match, made a double change as they sought an equaliser and were able to catch Bayern off guard.Josip Juranovic floated a cross into the penalty area and Urbig, who was deputising for Manuel Neuer and Daniel Peretz, both out injured, could manage only a weak punch on the ball which was headed in by the former Bayern academy player Hollerbach.Borussia Dortmundshould have scored three or four goals in their 2-0 loss atRB Leipzig, their coach, Niko Kovac, said after his team slumped to defeat despite having 25 shots.Xavi Simons and Lois Openda scored to give Leipzig a 2-0 lead but Dortmund did their best to fight their way back into the contest and had several chances to score in the second half.

Peato Mauvaka was shown a yellow card midway through the first half for making head-to-head contact with Ben White, following his deliberate lunge at the Scotland scrum-half after play had stopped.The incident was referred for a bunker review, which came back with the finding the contact had not been dangerous. Thus, the card remained at yellow, and Mauvaka returned to the field after 10 minutes in the sin bin.France win Six Nations title after Moefana’s double sinks ScotlandRead more“The decision not to raise it to a red card was because there was not excessive force,” said Townsend. “I’m not sure that is the criterion for a non-tackle incident. That was clearly not a tackle incident. It was after the whistle. So if there was head contact and that was intentional, it shouldn’t really have anything to do with the force.”The new 20-minute red card is meant to be reserved for technical offences generally in the tackle situation, where there is clearly no intent to harm. This incident did not qualify as such, so Townsend felt the referee ought to have issued a straight red himself. Once he had referred the incident to the bunker, the only option for upgrade was to a 20-minute red, which is not meant to apply to deliberate acts after play has stopped.“It was after the play. I feel sorry for Ben White, because he did nothing. He was pushed to ground, then he got collided in the head. I don’t know how it wasn’t raised to red. Whether that had anything to do with the final result, who knows. France are a quality side and deserved champions. They were the better side in the end. But I think [the bunker review system] gives referees an out. We’ve taken decision-making away from referees. That’s the process we have now to speed up the game, but you don’t want to miss incidents that are clearly red cards.”Townsend’s captain, Rory Darge, agreed that the incident looked like a red card in the moment, but both were adamant France deserved their win. Fabien Galthié, their coach, had been furious the weekend before about what he saw as foul play by Ireland, resulting in the loss of Antoine Dupont to serious injury. But Galthié was in jubilant mood.“I’m relieved,” he said. “We’re happy because we won. That was the goal. We achieved it, so the first feeling is happiness and joy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Borthwick says his team are developing fast and also backed his skipper, Maro Itoje, as a potential Lions captain.Andy Farrell will not unveil his Lions squad until early May but Borthwick hopes England’s 10-try display has given the former some “good headaches” as he seeks the best mix of talent to face the Wallabies in a three-Test series in July and August.Unflappable Maro Itoje proves he now deserves Lions captaincy | Gerard MeagherRead moreBorthwick was understandably delighted with the performance against Wales and the progression of his squad during the championship. “The team has stuck with the process and I’m really pleased for the players and supporters that they’re seeing the fruits of their labours on the pitch. The next thing for these players is that hopefully lots of them will get picked for the Lions.“I think the players have probably created some good headaches for Andy. They’re the kind of headaches you want to have as a coach. Lots of players putting their hands up and showing they should be on that plane with the Lions. A lot of our role is to get as many of these players on that plane as possible. Hopefully there will be a lot of England players heading down under in a few months’ time.”Borthwick also clearly believes Itoje would make an excellent Lions skipper. “I think Maro’s been absolutely outstanding. He leads by example and he’s stepped up his game. He’s improved in many areas in this campaign. I’d be fully confident in Maro to lead the Lions should Andy ask him.”Itoje preferred to salute his teammates following England’s lop-sided victory. “We have been building towards this and we are showing a different side to us. You have to be consistent even when results do not go your way, no matter the outside noise and scrutiny. The challenge for our team is to grow and get better.”Among England’s other stand‑out players in this tournament has been Ben Curry, who was named player of the match in Cardiff. “This is what you dream of,” said Curry, who started alongside his twin brother, Tom. “I have not had too many opportunities over the last couple of years and I love being a part of this team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Little things went against us and that probably opened up some wounds.“They’re a good group of lads and there are some really good players in the room as well.

He was headed toward a Tesla showroom in Salem, and his cart appeared to be loaded with molotov cocktails, according to court documents. One by one, he took out the handmade explosives, lit them on fire and lobbed them at the glass-walled dealership.By the time Salem police arrived, the showroom window was shattered, a fire was burning on the sidewalk out front, a nearbyTeslasedan was ablaze and the alleged vandal had fled. The whole scene was caught by security footage, according to an affidavit from a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The showroom’s general manager estimated $500,000 in damages, with seven vehicles struck and one completely destroyed.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Bullet holes left in the window of Tesla DealershipBottom: A damaged Tesla dealershipPhotograph: Salem Police DepartmentThe vandalism incident is one of dozens to hit Tesla dealerships, cars and the electric vehicle maker’s charging stations across the country since Trump took office. Many bear explicit messages protesting againstElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and a senior adviser to the president. Musk is the head of the unofficial so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and has made it his prerogative to overhaul the federal government – ordering the firing of tens of thousands of employees, slashing agency budgets and eliminating entire departments. His hardline approach, which takes aim at institutions including the National Weather Service, the Department of Education and the Social Security Administration, has elicited backlash and criticism nationwide.Thousands have attended peaceful protests at Tesla showrooms in cities and towns across the country. In the 54-odd days since the inauguration, those protests have grown from ahandful of people in cities like San Franciscochanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Elon Musk has got to go” to massive demonstrations across the US replete with live bands, Musk-as-Hitler costumes and heavy police presence. They have also crossed the Atlantic, with demonstrations occurring in the UK and Germany.As the protests have multiplied, so has vandalism against Tesla’s brick-and-mortar business and individual vehicles. The Guardian has tracked at least three separate incidents involving molotov cocktails, the coordinated theft of nearly 50 Tesla tires and spray-painted swastikas on Tesla facilities from New York to New Mexico. Nearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set, while dozens of owners have had their cars egged, pooped on and hit with Kraft cheese singles.Like the protests, the defacement and destruction of Tesla facilities has also gone international, with sedans and Cybertrucks targeted in at least five other countries. In France, authorities in Toulouse reported thata dozen cars were torchedat a Tesla showroom earlier this month. Another showroom in the Netherlandswas graffitiedwith slogans such as “fuck off fascist” and others that called Musk a Nazi. One vandal as far away as Tasmaniawrote“do you really want to drive a swasticar” across a dealership window.Musk and Tesla did not return requests for comment. In response to a police report of Tesla vandalism in Massachusetts, Muskposted on X, “Damaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!” Musk also reposted an interview with Valerie Costa, an organizer of the nonviolent Tesla Takedown demonstrations, andaccused herof “committing crimes”.Trump said earlier this week that he wouldlabel the violence against Tesla showroomsas domestic terrorism as he stood next to Musk in front of the White House. “I’m going to put a stop to it,” Trump said. “Because they’re harming a great American company.”View image in fullscreenTrump and Musk speak to the press from inside a Tesla on the South Portico of the White House on 11 March 2025 in Washington, DC.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesA day later, the House speaker Mike Johnson boosted the proposed designation. “Congress will investigate the sources of these attacks and help the DOJ & FBI ensure those responsible are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Johnsonposted on X, the social media platform Musk owns.Musk thanked Johnson on X, adding both a salute and American flag emoji.Hurling molotovs and firing semi-automaticsIn Salem, one month after the suspect first hurled molotov cocktails at the Tesla dealership, he returned. This time he came armed with what police believe to be a semi-automatic rifle.At around 4am, surveillance footage shows him firing multiple rounds into the empty Tesla showroom, once again shattering windows and hitting a car parked inside the building. Investigators collected bullet fragments, logged surveillance video and sent the leftover molotov cocktails to an FBI lab in Alabama for fingerprint dusting. No one was injured.ATF agents believe both incidents are linked to Salem resident Adam Lansky, who has been apprehended and charged. Lansky’s lawyer did not return a request for comment.In the small Colorado town of Loveland, police rushed to a Tesla showroom in response to a report of a fire burning by a Cybertruck on 29 January.Underneath the vehicle, they found a spent molotov cocktail.As with the Salem incident, the suspect in the Loveland case returned to the scene, according to court documents. Four days later, the word “Nazi” was spray painted on the dealership’s sign. Over the following weeks, the showroom was targeted three more times with molotov cocktails and graffiti. Lucy Grace Nelson, a resident from a nearby town, was charged for the series of incidents. Her lawyer declined to comment on the case.Police in North Charleston, South Carolina, are also investigating a vandal who threw a molotov cocktail at a Tesla charging station earlier this week, setting both it and himself on fire and forcing officials to cut the station’s power. The words “long live the Ukraine” were spray painted in red on the pavement next to the charging stations, according to theAssociated Press. The incident came after Trump rolled back US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, a move that Musk embraced.View image in fullscreenA person clad in black clothes hurling a molotov cocktail.Photograph: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF)Deliberate fires have also been set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations throughout the US without molotovs. Earlier this month, in Littleton, Massachusetts, seven Tesla charging stations were set ablaze in one night,according to CBS. Police found the first station thick with dark smoke and flames. Fires were also set at a Tesla facility in rural New Mexico and in an electric vehicle holding lot in Seattle, Washington, this week.The Seattle fire department told the Guardian it found four Cybertrucks engulfed in flames when it arrived on the scene at around 11pm last Sunday. Local news station Komo Newsflew a drone over the wreckageand filmed one Cybertruck reduced to “little more than a charred hunk of metal”. Another was so badly burned that the windows melted, according to Komo. The Seattle police declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Salt Lake City, swastikas and the word “Nazi” were found at both a Tesla Service Center and a separate charging station, according to local police. Black swastikas were alsopainted on a charging stationin the small mountain town of Meyers in California. In Ithaca, New York, along with swastikas, “Hail Hitler” and “Tesla is Fascist” wereemblazoned on the superchargers.At a Tesla facility in Lynnwood, Washington, vandals targeted a cluster of six Cybertrucks but left other vehicles there untouched.“I observed red spray paint on each of the cyber trucks,” reads a police report from Lynnwood obtained by the Guardian. “The graffiti wrote ‘Fuck Elon’ and a multitude of swastikas were spray painted onto the body panels of the vehicles.”Egged, spray painted and pooped onSome vandals have opted for incapacitating Musk’s cars rather than destroying them. In League City, Texas, 44 wheels were stolen off cars in an overflow parking lot for a Tesla dealership. The lot was hit on two separate occasions, with a total of 13 vehicles damaged. Jose Ortega, a spokesman for the League City police, said the case is inactive due to a lack of leads. Nearby surveillance cameras weren’t recording and “the cameras on the Teslas were not active since they were powered off”, Ortega said.Much of the vandalism targeting Teslas involves minor, less destructive methods than molotov cocktails and spray paint. Tesla owners around the country have had their cars plastered with anti-Musk stickers and flyers, as well as hit with eggs and dog feces.The owner of a golden Cybertruck in Southborough, Massachusetts, discovered that someone had put a “Nazis fuck off” sticker on his bumper last month, hetold local media. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, police in Brooklinearresteda 39-year-old man earlier this month and charged him with six counts of defacing property over allegedly putting stickers depicting Musk giving a fascist-style salute on people’s cars.Other Tesla drivers have seen their vehicles pelted with foodstuffs, including a Maryland woman whotold the Washington Postthat her car was hit with around a dozen eggs while she was driving home. In Dallas, Texas, a man had Kraft singlesthrown at his Tesla.Vandalism incidents can turn into viral social media content, likea post on X, viewed 25m times, that showed a Cybertruck in Brooklyn, New York, covered in broken eggs and dog feces. OneTikTokthat received over 700,000 views showed a man weaponizing the administrative state against a Tesla vehicle: he called a parking attendant when he saw a Cybertruck allegedly parked in a loading zone in hopes of getting it ticketed or towed.Tesla owners turn against Musk: ‘I’m embarrassed driving this car around’Read moreThe fears of vandalism and questions over what to do about their car’s association with Musk have become hot topics of discussion in online communities dedicated to Tesla. A thread started last month about “dealing with anti-Tesla sentiment” on Tesla Motors Club, an independent online forum for Tesla owners, received over 400 replies until it was closed to further posts. Bumper stickers that state “I bought this before Elon went crazy” are now widely available online and have been spotted on Teslas around the country. Other social media posts show people trying to disguise their Teslas bychanging their hood and bumper ornamentsto mimic brands like Honda or Toyota. Some Tesla owners areselling their vehicles at a lossto rid themselves of the stigma.Police have also been seen guarding Cybertrucks and dealerships during demonstrations. A widelyshared TikTok videotaken last week during the New York City Women’s March showed a group of New York police department officers surrounding a Cybertruck parked on the street while a protester held a “no to Tesla” sign up behind them. Crowds at a Mardi Gras celebration earlier this month in New Orleansbooed a Cybertruckand hurled beads at its windows, forcing it off a parade route as police attempted to shield it from harm.The wave of vandalism doesn’t seem to be ebbing. Back in Loveland, Colorado, almost two weeks after Nelson was arrested for lobbing molotov cocktails at the Tesla showroom, the same facility was targeted on 7 March, just after midnight.Using an incendiary device, someone ignited a fire between two Teslas and threw rocks at the showroom – breaking windows and damaging several cars. No injuries were reported and police say the incident doesn’t appear to be connected to Nelson, the prior suspect. Loveland’s police chief dubbed the act “copycat behavior”.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The image showed a boy chasing a football on a pitch. But some of the wildflowers on the grass floated without stems. Half the goal net was missing. The boy’s hands were misshapen.View image in fullscreenPhotographer Oliver Fiegel, 47, said after 18 years in the industry he can no longer earn a living from his trade alone.Photograph: Oliver Fiegel/Guardian CommunityIn previous years, many of Fiegel’s photography clients had been newspapers and magazines. But that work has dried up recently. This image, he felt, showed one reason why: “generative illustration”, the supplied caption said.Fiegel was frustrated: the use of artificial intelligence instead of a human creative symbolised how his craft, on which he had spent years training, was being undermined and erased by the advent of generative AI tools that were cheaper and quicker, he felt, though often with worse results.“AI’s had the most devastating effect on the industry,” said Fiegel, one of dozens of people who have revealed to theObserverhow the rise of generative AI tools is changing their working life – for the better or worse – amid seismic economic shifts. “It’s happening very fast.”Fiegel, who has been a photographer for about 18 years, said he could no longer make a living and had been forced to radically diversify his income streams. Now he is ­considering opening a natural wine bar instead.For advanced economies such as the UK, Germany and the US, about60% of jobs are exposed to AI, an International Monetary Fund study concluded last year, with approximately half of them potentially negatively affected. In the UK alone, AI coulddisplace up to 3m private sector jobs, according to the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, although some job losses may be offset by new roles in a changed economy.“I only know a couple of photographers who still can live off this trade,” said Fiegel. “It’s not easy – I’ve identified as a creative my whole life.”View image in fullscreenKarl Kerner, a longtime translator, said AI tools had negatively affected him.Photograph: Karl Kerner/Guardian CommunitySince 1994, Karl Kerner has worked as a translator – between English, German and Norwegian – focusing on nonfiction scientific texts. This kind of translation, he said, required specialist knowledge and careful terminology.“I am now basically out of business,” said Kerner. “This AI has come like a tsunami.”Amid the surge in AI-driven translation and editing tools in the past few years, “the number of [work] requests just dwindled”, he added.The loss of his identity has had a huge impact, said Kerner, who was born in New York and now lives in Tønsberg, Norway. “Overnight, all this linguistic culture stuff is just worthless, really. It does something to you, because that’s who you were professionally. [It’s like] somebody takes the rug from under you.”Kerner, 64, has begun working for an agriculture consultancy. “It’s not a good age to be on the job market – it wasn’t easy,” he said.But technology is also helping him with the few translation jobs he still gets. Instead of translating word by word, he can feed a text into automated translation software, then use his knowledge to weed out inaccuracies and mistranslations, drastically reducing labour time.“I’m not a technophobe – I find it fascinating,” he said.Other workers have had a more positive experience as they integrate AI into their daily work.Alexander Calvey, a self-employed locum GP in Surrey, said using an AI scribe to write up his notes had saved him time and improved their ­quality. The results mean that he is able to “focus more on the patient than the notes”.‘Do I think doctors are going to be out of a job? Not at all’: the ex-radiologist bringing AI to healthcareRead moreCalvey, who also works for a private GP provider, added that he had managed to increasethe number of patients he sees, in some cases from four to five an hour. In future, as the technology improves, Calvey feels, AI will have further uses for guiding questioning and treatment.TheChatGPTchatbot has become a sounding board for Paul, a 44-year-old university researcher on mathematics and philosophy based in Stockholm. He said the tool was helpful for summarising literature and brainstorming research questions.“It knows a little about a lot – it knows other things people have done that I have no clue about,” allowing him to research those topics in greater depth, he said.But professional work isn’t the only thing Paul uses ChatGPT for. He also uses it for personal tasks, such as offering him an analysis if he experiences a strange dream.View image in fullscreenA pencil portrait of her mother by freelance illustrator Jenny Turner, who has seen a collapse in bespoke commissions since AI.Illustration: Jenny Turner/JETurnerArt/Guardian CommunityDespite this functionality, he is worried about the amount of information that companies controlling generative AI tools learn about their users. He said he was “very concerned” about “the power of a few corporate tech giants”.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, meanwhile, has said he wants AI to be“mainlined into the veins”of the nation to boost productivity and economic growth. But this month, the TUC has called for urgent government action toprotect workers in ­creative industriesamid disruption and job loss risks.For Jenny Turner, a 33-year-old freelance illustrator in north-east England, the drop in demand for commissions has been “very sudden” and coincided with the proliferation of AI image tools. Turner previously sold work through Etsy. She would charge, for instance, about £100 for a coloured, pencil-drawn portrait. But over the last couple of years, she began to see AI-generated images below her work in the “You may also like” section, with some prices below £10.“I can no longer compete … it’s sold at a price I could never drop to,” she said. “It’s hit me really hard, made me feel sort of empty, like you’ve kind of wasted everything – it’s just upsetting, and it makes you angry.”Turner said, after drawing since childhood and studying at art college then university, she had now delisted her illustrations on Etsy and had been forced to consider other lines of work. “If that happens in everything,” she said, “how many people are not going to have jobs?”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverChatGPTChatbotsPhotographyGPsDrawingOnline shoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So what I was trying to do with this project is fix those barriers,” he said.TheVirtual Reality Public Speakingplatform employs exposure therapy – the idea that confronting fears can help reduce them – combined with breathing exercises and eye movements that help slow the heart rate and suppress the fear response.People using the technology can practise speaking in various virtual reality (VR) settings, from an empty classroom or small audiences of photorealistic figures that yawn and scratch, to a stadium of 10,000 spectators, with the option to add distractions such as flashing cameras and loud noises.Macdonald said the latter was an example of “overexposure therapy”.“The idea behind it is that this will give them extra resilience and adaptability – you can think of it like the psychological equivalent of training with weights or running with weights or at high altitudes,” he said, adding that the hope was that subsequently presenting to a smaller real life audience would feel like a “step down” by comparison.Macdonald said the platform – which incorporates learning materials, feedback mechanisms and scenarios such as job interviews – works on both Android and iOS operating systems and can be accessed through a laptop or VR headset or via a smartphone that can be inserted into a cheap mount.A recent study published by Macdonaldin the journal Frontiers in Virtual Realitysuggests the platform could be beneficial. The research involved 29 adolescents from China, who each undertook a 30-minute session in which they alternated between using the VR system and practising a simple breathing exercise, after which they delivered a prepared one-minute script in English to 34 people in real life.The percentage of students who said they were anxious public speakers fell from 65% before the experiment to 20% after the presentations, while the percentage who described themselves as confident rose from 31% to 79%. More students said they enjoyed public speaking after using the platform.Macdonald said another yet to be published study involving 18 students who did not have to subsequently give an in-person presentation revealed all participants found a week of self-guided use to be beneficial, for example in feeling more confident or better able to manage nerves.While Macdonald said further experiments with control groups and larger numbers of participants were planned, tens of thousands of people have used the platform during its development. “I don’t just want to build something that’s effective. I want to build something that can and will be used,” he said.Dr Matteo Cella, a psychologist and leader of the virtual reality lab at King’s College London, who was not involved in the work, said the platform built on the concepts of traditional exposure therapy, making it more accessible and easy to implement.But Cella said there was a potential risk overexposure could reinforce people’s avoidance of public speaking, and that robust randomised control trials were needed to evaluate the system, noting the published work did not offer many insights on its efficacy.“There is a lot of enthusiasm and problem-solving energy from digital innovators to address pressing mental health challenges in our society, but unfortunately many products have poor uptake and short lifespan due to their very rapid development and limited evidence,” he said.Dr Kim Smallman of Cardiff University also said more work was needed. “It’s promising to see open-source innovation in this space, particularly in how VR can enhance engagement and accessibility to skills development and potentially therapeutic content. However, as with any emerging technology, it’s crucial to evaluate its real-world impact, how people use it, whether it truly improves confidence and reduces anxiety, and what unintended effects might arise.”Explore more on these topicsVirtual realityAnxietyMental healthHealthInternetOnline learningnewsShareReuse this content"

And in an interview with the Guardian, Tsai said: “I hope his involvement with [Doge] is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses.”The chief investment officer and president of Tsai Capital, which reportedly manages a portfolio of about $137m, made it a point to say that his stated hope does not constitute a loss of faith in Musk or his company’s earning potential, despite opinion polls establishing the Tesla boss’s unpopularity with the American public and his net worth evidentlytumblingabout $23bn in recent days.Tsai said the stock markets also reacted negatively when Musk bought Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, in 2022 for $44bn. Yet he said Tsai Capital – which holds about 75,000 shares inTeslaas of its most recent quarterly filings – had made more than six times its money since first investing in the company in February 2020, even with the downturn in performance of late.A president touting Musk’s cars from the White House shows this: the Tesla boycott really irks him | Gaby HinsliffRead moreTsai recently told his investors ina letterthat his firm considers Tesla to be more of a creator of advanced electronics and software that it attaches to cars rather than a traditional automotive manufacturer and he insisted that the EV maker remained “on a path to become one of the most valuable companies on the planet”.Nonetheless, he said “the market … reacting unfavorably to Elon Musk’s recent involvement in politics” was real. And though he said he thought Musk’s self-professed belief that government reforms are needed was genuine, Tsai expressed a hope that the Tesla boss’s role in Doge ultimately proved to be like other temporary commitments he had previously taken on.Tsai’s comments on what is his firm’s largest holding come at a time when Musk – who prominently supported Trump’s successful run for a second presidency – has advised the White House on the widespread firings of government employees and the dismantling of various services. Those services include US humanitarian aid and development work, with experts warning that their elimination could have life-threatening consequences.If a CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS is any indication, such measures have not gone over well with the public. Thesurveyshowed 53% of Americans disapproved of Musk, and 35% approved – leaving him about 18 points underwater.Those results werereleasedon Wednesday, two days after Tesla’s stock fell more than 15% amid public protests against the company and vandalism reported at some of the brand’s dealerships.Tsai’s descent from a lineage of legendary investors sets his voice apart from some of the others who have weighed in on Musk, Doge and Tesla at the two-month mark of the second Trump presidency.His paternal grandmother was Ruth Tsai, who became the first woman to trade on the floor of the stock exchange in Shanghai, China, in 1939 during the second world war. Her earnings helped her send her son – Tsai’s father, Gerald – to college in the US, where he ultimately settled and made a name for himself as a financier and fund manager.Gerald Tsai Jr also eventually became the chief executive officer of the financial services giant Primerica, which – along with its subsidiary Commercial Credit Group – helped build Citigroup, as the New York Times hasreported.A notable aspect of Tsai’s trajectory was his father’s acquaintance with Trump when the latter was primarily a real estate mogul in Manhattan. The families were close enough that, in his youth, Tsai considered Donald Trump Jr his best friend, vacationing with him and once going to a baseball game with his siblings, their mother and their father.Tsai said the younger Trump was one of the first people to whom he came out as a gay man, doing so before he did to Gerald. “That’s cool,” Tsai recalled Trump Jr telling him, while he said Gerald took a longer time to accept it.A registered Democrat, Tsai said he had not had “a meaningful conversation with any member of” the president’s family since a lunch with Donald Jr in January 2014 – more than two years before Trump Sr clinched the Republican White House nomination and won his first presidency. Tsai said they just “went in different directions” as the Trumps moved into politics, and their family patriarch aligned himself closely with Musk as he clinched the White House a second time in November’s election.Meanwhile, the elder Tsai, who married and divorced four times and once survived crashing in a helicopter into New York’s Hudson River before his death in 2008, did not pass on much of his larger-than-life personality to Christopher.The younger Tsai for instance has been married to his spouse – with whom he is raising teenaged twins – since 2005.But, as Christopher put it, Gerald Tsai Jr did teach him to learn about – and love – trading stocks in his childhood. He began investing at 12 and started his capital firm in 1997 at age 22.Tsai said some of the principles to which he adheres – whether as a philanthropic donor to artistic as well as environmental causes – were inherited from the first Chinese American to be CEO of a Dow Jones Industrial company.“My father would say you have to do deep work in order to figure out where value is and to uncover great situations,” Tsai said. “Our job as investors is to figure out what’s real, what’s not real, what that’s worth, what’s priced into the stock and where the company’s valuation is going.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

If you can run your modem on the car, with the NBN doing fibre to the home now, you have communications, which is important because with the towers down there’s just no mobile phone reception out here.”With each battery in the two BYDs and the MG carrying 60kWh capacity – more than the 10kWh offered by a Tesla power wall – McLaughlin says these “batteries on wheels” mean they could keep the lights on for a month.His work with the RFS has only highlighted the significance of this in recent days.“On the weekend, we came across really elderly people trapped in their house: no power, trees on the driveway, no phones, no communications. They’re saying: ‘Is the power coming back on soon? All our food’s gone off,’” McLaughlin says. “So we’re doing welfare checks; we’re having to go back.”View image in fullscreenMatt McLaughlin used his electric car to help people affected by power outages in the Gold Coast hinterland in 2023.Photograph: SuppliedIt is this sort of situation that has prompted MyCar (formerly Kmart Tyre and Auto) to trial a program where EV drivers can register to help out during disaster recovery.So far more 100 people have registered with “The Chargers”, a program that, when activated, sends a text message alert to those within 250km to be on standby to help out with further details to follow.Adele Coswello, chief customer officer at MyCar, says the company coordinated with Energex and relief groups to support evacuation and community centres where needed on Thursday and Friday.“Our research showed that three-quarters of Australians have experienced a power outage as a result of natural disasters,” Coswello says. “One mother told us she felt vulnerable going to sleep because her baby monitor wasn’t working.”Though Alfred did not cause the level of destruction some feared, Hickey says the experience has made her car “that much more valuable” to her.Electric v hybrid: which vehicle should you buy in 2025?Read more“I’m gradually converting my friends,” she says. “I have a friend who [is] a chemical engineer and used to work for one of those offshore rigs and even he’s in the pre-contemplation phase of having the next car be an EV.”Any doubts she may have had about going electric are gone, she says, and she’s now thinking about long-term plans for swapping out their gas cooker for induction, a battery for their home solar panels as insurance, and potentially, electric hot water.“It’s so amazing,” she says. “Next time I might try other things, see how far we can push the canary by plugging in things like the washing machine.”Explore more on these topicsTropical Cyclone AlfredQueenslandElectric vehiclesMotoringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Already, it had been a trying few days for the world’s richest man, who was facing aTeslastock selloff and fierce backlashover his attempts to radically overhaul the federal government. His net worthdeclined over $22bnon Monday alone.After Musk jokingly brushed off initial questions about the mounting pressure, host Larry Kudlow asked the Tesla andSpaceXCEO how he was managing to run his numerous companies amid the chaos.“With great difficulty,” Musk answered, at first chuckling then taking a long sigh and staring off into the middle distance. “I mean … yeah”.‘Major brand worries’: Just how toxic is Elon Musk for Tesla?Read moreThe past 10 days have marked several of the most significant setbacks for Musk in months. Tesla, arguably his marquee company, continued to fall in value as investors worried about thethreat of trade warandpossible recession– as well as declining profits. Escalating protests against the company over the billionaire’s role in the government also grew in number and intensity across the US, coupled with rising cases of vandalism andsocial stigmaagainst his cars. SpaceX has also struggled, with one of its rocketsdramatically explodingin midflight last week and then an announcement on Wednesday that it wasdelaying a rescue missionto retrieve “stranded” astronauts. The companytried againtwo days later.Adding to Musk’s headaches, his social media platform, X, experiencedwidespread outages throughout the dayon Monday. During his Fox Business interview, he claimed that it was the result of a “massive cyberattack” that the company had traced to the area of Ukraine.Musk is also dealing with increasing pushback over his role at Doge. Multiple outlets reported that the “first buddy”, as he’s christened himself, gotinto a heated exchangewithMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, during a White House meeting last week, which ended withDonald Trumpappearing to rein in Musk’s power to make staffing decisions at government agencies with aTruth social post. A federal judge in California alsoissued a preliminary injunctionon Thursday to reinstate thousands of the workers that Doge mass fired. Meanwhile, polling this week from Quinnipiac University shows that despite Musk repeatedly declaring that the public loves what Doge is doing, astrong majorityof people disapprove of his initiative.After a long string of victories for Musk that included soaring share prices and a period of seemingly unchecked power following Trump’s inauguration, some signs of strain are beginning to show on his grip on his empire. He has lost around $119bn this year so far, although staggeringly still boasts a fortune $100bn greater than the next richest man in the world, and facesquestions from investorson whether his political activity ishurting his companies.Rather than step away from his role in the White House, however, Musk appears to be doubling down.Musk turns to Maga world to turn Tesla’s fortunes aroundTwo days after his labored appearance on Fox Business, Musk was once again in front of the cameras. This time, he was smiling alongside Trump on the White House lawn as thepresident cooed overa new red Tesla Model S and gushed to reporters about what a wonderful car it was.“Everything is computer,” Trump said, sitting in the driver’s seat. “That’s beautiful!”At the climax of the transformation of the White House into a car dealership, Trump announced that he had bought the Model S. He likewise spoke out in support of Musk and told reporters that Americans should “cherish” the billionaire. Others in the Maga world soon followed suit, declaring their backing forTeslaand urging their followers to do the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the display also gave the impression that Musk needed Trump to reverse his string of losses and quell the backlash against him. Trump stated at the event that he would label demonstrations against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism. Attorney general Pam Bondiannounced on Fridayshe would launch an investigation into vandalism targeting the company.“They fought the law and the law won,” Musk posted on X above news that Bondi was threatening vandals with up to 20 years in prison forattacking Tesla dealerships.The backlash against Tesla does not appear to be slowing; more protests against Tesla are set for the coming week. In response, Musk is deepening his embrace with the Maga world, including its most distasteful denizens. He spent a sizable part of Friday afternoon posting support for Tesla and Doge from rightwing media influencer accounts and Fox News clips. At one point, he retweeted a post that compared attacks against Tesla vehicles and dealerships to Kristallnacht, the infamous Nazi pogrom against Jewish-owned businesses that took place at the onset of the Holocaust.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationTeslaSpaceXDonald TrumpXUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Peace at any price is no peace at allSat 15 Mar 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 13.43 EDTShareAhalt to the killing in Ukraine is a highly desirable aim. A permanent end to the war would be a truly wonderful achievement. Who would not welcome an agreement that stopped Russia’s daily slaughter of civilians and its destruction of Ukraine’s cities, and which allowed millions of displaced people to return home? But peace at any price is no peace at all, as history shows and we have repeatedly argued here. In his untutored haste, Donald Trump risks rushing into abad deal with Vladimir Putinthat could set the stage for renewed conflict in Ukraine and other vulnerable countries bordering Russia and for an overall weakening of Europe’s security.The initial 30-day truce under discussion by US and Russian officials reportedly entails a complete halt to fighting and temporary freezing of the frontlines in eastern Ukraine. It provides for the exchange of prisoners of war, release of civilian detainees and return from Russia of abducted Ukrainian children. The truce could be extended. But Russia’s president is adamant that, before it even begins, many complex, longer-term issues must be addressed, including the most fundamental:Ukraine’s future as an independent, sovereign state.This attempt by Putin to set highly problematic conditions must be firmly resisted by Trump and western leaders. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, it is a transparent bid to delay and manipulate the negotiations and win broader concessions, while allowing Moscow’s forces time to pursue battlefield gains, notably in Russia’s contested Kursk region. It is not reasonable to insist on a halt to military aid to Kyiv during a truce. Putin’s demand that the historical “root causes” of the conflict be examined is acynical trap, set to gain wider advantage.Putin’s tactics are familiar. He raises hopes of a breakthrough, then finds reasons why it must remain elusive. He lies about the situation at the front, as in his false claim that Ukrainian troops are encircled in Kursk. He flatters and plays Trump like a fish on a line, congratulating him for “doing everything” for peace and exploiting the US president’s ego-driven need to keep his promise to end the war. Putin is brutally clear about his war aims: a neutral, disarmed Ukraine led by a Moscow-friendly government. His wider objective is an end to international ostracism, the lifting of sanctions and a remaking of Europe’s security architecture to suit his post-Soviet vision. All this to be achieved by a dramatic reset in US-Russia relations, as gaily offered, inexplicably, by hisfriend in the White House.Trump should remember this war would end today if Putin wished. He should understand Putin does not want peace, he wants victoryBefore making more unforced concessions, Trump should study this threatening agenda. He should remember this war would end today if Putin wished. He should understand Putin does not want peace, he wants victory. He should stop regurgitating Russian propaganda. Most of all, he should stop bullying Zelenskyy and start applying substantial, painful pressure onRussiato stop and reverse its illegal, unjustified invasion. The fact that Trump is unlikely to do any of this goes to the heart of the problems surrounding the talks. For all his self-important bluster and insincere compassion, the “master dealmaker” does not have a plan extending beyond an immediate halt to the gunfire. Putin certainly does.Trump’s optimism that a good agreement can be reached has little basis in fact. Keir Starmer, at least, is aware of this. He says Putin is not serious about peace and should stop “playing games”. The prime minister’s latest attempt to rally European and other allies around a ceasefire deal backed by credible, in-theatre security guarantees is worthwhile. He spent Saturday discussing his “coalition of the willing” proposal via video conference.But Starmer surely knows that Trump’s mishandling of the negotiations so far, his daily attempts to win personal credit for imaginary progress, his persistent exclusion of the Ukrainians and his biased pressurising of Kyiv but not Moscow is unlikely to end well. No peacekeeping force, whether under a Nato, EU or UN flag, can be deployed inUkrainewithout viable security guarantees, principally from the US – which Trump withholds. Nor can it happen without Putin’s agreement – and he is vehemently opposed.The evident danger for Britain and Europe is that they may be strong-armed by Washington into endorsing and policing a flawed, short-term ceasefire cooked up by Trump and Putin that does not serve, and potentially undermines, their long-term objective: securing a free, sovereign Ukraine and imposing a cautionary defeat on Russian aggression. Putin says he and Trump will talk again by phone. Who knows what Trump will give away next in his hurry to claim the mantle of Nobel peacemaker, shaft his old foe Zelenskyy andappease his ex-KGB chum?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has already dashed its Nato membership hopes. He has already cut military aid and intelligence assistance once, refused to guarantee the peace and publicly shamed Zelenskyy in front of the world. And if a ceasefire fails to materialise, even in lopsided form, it’s a safe bet Trump will find a way to blame Kyiv. This man is no honest broker. He is no friend to Ukraine or Europe. Like Putin, he cannot be trusted to build or honour a just and lasting peace. A truce, on fair and reasonable terms that Kyiv can freely accept and that can be adequately monitored and effectively enforced, would be a wonderful first step. In its absence, Ukraine must fight on and Britain, as ever, must support it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s not a shred of ambiguity about thatSat 15 Mar 2025 13.07 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 13.42 EDTShareIn diplomacy, focus is often on where we disagree. But Britain and our partners are stronger when we stand together. Last week’sG7 meeting made that clear.We arrived in Canada with real momentum. Our Ukrainian and American friends deserve a lot of credit for the breakthrough at Jeddah – with British diplomacy, from the prime minister down, making a big difference behind the scenes.With presidential envoy Steve Witkoff touching down in Moscow as we met in Quebec, it was crucial that Ukraine’s allies showed unity.Some may have doubted we could find common ground. But after 36 hours of talks, we agreed a clear set of messages – for Moscow, but also for Tehran and Pyongyang.We united in wanting a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, with Ukraine remaining democratic, free, strong and prosperous. We want to see the fighting stop, and for that to endure.We united in supporting a 30-day ceasefire on air, land and sea ­without conditions. We want to use this as a window to agree terms ensuring a just and lasting peace.And we united on what is required to make this happen. As President Trump has said, Putin can choose the easy way or the hard way. We all recognise the risk that Russia tries to string this process out with unreasonable conditions, while continuing to pummel Ukraine. But however Putin chooses to play this, we are focused on action in three areas.First, keeping up the pressure on Russia. For Moscow to negotiate seriously, there can be no let-up in our efforts. We are working hard on new measures to target their energy and defence sectors and utilise frozen Russian assets.The unity of the past week has put the ball firmly in Russia’s courtSecond, keeping up our support to Ukraine. The US lifting their pause on military and intelligence support was extremely welcome. But the US is right that Europeans need to bear their share of the burden. We are stepping up, putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position now and in any peace that follows.Third, we have to create the conditions that guarantee Russia does not come back for more. Together with France, we are establishing a coalition of the willing able to deter Putin from invading again. To be credible, it will need US support. But Britain and our allies recognise that the bulk of the contribution must come from Europeans. While I was in Canada at the G7, the defence secretary was in Paris meeting his counterparts, and the national security adviser was in Washington. On Saturday, the prime minister held a further leaders’ meeting, and this week thechiefs of defence staff will conveneanother military planning meeting. At this critical moment for European security, we are stepping up and leading this effort on multiple fronts, as part of our Plan for Change with national security at its foundation.The unity of the past week has put the ball firmly in Russia’s court. Putin’s aggressive actions over many years have shown his character. The proposal for ceasefire is therefore a test. He can’t simply say he is ready to end this war – he has to prove it.The G7’s unity extended beyond Ukraine. We will keep supporting the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, that sees all hostages freed, unhindered aid into Gaza and a political pathway to a lasting solution. We will back an inclusive political transition in Syria, up the pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme, and keep the spotlight on the terrible conflicts in Sudan and DRC.Republican Russophilia: how Trump Putin-ised a party of cold war hawksRead moreAnd we agreed a new Canadian-led initiative on maritime security – an example of strong leadership from one of our closest allies. With growing threats to freedom of navigation from the Red Sea to the South China Sea, growth in all our economies relies on a strong collective response.This year marks 50 years since a small group of western leaders first met just outside Paris – the origins of the G7. Those leaders did not agree on everything. Three were from the political left, three from the right. It was a time of upheaval – war, recession, changes in the multilateral system. Many in the democratic world were pessimistic about our ability to navigate a challenging global order.But that generation of politicians rose to the challenge. The G7 format represented a willingness to try something different. The leaders were able to be honest with each other. And this allowed them to find common ground.Today, we must rise to a new set of challenges. This requires that same spirit of honesty and common purpose. We and our allies are showing that spirit right now.David Lammy is UK foreign secretaryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Scarcely more than 50 days into his second presidential term, hapless Trump provides daily proofs of Merton’s universal “law of unintended consequences”.Rooted in ignorance, error, wilful blindness and self-defeating prediction, Trump’s rash actions produce contradictory, harmful and often opposite results to those he says he wants. The ensuing chaos characterises what may become the briefest honeymoon in White House history.Boomeranging US tariffs – which are to American prosperity what the Titanic was to ocean travel – are the tip of the unintended consequences iceberg. Defiant foreign retaliation has broughtstock market crashes and inflation fears– the exact opposite of what Trump promised voters.Trump won a mandate to make America great again, not greater – at least, not territorially. After his threats to invade Canada, loyal subjects of King Charles III are up in arms, booing the Stars and Stripes, boycotting US goods and retaliating with their own tariffs. Single-handedly, Trump has revived the fortunes of Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party. Under the new “elbows up” leadership of the former Bank of England chiefMark Carney, it has a good chance of winning this year’s election on an anti-Trump platform. That was not the plan.Likewise, Greenland’s voters, stung by a proposed Putin-style imperialist annexation,told Trump to take a hikelast week. They are undecided about independence but definitely reject US (or Danish) domination. Had there been any tea to spare in Nuuk, they would surely have tossed Trump and it into the harbour.Trump’s Ukraine surrender policy is another calamity. Russia is the aggressor, yet he punishes the victim. US pressure for a ceasefire is all one way – on Kyiv. This is emboldening Vladimir Putin to intensify attacks, notably in Kursk, whilestringing muggins Trump along.The prospective, unintended, consequences of an unjust peace are the undeserved rehabilitation of Russia, de facto amnesty for Putin’s war crimes, a precedent-setting ceding of sovereign territory seized by force, and a deep US-Europe split. So the question arises again: is this really unintended? Whether Trump is a stooge, KGB asset or plain stupid wasdiscussed here last week. Most probably, he has no real idea what he’s doing – or just doesn’t care. How else to explain his belief that proving himself right about tariffs is worth starting aglobal recession? Or that the ethnic cleansing of two million Palestinians in Gaza can bring peace?The explanation that Trump’s main concern is China, that he is trying to prise Moscow away from Beijing, is more upside-down thinking. These two authoritarian, anti-democratic states share a pernicious agenda: weakening and usurping the western-led, rules-based global order. Deliberately or not, Trump isassisting their ambitions.Surely even Trump and the underqualified toadies who advise him (no adults in the room in this White House) must realise that handing a humiliating victory to Russia does not bring closer lasting peace but future conflict with Nato neighbours and the US itself – while encouraging lawless behaviour all around. Perhaps they don’t realise. For unintended consequences, count on clueless dunces.Perhaps the scariest unlooked-for consequence of Trump’s serial blunders is accelerating nuclear weapons proliferation“Until him, no US president had been so ignorant of the lessons of history. Until him, no US president had been so incompetent in putting his own ideas into practice,”snarled the conservative commentator Bret Stephens. “Democracy may die in darkness. It may die in despotism. Under Trump, it’s just as liable to die in dumbness.”Merton described a foolish insistence on being right, despite all contrary evidence, as the “imperious immediacy of interest”. As the writer Rob Norton explains, “an individual wants the intended consequence of an action so much that he purposefully chooses toignore any unintended effects”. This is not true ignorance. It’s wilful ignorance.Perhaps the scariest unlooked-for consequence of Trump’s serial blunders is accelerating nuclear weapons proliferation. Alarmed by his threats to withdraw US protection, and shocked at the betrayal ofUkraine, Germany, Poland and South Korea are all urgently talking about obtaining an atomic bomb.

In his self-appointed role as godlike peace-giver, Trump told Tehran to restart nuclear talks – or else. His “bullying” hasenraged Iran’s leaders. An Iranian nuke, and military confrontation with the US and Israel, is now more, not less likely.Acolytes and hangers-on take their cue from the boss in his looking-glass land of self-inflicted cock-ups and risible own goals. Vice-president JD Vance and technobrat Elon Musk gave European “liberals”a dressing-downlast month and endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party. The results are the reverse of what they expected.German voters rejected the new fascists,Musk’s businesses are boycotted, and the EU is forging a united front against Trump and Putin both. Ironically, the Vance-Musk standup act’s repellent backing for Russia has wrongfooted “fawning” European rightwing populists, includingBritain’s Nigel Farage. Centrists like Keir Starmer are enjoying a “Trump bump”.As Trump careers uncontrollably towards the 100-day mark, his approval ratings slide. He is alreadyless popular than Joe Bidenwas at a similar stage. His honeymoon is history. Before November’s election, he claimed, falsely, that America was in an unprecedented mess. Such exaggeration is what Merton, who coined the phrase, called a “self-fulfilling prophecy”.

(Eggs are now $30 a dozen.) You fire off a few angry tweets about abortion rights and go to bed. In the middle of the night armed police break down your door and arrest you for destabilizing the security of the state. You are detained and then – if you hold citizenship elsewhere – deported.Not so long that sort of scenario happening in the US, where the first amendment protects free speech, would have been implausible. Now, however? It’s creeping closer. As I write this, the Columbia University graduateMahmoud Khalilis in immigration detention after being arrested and marked for deportation because of his pro-Palestinian activism.The pink protest at Trump’s speech shows the Democrats aren’t coming to save usRead moreGreen card holders can normally only be stripped of their immigration status if they have been convicted of a crime, which Khalil has not. But the Trump administration is rooting around to find any possible excuse to deport Khalil and make an example of him. Earlier this week,Donald Trumpcalled Khalil’s arrest the first “of many to come”, and said he would deport students he said engage in “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity”. And let’s be very clear here: doing anything in support of Palestinians – or simply existing as a Palestinian – seems enough to count as being “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, [and] anti-American” for Trump, who has repeatedly used the word“Palestinian” as a slur.The significance of Khalil’s detention, the enormity of the current moment, can’t be overstated. “This seems like one of the biggest threats, if not the biggest threat to first amendment freedoms in 50 years,”saidBrian Hauss, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. “It’s a direct attempt to punish speech because of the viewpoint it espouses.”While the Trump administration may have instigated Khalil’s arrest, I want to be clear that what’s happening right now isn’t just down to Trump. We did not go from zero to attempting to deport green card holders for political activism in a matter of weeks. The Biden administration’s brutal crackdown on student protesters led to this moment. University officialscooperatingwith this crackdown on protesters led to this moment. The mainstream media’sdehumanization of Palestiniansled to this moment.Indifference to US-sponsored suffering in Gaza and the West Bank also led to this moment. One of the most depressing things about the past 17 months has been seeing how many people in the US seem unbothered that what many experts havetermed a genocideis being committed with their taxpayer dollars. But what’s far worse than ignorance and indifference is cowardice: the people who know a grave injustice is being committed but who are too self-interested to speak out.What I have tried to say over and over again to those people in my writing is thatyour silence will not save you. Palestinian rights, trans rights, women’s rights: these are not separate issues. Unless you are a Maga supporter at the top of the food chain, the Trump administration will be coming for you too. This crackdown on free speech and political activism is not going to end with Khalil, or with pro-Palestine activism.We are not headed to uncharted territory: examples of where Trump seems determined to head are all around us. Look at Saudi Arabia, for example, where Salma al-Shehab (who was finally freed in February) spent more than four years imprisoned on terrorism-related charges forposting tweetsin support of women’s rights and retweeting Saudi women activists. She was charged, among other things, with “disturb[ing] public order, [and] destabiliz[ing] the security of society and the stability of the state” and, at one point, was sentenced to 34 years in jail. She spent almost 300 days in prolonged solitary confinement, according to Amnesty International.Look too at Israel’s use of “administrative detention” – detention without charge or trial that can berenewed indefinitely. Last year, for example, Israeli troops took 23-year-old Layan Nasir away at gunpoint from her parents’ home in the West Bank; there were no arrest warrant or charges, and her parents weren’t notified of where she was held. She was finally released after eight months, but only – one imagines –because she is Christian and her case got the attention of people like theArchbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Thousands of other Palestinians arecurrently rottingin Israeli prisons without any sort of timeline for charges or a trial.Look at Russia, where women areincreasingly being targeted and prosecutedunder the war censorship laws. Eighteen-year-oldDaria Kozyreva, for example, is facing years in prison for criticizing the Ukraine war in a media interview and for pinning a poem of a 19th-century Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko, to his monument in St Petersburg. She was also expelled from her university for her activism.It should be clear by now that America is not exceptional; the constitution is not a magical document that will protect our freedoms simply by existing. We are sliding towards an authoritarian future at alarming speed and Khalil’s detention is an important reminder that we can’t fight for our rights in isolation. All of our freedoms are intertwined.Texas bill would make identifying as transgender a felonyThe first-of-its-kind bill would charge transgender people with “gender identity fraud” and potentially lead toup to two years in jail. It was filed by a Republican state representative, Tom Oliverson, and has no co-sponsors.

This sort of monitoring (of pills that were approvedmore than two decades ago!) will have serious consequences. Doctors may not prescribe abortion pills as much because they are worried they will be investigated; patients may be scared about taking them.Former Texas megachurch pastor and Trump adviser indicted for child sex crimesIt’salways the peopleyou most expect, eh?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Doge’s cuts are way off baseKaterina CanyonMusk’s team is targeting diversity initiatives and research, which amount to pennies compared with the real spending concernsSat 15 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) recently made headlines by touting $80m in Pentagon budget cuts, claiming it is eliminating “wasteful spending”. But while these cuts focus on politically charged programs like diversity initiatives and academic research, they ignore the real sources of financial waste in the Department of Defense – waste that costs taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars annually.If the cuts were genuinely an effort to balance the budget and not a direct attack on programs that focus on equity and social justice, and if the goal is truly to trim unnecessary expenditures while preserving national security, then Congress and watchdog agencies should focus on where the real money is disappearing: failed weapons programs, an over-reliance on private contractors, unnecessary nuclear expansion and a Pentagon budget so massive that it has never passed an audit.The F-35: a $1.7tn messAmong the most obvious examples of waste is the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which has swelled into themost expensive weapons program in history. Originally budgeted at $200bn, the program’s lifetime cost has nowsoared to $1.7tn– roughly the GDP of Australia.Despite this considerable price tag, the F-35 is riddled with issues:It has over800 unresolved design flaws, including engine failures, software glitches and fuel system malfunctions.The cost per plane continues to escalate, with each unit nowcosting from $80m to over $100m– even before accounting for expensive maintenance costs.The program has been so ineffective that the air force has considered developinga new fighter jet to replace it– while taxpayers remain on the hook for the original purchase.If Doge were serious about reducing DoD waste, cutting back the F-35 program would be an obvious place to start. Yet, instead of addressing this bottomless drain, they have focused on cutting research grants and diversity programs, which cost a fraction of what the Pentagon spends on just a single F-35 jet.The Pentagon’s failed audits: where did the money go?The Pentagon has a budget ofmore than $800bna year – yet it cannot account for how that money is actually spent. The defense department has undergone audits since 2018, yet it hasnever passed a single one.In its most recent audit failure, the Pentagoncould not account for over half of its assets. That means hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars remain untracked, disappearing into bureaucratic black holes, overpayments and likely fraud.If this were any tax-paying American, they would be held accountable. If any other government agency or private corporation failed to pass six consecutive audits, it would face immediate financial oversight and accountability measures. Yet, instead of demanding fiscal responsibility, Congress continues to approve record-high military budgets with little transparency.Doge could use its influence to push for financial accountability, demanding a full, successful audit before approving more defense spending. Instead, it is fixated on small cuts that make no meaningful impact on overall waste.Musk’s entitlement remarks show Trumpworld can’t keep its story straight | Austin SaratRead moreNuclear expansion: a cold war relic that costs billionsAs of 2023, theUnited States was positioned to spend $756bnbetween 2023 and 2032 on nuclear weapons.One of the biggest cost drivers is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program, a$264bn effortto replace aging intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Many military experts argue that land-based nuclear missiles are outdated and unnecessary, especially when the US already has a robust deterrence system through submarines and bombers. Even the former secretary of defense William Perry has called for eliminating ICBMs altogether, labeling them “one of the most dangerous threats to national security” because they are vulnerable to first strikes.Yet, despite these concerns, policymakers continue funding an exorbitant nuclear expansion, diverting resources from modern defense priorities such as cybersecurity, climate security and AI-based warfare – the actual threats of the 21st century.Private military contractors: the Pentagon’s overpriced workforceThe Pentagon increasingly relies on private contractors for services that could be performed by active-duty personnel or civilian government employees at a fraction of the cost. In 2022 alone, the defense departmentspent over $400bnon military contractors, nearly half of its entire budget.This reliance on contractors often results in:Significantly higher costs: contractors are frequently paidfar morethan military personnel for the same jobs.Lack of oversight: many contracts go unchecked, leading to fraud, over-billing and waste.Conflicts of interest: many Pentagon officials move directly into high-paying defense contractor jobs after leaving government service, perpetuating a cycle of over-reliance on private firms.Instead of reining in excessive contractor spending, Doge has ignored this massive budget vacuum, choosing instead to focus on symbolic cuts that do not address the real financial inefficiencies within the Pentagon.We need real defense budget reformThe US already spends more on its military than thenext nine highest-spending nations combined. Yet, instead of using this budget wisely, we continue throwing money at broken programs, unnecessary nuclear expansion and overpriced contractors – without holding the Pentagon accountable for its failures.Meanwhile, Doge has chosen politically convenient budget cuts that pander to Donald Trump’s base and distract from the real sources of waste.Until policymakers are willing to address the actual inefficiencies in defense spending, taxpayers will continue paying for an over-inflated military budget that serves the interests of defense contractors far more than national security.The Pentagon does not need more money – it needs real financial accountability.Katerina Canyon is a poet, human rights and peace activist, and the executive director of the Peace Economy Project.

America raises about $3tn each year from income taxes. The nation also imports about $3tn worth of goods each year.Trump keeps saying other countries pay for tariffs. That’s not how they workSo to replace income taxes, tariffs would have to be at least 100% on all imported goods. Also, Americans would have to continue to import $3tn worth of goods every year. Neither of these is remotely plausible.The second problem is who pays.Trump keeps saying other countries pay for tariffs. That’s not how they work.Tariffs are in effect taxes on imported products. They’re paid by Americans.Say there’s a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. When Walmart imports Mr Coffee machines from China (where they’re made), China doesn’t pay the 60% tariff to the US government. Walmart does.If Walmart had bought the coffee machine for $20 before the tariff, the 60% tariff requires Walmart to pay an extra $12 – bringing the total cost of each coffee machine to $32.Walmart doesn’t want that extra $12 to cut into its profit margin, so it will try not to absorb that cost. Instead, it will pass the extra $12 on to its customers.Walmart’s CEOhas already saidit expects to raise prices in response to Trump’s tariffs in order to protect its profits.Now,targeted tariffscanbe used to protect industries critical to national security.This is what the Biden administrationdidwhen itlevied tariffson Chinese electric vehicles, solar panels,computer chipsand batteries after makingmassive domestic investmentsin these technologies.But Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on almost all imports – particularly from America’s largest trading partners.While Americans will pay more for imported goods due to tariffs, countries that export the products to America are also harmed because Americans presumably will buy fewer of their coffee makers and anything else they sell in the United States that now costs more. These countries are retaliating by raising tariffs on American exports.On Monday, China began imposing tariffs on a range of American farm products, including a 15% levy on chicken, wheat and corn.These retaliatory tariffs will hurt America’s farm belt – mostly Republican states and Trump voters.On Wednesday, after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all aluminum and steel imports coming into the United States from the rest of the world, the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on about $28bn worth of American exports, including beef and whiskey.Not incidentally, Europe’s retaliatory tariffs are on goods mostly produced by Republican states (think Kentucky bourbon). Europe is also slapping tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, made in America’s rust belt.On Thursday, in response to Europe’s tariffs, Trumpthreatened a 200% tariffon all alcoholic products from EU member states. If he follows through, Trump voters will be paying more for much of the alcohol they consume.Canada also announced new tariffs on about $21bn worth of US products.This is called a trade war. There are no winners in such a war.One of the biggest global trade wars started with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. After the 1929 stock market crash, President Herbert Hoover and Republicans thought sweeping tariffs would help the economy.They didn’t. Import prices surged, and exports plummeted because of other nations’ retaliatory tariffs. Global trade fell by66%, worsening the Great Depression.Smoot-Hawley seemed to prove that across-the-board tariffs don’t work. Then came Trump’s first term and his sweeping tariffs,largely on China.Higher prices from Trump’s first-term tariffs onthousands of Chinese importsare estimated to have cost American families close to$80bn.This cost took a larger chunk out of the incomes of poorer families than richer ones.If you make $50,000 a year, the cost of a coffee maker that rises due to tariffs affects you more than it does someone making $1m a year who can better afford the price increase.To put it another way, tariffs are a highly regressive tax.Following Trump’s first-term tariffs on China, Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs on American exports. This led China to import less from America.In the US agriculture industry alone, the result was a$27bnlossin exports from mid-2018 to the end of 2019. Even though the governmentincreased aidto affected farmers, farm bankruptcies shot up20%.Another consequence of Trump’s first-term trade war was that American manufacturingshrank,as demand for exports slumped and as raw materials used in manufacturing became more expensive.One study estimates that Trump’s first-term trade war cost nearly300,000 American jobs.Instead of learning a lesson from this fiasco, Trump is now promising even bigger tariffs –more tariff hikeson China and, starting on 2 April, 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.These new tariffs would cost the typical American household an additional$1,200this year. If Trump makes good on previous pledges to slap more tariffs on imports from around the world in addition to aluminum and steel, American families can expect to spend as much as$4,000more.Trump says he’ll use the revenue from tariffs to “offset” more of his big pending tax cut.That tax cut will disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans and big corporations, as did Trump’sfirst-term tax cut.But revenue raised from tariffs will be coming disproportionately from average working people.Hence, it will be a massive transfer of wealth from most Americans to the super wealthy and giant corporations.Will most Americans know that the higher prices they’ll pay for groceries, gas, housing and all sorts of other things will be going into the pockets of the wealthy? Will they know whom to blame?Trump was able to fool most Americans during his first term into believing he had created a marvelous economy for them and that they benefited from his tariffs and tax cuts.It was a lie, of course. But he tells lots of lies that many Americans believe. Will he be able to do it again, on a much larger scale?Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

It gave me respite from my private griefDavid SornigWhen Toni fell ill I stopped playing music entirely. Yet every so often I felt the urge to returnSat 15 Mar 2025 19.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 22.00 EDTShareThe first person who spoke to me on the first day of choir was a woman who’d sat beside me in the crowded alto section. She leaned my way and said a little bashfully, “I’ve never done this before. I don’t know how to sing.”I wanted to make the same confession to her, but in that moment I figured it’d be better to project something more like reassurance. “We’ll be fine,” I said from a place of certainty that I wasn’t entirely certain about.There must have been 70 or 80 of us in the room. The space we were in – a salon in the Melbourne Recital Centre – was intimidatingly world-class. It was hard not to feel inadequate in it.Aidan felt safe at choir, changed by the communal act of sharing his voice – then he was diagnosed with cancerRead moreRenée, the choir’s leader, stepped up to her music stand. She asked us to think about where our voices might best fit, and I drew out a vain half-memory of having once competently crooned some Sinatra somewhere. Where had it been? At some 3am karaoke night in that lane off Little Bourke Street? It was enough in any case to convince me to move over to the bass and baritone section where I figured my voice would at least be better concealed.I’d come to the choir at the tail end of a turbulent time. Toni and I had been together for over 30 years. We’d endured a serious fracture but had been preserved by being gentle with each other. By the time of the pandemic, we’d healed over the worst of it. Our bloom again into deep, constitutional loving was supercharged by the terrible illness that took hold of her two years later. By the start of 2024, she was gone.I spent a year pupating in the void of it. And while that time of reconstitution certainly wasn’t over, one of the certainties I’d arrived at was that I wanted to make music again.I wasn’t much of a musician. Mostly I noodled around alone at home on the guitar I’d bought on the day Ozzy Osbourne’s guitarist Randy Rhoads died in 1982. I liked playing with chords and melodies, but the devotion to learning, practice and performance never stuck.When Toni fell ill, I stopped playing entirely. Time became a small room. There was no space for indulgences. Even after she died, the best I managed was to notice how much dust had gathered on my guitar. Yet, every so often, I felt the urge to return to music, to the desire to fluidly utter this language that was not language.When I looked around the choir room, I wondered why each person there had come along. To sing, of course. But I reasoned that singing was an epiphenomenon of something more fundamental. I’d absorbed some of the valid things that had been said and written about the role community choirs could play in promoting wellbeing, especially around the space of grief, but I resisted thinking about that. I wasn’t entirely sure that I wanted my joining the choir to have anything to do with Toni’s death. It sounded too much like a program.Soon, Renée was warming us into trying out and trusting our voices. She took us, in our sections, through the parts of an 18th century canon setting of Psalm 137. The Waters of Babylon. My voice, as it landed on the wordsweptandremember, felt unfamiliarly smooth. Sure even.It was time, then, to sing all the parts together.I wasn’t conscious over those few short minutes of the song of the technical things I’d later learn about contrapuntal arrangement and the psychoacoustics of harmony that sit somewhere between the physics of sound and its intellectual and emotional apprehension.‘It brings you back’: the suburban choir helping people living with dementia reconnectRead moreWhat I was conscious of was that I was part of a collectively realised beauty. And that it was as that beauty fell in plaintive harmony on those two words –weptandremember– that I felt the sweetness of living being restored to a memory.A chill night, three decades ago. Toni and I aren’t so far away from where the Recital Centre stands now, walking around the shimmer of the floodlit fountain on St Kilda Road. We’re singing together. Just a simple harmony, the kind we’ll end up stumbling into by accident over the days and years of the everyday to come. The song is Moon River. She’s the alto. I’m the bass. I hadn’t crooned Sinatra alone after all.I remembered all this, and I heard the harmony of the many voices in the room. I heard each singer colouring their own part in it possessed with their own private reason for singing. I heard my own voice and my own desire. And in the totality of it there was a yearning for something more.And it was in our singing of it that I wept.David Sornig is a writer based in Melbourne.

But Premier Jacinta Allan has nowcompletely reversed this position,vowing to introduce the “toughest bail laws in Australia”. It follows staunch petitioning by social media influencers, FM radio hosts and the tabloid press, all demanding a response to what they say is a youth crime wave engulfing the suburbs.Allan has now apologised to victims of crimes committed while offenders were on bail, and said that “we got it wrong” in 2023. Among the changes Victorians can expect will be the removal of the principle that children should only be detained in custody as a last resort.It turns out that there were many, many votes in it for themVictoria’s one-eighty on bail laws is an expression of the age-old conflict between the forces of reform and the forces of reaction which defines criminal justice policy. Reformers cite solid evidence that prison is a wildly expensive, ineffective and ultimately self-defeating Band-Aid solution to the social generators of criminal behaviour. They emphasise the staggering numbers of deaths in custody, especially of First Nations people (including Ms Nelson, who was arrested on a shoplifting charge). They point to the traumatic and criminogenic effects of custody, especially on children.But it is the forces of reaction – fuelled by deeply felt, often prejudicial views we cling to about what young “thugs” do and don’t deserve – that now firmly hold sway.

During its very first sitting week, the CLP government rammed through legislation reversing Territory Labor’s historic achievement of raising the age of criminal responsibility to 12. The new chief minister, Lia Finocchiaro, justified that decision to the ABC by claiming nonsensically that recriminalising 10-year-olds would create “much better opportunities for authorities to intervene early in their lives” – while actually closing down some of those opportunities. To her base, her pre-election language had emphasised “meaningful consequences” for 10-year-olds who break the law. She also pledged toreintroduce spit hoods(banned after a landmark royal commission in 2016), widen police powers and toughen bail laws.None of this is new, and in part that’s the point. Finocchiaro and her team were determined to retreat and repeal, to undo the few royal commission-inspired changes Labor hadn’t already undone themselves, as part of a broader culture war agenda that has included ending treaty negotiations. It turns out that there were many, many votes in it for them.Over the border in Queensland, the Liberal National party took note. While promising to “divert” young people from the criminal justice system, David Crisafulli’s LNP also pledged to make that much less likely, by allowing sentencing courts to judge them “on every police caution, restorative justice agreement and breach” – and to ensure that a child’s criminal history follows them into adulthood.These changes fundamentally attack the principles that underpin separate youth justice regimes, the most important being based on our understanding of adolescent brain development and the impact of trauma (on the one hand) and supportive intervention (on the other). Labelling children as crooks and “thugs” – a favourite word among vigilante media and politicians – is among the worst things we can do to teens who are forging their identities and learning their places in the world.Stoking moral panics about youth crime had won reactionaries elections in the NT and Queensland, and the rest of the country learned the lesson. The federal agreement to raise the age of criminal responsibility was quickly abandoned everywhere outside the ACT. South Australia’s Labor government this month unveiled plans to “treat teens like bikies” (as the Advertiser’s front page put it), and now Victoria’s Labor government – which was always reactionary on youth crime under Dan Andrews, despite its claim as the country’s most progressive state – has promised the toughest bail laws in the country amid panic about a perceived crime wave.Most crime committed by young people is a symptom of much deeper social problems, which are often created or at least sustained by failures in public policy. The children in detention now in the Northern Territory – practically all of whom are Aboriginal – are the children of the Intervention, which among other things turned their communities into mini police states. Before they began committing crimes, most young offenders have been victims of truly horrific childhoods. Labelling them and punishing them more severely simply doesn’t work to reduce crime and create safer communities – if anything, it has the opposite effect.But these lessons are being ignored and quickly abandoned in our new commitment to reaction over sensible policy – when will we learn?Russell Marks is a criminal defence lawyer and adjunct research fellow at La Trobe University.

The behemoth in question is Meta, and whenCareless People,a whistleblowing book by a former senior employee, Sarah Wynn-Williams, came out last week, its panic-stricken lawyers immediately tried tohave it suppressedby the Emergency International Arbitral Tribunal. This strange institution obligingly (and sternly) enjoined Wynn-Williams “from making orally, in writing, or otherwise any ‘disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments to any person or entity concerning [Meta], its officers, directors, or employees’ ”. To which her publisher, Macmillan,issued a statementthat could succinctly be summarised thus: “Get stuffed.”Clearly, nobody in Meta has heard ofthe Streisand effect, “an unintended consequence of attempts to hide, remove or censor information, where the effort instead increases public awareness of the information”. The company has now ensured that Wynn-Williams’s devastating critique of it [see our review inthe New Review] will become a world bestseller.Among the many delicious ironies here is thatMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s Supreme Ruler, who has recently become a loud advocate of “free speech” – or at least free speech as understood by the Trump regime – is trying to suppress Wynn-Williams’s troublesome speech. The old-fashioned term for this is hypocrisy. But then her six years spent in the Supreme Leader’s inner circle will have inured her to that.She’s also a canny operator. Meta clearly had no idea this was coming. She adapted the playbook used by Frances Haugen,an earlier Facebook whistleblower, lodging a complaint in advance of publication with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – andbriefing theWashington Poston its contents; recording a compellinginterview with Emily Maitlistwo weeks before publication; and adding a real coup de grace – an appearance on Steve Bannon’shilarious podcast.What really infuriated him was that there was one huge area of the world – China – that was closed to himWhat comes across most forcibly from Wynn-Williams’s account is the extent to which Meta is really just a corporate extension of its Supreme Ruler’s personality, reminiscent of what Microsoft was like when Bill Gates ran it. Zuck’s special shareholding means that he has complete control of the company. In itsregular SEC filings, there is always a paragraph that makes it clear that he could even sell the company against the views of all shareholders and its board.The result is that Meta, as a corporation, always follows Zuck’s obsessions. For many years, that was about ensuring exponential growth in user numbers. Zuck viewed the world much as board-game fanatics view games of conquest. And what really infuriated him was that there was one huge area of the world –China– that was closed to him. In the 78-page document that Wynn-Williams filed to the SEC (and which theWashington Postclaims to have seen), it was alleged that Meta had for years been making numerous efforts to get into the biggest market in the world.These efforts included: developing a censorship system for China in 2015 that would allow a “chief editor” to decide what content to remove, and the ability to shut down the entire site during “social unrest”; assembling a “China team” in 2014 for a project to develop China-compliant versions of Meta’s services; considering the weakening of privacy protections for Hong Kong users; building a specialised censorship system for China with automatic detection of restricted terms; andrestricting the account of Guo Wengui, a Chinese government critic, after a Chinese internet regulator suggested it would improve cooperation. These corporate efforts only stopped after it became clear that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden viewed China as a strategic threat to the US.The time has come for Starmer & Co to grow some backbone and stop drinking the Kool Aid about AIIn her time atMeta, Wynn-Williams observed many of these activities at close range. In that sense, perhaps the most useful thing about her whistleblowing is that it provides an intimate picture of what a major tech company is really like. What strikes the reader is that Meta and its counterparts are merely the digital equivalents of the oil, mining and tobacco conglomerates of the analogue era. And they’re all US companies that have cosied up to Trump, which means that their interests are now inextricably intertwined with those of the American state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The story closely follows the instructions. The individual sentences mostly make sense. But – with the greatest respect to Jeanette Winterson, who called the story “beautiful and moving” – it is an atrocious piece of writing.The AI captures the tone of some of the worst writing around: pompous and self-satisfied, while using sentimental imagery (“a girl in a green sweater who leaves home with a cat in a cardboard box”) and dull similes (“like a stone dropped into a well”). There is repetition without development, poor structure, an over-reliance on jargon and, crucially, a lack of that slight breath of madness that makes writing human. If this were a first-year creative writing student, you’d give them feedback to help them improve, but you probably wouldn’t discourage them from pursuing other job prospects.It is in the gaps between what the author has written and what the reader imagines that writing comes to life. Readers will project meaning on to words on a page, but if those gaps are created by algorithms and chance, the act of creation on the reader’s part becomes onanistic; the death of the author requires the author to have been alive at one stage.I asked another AI model to critically evaluate the story, and it found it “compelling” and “self-aware”, employing “evocative language and imagery”. Perhaps it was not written for human eyes at all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What’s the point of a Labour MP who votes for something so cruel, tin-eared and short-sighted?John McDonnellTreating disabled and sick people callously flies in the face of all the party stands for – the government must rethink its plansJohn McDonnell accuses ministers of lacking empathy over benefit cutsSat 15 Mar 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 09.53 EDTShareEmails are pouring into MPs’ boxes from disabled people and carers, who are truly frightened by the suggestions from government sources and ministers’ speeches that the benefits they rely on are to be cut.The latest comments to a journalist from someonedescribed as a“government insider” demonstrate starkly what a tin ear some ministers have on this issue. This person accused Labour MPs who are expressing their constituents’ concerns about proposals to cut benefits of “pearl clutching”.It’s clear that some politicians have learned nothing from thewinter fuel payment debaclethat is still being raised angrily on the doorstep with Labour canvassers. More importantly, they appear to have learned nothing from the introduction of the work capability assessment for disabled people, associated with nearly600 suicide deathsin England between 2010 and 2013.As so many have said, the callousness of this treatment of disabled and sick people is not theLabourway. It prompts the question: why become a Labour MP if you are to vote for a policy that flies in the face of all that Labour has ever stood for?We’ve heard that there is a moral argument to justify the government’s plans. There is definitely a strong moral argument for providing professional and empathetic support to help people get into work if they are capable of doing so. There is no moral case for propelling even more people into poverty by cutting benefit levels, or denying access to financial support to those who have no alternative.The lack of understanding and empathy in the government’s policy planning and articulation has been shocking. Report after report has been published by thinktanks and specialist charities, including the Institute for Employment Studies, theResolution Foundationand theJoseph Rowntree Foundation, to explain the plight of sick and disabled people; how the numbers have risen and the best ways to tackle this issue.Although people are living longer, they are not necessarily living longer healthy lives. The increase in the retirement age has meant that many simply cannot physically manage to work until their retirement age. Therise in young people claiming benefitsfor sickness and disability, especially related to mental health conditions, has to be understood in the context of this austerity generation coming on to the books.Throughout my time as shadow chancellor, I, along with many charities and professional bodies, highlighted the impact the massive cuts in social care were having. They prevented those early interventions to support families and young people by social workers and expert specialists that could identify and tackle emerging problems before they worsened.We are now reaping the cumulative impact of the austerity measures sown by Tory chancellors. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, gets all this and appeared to be working to design a system whose underlying principle was supporting sick and disabled people, not penalising them. She recognised that this needs investment in the short term to bring the professional resources together, but that it would pay off in the longer term.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, obviously gets it because he was putting in place an extra8,500 mental health workersto address the mental illness challenges we have within our society.All that meaningful, positive, policy preparation seems to be being ridden over roughshod by the Treasury, whose demand for cuts appears to have risen from the£3bn planned by the Toriesto£6bn now. The obsessive and misjudged adherence to out-of-date fiscal rules by the Treasury is knocking this government off course.Ruling out increased taxes on the wealthiest when groups such as the Patriotic Millionaires are calling for them also appears dogmatic and foolish. And with such an overwhelming majority in the Commons, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have no fear of losing any votes in parliament.Dear Rachel Reeves: if there is no alternative to cuts, at least do them with care | Polly ToynbeeRead moreHowever, many Labour MPs are waking up to the fact that moves such as cutting the winter fuel payment, and now disability benefits, could very easily lose them their seats. Reform UK could exploit the unpopularity of these policies and build a base in their constituencies to springboard into the next election.There are only a few days left before the publication of the green paper on welfare benefits and just over a week before the spring statement.There is still time for the Labour cabinet to act like a cabinet, and for its members to stand up to the Treasury to halt the cuts in benefits to the sick and disabled, and to insist on a more flexible interpretation of the fiscal rules and a limited set of tax measures. That would follow Starmer’s guiding principle that the broadest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden.John McDonnell is MP for Hayes and Harlington.

After more than four months of largely peaceful student-led protests, frustration with the regime appears to have reached breaking point.The country is gearing up for a massive anti-government protest today, as thousands of students and citizens prepare to rally against the Serbian administration. Many residents describe the capital as feeling “under siege”, with the authorities implementing extreme measures that critics argue are designed to intimidate and prevent people from attending the demonstration.The state railway company, Srbijavoz, abruptlysuspended all inter-city train services, citing anonymous bomb threats as the official reason. There have also been reports of inter-city buses to Belgrade being cancelled, and even rumours that farm tractors and lorries have been deployed to barricade key roads leading into the capital. These unprecedented measures have sparked criticism, with many people arguing that the government is essentially locking down Belgrade in an attempt to suppress the protest movement.Despite these efforts, convoys of students and supporters from across Serbia have been finding alternative ways to reach Belgrade. Many groups, undeterred by the government’s tactics, set out days in advance on foot or by bicycle, determined to be part of what they expect to be a historic rally.At the same time, western diplomats are urging Serbia’s leadership to ensure the protest remains peaceful and that the safety of participants is guaranteed, warning that any attempts to suppress the demonstrations could escalate tensions domestically and internationally.In stark contrast to the diplomats’ appeals for calm, Vučić and his government have been framing the 15 March gathering as a powder keg ready to explode. For days, officials have ominouslywarned that clashes are inevitable, even suggesting that the demonstrators might attack police or attempt to violently storm the parliament.This relentless drumbeat of alarmist rhetoric from the government has been used to justify a heavy-handed response, with a strong police presence and pre-emptive security measures encircling Belgrade. These actions serve not only to heighten tensions but also to send a clear message of intimidation, painting the protesters as a threat to national stability, while bolstering the government’s narrative of control.The trigger for all of this wasthe deadly collapse, late last year, of a concrete canopy at the refurbished main railway station in Novi Sad, 50 miles north-west of Belgrade, which claimed the lives of 15 people. The tragic incident sparked mass protests across Serbia, becoming a symbol of something far deeper: a system where corruption, inefficiency and political cronyism are deeply entrenched.While claims of rampant corruption are widespread, they are often difficult to fully prove, with critics pointing to opaque government contracts, political patronage and a lack of transparency as troubling signs. Nevertheless, the judiciary is widely seen as compromised, the press is under constant attack and civil society faces harassment. In this environment, protests are no longer just about specific grievances – they represent a desperate call for a future free from the grip of autocrats and their cronies.View image in fullscreen‘Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, once seen as untouchable, now faces a genuine challenge to his authority.’Photograph: Andrej Čukić/EPAThe unexpected eruption of student outrage is not just about a single incident – it reflects the deep frustration of a generation that feels abandoned and betrayed by the same political elite that has held power for too long. What we are witnessing now is an unprecedented wave of new-age opposition, amplified through creative use of social media, and snowballing through the towns and villages of Serbia.The scale and persistence of these protests signal that the country is at a crossroads, with Vučić, once seen as untouchable, now facing a genuine challenge to his authority. However, despite the widespread unrest, the west continues to court Serbia’s controversial leader under the banner of keeping the country on the “EU path”. And perhaps for good reason.As much as there is to criticise about Vučić’s rule, there is no clear or viable alternative should his leadership falter. The political opposition is fragmented, often more focused on infighting than presenting a cohesive vision for the future.Yet the EU continues to engage with Vučić as if he were a reasonable partner, overlooking critical issues that should raise alarms. It turns a blind eye to his close ties with Vladimir Putin, the growing Chinese economic stranglehold on Serbian infrastructure, and the fact that Serbia’s energy giant, NIS, remainsmajority-owned by Russian interests– despite supposed EU sanctions.This apparent contradiction in EU policy raises questions about the bloc’s true commitment to its values and its long-term strategy in the region, particularly when pragmatic alliances seem to take precedence over the ideals of democratic governance and geopolitical stability.Serbia’s students are showing the world how to restore democratic hope | Adriana ZaharijevićRead moreOn one side, the Serbian government’s behaviour and lockdown tactics project an atmosphere of impending turmoil. On the other, the protesters – bolstered by moral support from abroad – are steadfast in their commitment to non-violence.Many people in Belgrade are hopeful that the day will unfold peacefully, defying the ominous predictions of violence. But given the tense buildup, all eyes will be watching how the authorities respond and whether freedom of assembly is upheld in practice.While Serbia’s relationship with Moscow may be viewed as part of efforts to balance its historic ties toRussiawith aspirations for EU and Nato membership, it also raises questions about the leadership’s true priorities. Under Vučić’s rule, Serbia has seen increasing authoritarian tendencies. These actions only deepen suspicions about his long-term priorities and intentions. If history has taught us anything, it’s that overlooking the Balkans often leads to unintended and far-reaching consequences.Brent Sadler is a former CNN journalist and a founder of the CNN affiliate 24-hour News Channel N1, based in Belgrade, SerbiaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I admire those who offer clear, sensible supportSat 15 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 15 Mar 2025 09.53 EDTShareThe first night we brought my son home from the hospital to our empty flat, we sat up far longer than needed, unmoored by a new, overwhelming responsibility to keep him alive. That some babies stop breathing in their sleep, and scientists still don’t really know why, terrified me when I’d just been primally rewired towards his survival. All you can do, you are told, is try to minimise risk.And so you commit the guidelines to memory: “For the first 12 months (adjusted for prematurity), the baby should be placed on its back in their own clear, flat, firm separate sleep space (eg a cot or moses basket) in the same room as you. They should not get too hot, and it should be a smoke-free environment.”This is drilled into you for a good reason: babies die from sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) and sudden unexpected death in infancy or childhood (Sudic, which covers Sids and other causes, for example, accidental suffocation). However, they are dying in far fewer numbers than a few decades ago. In the absence of a genetic test for Sids, safe sleep guidelines are the best things we have to prevent infant death.The problem is that babies don’t always play ball. They don’t read the leaflets. They have just left the safety of the womb, with its feeling of boundaried containment, only to be placed in a separate cot away from their mother’s body (even to be put down can prompt a startle reflex, from the sensation that they are falling). I remember looking at my son and all the other tiny babies in their neonatal intensive care unit incubators. The nurses had surrounded them with rolled up towels for this very reason.The rolled-up towel trick isn’t recommended at home. We often used a Purflo baby bed, reminiscent of a pod, that was advertised as being certified safe for overnight sleeping. Like many others, I was forced to negotiate the uneasy tension between wanting to keep my baby safe, and offering him the closeness, comfort and containment that is so natural for infants to crave.It is also not always easy to follow the guidelines. Your baby might sleep happily on its back. But many don’t. So where to turn? Online, it’s a culture war between the official health advice and ideologicalcosleepers– parents, mostly mothers, for whom sleeping with their infant has become akin to an identity, linked to the theory of attachment parenting. Somewhere in the middle you have, well, most of us, trying our best to keep our babies safe while also hoping to get enough rest to not lose our minds.Despite being long practised in many societies, cosleeping is a dirty word in the west (it is even more taboo in the US). Many parents are harshly reprimanded or guilt-tripped for doing it, or have lied to health professionals. Yet the charity the Lullaby Trust found thatnine out of 10 parentscosleep with their babies at one time or another.I did. I had a preterm baby (an added Sids risk factor) who slept happily on his back, until, at seven months, he stopped. I went against advice and coslept as safely as possible, but, haunted by a phrase in a baby book (“Imagine how you would feel if you coslept and your baby died”), I developed a crick in my neck from sleeping anxiously in the “C-curl” position.Pods and docks aren’t recommended either, despite ostensibly being the ideal solution to this quagmire. I recently visited a friend and her newborn who use the same Purflo baby bed, and it was only then that I found myself wondering what its claim of “certified safe for unsupervised, overnight sleeping” actually means. In fact, there is no one existing safety standard for this kind of product. The company DockATot brought an Advertising Standards Authoritycomplaint against Purfloin 2021, and Purflo was reprimanded for its use of the phrase, because it could imply there is a certificate that says this.Purflo has stopped using “certified” in its claim, and told me itsSleepTight Baby Bed “follows safe sleep guidelines, being fully breathable with a firm, flat base and firm, structured sides that allow air to circulate and will prevent risk of suffocation and overheating”. Both Purflo and DockATot, which thoroughly test against the standards available, say there should be a British safety standard for these (still relatively new) products.I agree. DockATot – which adheres to the general safe sleep recommendations – says that “without such standard, no brand promoting an unregulated product can make safe sleep claims that are true”. But worryingly, the market is flooded with untested products that prey on parents desperate for some rest.Despite cosleeping and using a pod, I try to look back kindly on my choices. In hindsight, I was so anxious and impressionable, desperate to do the right thing but also doubting myself. Recognising that telling parents off is less effective than supporting them to do things more safely, the UK seems to have turned a corner in its approach. Health professionals and charities are increasingly focusing on teaching parents how to bedshare more safely (a sofa or armchair is never safe).Baby sleep has become a sign of parenting competence – and a source of shame | Lucy Pasha-RobinsonRead more“We can have an ideal, but we understand that some people, for lots of different reasons, aren’t always able to do that on every single night,” says Jenny Ward of the Lullaby Trust. She wants people to have what she calls “an internal alarm bell” so that in a high-risk scenario where, say, you have had alcohol or are feverish, you have a separate sleep space for your baby that is completely clear.I admire its approach. The charity exists because of the tiny lives that have been lost. Yet in its quest to prevent more deaths it is being pragmatic and realistic, treating sleep-deprived parents with compassion and working with them. Alarmingly, recent research found that Sudic rates in the USincreased by 12%from 2020 to 2022, with a similar increasein the UK. Doctors don’t know why, and are hopeful that it may be a pandemic-related blip, but they have raised concerns about the role of social media in encouraging unsafe sleep practices.The internet is a wild west of unsubstantiated opinion and untested products, but people look to it because they feel alone, unsupported and unsure. Isn’t that the story ofmodern western parentingin a nutshell? Ward says that her dream policy would be better postpartum support to help parents get their babies sleeping safely right at the beginning. So when you are sitting on the sofa like I was, feeling too overwhelmed and unmoored to even think about sleep, there’s someone there to help you find a way.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

She talks ADHD, big breaks and micro-resistancesSat 15 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTShareNatasha Rothwell pops up on video from the US looking super-glamorous in a silvery-grey dress, with her hair and makeup on point. Did we miss a memo about a dress code for our interview? “I’ve just come from an event and thought, even though you’re not filming this, you could at least admire,” she laughs. “You know what they say: share the hair and never waste a face.”Rothwell is currently stealing the show as spa manager Belinda in season three of HBO hitThe White Lotus– reprising her role from season one, for which she was Emmy-nominated. Having endured the whims of Jennifer Coolidge’s needy heiress in Hawaii, Belinda has now travelled to the titular resort in Thailand to take part in its wellness training programme. She’s “cosplaying as a guest”, as Rothwell puts it – and in the process both finding romance and uncovering a potential crime.The 44-year-old was born in Kansas but spent her childhood moving around the US due to her father’s job in the air force. She studied theatre at university, before becoming a high school drama teacher in the Bronx, while appearing in comedy clubs by night. Her first professional gig in showbiz was as a writer onSaturday Night Live.She found on-screen fame in Issa Rae’s hit comedyInsecureon HBO; Rothwell was originally hired as a story editor but her script readings in the writers’ room inspired Rae to cast her as Kelli Prenny, who became a breakout heroine. Last year, Rothwell created her own Hulu sitcom,How To Die Alone, about a lonely airport employee who has never been in love.Resplendent in her finery, Rothwell discussesThe White Lotus, her daily Donald Trump protests and recent ADHD diagnosis. “Kop khun ka”, as they say in Koh Samui.Was it always the plan to come back forThe White Lotusseason three or did it come out of the blue?It definitely wasn’t the plan. It was pitched as a limited series. I put the character away, thanked her and watched season two as a fan like everyone else. When Mike [White, the show’s creator] reached out about returning for season three, I was beside myself. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity that I got twice.London is like New York with an accent. It’s walkable, the theatre is incredible, you can drink a pint on the street and no one looks twiceHow was filming in Thailand?Beautiful but too hot. It teaches you a bit of Buddhism: want is the root of all suffering. I tried to stop wanting it to be cold and it did help. I just gave into the environment. Resisting it every day for five months was not going to be fun.Lisafrom K-pop bandBlackpinkplays health mentorMook. Were lots of Lisa fans hanging around?She is huge but also wonderfully ordinary. Kind, relatable and approachable. I even met her mum. She’s just the sweetest – then you see people peeking in, like “is that her? Scream!” I can’t imagine that kind of mega-wattage celebrity. I’m quite the hermit myself, so to see someone handle it with such aplomb was cool. She’s so young but so savvy.In episode one, Belinda is so pleasantly surprised to see a black couple in the hotel restaurant that she gives them a little wave. Have you had moments like that in your own life?I actually pitched that to Mike. I told him that when you see other people of colour travelling – particularly if they’re moving in spaces that are quite homogenous – you want to let them know that you see them. It’s something subtle that happens. I remember being in Ireland, at a castle on some misty moor, and a black family came out of the fog. I was wide-eyed. I didn’t know them from Adam but I just walked over and hugged them. I was so grateful that Mike added that part in.In the first season, was it a struggle not to laugh while shooting scenes with Jennifer Coolidge?She’s so deeply funny, it’s incredible. I cut my teeth in improv and sketch comedy, so fancy myself as pretty unflappable. But the moment where I’m singing a hymn to her and she sings it back, that wasn’t in the script. I remember biting the inside of my cheek, thinking “Don’t break, don’t break”.Apparently she’s keen for her villainous ex, Greg, to get his comeuppance and messaged you saying “Go get him, girl”?(Laughs)She’s been texting me throughout the series. Jen is so supportive and such a character. Audiences miss her, so I’m a surrogate, keeping the flame alive.View image in fullscreenRothwell in the third series of The White Lotus. ‘A once in a lifetime opportunity I got twice.’Photograph: HBOWe’re midway through the series. What’s in store for Belinda over the next four episodes?Expect the unexpected. That’s kind of a piss-poor answer but I can’t say much. You’ll see sides of Belinda that emerge when she’s confronted with fear. Stay tuned.You had a stint in the UK shootingWonka, in which you played plumberPiper Benz, and are a self-confessed anglophile. What is it that you like about it here?Believe it or not, I even love the shitty weather. It’s sunny all the time in LA. I don’t trust a person who’s always happy. You need inclement weather to appreciate the sunshine. London is like New York with an accent. It’s walkable, the theatre is incredible, you can drink a pint on the street and no one looks twice. I got addicted toGoggleboxandLove Island. I even got aLove Islandwater bottle for Christmas.The Officeis one of my all-time favourites. I was a David Brent purist and only watched the BBC original. When the US version came out, I refused to watch it at first.WasInsecurea gamechanger for you?Without question. Hands down, it changed my life. I had no idea the show would be that big, let alone that I’d become an actor on it, as well as a writer.Insecureunlocked something. It showed me that black female comedy could succeed. Young, plus-size actresses who are brown still come up and say “Kelli Prenny is on my wall!” For me, that inspiration was Nell Carter on [80s sitcom]Gimme A Break!That’s why representation is so important. It allows us to dream bigger.I consider the ADHD diagnosis a gift. I’m able to unmask some of my traits and let my freak flag flyYou used to teach at a high school in the Bronx. Tell us about that.I loved teaching theatre so much. My older sister has been in elementary education for over 25 years so I definitely “phoned a friend” a time or two. I always had the call to teach. Now I have several young writers and actors in LA that I mentor. It’s important to send the elevator back down. Besides, after teaching teenagers, nothing can scare you.Was it hard to get over the disappointment ofHow To Die Alonenot being renewed for a second series?You have to accept sometimes that things are unjust or unfair. This was a huge reminder of that. You can create a critically acclaimed, award-winning show that gets great numbers and it still not be enough. I’ve had to remind myself to be proud of what I put into the world and the effect that it had on people. The industry is tricky right now. Post-strike Hollywood is operating from a place of fear and that’s no way to make art. I hope to find it another home. My middle name is Faith, so I’m not going to have the funeral quite yet.Do you think comedy is underestimated? It rarely wins Oscars, for example.Absolutely, and I think it’s much harder. Great comedians make incredible dramatists and I don’t know if the opposite is true. George Saunders defined comedy as the truth told quickly. Comedians are fearless in their confrontation of the truth. That’s why I’m so grateful forThe White Lotus. It enables me to use my comedic training in a dramatic way. Comedy needs more respect.View image in fullscreenWith Yvonne Orji in Insecure.Photograph: Raymond Liu/Warner MediaWhat projects are in the pipeline for you?A series about [internet personality]Reesa Teesa, who found viral fame after a TikTok post about how she was hoodwinked by her husband. It’s my first role where I’m playing someone who’s living. It’s such a relatable story, set on the battlefield of love. Talk about resilience: she used her platform to tell everyone how she was taken advantage of, which was a radical act of vulnerability. It inspired me to have courage to be more vulnerable, so I hope the show can do the same.We admire your dedication totweeting “You are trash”at Donald Trump every day. How did that start?It’s a necessity. I’ve been doing it since his first term. I went on hiatus during Biden’s presidency but now I’m back. It’s just a reminder that what’s going on is not normal and to speak truth to power. It’s a micro-resistance but it makes me feel better. I never planned it as a daily thing. I sent the first one and the next day was like: “that motherfucker is still trash.” Until I get it out of my system and I feel everyone’s chanting the same thing, I’m going to keep doing it. People ask if I have an AI bot that does it for me. No, I roll over in the morning and if that idiot comes to my mind, I tweet it. I love that people have tuned into something so simple. It’s just a collective nod. We’re all in agreement, so let’s keep pushing.You were diagnosed with ADHD last year. Did things suddenly make sense for you?Massively. I’ve always felt a little neurospicy but have found ways to work with it and move through the world. Before diagnosis, I’d get frustrated at some of the symptoms. Understanding that it’s just my factory setting has made me accept who I am in total. I consider the diagnosis a gift. I’m able to unmask some of my traits and let my freak flag fly.What makes you happy when you’re not working?Did my therapist tell you to ask that?(Laughs) I’m actively pursuing a hobby that has nothing to do with my vocation. I love what I do so much that work/life balance can be tricky.

The press have barely been let near the remake’s stars, Rachel Zegler, who is of Colombian-Polish descent and plays Snow White, and Israeli actor Gal Gadot, playing the Evil Queen. And there are no dwarves.The film is forgoing a traditional Leicester Square red carpet opening this week; advance ticket sales projections are lacklustre and it hasn’t been shown to reviewers.But why should a film based on an archetypal fairy tale – of a wicked queen, jealous of her stepdaughter’s beauty, who orders her murder, only to discover that she is hiding in a cottage with seven dwarves, then poisons her with a drugged apple, causing her to fall into a deep sleep, to be awakened only by the kiss of a prince – cause so much bother?View image in fullscreenGal Gadot and Rachel Zegler with a certain item of fruit in the new movie.Photograph: DisneyGood or bad,Snow Whiteis destined for a reaction. “It’s a complete quagmire but, realistically, what did they expect?” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts in California and former executive editor of theHollywood Reporter. “You’re going into this with a movie calledSnow White. It’s hard to imagine a picture in this DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion], or post-DEI, post-woke age could be more controversial and polarising – and Disney is all about not being polarising, bringing people together and avoiding controversy at all costs.”Disney embarked on a programme of reinventing its animated back catalogue as live action withAlice in Wonderlandin 2010, continuing withCinderella(2015),The Jungle Book(2016), andBeauty and the Beast(2017). But the release ofMulanin 2020, a remake of the 1998 animated film based on a Chinese folklore tale, signalled that folk tales carry contemporary political and cultural trapdoors. There were false rumours that Disney had cast a white lead actress, and calls for a boycott afterMulan’s lead actor Liu Yifei expressed support for the Hong Kong police. The credits revealed that film-makers thanked eight government entities in Xinjiang, where Uyghur Muslims have been detained in internment camps.Actor Halle Bailey, who is Black and starred in the 2023Little Mermaidremake, faced racist backlashafter being cast as Ariel, who was white in the animated film in 1989.Zegler, the star ofSnow White, who is Latina, has suffered similar abuse. ButSnow Whitealso arrives on our screens with a different set of issues. Screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson said the 1937 classic had been gently fleshed out for a more contemporary audience and that she had “massaged the theme of her discovering and trusting her own voice and her own purpose with compassion and strength”.Zegler toldVanity Fairin 2022 that people were making jokes “about ours being the PCSnow White, where it’s like, yeah, it is – because it needed that. It’s an 85-year-old cartoon, and our version is a refreshing story about a young woman who has a function beyond Someday My Prince Will Come.” She has also been criticised for saying the prince “literally stalks” the princess in the 1937 original.View image in fullscreenSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs – the 1937 original.Photograph: Disney/AllstarDisney possibly saw controversy coming. When it reopened its renamed Snow White’s Enchanted Wish ride at Disneyland in 2021, it was hit with criticism that the upgraded experience still included Prince Charming kissing a sleeping Snow White – without her consent. The kiss was one of true love, not lust, because the prince thought she was dead, it was explained.Both Zegler and Gadot have run into trouble with political statements. Gadot, who served in the Israel Defense Forces,spokeat an Anti-Defamation League summit on antisemitism, and her stance on the Israel-Hamas war triggered calls by Palestinian groups fora boycottof the film.Zegler, on the other hand, has posted “always remember, free palestine”on X. After the US election, she wrote “may Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace” on Instagram. Zegler later apologised, saying she was “sorry I contributed to the negative discourse”.R&B legend Brandy, who played Cinderella in a 1997 remake starring Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother, has advised Zegler to remember her true audience. “You’re not taking on this role to fit the mould of the critics,” Brandy toldVariety. “You’re doing this for every little Colombian girl who has yet to see themselves in a role like a Disney princess.”And then there are the notorious dwarves, created using CGI animation.Cyranostar Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, questioned why the characters were included while Snow White was cast diversely. “It makes no sense to me. You’re progressive in one way, but then you’re still making that fucking backward story about seven dwarves living in a cave together?” he said on theWTF with Marc Maronpodcast in 2022.View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as Evil Queen in the live-action Snow White.Photograph: DisneyDisney said it has consulted members of the dwarfism community “to avoid reinforcing stereotypes” and, later, that it would replace the seven with “magical creatures”.Peter Kunze, a historian at Tulane University in New Orleans and author ofStaging a Comeback: Broadway, Hollywood, and the Disney Renaissance, says Disney has sometimes struggled to manage the transition from animation to live action, just as Walt Disney managed to make animation more realistic with Snow White than it was with Mickey Mouse.“There are questions of authenticity that come with the shift,” Kunze says. “In some ways they’re moving away from the principles of the animated film, of fantasy or embellished reality, and getting more realistic. The interesting question is not whether it’s authentic, but in what ways does Disney think it’s being authentic and how audiences respond?But updating for contemporary audiences and hiring consultants to say how authentic it is, does not necessarily resonate with audiences “who maybe are not looking for Disney to have a culturally rich, in-depth storytelling in a fairytale space. A film can only do so much to capture a culture, and then there’s the question of: whose version of that culture do you capture?” Kunze says.“In attempting to speak to more diverse audiences by putting a Latina into a Germanic narrative without acknowledging certain elements of what it means to be Latina potentially does little to make space for more Latina stories and just presents new bodies in old stories as progress,” Kunze adds.It may be that Disney is a touchstone that makes for a big, easy target in the culture wars, andSnow Whiteis the fairest target of them all in its archive. If the movie is good enough, it could cut through the cultural flak. “From the beginningSnow Whitehad red flags waving – a whiter-than-white heroine at a time when Hollywood is moving away from that, rescued by Prince Charming, when that’s a chauvinist trope, and seven dwarves, when the word dwarf is a negative. It’s not like any of this crept up on Disney unawares. ButSnow Whiteis also the classic of classics – it is to animation what Hamlet is to the theatre.”Explore more on these topicsCultureThe ObserverChildrenWomenAnimation in filmFilm industryWalt Disney CompanynewsShareReuse this content"

Marylou Mayniel, 31, is a producer, vocalist and composer from a village in rural west France. As a child she played classical piano and sang in school choirs before moving to Paris in 2015 and London two years later. After being introduced to the city’s underground clubbing scene, she swiftly found support from American avant-pop starCaroline Polachekand British super-producerAG Cook, with whom she collaborated on her 2020 mixtapeGalore.While Oklou’s catalogue stretches back to 2014, she’s only now capturing wider attention for her debut full-length record,Choke Enough, released last month. The album (produced by Oklou, with Casey MQ, Cook and Danny L Harle), received critical praise for its vivid portrayal of party-going through heavy basslines and whimsical arpeggios – think PC Music (Cook’s label) meets Enya. Standout moments include the twinkling trumpets ofIct,rapper Bladee’s soft vocals on hyperpop tune Take Me By the Hand, and the club-ready climax ofHarvest Sky.Inspired by French summer bonfire celebrations, this last track balances thumping trance with shimmering vocals and the image of watching a party from a distance (“In the night, slow dance for a harvest sky/ But I won’t, no way, afar, I stay, and watch”). It’s a perfect summation of Oklou’s production style: tentative yet seeking thrills – a country girl making it in the big city.Choke Enoughis out now via True Panther/Because.Oklou tours the UK and Ireland at the end of the yearWatch the video for Take Me By the Hand by Oklou.Explore more on these topicsMusicOne to watchElectronic musicDance musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Which is probably why he’s given the task of unmasking a traitor suspected of stealing and selling a piece of potentially devastating technology. What complicates matters is the fact that one of the main suspects is his wife, high-ranking fellow agent Kathryn (Cate Blanchett). Others in the frame include in-house psychiatrist Dr Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris), alcoholic maverick Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke) and junior agent Clarissa Dubose (Marisa Abela).This knotty spy thriller fromSteven Soderberghattempts to distract us from a convoluted plot and baffling character motivations with fabulously chic interiors, impeccable tailoring and a general sense of dissolute luxury. And for a while it almost works: it’s always a pleasure to watch Blanchett slink expensively around a set, and Fassbender wears his serious, Harry Palmer-style thick-framed glasses with suitable gravity. But times have changed, and to audiences acclimatised to the grubby, malodorous whiff of frustration and professional disappointment that seeps out of something like the TV adaptation of Mick Herron’sSlow Horses, this all feels about as authentic as a set of dental veneers.The main problem, however, is the writing. We could probably get past the implausibly handsome cast and glossy, monied look of the production design if David Koepp’s screenplay delivered a satisfying payoff. David Holmes’s score borrows from the jazzy, percussive urgency of his work for Soderbergh’sOceansfilms, but, like much ofBlack Bag, it feels slick but superficial.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Black Bag.Explore more on these topicsThrillersThe ObserverSteven SoderberghCate BlanchettMichael FassbenderSlow HorsesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a fusion best expressed across his five albums since 2015’s debut EPNocturne, while his collaborations with other artists delve into related influences, such as lo-fi UK rap on 2016’s2nd Exitwith MC Lester Duval, and downtempo R&B on 2020’sEpochwith singer Emmavie.Mist’s latest project,44th Move, is a duo with drummerRichard Spaventhat explores rhythm. Harnessing Spaven’s astounding capacity to play time-shifting yet metronomically perfect grooves, the duo’s debut album,Anthem, is a mighty showcase of beats and keys. Tracks such as the title number and 2nd September channel the classic Mist sound, featuring reverb-laden Rhodes chords and a laidback groove over an earworming motif, yet it’s whenAnthemdeparts from the formula that itbecomes most engaging.Free Hit finds Spaven playing through warped breakbeats as Mist artfully accompanies. Second Wave touches on moody drum’n’bass, while Barrage moves into dub territory with a hypnotic, echo-laden groove. It’s a riveting interplay, showcasing two musicians at the top of their game.Listen to Free Hit by 44th Move.Explore more on these topicsJazzThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

No revelation there: on many occasions its composer, Benjamin Britten, said as much himself. He and his partner, the tenor Peter Pears, who created the role of Grimes, spent most of their adult lives near the Suffolk coast, the North Sea a steely backdrop. In anew staging for Gothenburg Opera, conducted by Christoph Gedschold, the British director-designerNetia Joneshas ditched the usual sea-as-metaphor idea, a handy cover-all for life’s existential questions, and embraced maritime reality.To underline the point, costumes, faded and weather-beaten, have been sprayed with salt. Workers gutting fish in white aprons are spattered with blood. Every detail reminds us of a sea that is not figurative but harsh and physical. Newly appointed associate director of the RoyalOpera, London, Jones is a radical creator who uses video to original effect. This was her Gothenburg debut. She has removed the opera from its original East Anglian fishing village setting, taken fromThe Borough(1810), a collection of poems by George Crabbe, to a libretto by Montagu Slater.The locale is now a remote island community off Sweden’s west coast in a fictional present. Gothenburg’s seafaring history – this is a port city with a Viking past – is also acknowledged. Itstraditionally shaped 1,276-seat opera house, opened in 1994, is airy and ship-like, with decks, railings and walkways. Generous public funding covers 72% of its annual budget (compared with 14%, in 2022/23, at the UK’s Royal Ballet and Opera).The audience slowly rose as one, as if stunned at the way human cruelty could go hand in hand with music of such restless beautyWe should say, too, that Gothenburg Opera’s pioneering record of sustainability – green power, food waste turned into biogas, recycled costumes – has led the way for other opera companies (though I’m not sure any has followed their example of keeping 50,000 bees and selling the honey).Outside in the harbour, hulls, piers and cranes shape the skyline. Jones and her team have built on all this inGrimes. What you see on stage distantly echoes what you pass on your way to the venue. Ingenious use of video projections, all filmed in the Gothenburg archipelago and to the north beyond, keeps turbulent sea and clouded sky to the fore. Action takes place on a pontoon, waters lapping below.View image in fullscreenJoachim Bäckström in the title role.Photograph: Lennart SjöbergThe rest of the set is minimal. The pitched roof of Grimes’s hut mirrors that of the wooden church in which hymn-singing parishioners praise the Lord – one of Britten’s characteristic musical cross-fades –before bullying the lone outsider in their midst. Colour is subdued, monochrome until, explosively, all turns lurid red for the midsummer fires and festivities, which render ordinary, hard-working people a vindictive mob (lighting design by Ellen Ruge). The sight of an effigy of Grimes hanging from a boom hook, which might usually hold a few tonnes of raw fish, is electrifying.Every character in this large cast, mostly Swedish, singing in good, clear English, is well delineated – all worthy of mention, but with Åke Zetterström an unusually sympathetic Balstrode leading the ensemble. In the title role, the tenor Joachim Bäckström, radiant-toned and detailed, conveys the frustration of the grizzled, poetic fisherman whose carelessness towards his boy apprentices is left uncertain and complex. The massed singing-shouting of “Peter Grimes!” by the excellent Gothenburg Opera chorus had the intensity, the ugliness, the displaced grief of a war cry. By the end, when his tormentors sing the name again, pianissimo, tuba playing its soft, fog-horn call, they sounded like briny wraiths.View image in fullscreenMatilda Sterby as Ellen Orford.Photograph: Lennart SjöbergThe handling of the female roles revealed anew their importance to the story: the widowed schoolmistress Ellen Orford, courageously delivered by the brilliant young soprano Matilda Sterby; Auntie (a benevolent, warm-hearted Katarina Karnéus); and her twin-like, spirited nieces (Sofie Asplund and Mia Karlsson). Ellen is disturbingly, unwittingly instrumental in the tragedy. Her own dreams blind her to the truth of the situation. Auntie and the nieces are too often typified as near-sluts: not here. Their quartet, in which they meditate on the difficulties of being women in a male-dominated world, is among the most rhapsodic passages in the opera – along with the orchestral sea interludes, which act as chapter headings as the work unfolds.Hardly well known to most opera-goers in Sweden,Peter Grimesis nevertheless not new to the country. The first ever performance outside the UK, in March 1946, was in Stockholm, with more recent stagings there, in Gothenburg and elsewhere. This production, which opened last weekend, raises an always affecting work to a different level of emotional impact. That the cast, chorus and superb orchestra were all outstanding was an equal part of the equation. The work closes, as a new day begins and the nets are brought in, with a muffled thud. At the end, the whole audience slowly rose as one, less out of normal curtain-call hoorays and excitement, though there was that too. It was more as if we were stunned at the way human cruelty, laid bare, could go hand in hand with music of such restless, elliptical and violent beauty.Peter Grimesis at Gothenburg Opera House, Gothenburg, Sweden, until 1 AprilExplore more on these topicsOperaThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

The starting point is simple. Johnny is 19, and on the run from a small-town childhood; arriving in London, he falls in love with Jerry, who is 45 and HIV positive. Their affair coincides exactly with the last four years in which the virus was untreatable; Jerry dies of an Aids-related illness in the summer of 1995, just months before effective combination therapies began to be prescribed.Twenty-six years later, Johnny is still living in Jerry’s flat. This is in the Nova Scotia House of the title, an oasis of public housing in one of the last pockets of unredeveloped land in London’s East End. Inevitably, a tower of flats is now being built right next to it. As the tower rises, light is gradually excluded from the garden that Jerry created and which the grief-stricken Johnny has lovingly maintained.As we overhear his reflections on this act of destruction, we realise that Johnny is in mourning for far more than just his beloved. Now 45 himself, he is one of that specific generation of British gay men who – in his words – “lost everyone. No elders, all dead. The ones that survived are broken.” The ecstasies of his life with Jerry have been replaced by bad buildings, bad manners and bad sex with online hook-ups. However, as the tower rises, creating darkness, memory floods in, bringing new light.Porter offers the reader a utopian glimpse of pre-Aids queer culture being born againThe past that Johnny recalls turns out to be a very specific kind of other country. His lover lived through the heroic days of British Gay Lib; as Jerry describes them, they were the years “when we found ourselves”, when gay culture elevated freedom over possessiveness, community over capitalism, liberty and creativity over everything. As their affair catches fire, Jerry’s courage and grace in the face of adversity teach his young lover that there is a straight line of descent from what Jerry calls the “queer magic” of his heyday to the empathy and activism that the epidemic now demands.To make his evocation of Aids-era London hit the reader with the same sensory dazzle it once did his young narrator, Porter employs a daring trick. All the benchmarks of early 90s queer London are here, recognisable down to their last filthy and heartbreaking detail: the backrooms, the saunas, the raves, the direct actions. However, none is given its real name or location. This creates a very particular kind of history. As memorialised here in a web of fictional disguises, the lost locations, communities and artists of our recent past are not so much documented as returned to archetypal life.A similar trick of untethering structures the book’s prose. All information about Johnny beyond his name and age is withheld; we meet him only through his voice. We hear as much as see him getting sloppy with sex, drunk with discovery, fractured by loss; his sustained interior monologue treats full stops as optional, tenses slippery, verbs as a necessary hindrance. The effect is to lend his memories an almost hallucinatory authority. “Why do I go there what more proof do I need what do I want these men to be”: in this unstoppable flow of words, the past is made present, and the death of his beloved undone.When the light on his garden is finally gone, Johnny decides he must leave Nova Scotia House. Porter spurs him to do this via two powerfully stage-managed epiphanies. The first occurs at an Aids-themed art exhibit in New York, for which Porter borrows the work of Félix González-Torres; the second is at a London exhibition of panels from the UK version of the Aids memorial quilt. Prompted by these acts of witness, Johnny decides that his life’s task will be to honour not just his lover’s memory but his radical vision. As he starts a new life outside London, Porter offers the reader a utopian glimpse of pre-Aids queer culture being born again, and of anger and grief turning into possibility.According to the book’s artfully buried chronology, Johnny was born in the same year as his creator. Porter’s first novel has all the virtues of exactly the kind of queer life that he is using his fictional alter ego to celebrate. It invites the reader to join him in an exhilarating, risk-taking, life-affirming experiment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A recent discovery was the Lebanese take on moussaka atMaroushon Edgware Road, which is very different from the Greek version made with lamb and bechamel. This version is a simple but delightful stew made using aubergines, chickpeas, spices and herbs, which I’ve perked up with aan adaptation of the Lebanese garlic sauce,toum. Toum is usually made with raw garlic, oil, lemon juice and salt, but I thought I’d ease you in gently by tempering the garlic with tahini.Lebanese moussaka with five-garlic-clove sauceYou’ll need a blender to make this.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4For the moussaka3 medium aubergines(1kg)Extra-virgin olive oil1½ tsp fine sea salt2 brown onions, peeled and finely diced4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tsp ground cumin1½ tsp ground cinnamon¾ tsp ground allspice800g tinned chopped tomatoes(ie, 2 tins)400g tinned chickpeas, drained40g flat-leaf parsley, leaves and tender stalks finely choppedSumac, to finishGreek-style flatbreads, to serveFor the sauce150g tahini5 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 tbsp fresh lemon juice(from about ½ lemon)3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½ tsp fine sea saltHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Quarter each aubergine lengthways, then cut each quarter into wedges about 4cm at their widest part. Pop these in a large bowl, add four tablespoons of oil and a teaspoon of salt, and toss to coat. Arrange the aubergine wedges in a single layer on a large oven tray, then bake for 18-20 minutes, until cooked through. Remove and put to one side.Put four tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan for which you have a lid and set it over a medium heat. When hot, add the onions and garlic, and cook, stirring regularly, for 15 minutes. Stir in the cumin, cinnamon and allspice, then add the tomatoes, chickpeas, the cooked aubergines and half a teaspoon of salt, cover the pan and leave to cook on a low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water, if need be (I added 100ml). At the end of the cooking time, fold in the parsley.Meanwhile, make the garlic sauce. Put the tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and 115ml water in a blender and whizz until smooth and creamy.Decant the aubergine and chickpea mixture on to a platter, then top with some of the garlic sauce, drizzle with more olive oil and sprinkle with sumac.

At any given time, I have at least four blocks in my fridge, ready to be softened and whipped into cakes or rubbed into flour for pastry. There is a camp of people who prefer to use salted butter for baking, and while there are definitely instances where that has its place (think shortbread and cookies), I find it much easier and more consistent to be able to control the salt level myself, especially because it varies so much between brands.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, I tasted each butter on its own (much harder than you think!) and spread it on a plain cracker. The differences between them were much more subtle than I’d been expecting and, for the most part, it was hard to tell which was which.

But I prefer to see these months as an exciting time to get creative with pickles, ferments and preserves, and to make the most of native root vegetables, such as celeriac, which is earthy, comforting and sweet.Mussels with celeriac, bacon and cream (pictured top)Winter is the ideal time for a big pot of mussels, because the cold weather is when their flavour and quality are at their best. The sea-briny sweetness of the shellfish and the earthy richness of celeriac are brought together here by the cream and thyme.Prep20 minCook30 minServes425g unsalted butter1 tbsp rapeseed oil200gsmoked bacon, rind removed and discarded, the rest cut into 1cm pieces or lardons1 small white onion, peeled and thinly sliced6 sprigs fresh thymeSalt andblack pepper½ small celeriac(about 200g), peeled and cut into 1cm cubes250ml dry cider250ml double cream2kgsustainably sourced mussels, washed and beards removed25g fresh parsley, roughly choppedPut the butter and oil in a deep, heavy-based saute pan for which you have a lid, and set it on a low to medium heat. Once the butter has melted, tip in the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, to render the fat. Stir in the sliced onion and thyme, season to taste, and cook, stirring, for five to six minutes more. Once the onion is lightly golden, tip in the cubed celeriac and cook gently, stirring from time to time, for 12-15 minutes, until soft and starting to caramelise.Turn up the heat, add the cider and cream, and bring the mix to just below a boil. Tip in the mussels, give everything a quick stir, then cover and leave to cook for three to five minutes, shaking the pan every now and then, until all the mussels are cooked and the shells are open (discard any that refuse to do so).Take the pan off the heat, gently stir in the parsley and serve straight from the pan with good baguette and more cider.Celeriac rarebitView image in fullscreenWill Devlin’s celeriac rarebit.Celeriac is one of the few vegetables that’s still in the ground during the winter months. It’s underrated and often the last veg standing in the vegetable box, but it’s also one of the tastiest things you can eat on a cold day. All root vegetables benefit from the temperatures plummeting below freezing, because the starch turns into sugars, meaning the root tastes beautifully sweet and nutty. Celeriac works perfectly with the mellow onions and buttery cheese in this dish, which makes a lovely vegetarian main course, or cut into slices and served with soup.Prep20 minCook1 hr 10 minServes4-61¼kgsea salt, plus ½ tsp extra for the rarebit mix175g egg whites(ie, about 4-5)1 mediumceleriac(about 600g)20g unsalted butter1tbsp rapeseed oil4 large onions, peeled and finely sliced6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked75ml cider200g block cheddar, a good, buttery one, ideallyHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. For the salt crust, whisk the 1¼kg salt and egg whites in a large bowl until fluffy.Clean the celeriac, then trim off the roots and any leaves. Dry the celeriac, put it on a tray and pack the salt and egg white mix all around it, so it’s completely encased. Bake for 45 minutes, then remove and leave to cool slightly.While the celeriac is roasting, melt the butter and oil in a small casserole pot for which you have a lid. Add the sliced onions, thyme leaves and half a teaspoon of salt, cover and leave to sweat gently, stirring occasionally, for anything up to 40 minutes, until the onions are soft and jammy. Turn up the heat, add the cider, leave to bubble away for a couple of minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated, then take off the heat and set aside to cool.Slice the cheese into ½cm-thick slabs. Release the celeriac from its salty crust, then peel off the brown, papery skin (or use a thumbnail or small knife to scrape it off). Cut the celeriac into 1cm-thick discs and arrange these in a single layer, spaced apart, on a clean baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Spread a tablespoon or two of the cidery onions on each slice of celeriac, then top with a slice of cheese.Return to the oven for 15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling, then serve hot, ideally with a glass of cider.Will Devlin is chef/owner ofThe Small Holding, in Kilndown, near Cranbrook, Kent, and ofBirchwoodin Flimwell, East SussexThe Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Instead of the traditional white sauce, each pasta tube is filled with cream cheese, mozzarella and a savoury mixture made with mushrooms and shredded leftover ham, either off a whole boiled ham or ready-sliced.Ham lasagne rollsThis recipe is an easy win and great fun to make. Kids love it, too, and it can easily be made vegetarian by replacing the meat with wilted greens such as spinach, kale or/and beetroot leaves.Even a small amount of ham will add flavour and nutrition to this dish. I rarely buy sliced ham, because it’s so hard to find any made with free-range pork. Occasionally, however, I’ll boil a gammon and slice it into ham.Meatis always best cooked on the bone, but that can be hard to cut around, and it’s those scraps that can be cut off and shredded into this dish (sliced works just as well, too, of course).You can use fresh lasagne sheets for this, but they can be expensive, so I used dried ones that I blanched in plenty of salted boiling water. To avoid them sticking together, drop in each sheet separately and wait 10 seconds before putting in the next one, then stir every now and then for about five minutes, until the sheets are malleable but still undercooked. This will help keep a bit of bite and chew in the rolls.This recipe is inspired by New Zealand’s national treasure,Jo Seagar, who has had a prolific career on TV and as a food writer. You can find many of her recipes onLove Food Hate Waste, an international campaign for climate action that provides knowledge and expertise to help people save food from the bin, and which I highly recommend for all sorts of waste-saving recipes, tips and facts.Serves4Olive oil200g mushrooms, sliced – the variety is up to you, though a good mixture is always welcome3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped150-200g leftover ham, shreddedSalt and black pepper1 tsp chilli flakes, or to taste (optional)1 tbsp vinegar– cider, wine or balsamic400g tinned chopped tomatoes1 pinch finely grated lemon zest, to taste (optional)12 lasagne sheets, fresh or dried and blanched (see recipe introduction)200gcream cheese150g mozzarella60g parmesan12 black olives, pitted (optional)Put a glug of olive oil in a saucepan over a medium-high heat, add the sliced mushrooms and fry, stirring, for about seven minutes, until they brown. Add two of the chopped garlic cloves and the shredded ham, stir for a minute, then season to taste and transfer to a bowl to cool.To make the tomato sauce, put the same pan back on a medium heat, add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, the last chopped clove of garlic and an optional teaspoon of chilli flakes. Before the garlic browns, add the vinegar and chopped tomatoes, and bring to a simmer to thicken. Season to taste and add an optional grating of lemon zest.Lay out all the lasagne sheets on a work surface, then spread the cream cheese all along the length of each sheet. Evenly scatter over the grated mozzarella, then spoon the ham mixture on top. Roll each sheet into a cigar and arrange side by side in an enamel baking dish. Pour the tomato sauce over the top, scatter over the grated parmesan and dot the pitted olives around and about. Bake in a 240C (220C fan)/gas 9 oven for 20 minutes, until browned and bubbling, then remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes before serving.Explore more on these topicsPastaWaste notFoodFood wasteMain courseTomatoesPorkMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The trouble with packaged varieties – even the products like apple crisps that promise to be purer than pure – is they are teaching your baby that food comes from a rustly packet with a cute logo on the front. It’s a training in eating crisps (something most of us don’t need much encouragement to do). The glorious thing about choosing a baby’s snacks (from six months on) is that they don’t yet have any concept of what is considered normal. A six-month-old doesn’t know many British people would consider it weird to snack on a stalk of steamed broccoli or a finger of plain tofu or a cold homemade fishcake, any of which would make an excellent baby snack. A baby can eat almost any food you eat, so long as the texture is right and it isn’t high in salt. From nine months on, do as Japanese parents do and pack a pair of baby food scissors in your bag so you can cut your food – plain pasta, noodles and so on – into baby-sized pieces (six-month-olds are better off with bigger chunks of soft or crunchy food).Anything, no matter how bitter or sour or bland, can start to taste good if you have enough positive memories of being fed it by a beloved parent. Not that it’s always easy to get there, either for the parent or the child. Picky eating is a real thing and it has a strong genetic component. If you think your child is a selective eater, seek help from a qualified dietitian and be very kind to yourself as you wait for mealtimes and snacktimes to get happier.NB never leave your child unsupervised to eat and before you start weaning,read thison the difference between gagging and choking, and what to do if they do choke (which is thankfully much, much rarer than you’d think).Instantthings to buy on the hoofA ripe banana (but you knew this).Boiled eggs: the ready-boiled ones are unsalted, and more nutritious than any baby food.Ready-sliced mild cheese such as Leerdammer or emmental (those long flat slices are safer than cubes, to avoid choking).A tub of plain whole yoghurt, full fat (remember your baby doesn’t yet know that sweetened yoghurt is considered normal).Canned pears or peaches or mandarin segments (in their juice) are soft enough to be offered as a finger food from six months on.Quick homemadeoptions tobring with youLarge pieces of almost any veg steamed until soft.Sweet potato: either microwave it and serve the inside flesh as an instant puree or make large wedges of sweet potato chips (peel, cut into chunky fingers, toss in olive oil and cook on a baking sheet in a hot oven for 25 minutes). Cool and pack for an energising snack. Remember: your baby does not know that chips are normally served hot.Bread: some crust from a loaf of white sourdough, the best quality you can buy (with no seeds or grains). For six-month-olds, you want to start with crusty pieces of bread or toast. Even the most expensive artisanal bread will work out way cheaper than bags of baby snacks. Store it sliced in the freezer and toast as needed. Fingers of toast can be spread with a little nut butter, cream cheese, ricotta or hummus.Baby frittata: cook any peeled and prepped veg until very soft, then chop finely, saute in olive oil for a minute or two and mix with a few eggs and a spoonful or two of grated parmesan (optional). Divide between muffin cases in a muffin tray and bake for 12-15 minutes at 180C or until set and golden. Cool before giving to your baby.Pancakes:there’s never a bad time for a pancake as a snack, whatever your age. Trythis basic template, eaten on its own or made into a more substantial meal, perhaps with cheese or spinach and bechamel. Crepes can be tricky for six-month-olds (that flatness can glom to the roof of the mouth), so save that pleasure for nine months plus.Here are two ideas for baby pancakes that are good at any temperature and any time of day: one with vegetables and one with fruit. They are far more nourishing and delicious than any commercial baby snack.And two simple recipesBroccoli cloudcakesThe great thing about this recipe – apart from being an instantly lovable way to eat broccoli – is that these cloudcakes are equally delicious for babies and parents (who very much need feeding, too). I’d add salt and pepper to the batter for the adult portions. I love them for a light dinner with a quick tomato sauce alongside, made by simmering a smashed clove of garlic with a spoonful of oil and a can of tomatoes. For babies (six months plus), eat from the hand, warm or cold. Makes 12 large cloudcakes or 18-20 smaller ones.300g broccoli, trimmed and cut into florets250g ricotta (one tub)4 eggs, separated100g plain flour1/2 tsp baking powder if making for older toddlers (you may want to avoid under the age of one, though it’s up to you)A grating of fresh nutmegButter to cookFirst steam or microwave the broccoli until very soft (about 8 minutes in a steamer or 5-6 minutes in a covered bowl with a splash of water in the microwave).Blitz with a hand-held blender until pureed.Mix together the ricotta, yolks, flour, nutmeg, broccoli puree and baking powder (if using).In a separate bowl whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form: it should look snowy white.Using a large metal spoon or a spatula, stir a small spoonful of whites into the batter to lighten it. Then fold the rest of the whites into the mixture.Heat the oven to 180C.Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add a dot of butter and drop spoonfuls of batter into the pan, three or four at a time. Cook for around two minutes each side or until golden on both sides, flipping with a fish slice or palette knife.Put them on a parchment-lined tray in the oven for a couple of minutes to finish cooking.These store well in a container in the fridge for up to three days; leftover batter keeps in the fridge for two or three days.For a baby, leave them to cool to room temperature before serving.You can substitute any freshly made vegetable puree of same weight for the broccoli: cauliflower, frozen corn, spinach, peas or carrots would all be good.Banana and cinnamon pancakesVery nutritious and ridiculously simple to make, have these for breakfast or pack some for a snack on the go. Makes eight baby-sized pancakes; double up if you want more – and don’t forget to eat some yourself!1 banana, the riper the better (about 100g peeled weight) or 100g apple puree50g porridge oats or jumbo rolled oats20g ground almonds (leaveout for nut allergy sufferers)1 eggA pinch or two of cinnamon (or ground ginger)A little butter or oilIn a measuring jug, blitz the banana (or apple), oats, almonds (if using), cinnamon and egg to a smooth batter. The texture is better if you leave the batter to stand for 30 minutes but don’t worry about this if you are in a hurry.Heat a frying pan over medium heat, add a little butter or oil and dollop out small tablespoons of batter (three or four per batch).Cook for around two minutes each side or until golden brown, flipping with a spatula. Turn down the heat if the pancakes threaten to scorch.Continue to cook the rest of the batter in the same way.Let them cool a little before giving to your baby or bring along in a bag or box for outings.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthChildrenNutritionFoodSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"
