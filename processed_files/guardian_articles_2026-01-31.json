Lateral bar crowding has been a mainstay of the UK pub for as long as anyone can remember.Photograph: David Gee 5/AlamyAt Wolfpack, a taproom in north-west London, run by the brewing company of the same name for whom Loebenberg is the managing director, the problem has come from nowhere but is hurting business and the experience of his customers.“It’s like the one person did it once and since then everyone has followed like lemmings, they all just copy each other’s behaviour,” said Loebenberg. Staff at Wolfpack have had to begin walking over from behind the taps to free customers from the queue and send them to the bar to get served.“We’ve trained our guys to say: ‘Please come forward, don’t queue,’” he said.“If we could figure out why, then we would find a remedy. But there’s no rhyme and reason.”Jess Riley, a manager at Wylam Brewery, a large bar and events space in Newcastle, believes that the pub queue epidemic began around the same time that a different outbreak spread across Britain.“I think it was the pandemic,” said Riley. “It wasn’t a thing before 2020, and then all of a sudden people really started to like a single-file line after Covid. I know we’re British and we like a queue, but it’s ridiculous.”Riley says that despite Wylam having multiple bars to get served from, with the largest measuring over 20ft (6 metres) in length, there are still customers who insist on forming an orderly queue, no matter how much it annoys the bar staff, with lines of customers sometimes “snaking around the building” owing to people refusing to spread across the available space.“We’re a big place with massive bars, but some people just refuse to stop queueing,” said Riley.“I’ve argued with customers who queue before because I serve people who come to the bar and they’ve said it’s unfair, and I just said: ‘The whole bar is empty, why are you standing there when there’s all this space.’”View image in fullscreenIt may be that the queue to pay respects to Queen Elizabeth II in 2022 changed people’s attitudes to queueing.Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/APAccording to John Drury, a professor of psychology at the University of Sussex, people’s attitudes around public activities such as going for drinks and attending music and sports events have changed since the pandemic, sometimes negatively.“For people who work in these industries, when we’ve spoken to them, a lot say that behaviour has gotten worse post-pandemic,” said Drury.“They say it has become normalised, and when you ask the general public, their response is more mixed, because not all of them realise that their behaviour has changed.”Pubs and live music venues to get support after business rates backlashRead moreDrury, who is himself a supporter of the queueing system at pubs, believes that it adds an element of fairness that is not found when “crushing around the bar”.He specialises in the behaviour of crowds and was a consultant for the planning of thequeue to pay respects to Queen Elizabeth IIafter her death in 2022. He believes that despite the fact queueing at the bar is at times illogical, social pressure means that it is likely to persist.“Its a new norm and norms are neither rational nor irrational. A norm means not only something that people generally do, it also means something that people in your group think is the right thing to do, so if you resist it, you are going to be regarded as a deviant, a troublemaker, a pain.“And people don’t want to be put in that position,” said Drury, adding that even though data shows that the amount of time people wait when queueing rarely goes down, “people may still prefer it, knowing they’re waiting just as long as the person in front of them”.Explore more on these topicsPubsHospitality industryAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We need this, don’t we? We need them. The TV show ended in 1981, yet decades later, memes of Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal et al still circulate. We give their movies Oscars. Their version ofA Christmas Carolis a non-negotiable tradition for anyone with sense. Jim Henson’s furry anarchists bring us together like few things can. As a beady eyed fun-sponge, I can’t help but wonder – why?In an 1810 essay, German poet Heinrich von Kleist argued that puppets demonstrate pure grace: a weightless unself-consciousness that humans long for but never achieve. He was talking about marionettes, suspended from strings. Yet Muppets are hand puppets; extensions of a body. They have weight. As for grace, have you seen how Kermit moves? His arms flap, and he bounces vertically, while moving forwards. It’s hard to imagine a less efficient walk. That frog, he silly.That’s why we love them. Do we not, too, know ourselves to be odd, hapless psychological caricatures? Do our plans not also lead to flaming wreckage? Do we not long to put on a vaudeville-style variety show in a classic theatre?Which brings us to the 2026 Muppet Show (Disney+, from Wednesday 4 February), with executive producerSeth Rogenon board. It’s a one-off, but could lead to a whole new series, the trailer reveals, “depending on how tonight goes”. Happily, it hasn’t been updated so Fozzie is doing bits on TikTok, or Rowlf protesting about streaming royalties. The guys are still trying to put on that variety show, and it’s still all going wrong.Something I love about these geniuses made of rod and felt is their lack of false modesty. They know we love them. Every famous person in the world would kill to be on the Muppets (though what a horrific negotiation). They turn this popularity to farce: producer Kermit replies to every act who expresses interest in appearing, “That sounds like fun!” It’s a polite way of saying no, he confides to stage manager Scooter. “That’s very indirect,” responds Scooter, with misgivings.Naturally, the overstuffed running order runs into crisis, with cuts needing to be made, a disaster for any fragile egos in the vicinity. At least guest starSabrina Carpenteris unflappable. Like Rogen, the former Disney channel child is a perfect fit. She gets in a saucy joke with a straight face, doesn’t upstage the real stars and proves herself game. Or fowl, given her musical number backed up by a bunch of hens.View image in fullscreenUnflappable … Seth Rogen in The Muppet Show.Photograph: Disney+A highlight is when Carpenter meets Miss Piggy, gushing how she has always loved her, and even copied her look. “My attorneys have taken note,” Piggy replies primly. The porcine diva is energetic throughout, trotting backstage to announce to anyone present that she is “on vocal rest”. Protecting her place in the running order, she undertakes a water-based romantic rescue mission, which culminates in a bisexual rug-pull moment. She’s doing a lot.Even the show within the show is good. Expect toe-tapping needle drops old and new. Skits include period-drama parody Pigs in Wigs, and a science segment about screen time, which ends with Beaker losing his eyes. Unlike Sesame Street, where the Muppets also appear, there is no educational agenda. The agenda is electric mayhem.The Muppets have always been subversive. I thrill to the meta winks, comic timing, the sheer weirdness of this world. There’s a throwaway bit in which audience memberMaya Rudolphdies and apparently goes to hell; it’s one of the sweetest things I’ve seen. Given that young people love choreographed K-pop and makeup tutorials, I wonder if nostalgic parents are now the primary audience. The kids may be just an alibi for them to watch.The show’s resident theatre critics, Statler and Waldorf, remain unmoved by the Muppets. (The fact they live in a box, and have never missed a show, suggest a resentful dependence.) They are my spiritual teachers, yet here we must part company. This show isn’t half bad; it’s all great. In 30 minutes, I laughed more than I can count. In the end, it doesn’t matter why we love the Muppets. Joy needn’t be dissected, like a frog on the table. It’s meant to be felt.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But many grieving families maintain that investigators are missing the full storySupported byAbout this contentRuth Michaelsonand Beril EskiSat 31 Jan 2026 06.45 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 14.34 ESTShareAlmost nothing seemed to scare Şebnem Köker. With her hair dyed fire-engine red, the 29-year-old nurse lived life by her own rules. Friends say she was so headstrong, she’d be getting ready for a night out in their home town, the Turkish coastal city of İzmir, and suddenly suggest a change of plan to a last-minute trip away. Even a prospective move to Canada didn’t seem to daunt her. But there was one thing that had terrified Şebnem: heights. Her father, Abdullah, says she was afraid to even tiptoe on to the slim balcony that wraps around the third-floor apartment they shared in İzmir.“She wouldn’t even have a cigarette or eat out there. She wouldn’t hang laundry on the balcony,” he says, sitting on the sofa in the darkened living room they once shared. A pouting portrait of Şebnem is tucked into the frame of a mirror on the opposite wall.View image in fullscreenThe Köker family home, with its photograph of Şebnem …View image in fullscreen… and the balcony she was too afraid to go out on. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianSo when police implied she had killed herself by jumping out of a hotel window, Abdullah was stunned. “She was my daughter for 29 years – it’s impossible she jumped from that height,” he says. “If she had wanted to kill herself, she would have taken pills or something else. There’s no way she would have done this.”What the police hadn’t mentioned was that there was another person in the hotel room at the time his daughter had allegedly hurled herself to her death.Sebnem had told her father she was going to visit friends in Istanbul. To her friends she had mentioned a married man she was going to meet – not for anything serious, just a weekend of fun. He was a commercial ship captain she’d seen off and on for about a year. Abdullah was a little perturbed when she called from an unknown number to say she had lost her phone: his normally confident daughter sounded out of sorts. He laughed and gently told her to call her phone on the one in her hand. It was the last time they would ever speak.The next thing Abdullah remembers is being shaken awake around dawn on the day his daughter was due to return. His distressed brother-in-law said Şebnem had been in an accident. Within minutes they had piled into the car, starting a frantic five-hour journey to Istanbul.Abdullah remembered the call from the unknown number as he crossed into Istanbul, and dialled it. “I couldn’t hold her; she died in my arms,” an unfamiliar male voice said, before abruptly hanging up. This was how Abdullah learned his daughter was dead.The police had failed to disclose a key detail to Şebnem's father: she was not alone on the night she diedHe was shown Şebnem’s body in a municipal morgue; he could see blood seeping on to the metal table. Mortuary workers handed him a document saying she had fallen 9 metres (30ft) from a hotel window on to metal railings below. Abdullah was too deep in shock to read it, let alone understand what it implied.The moment he entered the local police station, officers asked if Şebnem had been suicidal, then bombarded him with questions about her mental health – but he got the feeling they had already made up their minds. “They were guiding me to believe it was suicide,” he says. “But they never provided any evidence – if they had, I would have taken it and moved on.”There was a lot Abdullah didn’t yet understand as he sat in an Istanbul police station on that hot day in June five years ago. Prosecutors inTurkeyhold the power to judge whether any death warrants investigation in the crucial initial hours; in Şebnem’s case, police visited the scene, but the prosecutor did not, indicating the authorities didn’t see any need to investigate whether she had been pushed to her death.View image in fullscreenThe hotel room window (with light on) from which Şebnem Köker fell to her death.Photograph: Bradley Secker/The GuardianBut even as Abdullah was forced to field questions about his daughter’s mental health, the police had failed to disclose a key detail. Şebnem was not alone on the night she died. The man in the hotel room with her, the last person to see her alive, was also at the police station, to give a witness statement – he was not yet considered a suspect. Commercial captain Timuçin Bayhan told police he didn’t see her fall as he was asleep in another room in the hotel suite: “I heard a thud … I thought she might have fallen down the stairs as she was drunk.”An autopsy would show Şebnem had significant alcohol in her blood. A hotel worker would give evidence that Şebnem appeared to be drunk on the day she died. But Yunus Gençay, who had worked with her from 2016 to 2019 and who accompanied Abdullah to the morgue and police station, later testified that she wasn’t known as a big drinker. He also said when they met in the police station yard that day, Bayhan gave him a different account: that he had gone down to the hotel reception to collect a beer delivery when he heard a noise. After returning to find their room empty, he ran downstairs, where Şebnem “passed away in his arms”. He and his lawyer deny this exchange ever happened.In his initial statement to police, Bayhan said he warned Şebnem she might fall. “Don’t sit by the window, something will happen to you,” he recalled telling her.Hundreds of women are recorded inTurkish government dataevery year as having taken their lives by “throwing themselves from a high place”. The numbers have grown exponentially: one in every four female suicides in Turkey is now attributed to this cause, compared with one in five 10 years ago. State records for 2024 state more than 250 women died this way.Their grieving families, along with campaigners against gender-based violence, say these figures conceal cases where women did not jump but were pushed. Many say they have struggled for years to get justice and claim officials are ignoring or obscuring femicides – murders of women targeted because of their gender.“Autopsies start at the crime scene: police must treat these cases as suspicious and collect all the evidence available,” says doctor and women’s rights campaigner Gülsüm Kav. “But even if they do, prosecutors can still decide it’s an accident or a suicide and close the case.” The increase in these cases, she says, is linked to improved forensic techniques. “We used to see women dying due to poisoning, but now, with blood tests, you can see if someone was poisoned. So we see a decrease in that and an increase in deaths by falling. It’s harder to prove if these are a suicide, an accident or a femicide.”Kav has spent much of her professional life trying to get the Turkish state to take gendered violence seriously, founding the group We Will StopFemicide(WWSF) 15 years ago. Turkey discloses official statistics on femicide in an annual statement by interior minister Ali Yerlikaya, who last year declared triumphantly that only 217 women had been killed in the first 10 months of 2025. (In 2024 he was criticised for citing 32 cases in which he claimed female victims had not complied with restraining orders against violent partners: “They did not obey our warning, opened the door to a man, and he shot her inside.”)View image in fullscreen‘Police must treat these cases as suspicious,’ says Gülsüm Kav, founder of We Will Stop Femicide …View image in fullscreen… whose members held a press conference for the release of 2025 data on femicides and suspicious deaths. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianBut Kav says the Turkish government systematically undercounts femicides. WWSF collect its own data and says 2024 was a record year for violence against women, recording 394 femicides and 258 suspicious deaths, 40 of which were attributed to falling.What frustrates Kav is that forensics experts have ways to judge whether someone was pushed or fell. Researchers from the Netherlands developed computer modelling several years ago to answer this question. Campaigners in Turkey scored a landmark victory in 2019 with the conviction of businessman Çağatay Aksu for the killing of Şule Çet, a 23-year-old student, after a physics report by a forensics expert proved he had pushed her from the 20th floor of an Ankara high-rise. In Kav’s view, suspicious “deaths by falling” could be conclusively investigated with proper forensics.It was at Şebnem’s funeral, the day after her death, that doubts began to increase. As friends and family gathered in the Kökers’ apartment, Abdullah and Şebnem’s childhood best friend, Nevraz Sığın, shared their rising scepticism about the idea that she had killed herself. A family friend who is a police officer joined them. He asked Abdullah for Şebnem’s details to access the witness statements gathered in Istanbul, then told him, “I read the statements. This is a homicide.”This was how Abdullah learned Şebnem was not alone before she died. He called Bayhan again, to go over what happened. “The way he told the story was very different from what I heard at the police station,” Abdullah says. “He described it more like she fell or there was an accident. After that conversation, we noticed contradictions.”That Şebnem would sit near an open window high up, let alone jump from there to her death, made no sense to Sığın. The pair were lifelong friends who grew up on the same street in İzmir. A bond formed during childhood sleepovers became a teenage alliance, planning nights out and battling anyone they felt might hold them back. Sığın recalls her friend as a social butterfly who liked to party but never overdid it, fond of spontaneous trips to a nearby beach town. She had a softer side, though – often tucking her father in when he fell asleep on the sofa after a few drinks – and was weighing a move to join her mother and brother in Canada.“She was always going to do exactly what she wanted to do,” Sığın says, proudly. “Usually she was dating several people at the same time, and this guy happened to be one of them; it wasn’t a serious thing.”View image in fullscreenLawyer Nevraz Sığın, who represented the Köker family in court …View image in fullscreen… visits her friend’s grave with Şebnem’s  father. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianStill reeling from her loss, Sığın, a lawyer, stepped up to represent the Köker family. First, she visited the little three-storey hotel where Şebnem fell to her death. When local media released security camera footage of the couple fighting on a dark street outside it – Şebnem in a summer dress, squaring her shoulders at Bayhan – Sığın’s suspicions grew. She spoke with waiters in a nearby fish restaurant, who recalled the pair angrily leaving what was meant to be a romantic dinner there.Sığın also got access to the police records, including a video they took inside the hotel room the morning after Şebnem’s death. This appears to show evidence of a clash: large spots of blood on the floor and a torn dark green-painted fingernail tangled in the bedsheet.Then there were Şebnem’s conversations with her friends. In a text, she told one, Hatice, that Bayhan had been reading her messages. Then she overheard him on the phone talking to his wife, using the same nicknames as he did for her. “I couldn’t have learned a better lesson,” she said. This entire fling had been a waste of her time.The day before she died, Şebnem called another friend, Ufuk Köse, who works just outside Istanbul. Köse later told police she had sounded anxious. “She said, ‘I’m in a bit of a tight spot. If I call you, can you come and pick me up?’” Şebnem never called back.Sığın hounded the prosecutor and the authorities interviewed Bayhan again – this time as a suspect. A week after Şebnem’s death, Bayhan told the prosecutor the pair had been drinking since the early afternoon before arguing over his refusal to leave his wife; she tore off her fingernail by tugging on his arm. Then he offered new information he hadn’t mentioned when interviewed as a witness: that day, Şebnem had discussed a suicide attempt from over a decade earlier, “by taking pills”. She took antidepressants for a while, he said, but disliked the weight she gained.The prosecutor wouldn’t say why he thought it was a suicide.  He was supposed to go to the scene, but he didn’tAfter this conversation he fell asleep in another room, he said, before waking to a loud noise. The window was open and he peered out to see Şebnem’s body on the railings below. “I had no motive to kill Şebnem or to encourage her to commit suicide,” he said. “I didn’t see how she fell. I don’t know if she committed suicide.”When the prosecutor sought arrest, compelling him to appear in court, Bayhan maintained his innocence. Witnesses had heard shouting but only because he had to yell at Şebnem to get her to listen after a day of drinking, he said. “I kept my distance … I warned her that she could fall out of the window because she was drunk,” he added. He was released on bail to await trial.Sığın began to fixate on crime scene photographs – so gruesome that the first time she saw them she fainted. They show the contorted position Şebnem landed in, arched away from the window, red hair skimming the ground. The railings on which she was impaled circle a patio below, covered in netting. When investigators threw a weighted mannequin from the hotel window to simulate Şebnem’s fall, the results suggested her body must have fallen rather than been pushed.When asked about the earlier suicide attempt, Sığın is dismissive. “She was a character who wanted things to happen on her schedule,” she says, so one time she took some of Abdullah’s pills in a show of defiance. Şebnem hadn’t taken antidepressants for years, she adds.Three years earlier, in February 2018, two passing medics spotted a group at the side of a busy highway on the outskirts of Istanbul and went to help. The group were gathered around the still-warm, motionless body of Aysun Yıldırım, debating what to do after finding her on concrete steps below the three-storey office block she worked in. Alarmed, the medics called an ambulance.For her mother Hüsniye, life is split into before and after she got the call to say Aysun was in hospital. “She had called her sister to say she’d be late for dinner a couple of hours before,” she says. “Then her friend called.” Hüsniye and her husband İbrahim raced to the hospital, where they were told Aysun was in a critical condition. She was pronounced dead soon after. They believe if she had been taken to hospital earlier, she might have lived.Retelling the worst evening of her life in the family’s living room, Hüsniye describes it as an “out of body experience”. The prosecutor assigned to the case told İbrahim he was so confident Aysun had jumped 17 metres (56 feet) from her office window to her death that they would release her body for burial only if he signed a document attesting she had taken her own life. Hüsniye begged her husband not to sign and eventually a workaround was found. “The prosecutor wouldn’t say why he thought it was a suicide,” İbrahim says. “He was supposed to go to the scene, but he didn’t.”İbrahim kneels on the living room rug to demonstrate the strange position his daughter was found in. It makes them doubt whether she fell at all. “I didn’t believe it was suicide … There was no blood,” he says. An autopsy showed Aysun died from internal organ damage and a brain haemorrhage due to the impact of the fall.View image in fullscreenHüsniye Yıldırım, mother of Aysun, who died after falling from her office window …View image in fullscreen… and lawyer Leyla Suren, who believes ‘there was enough evidence for a criminal case’. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianWhen Hüsniye and İbrahim talk about their daughter, they describe a young woman on the brink of achieving her dreams. Sociable and hard-working, the 26-year-old had taken a job in a shipping office as she prepared for an exam to become a customs official. Hüsniye knew she had gone out for coffee a few times with a client, but felt her daughter wanted to end the relationship. When they spoke the night before she died, Aysun was also talking about quitting her job to focus on her exam.After she fell, Hüsniye and İbrahim began visiting the prosecutor to press him for details of the investigation. They grew frustrated at the slow pace. İbrahim describes chasing forensic authorities, and being handed a bag of his daughter’s belongings. They could see where she died from the prosecutor’s window.The Yıldırıms believe there was evidence to cast doubt on Aysun having died by suicide, if prosecutors were willing to examine it – including that she may not have been alone when she fell. They point to messages Aysun had sent to the client she had been seeing, politely but firmly asking him to stop contacting her. Perhaps when he ended his marriage they could talk: “Until then, don’t write to me. Take care of yourself – I entrust you to God,” she wrote, employing a common Turkish phrase used to let someone down gently.Aysun’s client was interviewed by police as a witness in the hours after she died. He described how he grew worried after she didn’t answer his texts, before arriving at her office to see the lights were on. Distressed, he called her boss, who he says found her body on the steps. In later statements he describes visiting the offices, but waiting in a friend’s car. His friend also spoke to police, but in his account he says he discovered Aysun’s body on the concrete steps below her office. He recounted checking for a pulse, and finding she was still alive.Years later, standing outside the office block, there is little sign of what happened there. The steps where Aysun’s body was found have been smoothed over with concrete. There is a large dent in some railings, caused when police hurled a mannequin from the window to try to verify how Aysun could have fallen. But the mechanics whose workshops sit below Aysun’s office remember her – and one recalls the night she died.Car painter Orhan Harman peers into the distance and scratches at his chin as he tells the story he has clearly told and retold. He was working late that night when he “heard a scream and a noise like the thud of something heavy”. Thinking there had been a car accident, he walked out of his workshop and peered round the corner, but saw nothing. He went back to work.There were two people in a room: one became a witness and the other a corpse. Why?Harman recalls another detail: a familiar face had shown up that night, a long-haired man whose car he’d spotted Aysun getting into a few times: “Maybe it was her boyfriend.” Harman had got the impression Aysun’s bosses liked this man, so when he asked for the key to the building, Harman, seeing the lights on, let him in.“There’s an extra door upstairs. If there was any danger, she could have just not let him in. He didn’t look like a guy who’d do anything,” he muses. But eight years later, Harman struggles to remember if he opened the door before or after he heard the scream. He gave the police a statement at the time, he says, but never thought about it after – and no one had asked until now.The only reminders of what happened here are when occasional protesters show up. “She was so friendly, so nice, we were always saying hello. I’m glad I didn’t see her body; it would have hit me so hard,” Harman says.In December 2018, the prosecutor closed Aysun’s case after concluding it was a suicide. Hüsniye and İbrahim were distraught. In their view, the justice system they once believed in had betrayed them.Searching desperately for help, İbrahim remembered Kav, the doctor and campaigner he once worked with at a public hospital. He picked up the phone and called her. By chance she was sitting next to Leyla Süren, one of WWSF’s lawyers, who agreed to take on Aysun’s case.Sitting in her wood-panelled office in central Istanbul, Süren describes her shock when she opened the case file. Police had collected plenty of evidence, but Süren felt the prosecutor had ignored key parts of it, including the messages on Aysun’s phone. “There was enough evidence for a criminal case,” she says.View image in fullscreenWomen’s right protesters hold a poster of Şule Çet, a student who was pushed to her death from the 20th floor of an Ankara high-rise.Photograph: Bradley Secker/The GuardianForensic evidence had sat unexamined: it showed Aysun had DNA under her fingernails that matched the client she had been texting the night she died. Süren requested phone location data, which showed he was at the crime scene within four hours of Aysun’s death. Police had also found a footprint on a couch in her office.“There were no fingerprints on the narrow window she allegedly jumped from. But you can’t jump from there – you’d have to hold on to the window,” Süren says.After she applied to Turkey’s constitutional court to get the case reopened, a new prosecutor took it up and arrested Aysun’s client in late 2019. Things finally seemed to be moving forward – until the world was shut down by Covid-19 . The client was held in pre-trial detention for five months, before being released.Little has changed in the years since, despite Süren’s efforts. Progress has been so slow, Süren says, that no matter what happens, she intends to take Aysun’s case to the European court of human rights. She believes the Turkish authorities discriminated against Aysun by failing to investigate her death because of her gender.Hüsniye and İbrahim are still groping in the dark, trying to figure out what happened. Their pain is palpable as we talk in their sweltering living room, a portrait of Aysun smiling from the wall above the television. “It feels like there is only justice for the powerful,” Hüsniye says. “Even if it comes late, justice must be served.”Progress was similarly slow in the investigation into Şebnem’s death. Abdullah grew so desperate that he went on a local daytime television show that specialises in unsolved crimes. As its investigators got close to giving their account of what happened that night, he got a call from the prosecutor, inviting him to a meeting. Bayhan would be indicted on murder charges, he said, but he would issue a gag order – meaning Abdullah could no longer appear on television in his search for answers.Still, Abdullah used the meeting to ask questions – such as why the prosecutor had declined to visit the crime scene. “There were two people in a room: one became a witness and the other a corpse. Why?” Turkey’s justice ministry declined to comment for this article on either Şebnem’s or Aysun’s cases.Bayhan’s case finally made it to court in early 2022. His lawyer said he was innocent, pointing out if Şebnem had felt in danger, she could have told someone, and adding that Bayhan was consistent in his statements to prosecutors and the court. Bayhan said they’d argued but had “no physical contact” other than when Şebnem tore her nail on his arm. Asked about his varying accounts of that night, he said prosecutors hadn’t written down everything he’d said, and accused Gençay and Abdullah of lying in their testimonies. “If anyone has been involved in a struggle for justice, it is me. I understand the family’s pain, but I will not allow them to ruin my life. I did not kill Şebnem,” Bayhan said.Sığın asked the court to consider that hotel staff had entered the room after the police left, potentially interfering with key evidence such as fingerprints on the window frame. She also demanded a physics report be commissioned from a forensics expert to analyse how Şebnem fell, just like in the Şule Çet case from 2019 – this would show definitively, beyond the mannequin test, whether she was pushed. Her request was denied.Bayhan was acquitted in late 2022. The court found that, while it had heard many witnesses, there was a “lack of concrete evidence” to prove beyond any doubt that he committed murder. The judge highlighted Şebnem’s high level of intoxication. The couple arguing was part of “the normal course of life” and witness testimony, plus the mannequin test, “were not consistent” with the idea that Bayhan pushed or threw Şebnem out the window. The judgment also cited the Turkish constitution, which obliges the state to treat women and men equally.View image in fullscreenŞebnem Köker’s bedroom …View image in fullscreen… and her father with Pera, the dog she left behind. Photographs: Bradley Secker/The GuardianBoth Abdullah and Sığın believe evidence to show Bayhan pushed Şebnem was available, if only the court had agreed to examine it. Bayhan’s lawyer disagrees. “This was a tragic incident. Whether Ms Köker fell or jumped is something we do not know. What we do know, according to the findings examined by the court, is that my client did not harm Ms Köker.”Sığın appealed against Bayhan’s acquittal twice until it reached Turkey’s highest appeals court. In June 2024, its chief public prosecutor’s office said the initial trial failed to interview key witnesses and examine evidence tampering – and that to understand what happened, the authorities should commission a physics report by a forensic expert, as Sığın had demanded. Bayhan’s lawyer maintains this would still exonerate him.Sığın and Abdullah still hold out hope that Şebnem’s death could be re-examined at the top appeals court. But, as with Aysun’s case, months have become years of waiting. Sığın has begun working as a lawyer for WWSF. When we meet in a sunlit rooftop restaurant in İzmir, she has just come from a court appearance. Some prosecutors in Turkey take violence against women seriously, she says, but “it’s a struggle against a system”.She carries the gruesome crime scene pictures of Şebnem on her phone, ready to work on the case at a moment’s notice. She wants to ensure that Abdullah never sees them.Abdullah, meanwhile, remains trapped in the apartment he once shared with his daughter, fixating on the details of her death. He longs to join his wife and son in Canada, but fears if he leaves, prosecutors will close Şebnem’s case. Instead he spends his days with Pera, the ageing King Charles spaniel she left behind, who whines in distress at even a minor separation.Şebnem’s room remains a shrine, a copy ofthe graphic novel Persepolison the bookshelf waiting to be read, her scrubs laid out on the bed as though she might return. Her cherry-red sneakers from the night she died lie nearby, near a door she never used, leading to the balcony she feared to stand on.Additional reporting: Nevin SungurExplore more on these topicsWomenShe countsTurkeyViolence against women and girlsFemicidefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As established in the first piece in our series, liberals have totally failed to grasp this fact. The right, however, are thriving in this new world. Future historians studying the role that fringe online ideas played in the US republic’s demise will be spoiled for choice. One episode in particular comes to mind: Tucker Carlson, a former primetime speaker at a Republican convention, inviting a white supremacist livestreamer, Nick Fuentes,on to his YouTube show in 2025for a chat in which he talked about the influence of “organised Jewry” in the US.Carlsonspent yearsechoing white nationalist talking points on his Fox News show, but Fuentes’ style – combiningNazi saluteswith cheeky grins – places him beyond the pale for broadcast television. However, under the logic of YouTube, the meeting of these two major influencers is almost inevitable. Platforms incentivise audience cross-pollination, which is why Fuentes routinely livestreams with figures such as Adin Ross and Andrew Tate, who are known more for their homophobia and misogyny than their thoughts on ethnostates.Establishment politicians have denounced Carlson, but despite – or perhaps because of – the backlash, his subscriberaccount continues to climb steadilyafter hosting Fuentes, who was rewarded for his appearance with morethan100,000 new X followers. For every corporate advertiser that pulls out, another selling, say, seed-oil-free beef tallow crisps will find a new market of people looking to resist establishment corruption with something natural and authentic.But this is not just about follower counts. It is also about harnessing online engagement and turning it into a worldview. If you can cultivate online engagement, you can create new political styles and advance even the most extreme political ideas, such astotal remigration. Only a year ago, this call to deport anyone with a migrant background – potentiallyeven naturalised citizens– wastoo toxicfor far-right parties to embrace openly. Now, the US Department for Homeland Securityposts calls for remigration on X,and Alice Weidel, leader of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – the second-largest party in the Bundestag – has incorporatedremigrationinto the party’s official platform.Reform UK – not so much a party as a corporation orbiting an influencer – understands the power of this politics well. When LBC’s Nick Ferrari recently tried to pin Nigel Farage down over Donald Trump’s dubious suggestion that paracetamol causes autism,Farage framed itas a question of national sovereignty, saying the important thing is not to cede ground to the World Health Organization, which “now seem to want to take some extraordinary powers that would allow them to lock us down in the future”. A large audience could interpret this as a reference to the“great reset” conspiracy, a vague conspiracy theory that encompasses the loss of civil liberties and the creation of a new economic system.This theory remains a touchstone years after the pandemic because it joins the dots between the upheaval of lockdown and the political and economic instability that has followed. This is why Joe Rogan and Tate were quick to link Labour’s digital ID scheme to the “great reset”. Reactionary digital politics tells a compelling story: a nebuloustheyhave gone too far and must be resisted. This niche online view then helps to shape a wider worldview that can influence voters during elections. Once ideas such as remigration or worries over the “great reset” find a mainstream audience, they exist alongside debates about cutting taxes and funding the NHS, and their extremist origins get buried.As well as the ability to influence public opinion, there is also the chance of earning cold hard cash for enterprising posters. The since-deleted X account @EuropeInvasions helped spark the July 2024 riots with a post claiming the Southport attacker was a “Muslim immigrant”. The post was viewed nearly 7m times. Over the next month, the account’s relentlessly Islamophobic posts attracted almost 240m views. X’s ad revenue-sharing programme is opaque, but based onother users’ stated earnings, in August 2024 @EuropeInvasions would have earned roughly $2,000.This convergence of monetary incentives with ideologically charged engagement produces a kind of ambient extremism in contemporary politics. Far-right ideas, memes and tropes that were once confined to the fringes of 4chan and Telegram now circulate as part of mainstream discourse, where they no longer stand out as extreme. In the span of a few weeks in the summer of 2024,Jordan Petersoninterviewed Farage, Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk. Robinson’s rants about grooming gangs did the best numbers. Soon after, Musk began calling Starmer “two-tier Keir” adopting one of Robinson’s favoured phrases, which Reform also adopted.Robinson’s blunt-force communication style wears thin, but the secret of his current success is his ability to tie his far-right project to the playfulness of meme culture and the self-help discourse of reactionary gurus such as Peterson. Musk welcoming him back to X has been a massive boon as well. As an influencer, he is in a far better position to shape British politics than he was as leader of the English Defence League. He can let the currents of the attention economy carry him along.There are risks involved: as Trump has learned, as his QAnon posting comes back to bite him with the Jeffrey Epstein debacle, many can feed online attention, but none can control it. Nor can they satiate it. Robinson firstclaimed victoryfor Labour’s hardline asylum reforms and then described the home secretary as a “Pakistani” who has “welcomed the invaders”. Musk has suggested that there could be civil war in the UK. Scenes from the US of masked agents nabbing people off the streets – and evenfrom daycarecentres – and shooting civilians is a grim reminder that what starts online can end in real-life violence.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London"

From the dais of the blond-wood committee room in Brussels, he was clear: “If anyone thinks that theEuropean Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t.”And ifEuropewanted to supplant the US nuclear deterrent, existing spending commitments would have to double, he added – “so hey, good luck!”Armed by America: how Europe’s militaries depend on the US – a visual analysisRead moreHis comments left some MEPs fuming. The former Dutch prime minister – who provoked mockery when hecalled Donald Trump “Daddy”– had already irritated some deputies with his robust defence of the US president’s interest in the Arctic.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, chided Rutte a day later on social media: “Europeans can and must take charge of their own security. Eventhe United States agrees. It is the European pillar of Nato.”Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, suggested a different approach: “We must go for a ​European army,” he told reporters in Brussels this week, adding, “I’m very much aware that you don’t do that from one day to ​another”. Europe, he said, needed “all sort​s of deterrence – economic, political, security deterrence – in our hands”.But a European army has always raised more questions than answers. Is it an EU, or Europe-wide army? A brand-new forcecommanded from Brussels, or a souped-up version of existing structures?View image in fullscreenJoint forces of the Swedish, Finnish, Italian and French army conduct an amphibious assault demonstration during the Nordic Response 24 military exercise above the Arctic Circle in Norway last March.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesSophia Besch, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, observed: “To supporters, it is a very visionary goal, and then to critics it is the symbol of overreach – and it’s just vague enough that we never have to really discuss details.”Behind the discordant public tones, however, lies a consensus that Nato’s European members need to pull their weight.Natomust “become more European” to maintain its strength, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week. “Europe must step up,” she told a defence industry audience. “No great power in history has ever outsourced its survival and survived.”The Nato alliance last yearpledged to increase defence spending to 5% national incomeby 2035. The EU, which includes 23 Nato countries among its 27 members, has embarked on an€800bn defence spending plan. But after a longholiday from history, can Europe get its act together?“The Europeans are moving in the right direction and can do it,” Camille Grand, a former Nato assistant secretary-general, told the Guardian. “It is a matter of a sustained effort over a few years. It is a matter of buying and acquiring the right set of capabilities to reduce their dependency on the US,” said Grand, now secretary general of the Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association for Europe.Europe’s ability to stand on its own two feet does not have a precise launch date. “It is not as if we could say on the 1st of January 2030: the Europeans will be completely autonomous,” Grand said.View image in fullscreenItalian marines take up positions during the Nordic Response 24 military exercise in Norway.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesBut the date matters because policymakers, responding to warnings from the security services about a possible Russian attack, say Europe should have “credible deterrence” to put off potential invaders by 2030.From the point of view of military planners, 2030 is “tomorrow”, said Grand, but Europe could achieve “significant progress” by then in acquiring stronger capabilities across a swathe of “strategic enablers”.This refers to a mixed bag of critical capabilities where the US dominates, such as intelligence, satellites, long-range missiles, airlift and ballistic missile defence. Europe probably would not “tick every single box by 2030” but “we can achieve significant progress”, Grand said. Although, he added, it would also require an “honest conversation with the US” that Europe would need some American assets beyond 2030.But Trump’s threats over Greenland and hot-cold support for Ukraine that often tips into Russian talking points, have called into question Washington’s commitment in a crisis.Tobias Billström, a former foreign minister of Sweden who helped negotiate his country’sNato entry, retains confidence that the US would come to Europe’s aid if the collective defence clause, article 5, was triggered. He pointed out the US benefitted from Nato, citing the location and military capabilities of Arctic members, such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland.Billström, who now works for Nordic Air Defence, a startup developing low-cost drone interceptors, said Europe would have to be ready to defend itself for years to come. “Regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, Russia will be, graphically, where it is. It will be revanchistic. It will be set on hybrid actions. It wants to disrupt. It’s going to have a very, very clear incentive to be aggressive against us for a foreseeable future.”View image in fullscreenHDMS Knud Rasmussen of the Royal Danish Navy patrolling near Nuuk in Greenland on 15 January.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APNot everyone is so sure about US guarantees. Besch, the defence expert at the Carnegie centre in Washington, thinks trust has gone. “I don’t think that there is very much illusion among any European policymakers now that they can trust in US security guarantees.”Europe, she suggested, had to shake off decades-old habits about defining its defence interests. Europe’s capability planning – “what we buy and what we develop” – is derived from Nato’s regional capability plans, which still rely on a substantive contribution from the US, she said.“The risk of what I believe is happening right now, is that we’re all spending huge amounts of money and will not actually be much more independent from the US in 10 to 15 years’ time, because that money is not being spent in a coordinated and directed way to actually replace these US enablers.”Money alone is not the answer to Europe’s defence weakness, as illustrated by the troubled €100bn Franco-German fighter jet project,beset by disagreement and mistrust between the developers. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, indicated this week that the project could bescaled down to joint systems, without an aircraft. A fighter-jet system without a fighter jet would be an emblem of European defence for all the wrong reasons.Meanwhile, Europe has long struggled to join up its defence spending, meaning costly duplication and a mishmash of different systems that hinder effectiveness on the battlefield. EU countries, for instance, have provided 10 different types of howitzer capable of firing 155mm shells to Ukraine “creating serious logistical difficulties for Ukraine’s armed forces”, according to a report by the former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi. In another example of fragmentation, Draghi noted EU member states operated 12 different types of battle tanks, while the US used one.View image in fullscreenA full-size model of the New Generation fighter developed by France, Germany and Spain is presented at Paris-Le Bourget airport.Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Besch, the problem runs deeper than national industrial rivalries. “The key question here is who is Europe, what is Europe, and then what are we actually trying to do? … If our standard for success is to replace everything the US does now with European capabilities, militaries, enablers etc, we are bound to fail,” she said.Europe, she said, needed to figure out its own strategic interests, for instance a European version of nuclear deterrence or how to safeguard its interests in regions from the Arctic to the Pacific, which could mean “cheaper, faster” systems.“My fear is that we are still caught up in this conversation around ‘can we replace the US’, rather than trying to decide what are we actually trying to do without them.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeNatoTrump administrationEuropean UnionUS foreign policyAerospace industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week it took two days, said Rebecca Horsington, chair of the Flooding on the Levels Action Group and a born-and-bred resident. A fierce barrage of storms from the Atlantic has drenched south-west England in January, saturating soils and supercharging rivers.Nearly 150 flood alerts in place across England in aftermath of Storm ChandraRead more“It’s déjà vu,” she said. “The stress and anxiety is palpable in the community. We’ve all been here before, we know what happens and it shouldn’t. But since 2014, the weather events are becoming more and more frequent and the rain just dumps now.”The climate crisis is here and now and this is its face in Britain, scientists told the Guardian. But the devastating impacts are accelerating faster than the work to keep communities protected, they said: torrential winter rains are arriving 20 years earlier than climate models projected. While those forced from homes engulfed by filthy water are suffering today, a darker question is looming: will some settlements have to be abandoned?Storm Chandra, which pummelled the south-west this week, followed hot on the heels of Storms Goretti and Ingrid. New 24-hourrainfall recordswere set in places in Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. Setting new records is the new normal in the climate crisis.0:48Storm Chandra hits UK and Ireland – videoSomerset council declared amajor incident on Tuesdayand across the south-west homes and businesses were flooded, communities cut off, schools closed, trains cancelled and dozens of people were rescued from stranded vehicles.“These events are getting more frequent and more serious,” said Bryony Sadler, a hairdresser from Moorland, a village on the Levels. She was planning an evacuation of her family and animals when the Guardian spoke to her this week as the waters rose. “The rain is heavier and more intense, the winds stronger.”rain graphSadler is right: the science is now crystal clear that winters are getting wetter in the UK due to global heating, hitting damp regions like the south-west hardest. The reason is simple physics: warmer air holds more water vapour, meaning heavier downpours – and it is getting worse.“There’s been massive changes over the last four or five years,” said Prof Hayley Fowler, an expert on climate change impacts at Newcastle University. “We’ve seen a rapid increase in warming and that has a huge knock-on effect on rainfall. We’re already experiencingchanges in UK winter rainfallthat the global and regional climate models predict for the 2040s – we’re 20 years ahead.”The extra water falling in the UK each year was equivalent to 3m Olympic-sized swimming pools, Fowler said: “That’s a lot of extra water and means that the ground is more generally saturated and more prone to flooding. That’s what we’ve seen in the south-west this week.”View image in fullscreenBryony Sadler was planning an evacuation of her family and animals when the Guardian spoke to her this week as the waters rose.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThe rain is also falling in more powerful bursts, withstorms now 20% more intense, according to the Met Office. There was no doubt about the culprit for the deluges, said Fowler: “It’s directly attributable to fossil fuel burning and the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. So it’s going to continue [getting worse] until we stop.”Global carbon emissions set another new record in 2025. The pastthree years are the hottest everrecorded.With no sign of the climate crisis ending any time soon, protecting communities from increasingly extreme weather is becoming ever more vital – but global heating is outpacing us.Fowler is a member of the adaptation subcommittee of the Climate Change Committee, the government’s official advisers: “We are very concerned about the widening gap between the action we’re taking in the UK and the impacts we’re feeling from climate change.Floodingis actually one of the areas that we are doing better at, which is slightly horrifying given the actual impacts we’re feeling almost every week now.”Her own view is that there is not enough investment to stop flooding: “There are a lot of plans, but there’s still a lack of delivery. Without resources going into trying to make communities resilient, there’s going to be fatalities, there’s going to be economic damage.”View image in fullscreenFlooding in Moorland on the Somerset Levels in 2014.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/AlamyFor the south-west, those resources were needed today, said Dr Martina Egedušević, a flooding scientist and engineer at the University of Exeter and an independent member of the Environment Agency’s South West Regional Flood Committee. “We are still funding flood protection like climate change is a future problem, but for communities in the south-west it is already here,” she said.On the ground, that matters. Bill Revans, the leader of Somerset council and member for the ward, including Moorland village, said: “We are now more frequently reaching this point where we need to get in extra support to be able to manage the water.” That means setting up high-volume pumps.“But if that resource was there permanently, it would be a case of flicking a switch rather than having to wait for cranes and contractors and all the other difficult project planning things needed to get that operation up and running,” he said.View image in fullscreenLeader of Somerset council Bill Revans says the area needs high-volume pumps to manage the water when it floods.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianSadler said: “We don’t get anywhere near the help we need. Help eventually comes from the government and then they forget about us until it gets bad again.”‘She rang me to say there was water coming into the house’ – This is climate breakdownRead moreEgedušević said: “Funding is often short term and reactive. Maintenance in particular is underfunded, and flood defences only work if they are maintained and there is a growing backlog.” She also backs more nature-based solutions to complement hard defences such as the Bridgwater tidal barrier. Planting trees, blocking upland drains and slowing the flow of water downstream all helped, she said.The south-west has always been vulnerable to flooding. “These storms coming in off the Atlantic hit the west of the country first, so Devon andCornwallsticking out like that into the ocean bear the brunt,” said Dr Amy Doherty, the manager of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre.The region also has high moors that catch the rain, steep valleys where streams can swell rapidly and many communities on rivers and coastlines, where rising sea level adds to the dangers.But the new climate-driven intensity of rain was bringing new peril: flash floods that overwhelmed drainage, said Egedušević: “So areas historically not classed as flood prone areas are now experiencing flooding, which can catch communities off guard. The drainage systems are frequently outdated and not designed for today’s rainfall extremes.”View image in fullscreenJames and Faye Wade, pictured at their home in Taunton, which flooded with 2.5 inches of water.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianJames Wade and his family in Taunton, now in emergency accommodation, sufferedflooding for the first timethis week thanks to blocked drains. “We have been here for 13 years and this has never happened before. Even during the huge floods of 2014 we were dry,” he said.Revans said: “We’ve only got so much money. As soon as you clean a drain out, it will start filling up again. I’d love to live in a world where we could maintain those drains to that high standard. But that’s not a situation that local councils are in at the moment.”Jim Flory, the Environment Agency (EA) environment manager for Wessex, who has worked in incident management in the south-west for 20 years, said: “We’re trying to keep ourselves ahead of the curve. But it is very, very difficult because you’re fundamentally dealing with a very complex system being influenced by factors such as climate change.”Due to an EA funding shortfall, the number of properties to be better protected from flooding by 2027 wascut in 2025 by 40%, while 500 of 2,000 new flood defence projects were abandoned. The EA said in November it was £34m short of its expected budget.A month earlier the environmental audit committee of MPshad warned: “The scale of investment remains insufficient relative to overall flood risk. The current system, though delivering important defences, is fragmented and reactive, leaving major gaps in long-term resilience that must be urgently addressed.”Three weeks after Storm Goretti hit Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly with 100mph winds, not everyone even has their phone lines and broadband back.The Cornwall councillor Juliet Line said: “Resilience is lacking in the infrastructure – the vulnerability of our drainage, sewerage and communications systems is being exposed more and more with each day of rain and wind.She added: “The council is doing the best it can with limited resources and drastically reduced funding from central government.

Some of us are now discussing how, if this is going to continue happening, are we going to cope as we get older.”But it is not just the south-west facing ever more floods as the climate crisis bites.Environment Agency dataestimates 6.3m properties in England are at risk of flooding, rising to 8m by 2050, with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland also hit hard.It’s also not just the damp British Isles. “This is all very new everywhere,” Egedušević said. “Everyone [across Europe] is failing to keep pace with climate changes. We are coming into the era when we are trying to live with these things, rather than fight them 100%.”View image in fullscreenMark Pugh, right, says his community is discussing how it is going to cope with weather and flood risks as residents age.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn Somerset, that means contemplating the previously unthinkable. “It may be that in the next 50 years, perhaps in the next 20, some homes around here will have to be abandoned,” said Mike Stanton, the chair of the Somerset Rivers Authority.Revans reflected on the local impact: “It’s a beautiful community here, tight-knit. Everyone’s really friendly and supportive of each other. They don’t deserve this.”Can communities like Moorland survive? “That’s an interesting question, isn’t it?” Revans said. “I would fight tooth and nail to be able to keep communities like this viable and going in the future. But ultimately, it’s a question of whether we’re prepared to spend the resource on keeping them dry every winter.”"

The cache of documents also includes emails which indicateMountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace in September 2010, two years after he was convicted of soliciting girls as young as 14 for sex.What have we learned from the newly released Epstein files?Read moreLast year Suhas Subramanyam, a Democratic member of the oversight committee in the House of Representatives,askedMountbatten-Windsor to sit for a deposition as part of its investigation into how the US government handled the case against Epstein.Subramanyam said Mountbatten-Windsor “has been hiding from us, and I think he will continue to try to hide from people doing meaningful investigations of this matter”.Speaking after the release of the latest Epstein files, Starmer said: “Firstly, I have always approached this question with the victims of Epstein in mind. Epstein’s victims have to be the first priority. As for whether there should be an apology, that’s a matter for Andrew.“But yes, in terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that. You can’t be victim-centred if you’re not prepared to do that.”‘She needs to fix it’: Jeffrey Epstein’s plot to win redemption via Sarah FergusonRead moreThe documents suggest that, a month before the Buckingham Palace invite, Epstein had suggested he could arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clever, beautiful and trustworthy” Russian woman, who was 26. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to see the woman. He also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free” from house arrest.Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park later that year.In his calamitous Newsnight interview, broadcast in 2019, Mountbatten-Windsor claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in person in light of his conviction.However, the newly released emails suggest that the Hollywood publicist Peggy Siegal arranged a star-studded dinner in Mountbatten-Windsor’s honour at Epstein’s New York home during the trip. Siegal invited the film director Woody Allen and George Stephanopoulos, a talk show host and former senior aide to Bill Clinton.Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have continued to send Epstein intimate family pictures featuring his adult daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.In 2022,Mounbatten-Windsor paid a reported £12m settlement to the late Virginia Giuffre, who claimed she had been forced to have sex with him after she was trafficked by Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor made the payment without accepting liability and has always denied wrongdoing.However, he and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, have been ostracised from royal circles thanks to their decision to maintain friendships with Epstein after his first conviction. Epstein gave Ferguson £15,000 to pay off debts and she described him in an email as the “brother [she] always wished for”.Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019, while awaiting trial on fresh child sex abuse charges. The files also detail apparent correspondence between Mountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence in a US jail for child sex trafficking.They feature an email from Mountbatten-Windsor to Maxwell, written in 2005, about a proposed trip to the US. Mountbatten-Windsor wrote: “I am in your hands (literally) until Saturday/Sunday.” He signed off: “Love you A xxx.”The newly released documents contain a string of embarrassing revelations for prominent British figures.They show that Epstein sent £10,000 to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, the husband of Labour peer Peter Mandelson, in the year after his conviction. Emails suggest this was to fund an osteopathy course.They also reveal that Lord Mandelson requested to stay at one of Epstein’s properties while Epstein was serving his first jail term. The terms of Epstein’s sentence allowed him to work from his office during the day and return to jail each night.Mandelson said on Friday he had been “wrong” to continue his association with Epstein after his conviction. He added that he was “never culpable or complicit” in his crimes.He was sacked as the UK’s ambassador to the US last Septemberwhen it emerged he had sent supportive messages to Epstein after his offending had come to light.View image in fullscreenA photo of Richard Branson and Jeffrey Epstein released as part of the Epstein files.Photograph: US Department of Justice/PAThe files show that Richard Branson met Epstein in 2013, at the Virgin Group founder’s private Necker Island, and offered him advice on restoring his reputation in light of his 2008 conviction.In an email, Branson told Epstein: “Any time you’re in the area, would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!”“I think if Bill Gates was willing to say that you’ve been a brilliant advisor to him, that you slipped up many years ago by sleeping with a 17½-year-old woman and were punished for it,” Branson wrote.“You’ve more than learnt your lesson and have done nothing that’s against the law since and, yes, as a single man, you seem to have a penchant for women. But there’s nothing wrong with that.”A Virgin Group spokesperson said: “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event.“When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.“As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again.“Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever. Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.”Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

He has threatened to intervene in Iran in the wake of a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.“Well, we can’t tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan – it could be worse, actually,” he said.Washington has deployed a naval battle group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier off Iran’s shores, after Trump threatened to intervene in response to a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.The arrival of the flotilla has raised fears of a direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies – notably Israel – in the event of an attack.But Trump has said he believes Iran will prefer to make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action – and Tehran has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missiles and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.“Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing,” said Ali Larijani, head of Iran’s supreme national security council, a day after the Kremlin said Larijani held talks in Moscow with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Saturday said a broader conflict would hurt both Iran and the US.“The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought, and in no way seeks, war and it is firmly convinced that a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region,” he said in a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, according to the Iranian presidency.Iran’s army chief, Amir Hatami, had earlier warned the US and Israel against any attack, saying his forces were “at full defensive and military readiness” to respond.“If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime,” Hatami said, according to the official news agency IRNA.He said Iran’s nuclear technology and expertise “cannot be eliminated”.With tensions heightened, Iranian authorities rushed to deny that several incidents on Saturday were linked to any attack or sabotage, including an explosion in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas that local firefighters said was caused by a gas leak.On Friday, US Central Command said the Revolutionary Guards would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.In a statement, US Central Command warned Iran against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”.It drew criticism from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.“Operating off our shores, theUS militaryis now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf,” he wrote on X.The US designated the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organisation in 2019,a move the European Union followed on Thursday, prompting angry reactions from Tehran.The US carried outstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sitesin June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe.Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreNationwide protests against the rising cost of living then erupted on 28 December, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on 8 and 9 January in what authorities called “riots” and blamed on the US and Israel.The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117.However, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 6,563 deaths, including 6,170 protesters and 124 children.On Saturday, Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations and “serve the people”.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

That tells you everything about the politics they intend to inject into this byelection, the politics of poisonous division, so we can see exactly where that’s going.“So we are the only contender. So it’s Labour versus Reform, and we will fight for renewal, for inclusive communities and bringing people together, and for true patriotism against the plastic patriotism of Reform. But only Labour can beat Reform, and therefore it’s the only way to win this byelection.”The prime minister did not say whether he would be campaigning in the seat. Labour is vying with theGreen partyto attract progressive votes to beat Reform.The Greens selected Hannah Spencer, a Manchester plumber who is a councillor in Trafford, on Friday. The party’s leader, Zack Polanski, was campaigning in Levenshulme, in the south of the constituency, on Saturday.In a post on Facebook, Polanski said: “What a turning point we can make happen for our country!”Reform has selected Goodwin, a former academicwho is now a hard-right activistand GB News presenter.On Saturday Stogia was chosen to fight the seat for Labour after a hustings event and vote by local members at the Jain community centre in Levenshulme.Stogia beat Eamonn O’Brien, the leader of Bury council inGreater Manchester, who had been said to be the favourite of No 10. Labour insiders said the contest was closely fought, but Stogia was seen as the more local candidate. She is a ward councillor in nearby Whalley Range, also in south Manchester.Labour’s deputy leader,Lucy Powell, said: “I’m absolutely thrilled that my good friend Angeliki Stogia has been selected as Labour’s candidate today. She’s a local girl, she’s Mancunian, she’s up for it.“She’s been delivering for people in this area for a long time, and that’s what we’re going to be going out on the doorsteps to say to people.”Stogia said she was “absolutely thrilled and excited” to have been chosen as Labour’s candidate.“I am a proud Mancunian woman,” she said. “I have walked the streets of this constituency. This is about Manchester. Manchester is a city united, we are rejecting division. I am so looking forward to going out on the doorstep and winning this for Labour.“I am so excited that I got selected, and I am raring to go,” she added. “We’ve got a right fight on our hands, but we’ve got the people with us, and we will win this.”The byelection was triggered bythe resignation of the former Labour MP Andrew Gwynnebecause of ill health.Gwynne remains under a parliamentary standards investigation into a scandal involving a WhatsApp group, called Trigger Me Timbers, that shared inflammatory comments about constituents, local party members and other MPs, which led to him being suspended by Labour.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Lucy Powell, deputy leader of the Labour party, Angeliki Stogia and Anna Turley, chair of the Labour party, in Denton.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAPowell told activists that the Labour brand is resilient, and mentionedAndy Burnham, the mayor of the region who was turned down to be a candidate.She said: “The Greens aren’t being entirely straight with people about this.

But also we’ve got a really good Labour council here.“So we’ve got a very strong, resilient brand and we’ve spoken to over 15,000 people in a week,” she added. “We know that this race is between us and Reform. The Greens aren’t really in this race at all, and they’re not being straight with people about that.”Labour’s chief whip, Jonathan Reynolds, said there was “no complacency” about the scale of the challenge, and that the party was ready to defend the seat.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner attended the announcement at the Jain community centre in Denton.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAHe said: “It is definitely a Reform-Labour head-to-head. I don’t say that to disrespect any other political party, but I think the sense is, had the Greens really thought they were in it, Polanski would have been the candidate.”Labour’s candidate selection came amid a high-profile row after Burnham, who wanted to surrender the mayoralty of Greater Manchester to contest the seat for Labour,was denied the chanceby the national executive committee.The briefing war has continued, with a cabinet member telling the Times: “He’s been handed everything on a plate for his whole career. He’s now angry because people won’t make way for his second coming. It’s typical Andy.”The latest remarks prompted the mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotheram, to defend Burnham, saying: “These gutless people hide behind the cloak of anonymity, just like the keyboard warriors they rail against. These anonymous attacks help nobody but our opponents. For the sake of our party, please, just stop.”On Saturday night, Burnham congratulated Stogia and said she would do “a great job”.

The local sheriff told the local news outlet that the parade was immediately shut down.One person is in custody, officials told the outlet – and investigators are searching for a vehicle suspected to have been used for the shooting.The East Feliciana parish sheriff’s office, which oversees Clinton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.WBRZ reported that theLouisianastate police has taken over the investigation. Streets near the courthouse were reportedly blocked by state troopers and officials with the sheriff’s office.Clinton has a population of about 1,300 people. It is part of the metropolitan area surrounding Louisiana’s capital city, Baton Rouge.At the time of the bloodshed reported in Clinton on Saturday, there had been at least 24 mass shootings in the US so far in the year, according to the nonpartisanGun Violence Archive.The archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed.Constantly high rates of mass shootings in the US have led many to call on Congress to enact more meaningful gun control measures.

The Labour party said the peer died on Friday night “peacefully and at home”.The former prime minister Tony Blair paid tribute to David Triesman as a “vital part of the New Labour movement”. Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, Angela Smith, described him as “respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit”.Triesman was the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers trade union and the general secretary of the Labour party before he joined Blair’s government in the House of Lords in 2004.He served as a Foreign Office minister and then later as undersecretary of state for innovation, universities and skills.Triesman was later Labour’s shadow minister for foreign affairs and also sat on several prominent select committees.Labour’s statement said: “He pursued a very active role in the House of Lords from 2004 until his death. And served as a lord in waiting to Queen Elizabeth II from 2004 to 2022.”The party added: “A passionate Spurs fan, Lord Triesman became the first patron of theTottenham HotspurFoundation and the first independent chair of the FA (Football Association) from which platform he advocated intensely against racism in football and for the increased centrality of the women’s football.“He later played an important role in the exposing of corruption within Fifa.”In 2010, heresigned as FA chairafter being secretly recorded making bribery allegations about rival countries’ attempts to host the men’s World Cup.Blair, prime minister from 1997 until 2007, said in a statement: “David was a vital part of the New Labour movement and became in time a great friend.“Passionate about the cause, whether the Labour party or football, he was deeply committed to making change to improve people’s lives.“Unwavering in his loyalty and dedication, he was someone both liked and admired by those who had the privilege of working with him.“He was a gentle, genuine, good guy who put others before himself naturally and without hesitation. My profound condolences to Lucy and all his family.”Lady Smith said: “As a Labour peer, David was respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit.“He was great company with a wide circle of friends who shared lively conversations on his many interests and enthusiasms, particularly, but not exclusively, politics and football.“David bore his illness with amazing courage and even in the last weeks of his life he was engaging company. He will be sadly missed by all who knew him, but we are proud to have had his friendship.”Hollie Ridley, Labour’s general secretary, also paid tribute to her predecessor.She said: “Far too few general secretaries have had the privilege of serving the Labour party and the country while Labour is in power – and the work David did while in that role helped to ensure our campaign machinery had the solid foundations needed to help us go on to win that third term in government.“His commitment to public service was admirable and he will be much missed by those who he worked so closely with.”Triesman is survived by his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Ilona.Explore more on these topicsLabourThe FATottenham HotspurFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They eat on average 63kg a person every year, according to official statistics.But the exceptional glut of potatoes produced by farmers during the last harvest has overwhelmed even the hardiest of fans.Named theKartoffel-Flut(potato flood), after the highest yield in 25 years, the bumper crop has inspired one farmer to organise a potato dump on Berlin, with appeals going out around the German capital for people to come to various hotspots and pick them up for free.Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, kindergartens, schools, churches and non-profit organisations are among those to have taken their fill. Even Berlin zoo has participated in the “rescue mission”, taking tonnes of potatoes that would otherwise have gone to landfill, or to produce biogas, to feed its animals. Two lorry loads have been sent to Ukraine.Ordinary city residents, many feeling the squeeze over the rise in the cost of living, have arrived at pre-announced potato dump locations, filling up anything from sacks and buckets to handcarts.Astrid Marz queued recently in Kaulsdorf, on the eastern edge of Berlin, one of 174 distribution points spontaneously set up around the city, to stuff an old rucksack with spuds. “I stopped counting at 150. I think I’ve got enough to keep me and my neighbours going until the end of the year,” she said.The operation, called 4000 Tonnes after the surplus a single potato farmer near Leipzig offered in December after a sale fell through at the last minute, was organised by a Berlin newspaper with the Berlin-based eco-friendly not-for-profit search engine Ecosia.View image in fullscreenWorkers distribute potatoes for their customers at the Berliner Tafel e.V. food bank.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy Live News.“At first I thought it was some AI-generated fake news when I saw it on social media,” Marz, a teacher, said. “There were pictures of huge mountains of ‘earth apples’,” she recalled, using the wordErdäpfel, an affectionate term for the potato sometimes used by Berliners, “with the instruction to come and get them for free!”The excitement has lifted spirits at a time when arctic cold has Berlin in its grip, hampering travel, grinding public transport to a halt and leaving pavements hazardously icy.“There was a really party-like atmosphere,” said Ronald, describing how people cheerily helped one other with heavy loads and swapped culinary tips when he recently picked up potatoes for his family at the Tempelhofer Feld.As a result of the buzz, the potato is receiving something of a new lease of life.It has helped resurrect stories about how the humble tuber first became popular inGermany, after Prussia’s Frederick II issued an order for its cultivation in the 18th century, known as theKartoffelbefehl(potato decree), establishing it as a staple food despite reported initial scepticism over its strange texture and form.Recipes galore are being shared online as those who have scooped up the spuds try to work out what to do with the surfeit.Although the potato has sometimes been spurned in recent years as some fitness gurus have recommended avoiding carbohydrates, experts have highlighted its nutritional properties, such as vitamin C and potassium.Celebrity Berlin chef Marco Müller of the Rutz restaurant has said now is the ideal moment to give the potato the Michelin-star treatment. He uses an innovative technique to make a rich broth from roasted potato peelings and a sought-after potato vinaigrette.Another of the recipes doing the rounds is Angela Merkel’sKartoffelsuppe(potato soup), which the former German chancellor first shared with voters in the run-up to 2017’s general election in an interview with a celebrity magazine.View image in fullscreenStock of spare potatoes thought to amount to 4,000 tonnes near Leipzig.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPAHer hot pot tip? To give it the necessary lumpy texture, she revealed: “I always pound the potatoes myself with a potato masher, rather than using a food mixer.”‘We want to make jacket potatoes sexy again!’: how the humble spud became a fast food sensationRead moreCriticism has come from farmers in the region, who say the market in Berlin is even more saturated and their crop has been devalued further still by the vast giveaway.More widely, environmental lobbyists have said the glut in part stems from a warped and out-of-control food industry, and that the mountains of potatoes pictured in storage facilities across the region is reminiscent of the notoriousbutter mountains and milk lakesof the 1970s, when farmers were overly incentivised to produce food owing to the European Economic Community’s guarantee to buy up surplus products at high prices.While it’s the potato’s turn this year, last year hops were in surplus and next year, it is predicted, it will be milk.A last hoorah for the intervention is expected in the coming days, and those keen to participate in the potato party are urged to keep a close eye on the organisers’websitefor the next drops.There are, in theory, about 3,200 tonnes (3,200,000kg or 7,056,000lbs)still up for grabs.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeAgriculturePotatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

End Israel’s occupation of Gaza & West Bank.”He called his arrest an “attack on free speech” and said police claimed the word intifada was unlawful. He was taken to Sutton police station in southLondon.In a statement released by the Peter Tatchell Foundation, the 74-year-old, who is one of the country’s best known gay rights campaigners, said his arrest was “part of a dangerous trend to increasingly restrict and criminalise peaceful protests”.“The Arab word intifada means uprising, rebellion or resistance against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. It does not mean violence and is not antisemitic. It is against the Israeli regime and its war crimes, not against Jewish people.View image in fullscreenHuman rights activist Peter Tatchell, photographed in his London flat in 2016 surrounded by memorabilia from his numerous campaigns and protests.Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer“By ‘non-violent resistance’ I was advocating boycott, sanction and divestment – the same tactics that helped bring down the apartheid regime in South Africa. ‘Globalise the intifada’ means create a worldwide campaign like the anti-apartheid movement.“The police are totally wrong to conflate support for Palestinian resistance to oppression with hatred and attacks on Jews,” he said.In December, theMetropolitan policesaid that protesters who chanted “globalise the intifada” would now be arrested because the “context has changed” after the Bondi Beach terror attack in Sydney.On Saturday afternoon, the force said: “Officers policing the Palestine Coalition protest have arrested a 74-year-old man on suspicion of a public order offence. He was seen carrying a sign including the words ‘globalise the intifada’.”The Metropolitan police said there were 13 arrests from the Palestine Coalition protest and one from the Stop the Hate counter demonstration.Tatchell said three people “were charged with this new ‘crime’ of expressing support for an intifada against Israel’s war crimes and genocide” at a London rally last month.“I have a long history of defending Jewish people against the antisemitism of the far right and Islamist extremism. I joined the March AgainstAntisemitism, with the chief rabbi and thousands of Jewish people, on 26 November 2023, just after the 7 October massacre,” he said.Last May,Tatchell was arrested by policefor holding a placard that read: “Stop Israel genocide! Stop Hamas executions! Odai Al-Rubai, aged 22, executed by Hamas! RIP!” for a racially and religiously aggravated offence. He said he is taking legal action against the Met over this arrest.“My placard did not mention anyone’s race or religion. The police have since admitted that I was wrongly arrested and I am awaiting a settlement,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPeter TatchellIsrael-Gaza warProtestMetropolitan policeLondonPalestineAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

In a post on Instagram, Levy said he would “cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her”.Catherine O’Hara – a life in picturesRead moreHe added: “What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O’Hara’s brilliance for all those years.“Having spent over 50 years collaborating with my dad [Schitt’s Creek co-star and co-creator Eugene Levy], Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family.“It’s hard to imagine a world without her in it.”View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Eugene Levy, Annie Murphy, Daniel Levy and Catherine O’Hara, the stars of the TV series Schitt’s Creek.Photograph: Willy Sanjuan/Invision/APEugene Levy said: “Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today. I had the honour of knowing and working with the great Catherine O’Hara for over 50 years.“From our beginnings on the Second City stage, to SCTV, to the movies we did with Chris Guest, to our six glorious years on Schitt’s Creek, I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke, and the entire O’Hara family.”Richard E Grant, who starred in 2006’s Penelope with O’Hara, called the actor’s death an “incalculable loss”. In a post on Instagram, he said: “She & her husband Bo were the first people we called when we were in LA, stayed with us in the Cotswolds, shared dinners in London & never stopped yakking & laughing.”In 2024, O’Hara reprised her role as Delia Deetz in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, having starred in the first film in 1988. Her co-star Michael Keaton said: “We go back before the first Beetlejuice. She’s been my pretend wife, my pretend nemesis and my real life, true friend. This one hurts.

Getting to work with her was a true honour.“She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous … She made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating.

I am just so contrite I cannot say.”In the interview with the Daily Telegraph, Ferguson admitted that she allowed Epstein to pay off £15,000 of her debts. “Whenever I can I will repay the money and will have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again,” she added.View image in fullscreenBoth Ferguson and Mountbatten-Windsor have been shunned by royal family for maintaining their friendships with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction.Photograph: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty ImagesNo sooner had Ferguson’s crisis-PR mea culpa hit the presses, however, than another operation was kicking into gear in the US, one to help Epstein launder his reputation – and one in which the former duchess was intended to play a major part.The new tranche of files released on the late child sex offender reveal how he tried to leverage what he felt was his close relationship withSarah Fergusonto bounce back from the disgrace of his conviction for soliciting underage girls in Florida.Emails disclosed by the US justice department on Friday show that Epstein and his publicist detailed a plan to persuade Ferguson to release a statement saying he was “not a pedo” after she publicly distanced herself from him in the interview.Epstein’s confidence that he could make Ferguson U-turn on her criticism may be born of the close relationship they shared, and of the many favours he had done for her down the years. An insider claimed he had been “blindsided” by the interview, adding: “They were very close until this point.”As well revealing Epstein’s reputation redemption plot, files released yesterday show the extent to which Ferguson flattered and benefited from her relationship with the banker.Ferguson continued her relationship with Epstein after he was jailed for child sex offences in 2008 and, while he was under house arrest the following year, described him as the “brother [she] always wished for”.The week after Ferguson’s interview, Epstein discussed the situation with a crisis management publicist, Mike Sitrick. Epstein suggested Ferguson could release a statement saying she had been “duped” by lawyers representing some of his accusers.“She now knows that what she was told was based on falsehoods, and fabrications designed to enhance their civil suit,” Epstein said. “She should out the newspapers on the offering of money for stories.”Sitrick, understood to be working for lawyers Epstein had retained, responded saying they needed to put pressure on Ferguson to change her account. He said: “Agree, quite frankly whatever her excuse she needs to say she was mistaken, she apologises, feels terrible. Jeffrey is not a pedophile.“The you [sic] woman who was the source of the conviction for solicitation of prostitutions for someone under 18 was 17-3/4 and she is very sorry. We need all those components. She created this problem. She needs to fix it and as I know everyone knows time is of the essence here.” In fact, Epstein had admitted soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.In the exchange, Sitrick said that if Ferguson did not succumb to “gentle persuasion” he felt that they should “turn up the heat even to the point of sending her a draft defamation lawsuit”.Although Epstein expressed concerns that he could not “depend” on Ferguson “doing as we would wish”, Sitrick replied that her retraction was “critical”. He said this would be “a major turning point and be picked up everywhere”.He added: “This is about your name and your reputation. You really can’t worry about her, in my view, you need to worry about you. She certainly isn’t concerned about you or your reputation.”Ferguson appears not to have made a public statement in support of Epstein. In private, however, she changed her tune again.She emailed Epstein the next month to say she wanted to “humbly apologise” for her comments in the Telegraph and described him as her “supreme friend”. It is unclear if she was threatened with legal action, as discussed by Epstein and Sitrick.In her email, she said: “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read and I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that.”She added: “I was instructed to act with the utmost speed if I would have any chance of holding on to my career as a children’s book author and a children’s philanthropist. As you know, I did not, absolutely not, say the ‘P word’ [paedophile] about you but understand it was reported that I did.”View image in fullscreenMountbatten-Windsor and Ferguson continued to live together after their divorce in 1996.Photograph: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty ImagesHowever, the relationship appears to have irreparably soured. Later that year, Epstein emailed the banker David Stern a link to a photograph of Ferguson at Beatrice’s graduation, which was featured in the Daily Mail. “Pic of F not the prettiest sight,” he said.Ferguson’s apology email to Epstein was revealed by the Mail on Sunday in September. In response, a number of charities severed ties with Ferguson. Both she and Mountbatten-Windsor, the brother of King Charles, have been stripped of their royal titles amid the fallout from their friendship with Epstein.The Epstein documents suggest that the former couple, who continued to live together after their divorce, separately continued to meet with Epstein after his first conviction.I urgently need 20,000 pounds for rent today. The landlord has threatened to go to the newspapers. Any brainwaves?Sarah Ferguson, writing to EpsteinFerguson appears to have had lunch with Epstein in summer 2009, shortly after he was released from prison and placed on house arrest, and sought his advice on marketing her “Sarah Ferguson brand” to retailers.She also suggests that she took her daughters to meet Epstein, adding: “I have never been more touched by a friends [sic] kindness than your compliment to me in front of my girls.”In October that year, she discussed her financial woes with Epstein, saying: “I urgently need 20,000 pounds for rent today. The landlord has threatened to go to the newspapers if I don’t pay. Any brainwaves?”In July 2010, Epstein asked Ferguson if there was “any chance of your daughters saying hello” to one of his associates, who was in London in July 2010. This person’s name was not revealed in the files. Ferguson replied that Beatrice was in London with Mountbatten-Windsor but Eugenie was “away with a cool boyfriend”. It is unclear if any meeting took place.Just weeks later,Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace, shortly after he was released from house arrest. And three months later again, in December 2010, the former prince visited the disgraced financier in New York, where they were pictured walking through Central Park.Mountbatten-Windsor claimed in a catastrophic Newsnight interview in 2019 that he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in person. However, the files revealed that the Hollywood publicist Peggy Siegal organised a star studded dinner for him at Epstein’s home during his visit.Mountbatten-Windsor, who appears in the files to be pictured crouching over an unidentified woman, withdrew from royal life shortly afterwards. In 2022, he paid a reported £12m settlement to the late campaigner Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him after being trafficked by Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied wrongdoing and made the payment without admitting liability.Sitrick declined to comment on the emails. Ferguson and Mountbatten-Windsor did not reply to requests for a response. Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019, while facing a fresh round of child sex abuse charges.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinSarah FergusonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some wrote in the chat where they were from: Arkansas, Texas, Michigan, Florida and many other corners of the country. Others typed why this was important to them: calling for “ICE out” of their communities and demanding the abolition of the agency itself. “The fact we’re all here gives me hope we’ll come out the other side,” wrote one participant. Within 24 hours, another 200,000 people had watched the recording on YouTube.The rising interest in ICE observing came two days after Minneapolis resident Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a federal immigration agent and less than three weeks after an agent killed Renee Good.“Two of my neighbors have been killed, but because of ordinary people documenting the actions of ICE, we’re able to show the truth of what happened to Renee and Alex”, a Minneapolis resident named Marjorie told those on the call. “And we’re also able to track what is happening in our community, and ensure that our neighbors are not being simply disappeared.”While ICE raids continue in the Twin Cities, as well asPhoenix, Arizona,southern Californiaand other parts of the country, organizers say the killings of Pretti and Good have inspired thousands of people to join local ICE observer groups. In addition to documenting ICE operations, a heavy presence of observers can deter agents from detaining people. Earlier this week,Minneapolis city council president Elliott Paynesaid: “Because we had so many patrols out, multiple abductions were prevented.”View image in fullscreenPeople record on their phones after an incident where a civilian’s car was hit by ICE agents, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 12 January 2026.Photograph: Tim Evans/ReutersEven those who had been observing ICE for months, from the Pacific north-west to the southeastern US, told the Guardian that they were more determined than ever to keep documenting federal agents. This was despite escalating violence from agents, the threatof harassment or detention, and the government continually casting observers’ work as “domestic terrorism”, as federal officials did after Good and Pretti’s deaths. In fact, witnesstestimonyandfootagecountered what the White House said about Pretti’s killing being an act of “self-defense” – a testament to how vital ICE observing is, organizers said.“I am petrified, to be sure,” said Andrea, an ICE observer in Chicago who asked to be identified by a pseudonym for safety reasons. “But [I have] no intentions to back down or not show up. That just isn’t an option.”Navigating ‘shifting’ legal risks and unpredictable agentsAdding to the threat of ICE agents escalating violence against observers is the federal government’s threat of legal ramifications. Recording police and federal authorities in public areas is aprotected first amendmentright. Still, White House officials have claimed that it is “illegal” and an act of“violence”to record ICE agents, equivalent to “doxing”. After the deaths of Good and Pretti, federal officials called both residents “violent” and “terrorists”, even though video evidence showed otherwise.Video contradicts Trump’s claim man killed in Minneapolis was a ‘gunman’Read moreThe White House and DHS accused Goodof charging officers with her car, but video footage captured by observers showed Good had slowly turned her car away from, not toward, agents. White House officials claimedPretti sought to “massacre” immigration agentsbecause he had carried his permitted handgun that day, but video captured by observers showedfederal agents had already taken his handgunbefore shooting him on the ground. The White House and DHS havesince attempted towalk backsome of these statements, and the Department of Justice announced Friday that it would investigate Pretti’s killing.The White House did not respond to questions from the Guardian about an apparent crackdown on protesters and legal observers, or the characterization of them as “domestic terrorists”. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: “President Trump is taking important action to make America safe again and protect federal law enforcement officers from violent left-wing rioters when local Democrat leaders refuse to act.” DHS did not respond to request for comment.At the same time,the Trump administration is investigating Minneapolis’s ICE watch organizing. On Monday, FBI director Kash Patel said he intends tocriminally investigategroup chats on the encrypted app Signal used by Minneapolis residents for organizing purposes, calling them “clearly a coordinated infrastructure” and comparing them to the mob. The justice department declined to comment.“Post-Trump[’s re-election], you can’t deny that there has been a shift” in the level of risk for engaging in civil disobedience, said attorney Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, which has represented activists and organizers facing charges from their advocacy since 2003. “When I’m doing ‘Know Your Rights and Risks’ training for activists and movement people, we are talking about a higher-risk moment in time, in terms of the potential for arrests, potential consequences of political activism.”View image in fullscreenPeople attend a candlelight vigil for Renee Good and Alex Pretti, organized by healthcare workers at the site where Alex Pretti was killed on 24 January 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty ImagesHowever, Regan said there’s been little evidence that federal charges against observers or protesters have stood up to legal muster.An analysis from the Associated Pressfound that in 100 federal charges between May 2025 and December 2025, 55 were reduced to misdemeanors or dismissed outright, and over 40% of cases in what the Trump administration deemed “domestic terrorism” were “relatively minor misdemeanor charges”. Those still charged with felonies had allegedly physically assaulted officers or thrown rocks at federal vehicles.For example, Chicago residentMarimar Martinezwas charged with felony assault after being shot five times by federal immigration agents who claimed she drove into them in October. The charge was dropped a month later, as Martinez and her legal team challenged their depiction of events. Now, in the wake of Good and Pretti’s killings, Martinez is seeking to have evidence from her case unsealed.“There is a lot of propaganda rhetoric and threats around making run-of-the-mill protest into ‘terrorism’… but at the end of the day, right now, from my vantage point, when you look at the statistics of what cases have actually been indicted and prosecuted and sentenced? You’re not seeing a huge shift in that stark line,” Regan said.Eight people have died in dealings with ICE so far in 2026. These are their storiesRead moreRegan and other legal experts believe that the threat of heightened charges is an intimidation tactic, not necessarily a legal effort that will pay off.Regan added: “They lean into the propaganda war far more than the legal war.”Protecting citizens from unwarranted ICE escalation has proven more difficult. On 16 January, a federal judge in Minnesota barred ICE agents from retaliating against ICE protesters, including with pepper spray and arrest, or stopping drivers without reasonable cause;in less than a week, an appeals court overturned the ruling. In the five days in between,clips of an observer being pepper-sprayed directly in the facecirculated online. Within 72 hours of the ruling being overturned, Pretti was killed.How organizers are adjusting tactics to stay safeIn the wake of Good and Pretti’s deaths, with more people outraged, scared and looking to get involved, organizers said they’re doubling down on basic community organizingsafety practices.View image in fullscreenA woman blows a whistle in front of border patrol commander Greg Bovino at a gas station in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 21 January 2026.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters“What we’re telling folks right now is that [the administration] will continue to criminalize observers and supporters. And unfortunately, they have a very large megaphone,” Armando Gudino, executive director of the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, which advocates for the rights of low-wage and immigrant workers in the city, said after Good’s killing. “So we have to be even more careful.”During the Monday night online training, staffers role-played filming an ICE officer, while viewers weighed in about how they could be safer – did she back away fast enough when the agent told her to? Was she still recording while engaging with them? In the chat, some viewers encouraged others to carry makeshift body cameras for interacting with ICE.“As things become more popular on the side of the people, you see more desperate attempts by the regime to try and deter it, shut it down, minimize it,” said Regan. “One of the goals of an authoritarian regime is to scare the people into submission, and the most important thing that we can do to counteract that is to continue showing up.”When leading trainings, Regan advises attendees to make a “safety plan”, sharing with a loved one where they’re going and establishing an emergency contact person if they are arrested or injured. They train attendees to read the crowd and law enforcement for intensity and potential inflamed situations.Fearinggovernment tracking, organizers say they’ve been turning off their Bluetooth and wifi at protests and areas they expect to be in direct confrontation with ICE, and most are anonymizing their online usernames when using encrypted apps like Signal to communicate – tactics that have been a part of community organizing tech safety since beforethe 2020 Black Lives Matter uprisings.Several organizers said that the administration’s aggressive tactics have, perhaps contradictory to the administration’s intent, also led to wider collaboration between organizations. At a time when immigrants and people of color are especially fearful of being racially profiled and arrested by immigration enforcement agents, Gudino said, it has been helpful to coordinate with legal aid groups and volunteer networks who can patrol neighborhoods for the presence of ICE agents, and help provide immediate legal aid and assistance in the aftermath of raids.View image in fullscreenA history teacher and member of Union del Barrio, a community non-profit, takes photos of areas with a known ICE presence near a school in Los Angeles, California, in August 2025.Photograph: Carlin Stiehl/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesOrganizers also let people know they can help their communities without engaging in ICE watching – whether that’s providing mutual aid and meal trains for vulnerable people unable to leave home amid an ICE siege, or bulk ordering whistles for local ICE watchers to warn their neighbors about nearby agents. “Everybody has a different risk assessment, but everyone can still show up,” said Regan. “There is a place and a way to participate for everyone.”Growing participation in ICE observingDespite these challenges, every organizer and volunteer who spoke with the Guardian asserted that they were undaunted, even if shaken, by the federal government’s backlash.David Chung, an organizer with ICE Out of New York, said the day after Good’s killing, hundreds of New Yorkers gathered at a press conference held by DHS secretary Kristi Noem to make their feelings – and presence – known.“For about two and a half hours, the energy was really electric, of people showing their defiance, their anger towards this administration,” said Chung. “And it wasn’t just the energy, but having conversations with people who are there. They wanted to know: ‘How can I get more involved? How can I take the next step? What are some things that we can do?’ I didn’t hear anyone that was saying: ‘I’m too afraid to come out now.’”Omar Flores of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression recounted the same type of energy at an emergency action in Chicago after Good’s death, then again, after Pretti’s, saying “several thousand” people showed up. “While people are taking more precautions, folks seem to be undeterred,” Flores said.View image in fullscreenPeople use their phones to record federal agents at an intersection in the Cicero neighborhood during an immigration raid in Chicago, Illinois, on 22 October 2025.Photograph: Jim Vondruska/ReutersAt the Monday night ICE observer training, the chat was active with people wanting to help, connect and share gratitude for those who have already been doing this work. “Many thanks to Minneapolis for the weight they have been carrying,” one participant wrote.Majorie, the Minneapolis resident who opened the call, emphasized that being in community is getting involved. “I know some of you think you’re not qualified, or that you’re waiting for someone to tell you how to do this right,” she said. “But let me tell you that the person who is going to do that is you. You’re on this call, you have five neighbors right now who are waiting for you to talk to them and get organized. And that’s how you start. You won’t be perfect, you’ll make mistakes, but you just have to start.”Additional reporting by Maanvi Singh"

Once solely the province of experienced backcountry bushwalkers, the country’s ever-expanding network of hiking trails now offers something for walkers of all abilities.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.According to Ausplay, almost4 million Australians go bushwalking each year, making it the third-most popular form of physical activity in the country, and in 2025 theAllTrailsapp saw an almost 300% year-on-year increase in distance walked by Australian users. The largest growth has been in long-distance hikes, and it’s no surprise the boom in trail construction is continuing across the country, with multiple big-ticket walks slated to break ground this year.Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal parkRead moreTasmania’s Next Iconic walkis set to be a three-day hike through the Tyndall Range on the island state’s rugged west coast, and in Victoria the 76kmGreat Ocean Road coastal trailwill run along the Otway coast from Fairhaven through to Grey River.While you wait for those projects to get under way, here are some of the best new (and soon-to-open) tracks to stretch your legs this year.Map of Australia showing the different hike spotsGidjuum Gulganyi walk (New South Wales)Most visitors to NSW’s northern rivers region stick to the coast, but venture into the hinterland and you’ll discover a magical world where waterfalls cascade through ancient volcano craters and subtropical Gondwana rainforest.View image in fullscreenThe Gidjuum Gulganyi walk is a 42km hike in the NSW northern rivers hinterland.Photograph: D ParsonsLaunched last year, theGidjuum Gulganyi walkfollows the southern rim of the Tweed volcano on a journey deep into this exceptionally biodiverse ecosystem. The 42km, four-day hike also offers awindow into the cultures of the Widjabul Wia-bal and Minjungbal traditional owners, with a cultural experience at the walk’s terminus slated to open later this year.Ngaro track (Queensland)The Whitsunday islands group has long been associated with aquatic activities, but the new 32kmNgaro trackis aiming to turn the region into a hiking hotspot as well.View image in fullscreenThe three-day Ngaro track traverses coast, forest and rocky peaks on Whitsunday Island in Queensland.Photograph: Matt Horspool/Vagay Studio Pty LtdAccessed via boat, the three-day walk begins at Whitehaven beach (recently voted the world’s best) on Whitsunday Islandbefore traversing a mix of coastal landscapes, open forest and rocky peaks that offer panoramic vistas of the island group. Developed in collaboration with the Ngaro traditional owners, the trail incorporates art installations and cultural information and will have space for just 15 walkers a day when it launches in May. Bookings for independent hikers have almost sold out for the inaugural season, but World Expeditions still has availability on itsguided trips.Tidbinbilla Mindjagari track (ACT)“Not for the faint-hearted” is how ACT minister for city and government services, Tara Cheyne, described the 14km of fresh trails added to theTidbinbilla Mindjagari track networkat the end of last year. Rated grade 5 (for experienced, well-equipped bushwalkers only), the new trails unlock a range of new circuits. These include the aptly named Short ‘n’ Brutal loop, one of four routes to the top of the Tidbinbilla Range where walkers can enjoy views out over the Brindabellas and Kosciuszko national park.Adelaide 100 (South Australia)Conceived back in 2012, theAdelaide 100is finally nearing completion. For now, walkers can follow a continuous section of more than 70km that winds through the koala-filled foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, along the gum-lined River Torrens and past the coastal dunes of Adelaide’s western suburbs. Because the trail lies within the Adelaide metropolitan area, most sections can be accessed via public transport, and through-hikers will find toilets, accommodation and food providers along the way.‘It just blew me away’: the new Gidjuum Gulganyi Walk in northern NSW follows ancient trailsRead moreLeeuwin Biddi trail (Western Australia)South-west WA’s Cape to Cape track rightfully ranks highly on many lists of Australia’s top hikes. But if you don’t feel like tackling the entire 123km, the recently openedLeeuwin Biddi trailoffers an easier way to appreciate this beautiful stretch of coastline. The 3km trail is an accessible path designed for all ages and abilities that follows the coast and links with existing trails to connect the Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse (at 39 metres, mainland Australia’s tallest) with Augusta Boat Harbour.Snowies Alpine walk (NSW)Meandering across the rooftop of Australia, this56km, four-day trailis part of NSW’s rapidly expanding collection ofGreat Walks, and lives up to the billing by connecting alpine meadows filled with endemic wildflowers, historic mountain huts and stands of sinuous snow gums that overlook clear glacial lakes.View image in fullscreenHikers at Blue Lake in Kosciuszko national park.Photograph: Andrew Bain/AlamyThe chance to summit Australia’s highest mountain is the cherry on top, with the views from Mount Kosciuszko stretching all the way to the NSW south coast on a clear day. Half of the route is new track, and there are no designated campsites – walkers are encouraged to book transfers or carpool to nearby accommodation options.Twin Bridges track (Queensland)Five years after closing due to cyclone damage, the 18kmTwin Bridges trailreopened last December. Connecting the communities of Wangetti and Mowbray, the dual-use trail takes walkers and cyclists through the lush hinterland of the Wet Tropics world heritage area in Queensland’s far north. While not officially part of the 94kmWangetti trail, it will form an alternate route for walkers and cyclists travelling between Palm Cove and Port Douglas when that project is completed in 2028.Uluru-Kata Tjuta signature walk (Northern Territory)View image in fullscreenThe 54km Uluru-Kata Tjuta signature walk will include five days of guided hiking.Photograph: Michael PetersWhen it launches in April, the newest addition to the Great Walks of Australia luxury guided hike portfolio will allow walkers to stay overnight in Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park for the first time.

Sydney had always been my dream destination, but then the Australian immigration rules changed, meaning that to get permanent residency with my skillset as a barber, I’d have to move to Tasmania or the Northern Territory. I decided on Darwin because I feared the weather in Tasmania was too much like British weather. So in 2018, I packed my bags and moved to Darwin without knowing anything about the city.Ben and I first chatted onGrindrand he was very welcoming, offering to show me around town. He was also very interested in my story – how did this Welsh boy end up living here? He asked if I was going to Darwin Pride.View image in fullscreen‘She was running and dancing around the pool, then threw herself in the water in full drag’: Dion Padan meeting Miss Ellaneous at the Darwin Pride pool party in 2018He said he’d be at a Pride pool party event in a few days, but he didn’t mention he was hosting the event as his drag queen persona Miss Ellaneous. So when I turned up I was like, “Oh my god.”She was running and dancing around the pool, then threw herself in the water in full drag. She also invited me backstage where I saw all her costumes. I was swept up by it all.The moment I knew: I was on a quest to figure out exactly how gay I was. But I kept coming back to herRead moreIn between performances we spent the entire day together. I’d watch Miss Ellaneous command a crowd with humour, confidence and generosity, and off stage we talked, laughed and connected in a way that felt effortless. There was an undeniable energy between us. I remember the other performers looking at me and saying: “Where did you come from? You make such a cute couple.” We were like: “No, we’re not dating.”What I hadn’t realised was that Ben was “a bit famous” and always travelling, doing shows. So despite our initial connection the idea of anything romantic felt impossible.When Covid hit, it grounded us both in Darwin. Suddenly, Ben was home a lot more, and we started spending more time together. At some point he invited me away for a weekend in Dundee. We stayed in a little villa with a jacuzzi and no phone signal. On the second night, we sat outside on the veranda playing Scrabble. I felt really at ease – we’d had such a beautiful afternoon together. Then without any grand gesture or dramatic moment, it hit me. I felt safe. I felt seen. I felt deeply listened to, without judgment. The connection was unmistakable. I was in love.View image in fullscreen‘When it comes to Ben, I feel as if I’ve won the lottery’: Dion Padan and Ben Graetz on their first wedding anniversary in Liverpool, UK in 2023.Photograph: Cal HibbardSo much has happened since then. I lost my business in Darwin when a fire went through my shop. In 2022 Ben moved to Sydney to work on WorldPride; I felt a bit lost in Darwin so I followed him.We got married in Sydney in 2022 – just me, Ben and two witnesses. We knew we were never going to get all our friends and family together in one place, so we did three separate celebrations over a year in Darwin, Sydney, and our final “festival of love” on our first anniversary in Liverpool in the UK.We moved to Brunswick Heads in northern New South Wales last February. It felt like the right move for our quality of life, mental health and careers. I found a new job as a self-employed barber. Ben is still away a lot, but there are two domestic airports nearby. It sounds cheesy, but I keep falling more and more in love with him.Ben is a First Nations man with cultural ties to Malak Malak, Kungarakan, Muran Clan (Iwaidja) and Torres Strait Islands (Badu Island). I love learning about his culture and history and I think he enjoys hearing about my Welsh identity. We’re not from the same place, but that’s a blessing. It adds another dimension to our relationship. Ben really puts his neck on the line to create space and opportunity for other Indigenous people, and carries a lot of weight and responsibility for his community.When it comes to Ben, I feel as if I’ve won the lottery. He’s the most kind, generous, loving, driven, calm and loyal person I’ve ever met. I love the life we have created together, especially when I get to travel and help Ben with his drag shows, whether he’s performing as Tina, Bogan Villea or Miss Ellaneous – she gets around! I am a very proud husband and it fills my heart seeing him achieve so much.Ben Graetz performs his showTina: A tropical love storyat the Round Theatre in Melbourne as part of the Midsumma festival, on 6 FebruaryTell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Picking up a coffee mug. Waving at a friend. Bending down to pat a dog. Turning to flush the toilet.Many who have experienced “doing their back in” have been baffled by the discrepancy between the mildness of the precipitating action and the severity of the resulting pain. How could such a small, innocent movement trigger such paralysing pain that lasts for weeks, months, years or, in some cases, decades?The reason is that most cases of lower back pain are not the result of damage to muscles, tendons or bone. Most start with something as benign as a muscle spasm, which then sets the lower back on a pathway of nerve sensitisation and pain that is hard to treat.‘We stick them in shoes and forget about them’: how to really look after your feetRead moreThe lack of serious underlying injury might be small comfort to the estimated80% of the populationwho will suffer from lower back pain at some point in their lives. But the good news is that preventing lower back pain is a lot easier than treating it, and when it does occur, many cases resolve by themselves with time.‘Joints need to be moved’The spine is essentially a pillar that protects the spinal cord and nerves and supports us to stand, but at the same time it allows us to bend and turn and twist, saysProf Manuela Ferreira, head of musculoskeletal health at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney. This requires a lot of moving parts. “There are so many structures that could be involved in the process of back pain; so many joints, so many muscles – big muscles, small muscles – the disks,” Ferreira says.And we don’t move those structures nearly enough. “Joints need to be moved,” she says. “We’re putting a lot of weight, a lot of load, on the especially the lumbar [lower] spine, without allowing it to adjust itself and move around.”Don’t ignore the triggers of back painBack problems are the third-highest contributor to disease burden in Australia, and account for2.2%of the national health budget. At any one time,one in six Australiansis suffering from back problems.The reason back pain is so common is because many people experience their first episode of back pain in adolescence and it has a high rate of recurrence: around one-third of people who have an episode of low back pain will have another one within a year.But what triggers it in the first place? “We know there are genetic factors that predispose the back pain, we know that there are lifestyle factors, there are mental health factors,” says musculoskeletal therapistProf Peter O’Sullivanfrom Curtin University in Perth.Often, the most likely explanation for that first muscle spasm is we’re simply run down. “The current view is the majority – and this is like 95% of back pain – will often emerge at a time when you’re under stress, not sleeping, not as active, fatigued, and then you do something like just be bending over, picking something up, and then your back spasms,” O’Sullivan says. That acute pain then causes us to seize up, to move less, to protect the area, which in turn causes changes in the surrounding tissue and nerves so they become sensitised to even the slightest and most benign stimuli.The pain is realAnyone who’s experienced lower back pain might be surprised to learn that it’s rarely caused by serious injury. But studies using imaging technology such as X-ray, CT and MRI scans show that in the majority of causes, there is no obvious difference between people with pain and people without pain. “This old thinking of, ‘Oh, you’ve done your back’ is not supported with current evidence,” O’Sullivan says.That doesn’t diminish the crippling effects of lower back pain. O’Sullivan likens it to a muscle cramp or severe headache: the pain is real, even if medical technology can’t pinpoint what’s causing it.Adopt a healthy lifestyleAs with so many musculoskeletal issues, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of painkillers. A recentAustralian studyshowed just how important – finding that lifestyle changes such as sleeping better, quitting smoking, eating a healthier diet and getting more physical activity could save people thousands of dollars on healthcare for low back pain.One participant in the study was a woman who had lived with chronic low back pain for more than 40 years, says PhD researcher Tiara Tian from the University of Sydney. “She went from being very impacted by back pain in her daily life, all the way to not being bothered by back pain for the last 12 months,” says Tian. All it took was a gradual increase in physical activity, from a 15-minute walk around the block every day to a Zoom-based exercise class.‘Move the spine in all directions’The solution to the majority of back pain is to just keep moving, experts say. “The best movement is the next movement,” O’Sullivan says. In terms of specific exercises for the spine, O’Sullivan says yoga can help. “We encourage people to move the spine in all directions … flex, extension, rotate and side-bend.”Exercising with back pain doesn’t mean ignoring the pain, but doing as much as you can with it, Ferreira says. “You have to change how you move, but you have to keep moving – it’s almost like reminding your brain that it’s OK to move.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe way you moveFitnessHealth & wellbeingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the reporter put the same question toMelania, she ventured: “Well, we will all be in different places, I guess.” With a nervous laugh, she turned to look at Trump and asked, “Right?”Eggs, hats and unfettered political ambition: what we learned about Melania Trump from her documentaryRead moreThe couple were attending Thursday night’s premiere of Melania, a big-budget documentary billed as an “unprecedented, behind-the-scenes look” at the first lady’s return to the White House – but dismissed by critics as a $75m vanity project andlikely box office flop.The film, which chronicles the 20 days leading up to the inauguration in January 2025, was shown at Washington’s John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which the president’s acolytes havetried to renamethe Trump-Kennedy Center in a legally dubious move.Financed byAmazonMGM Studios, the documentary has been marketed with the gusto of a Hollywood blockbuster rather than a discreet political portrait. TV adverts ran during NFL playoff games; billboards appeared across US cities; and a promotional video was projected on the exterior of Las Vegas’s Sphere. This week adverts were even spotted in London’s Piccadilly Circus.Amazon paid a record $40m to license the filmand a related docuseries for its Prime Video platform, with a further $35m spent on promotion and distribution, according to people familiar with the deal. The Wall Street Journalreportedthat Melania Trump will personally make $28m.The scale of the spend has raised eyebrows, not least because Amazon’s founder and chair, Jeff Bezos, also contributed toTrump’s inaugural fundlast year. Amazon and the film’s director, Brett Ratner, have rejected suggestions that the project was designed to curry favour with the administration.Ratner – for whom this is the first film since 2017, whensix women accused himof sexual misconduct, allegations that he denies – told reporters at the premiere: “It wasn’t about getting rich. I think the Trumps are wealthy and successful enough.”The documentary opened on roughly 1,700 screens in the US and Canada on Friday, with releases in about 25 territories beyond North America. Box office analysts suggest an opening weekend of up to $5m.The film promises rare access to one of Washington’s most elusive figures. The Slovenian-bornMelania Trump, 55, has kept a low profile during her husband’s second term and has long stressed a desire for privacy.Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreTheofficial traileropens on inauguration day, showing her in a navy wide-brimmed hat at the US Capitol, before cutting to scenes in which she advises the president on his inaugural address, urging him to strike the tone of a “peacemaker and unifier”. At one moment she looks straight into the camera and remarks drily: “Here we go again.”Melania told journalists on Thursday: “I want to show the audience my life – what it takes to be a first lady again. It’s beautiful, it’s emotional, it’s fashionable, it’s cinematic and I’m very proud of it.”Some observers are intrigued by the prospect.Anita McBride, who was chief of staff to the former first lady Laura Bush, asked: “Why not? In her first term there was such hostility towards her and everything that she tried to do, so this is an opportunity for her in the second term where she has come back confident, knowledgable, defining herself and her role in the way that she wants to and not to be defined by others’ expectations of her.”But few in the film industry are expecting a masterpiece. The British documentary maker James Fletcher, who madeThe Accidental Presidentabout how and why Trump won the 2016 election, said: “I wouldn’t go to cinema to watch it. Melania is conspicuous by her absence. She’s not like Michelle Obama, who was pretty present. Obviously Hillary Clinton was, and we all remember Nancy Reagan and ‘Just say no’.“It strikes me it’s quite hard to make a documentary about someone who’s not in evidence. But I may be totally wrong and there could be a brilliant angle or some scoop in there that is going to shut us all up.”Historians have observed that the film is unprecedented for a sitting first lady. Presidents and their spouses have traditionally avoided commercial ventures while in office to prevent conflicts of interest.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump Jr arrives at the world premiere of Melania at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC on Thursday.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesHillary Clinton and Michelle Obama both waited until their White House years were behind them before publishing memoirs.Obama’s Becomingwent on to become the fastest-selling memoir of all time. Jill Biden, by contrast, continued teaching English at a local community college. Her salary for 2023 was $85,985, according to the Bidens’ tax returns.Kurt Bardella, a political commentator and former congressional aide, said:“I can only imagine what Republicans would have said had first lady Hillary Clinton, first lady Michelle Obama, first lady Jill Biden been paid somewhere between $30m and $40m by a Hollywood studio to allow a documentary.“The one consistent thing that we have seen during Trump 2 is the ‘open for business’ sign that’s been tattooed on the White House and the first family availing themselves of profiting from the presidency.” The Trumps have continued to market everything from watches and fragrances to jewellery, ornaments and digital collectibles.From ICE to Melania’s black carpet, are Trump’s techlords getting pangs of buyer’s remorse? | Marina HydeRead moreMary Jordan, author of The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump, said the first lady’s three motivations for making the film were “money, money and money”.Another incentive, Jordan added, is editorial control. “It has always bothered her when people wrote about her. She has said several times, ‘Only I know my truth, only I know my story.’ She’s never quite adapted to the fact that if you are the best-known woman in the world, people will write about you. This was her chance to tell a bit of her story herself. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to suddenly have a pulling back of the curtain about who Melania is.”Melania Trump has been closely involved in the film’s development for more than a year, according to her advisers. It also highlights her policy interests, including child welfare initiatives, online safety legislation, foster-care reform, and a role in the administration’s work on artificial intelligence and education.Like her husband’s, Melania Trump’s second term is proving quite different from her first. Jordan commented: “In the first term, people were always wondering if she was this damsel in distress –blink your eyesif you need a rescue – that somehow she was there captive. You don’t have any of that this time.“She is making it very clear that she’s independent and that is something she’s always wanted. She has her own projects.She exudes more confidence now and she certainly has more of her own money too.”Explore more on these topicsMelaniaDocumentary filmsMelania TrumpDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmazon Prime VideoAmazonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The combination of nuts in a mixed bag matters enormously, too. After all, if your least favourite nut dominates a particular packet, it will be a chore to get through. Also, some nuts are more expensive than others, with macadamia, pecans and cashews fetching a higher price per kilo than the humble peanut (which is actually a legume), say. The formula affects both price and profit, so for today’s test I’ve listed the most prominent nuts in each packet to help you choose one that suits you.Due to their high fat content, nuts are particularly prone to oxidation, so their freshness can deteriorate fast, leading to rancid flavours and bitterness, and that freshness depends on when the product was harvested and how it was packaged. This information isn’t generally available on packets, but the use-by date is, so always pick a bag with the longest possible shelf life – at least six months ideally. To keep your nuts fresh, store them in an airtight container and, if possible, in the fridge.The best supermarket mixed nutsBest overall:Waitrose mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£5 for 250g at Waitrose (£2/100g)★★★★☆Lots of super-crunchy almonds and large walnuts, with a good ratio of brazil nuts, and a scattering of hazelnuts and sweet pecans. A few nuts were crushed from rough transportation, but overall one of the freshest packets I tried. Great quality and well balanced. Packaging recyclable in-store.Best bargain:Natural Days mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£2.15 for 200g at Ocado (£1.08/100g)★★★★☆Beautiful, big walnut halves, crunchy almonds, a sufficient quantity of sweet cashews and a few tasty hazelnuts scattered throughout. A fresh aroma, with the walnuts dominating, and the quality and variety are exceptional for this price point and the types of nuts included. Sadly, though, these have non-recyclable packaging.And the rest …Sainsbury’s So Organic mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£5.50 for 300g at Sainsbury’s (£1.83/100g)★★★★☆A bountiful mix of brazils, walnuts and hazelnuts with a smaller but sufficient ratio of almonds and creamy cashews. Consistently fresh. Good value for an entry-level organic product that doesn’t compromise on quality. Packaging not recyclable.Asda mixed nut selectionView image in fullscreen£2.02 for 190g at Asda (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆Equal quantities of almonds, cashews, pecans and peanuts combine in a more economical bag than most. A sweet aroma, but the peanuts overpower the more delicate nuts. Overall, good freshness and great value for an everyday mix. Nonrecyclable packaging.Fudco deluxe assorted nutsView image in fullscreen£7.40 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (£1.48/100g)★★★☆☆Mostly creamy cashews and sweet almonds, with some disappointing walnuts, and a limited number of delicious pecans and brazil nuts. Good value for a rich and diverse combination, though freshness varied. Packaging recyclable in-store.Sainsbury’s mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£5 for 300g at Sainsbury’s (£1.67/100g)★★★☆☆A pretty even mix of crunchy almonds, walnuts and cashews, plus a scattering of brazil nuts. A fresh aroma and flavour throughout. Decent value.

A generous mixture with good variety, though the freshness was mixed. Packaging not recyclable.Tesco mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 500g at Tesco (£1.30/100g)★★☆☆☆A high ratio of crunchy but bitter hazelnuts, lovely, amaretto-flavoured almonds and rather less tasty blanched almonds, with a few sweet cashews and delicious walnut halves. Good value, but loses points for its poor ratio and variable quality. Packaging recyclable in-store.Co-op mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£2.40 for 120g at Co-op (£2/100g)★★☆☆☆An even mix of large almonds, creamy cashews, hazelnuts and generous walnut pieces. The balance is sound, though freshness was less consistent. Grab-bag-size for snacking on the go. Packaging recyclable in-store.Crazy Jack organic mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£3.40 for 175g at Ocado (£1.94/100g)★★☆☆☆A near-even mix of fresh and tasty hazelnuts, shrivelled and poorly flavoured almonds, large and notably delicious walnuts, and juicy brazil nuts and cashews. The organic certification is added value, but these are ultimately let down by the sub-par almonds (hopefully a one-off with my packet).

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Lou Blake. Archive photograph: courtesy of Rosie JonesBorn in 1990 in Bridlington, East Yorkshire,Rosie Jonesbegan her career working in television as a researcher on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, before moving into live comedy. Her television appearances include Live at the Apollo, The Last Leg, Taskmaster and the Tokyo Paralympics. She has published a series of children’s books, titled The Amazing Edie Eckhart, and hosts the new series of Out of Order on Comedy Central.This was taken in my childhood homein Bridlington. My family had moved in not long before the photo was taken, hence the very empty living room in the background. I should also acknowledge my incredible outfit: Mr Men trousers, paired with a black velvet hat. It makes me really fond of my mum. She took so much pride in putting me in ridiculous clothes.I was a smiley, happy child. I’ve had cerebral palsy since birth, so I’ve never known any other reality. At three years old I went to a disabled nursery connected to a disabled school, and I remember thinking, “Why am I here?” At the end of the day, the teacher brought my parents in and said, “Rosie should be in a mainstream school.”I was five when theDisability Discrimination Actcame in. If I’d been born 10 years earlier, I probably would have gone to that disabled school, which would have led to fewer opportunities for me in the long run. Instead, the mainstream school was given a lot of funding by the government. I was one of a few disabled children in my year, so I had a teacher’s aide, one-to one, for my entire primary school experience. I couldn’t hand-write because of my cerebral palsy, but I was given a laptop so I never missed out on any of my education. It breaks my heart to think of the disabled people starting school today. The funding they need to succeed simply isn’t there any more.Being disabled, I couldn’t walk or talk properly, but I realised that if I made a funny face or said something silly, getting laughter from people was all I needed. I was hooked on being funny. My training started at home: my dad, bless him – a good man, not a funny bone in his body – was out of the game. My mum and my brother, however, were always cracking jokes and doing characters. Not to be arrogant or a dickhead, but it was me setting them up for the punchline. This continued as a teenager at school. I wanted to be surrounded by laughter, but I didn’t necessarily want to be the one in the spotlight because I already had so much unwanted attention. Feeding other people the lines made me feel far more comfortable.I’m very liberal and vocal in my beliefs and my politics, so with the rise of the right, I get abused online every dayAt the start of my career, I wasworking on 8 Out of 10 Cats, writing jokes for Jimmy Carr. Alongside my full-time job as a TV researcher, I was doing a postgraduate diploma in comedy writing at the National Film andTelevisionSchool. I was taught by an amazing man, Bill Dare, who sadly isn’t with us any more. In the best possible way, he was a grumpy bugger. I’d hand in my sketches or jokes and he would take one look and go, “No, it’s shit.” It didn’t put me off – I was in my element, surrounded by other comedy writers and going to the pub after class. One night, when I was telling everyone a story as we had a drink, Bill looked at me and said, “You’re a standup. Go and try standup comedy.” I thought, “Well, now I’ve got to do it.”After that, I became more aware of how internalised ableism had shaped me and my perception of who I could become. I grew stronger in my confidence and realised, “Why the fuck can’t I be the one telling the joke?” I already had a bit of material ready. Without acknowledging it, I had been workshopping jokes down the pub for years. For example, “Oh, I’m not disabled, I’m drunk.” Those lines were ones I’d use as a defence mechanism to show people that I might have a disability, but I was an alert, intelligent and extremely foolish person, too.During those first five yearsofgigging, I barely slept. I was working in TV during the day, doing standup five days a week, then I would get home and do my homework for the comedy writing course. It was hard, but worth it. Whenever I meet aspiring standups and they say to me, “I want to be rich and famous. How do I do that?” I always reply, “You literally need to go to Reading on a Wednesday night, perform to four people who fucking hate you, cry on the train home and be £40 out of pocket.” If you can do that and wake up the next day thinking, “We go again” – then that means standup comedy is for you.Mika looks back: ‘Nowadays you wouldn’t get away with the things journalists said about my sexuality in the noughties’Read moreBeing famous was never something I wanted. Standup is just a hobby that got out of hand. The upside of having an audience is that people listen. We live in a world where disabled people are often left out of the conversation – even conversations about disability. Through my career, I’m able to go on TV or write for newspapers, and people pay attention to what I say. It also matters when someone comes up to me and tells me, “Thank you for the representation.” Growing up, I rarely saw disabled characters in the media, and when I did, they were usually victims or treated as vulnerable. It would have blown my mind to see an independent disabled adult – swearing, talking about sex, drinking, smoking and having flaws – on primetime TV.The other side of fameis that I attract a lot of negativity. I’m very liberal and vocal in my politics, so with the rise of the right, I get abused online every day. I’ve got to work hard on my mental health and choose not to expose myself to social media. It’s also made me quite anxious when I go out. Sometimes my friends will suggest we go into a pub and I’ll think, “It looks a bit busy, let’s not.” I don’t always feel like I’m in the frame of mind to deal with strangers coming over to me, because I never know what will happen. Sometimes people want to take photos, but a lot of people hug or kiss me. I don’t know if it’s because I’m small, a woman, disabled, or because I have a friendly persona, but there are even times when people try to pick me up. I’m sure it comes with good intentions, but I often have to say, “You know what, can you put me down, please?” In an ideal world, I would like the fame that means I have power that influences representation, without having the online abuse and boundary crossing.When I look back at this photo, I feel inspired. I’ve got such a love-hate – emphasis on hate – relationship with mobility aids. If they’re offered to me now, I think, “I can walk, so why would I use an aid when that’s a physical embodiment of disability?” That wasn’t how I felt back then. Mobility aids were simply tools that helped me get around. Over the years, they became negative symbols of disability. That internalised ableism is something I’m trying to shed through therapy. When I see how happily I’m using my rollator at the age of three, I realise that 35-year-old Rosie could learn a lot from her younger self.Explore more on these topicsRosie JonesFlashbackComedyTV comedyTelevisionDisabilityFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lurching between extremes is their speciality. They were shambolic against struggling West Ham for 45 minutes, had Stamford Bridge ready to turn on Liam Rosenior at half-time and still found a way to mount a comeback so wild it left their opponents in a state of utter, uncontrollable rage at the end of an incomprehensible London derby.Where to begin? With the end, perhaps, and Enzo Fernández running on to a cutback from João Pedro to make it 3-2 to Chelsea in the 92nd minute. It was some turnaround. João Pedro had made the difference after coming on at the start of the second half. The forward scored Chelsea’s first, heading home just before the hour, and was cool when he broke into the West Ham area when the game ran into added time. João Pedro had options. He could have shot and he could have crossed. Instead he threw West Ham by pulling the ball back to Fernández, who is beginning to resemble Frank Lampard with his knack of deciding games with late unnoticed runs from midfield.Proud Liam Rosenior wants to be best choice Chelsea have ever madeRead moreWest Ham, who remain five points below Nottingham Forest in 18th place, were broken. They dominated the first half, goals from Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville lifting them into a commanding position. The revival led by Nuno Espírito Santo looked set to continue. West Ham were strong, muscular and dangerous. They defended and attacked as a unit. They rattled Chelsea. It would not be enough. The red mist descended. A mass brawl ended with West Ham fortunate that Jean-Clair Todibo was the only player to be sent off. The defender will miss three games for throttling João Pedro but could have been followed down the tunnel by Konstantinos Mavropanos and Adama Traoré.Nuno could not hide his disappointment. He criticised his side’s defending during the second half, although he has to take his share of the blame. Nuno was bold at first but too quick to retreat when the tide turned. Not for the first time, he relinquished the initiative with his changes. The most inexplicable was taking off Pablo and replacing the striker with Max Kilman. Chelsea were level three minutes later. Liam Delap headed against the bar and Marc Cucurella, one of three half-time changes from Rosenior, stooped to head in the equaliser.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro urges on the crowd and his teammates after pulling a goal back for Chelsea.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersIs Rosenior a lucky manager or a tactical genius? Chelsea’s head coach has six wins from seven games since replacing Enzo Maresca but few have been convincing. The recoveries are becoming a theme. Rosenior responded after making a mess of his initial approach, just as he had when he bungled his starting lineup duringChelsea’s victory over Napoliin the Champions League last Wednesday.Chelsea’s mentality against inferior opposition was under the spotlight. Rosenior wanted to see if they could back up the win in Naples. He said this game would tell him a lot about his players. He did not discover anything good about them at first.West Ham rattled Chelsea with an intense, coordinated press. Taty Castellanos and Pablo were dangerous front two. Pablo was involved in the opening goal. His presence deceived Robert Sánchez, who let Bowen’s cross from the right drift inside the far post after seven minutes.Quick GuideChelsea 3-2 West Ham key factsShow• Chelsea won a Premier League match having been two goals behind at half time for the first time ever in the competition, while West Ham lost an away match that they were two goals ahead at the break for the second time (lost 3-2 against Wigan in May 2011).• Liam Rosenior (pictured) became the fourth English manager to win his first three Premier League games in charge, after Bobby Gould in August 1992, Sam Allardyce in August 2001 and Craig Shakespeare (first 5) in April 2017.Photograph: John Walton/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Chelsea, who made seven changes before the second leg of their League Cup semi-final against Arsenal, were miles off the pace. The passing was abysmal and their left flank was a mess. Bowen tormented Jorrel Hato before Cucurella replaced the left-back. It was 2-0 when Alejandro Garnacho failed to track Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The right-back ran on to a pass from Bowen and set Summerville up for his fourth goal in as many games.The mood darkened. Trevoh Chalobah was arguing with a home fan when the teams walked off at half-time. Rosenior acted. Benoît Badiashile, Garnacho and Hato were taken off. João Pedro, Cucurella and Wesley Fofana brought on. West Ham kept attacking, though; Bowen and Mateus Fernandes were close to making it 3-0.View image in fullscreenJean-Clair Todibo clashes with João Pedro and is later sent off, much to Chelsea supporters’ delight.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersChelsea’s substitutions began to make an impact. Nuno was enraged by his side allowing Fofana to advance and cross for João Pedro to head past Alphonse Areola. West Ham faded. Areola made a stunning stop from Moisés Caicedo. Nuno wanted to protect the lead. The introduction of Kilman made no difference. Pedro Neto, another substitute, crossed. Malo Gusto won the first header and Cucurella scored after the otherwise disappointing Delap hit the woodwork.West Ham are without a clean sheet since August. That will have to change if they are to stay up. This was agonising. They hit the post through Todibo in the 86th minute. It seemed they would have to settle for a point. Fernández had other ideas.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Even now, with so much mileage in his legs at 38, Djokovic has never doubted his ability to still match the level of the best player in the world. His durability, however, is another issue altogether and he struggled to recover physically from tough best-of-five-sets matches throughout last season.It cost Djokovic so much energy to put Sinner away after four hours in such a high-intensity match, that even before he thinks about his prodigious opponent across the net, his biggest concern is his recovery.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz revels in the adulation after winning his semi-final against Alexander Zverev.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersFortunately for the oldest Australian Open men’s finalist in history, Alcaraz at least shares similar worries. Around an hour before Djokovic and Sinner entered the court on Friday, Alcaraz added yet another match to his portfolio ofimprobable comeback victories, fighting back from cramps and a fifth-set deficit break to reach his first final here.Gauff’s racket rage fallout: are players right to feel like they’re on Big Brother? | Tumaini CarayolRead moreConsidering how much of his movement he recovered by the end, it seems likely that Alcaraz’s physical problems against Zverev were merely cramps. With rest and diligent recovery, many players often do not have any lingering difficulties after cramping episodes, particularly 22-year-old players. However, Alcaraz spent five hours, 27 minutes on court against Zverev, just two minutes shy of his win over Sinnerin last year’s French Open final.The second Saturday of a grand slam usually provides an opportunity for the two finalists to feel the ball on the practice court, but this time both players were nowhere to be seen, prioritising their recovery.This final will be a historic moment regardless of who triumphs. Djokovic would become the oldest grand slam singles champion, extending his open era record to 25 titles. Alcaraz would become the youngest male player to complete the career grand slam. It is not hyperbolic to call this a meeting between the greatest old man in the history of tennis and a player making a strong case for being the sport’s greatest young player.The two players are 16 years apart in age. That they have enjoyed such a storied rivalry is unprecedented in men’s tennis. They first faced each other in the semi-finals of the Madrid Masters in 2022, when a 19-year-old Alcaraz underlined his potential by defeating Djokovic in three tight setsbefore toppling Rafael Nadalin the final.They have played some of the great matches of the 2020s and have been each other’s foil in some of their most important moments, with Alcaraz showing his penchant for dramatic comebacks with his five-set win over Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final. A year later, Djokovic summoned every ounce of his willpower to overcome the Spaniardat the Paris Olympicsand win the gold medal he had craved for decades.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic celebrates his win over Jannik Sinner.Photograph: James Ross/EPANobody understands the challenge of trying to overcome two pre-eminent players quite like Djokovic. This was the story of his early career, as he forced himself into the Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal duopoly, eventually rising above both.Then came a long period when Djokovic was the incumbent No 1 and defeating him after overcoming Nadal or Federer was others’ greatest test. In this final stretch of his career, with a conclusion still nowhere in sight, Djokovic is halfway to taking out the two shiny, new champions at the top of the sport he commanded for so long. He is exactly where he wants to be.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Novak DjokovicCarlos AlcarazAustralia sportTennisAustralian OpenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This against a team who have lost once since the start of December and with a ferocious home crowd behind them.Bournemouth build on Liverpool win as Kroupi and Scott sink WolvesRead moreFifteen minutes before kick-off, Bukayo Saka picked up a hip problem in the warm-up, but to the their credit Arsenal navigated a tricky test to return to winning ways in emphatic fashion. Time will tell on how long Saka will be missing for, with Mikel Arteta only saying the winger had a “little niggle”.What would have been most encouraging for Arsenal, aside from the result, was the man who replaced Saka. Noni Madueke’s goal contributions have fallen firmly under the spotlight in recent days, as have the entirety of the Arsenal attack. At one stage on Saturday, own goals were their joint-highest Premier League scorer this season.View image in fullscreenLeeds’ Karl Darlow punches the ball into his own net in the 38th minute, his view from an Arsenal corner obscured by teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBut this was a coming of age performance for Madueke in an Arsenal shirt. His sumptuous cross allowed Martín Zubimendi to head his side into the lead midway through the first half and in the 38th minute the winger’s corner was punched into his own net by Karl Darlow, who had an afternoon to forget.The£50m price taghas seemed to be an immense burden on Madueke and though he is still waiting for his first goal, his performance was encouraging. The news on Saka will become clearer in the coming days, but Arsenal can take some comfort that a player brought in to boost squad depth delivered.Quick GuideLeeds 0-4 Arsenal key actsShow• After wins at Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Chelsea, Inter and Leeds in January 2026, Arsenal have won five away games across all competitions in a single month for just a second time in the club’s history, with the previous instance coming in April 2000 (that run also included a 4-0 win at Elland Road).• Only in 2009-10 (6) have Arsenal benefited from more own goals in a single Premier League campaign than the five they’ve benefited from so far in 2025-26.• Aged 27 years and 17 days, Declan Rice (pictured) became the fifth youngest player to reach 300 Premier League appearances after Wayne Rooney (26y 58d), James Milner (26y 117d), Gareth Barry (26y 247d) and Raheem Sterling (26y 348d).OptaPhotograph: Lee Smith/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I’m very happy,” Arteta said. “It was a very impressive performance and result. We really wanted to show how much we wanted it given the fact three results haven’t gone our way in the league and we certainly did that.”Leeds will look back on this with frustration, but their season will not be defined by these sorts of fixtures. The visit of Nottingham Forest on Friday is a far more significant encounter for their survival hopes, but the lack of anything too noteworthy in attack will have disgruntled Daniel Farke.“Arsenal were deserved winners,” the Leeds manager said. “We faced the best side in Europe. There’s a reason they’re top of the league and you need a perfect day to give yourselves a chance, as well as a bit of luck. We didn’t have that and they were on it from the first second to the last.”Arsenal dominated most of the contest and when Madueke’s cross was headed in by Zubimendi midway through the first half, it was the least they deserved. That was bad enough for the hosts, but the second goal was hugely damaging. Arsenal’s set-piece routines proved decisive again, as Darlow flapped at a Madueke corner.Farke responded at half-time by reverting to a back four and for a short while there was a brief upturn from Leeds. But as the game entered the final quarter the substitute Gabriel Martinelli’s cross was turned home by Viktor Gyökeres for his sixth league goal of the season. Darlow again could have done better.Arsenal were not done. With four minutes left, another of their attacking options scored a much-needed goal as Gabriel Jesus spun away from Pascal Struijk before curling home a marvellous effort that, this time, Darlow could do nothing about.Teams rarely win at Elland Road by margins as great as this, but this was as decisive and convincing an away win as you are likely to find. After an unsteadying couple of weeks, Arsenal’s position as champions in-waiting has emphatically returned.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But there was one noise that wasn’t quite right. In the sacred moments before each player’s serving motion, the crowd generally obeyed the protocol demanding silence. However, a single bird – perched somewhere high in the rafters – was less compliant.It must not have been able to escape before the roof shut on Saturday afternoon, and so there it stayed. Tweet-tweet. An unusual accompaniment to a grand slam final. No one could see the critter, though long they tried, as dozens of the 15,000-strong crowd craned their necks in curiosity. Even the umpire kept glancing up, only to recognise the limit of even his broad powers. Tweet-tweet.Elena Rybakina rocks Aryna Sabalenka to grab first Australian Open triumphRead moreThe quaint, sweet birdsong was agreeable and familiar, as was the contest below. Featuring two players at the summit of tennis – the world No 1 inAryna Sabalenkaand Elena Rybakina, soon-to-be No 3, whatever the outcome – who knew each other intimately. Their power games are well matched and their sustained success has brought them together often. They had duelled more times than either had faced anyone else on tour, 14 times all up.The most important of those wasthe final at Melbourne Park three years ago, marking the major breakthrough for Sabalenka, and – after giving up a one-set lead – one of several setbacks suffered by Rybakina in recent years that have became fodder for tour whispers.But as the Rod Laver Arena wildlife kept chirping, those whispers were hushed. The Kazakshtani secured the first set and was testing Sabalenka in a fierce second. At about this time, a newly downloaded bird app identified the sound as coming froma myna, but not the noisy type.The tenor of the match was soon to change, however, as Rybakina crumbled to hand the second set to her opponent – failing to win a point on serve at 4-5 – and falling to an early break in the third. A 16-shot rally in that game was an arm wrestle, a microcosm of the final thus far.The pair went backhand to backhand until Rybakina bent. For the loser there was no rage in response, no wild gesticulations, only a forlorn woman looking like she wanted to be somewhere else. The bird, by the way, was also quiet.View image in fullscreenDespair for Aryna Sabalenka after losing the women’s singles final against Elena Rybakina.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPAThe contrast with Sabalenka was jarring. In apparel, the world No 1 wore orange and pink stitched with black and blue and matched with jewellery, as her opponent got around in functional off-white. At the end of each point, win or lose, Sabalenka provided a reaction – flicking her hand in dismay, shouting: “Let’s go!” or pointing to her head as if to question what she was thinking.The on-court theatrics and off-court charisma have won her many fans and they were bellowing in the third set as she closed in on her thirdAustralian Opentriumph. “Come on, Tiger: you got this,” one loud supporter shouted, referencing the animal that is now a key part of brand Aryna.In comparison, there were fewer Rybakina supporters. Perhaps the most vocal was Malika Batkuldina. The civil engineer and tennis fan carried a handmade sign scrawled with crayon, reading “Lena ace” and a crown to point out Rybakina’s record as the tournament’s top server. Batkuldina had flown to Australia last week for the tournament to support a group of Kazakhstani players led by Alexander Bublik and Rybakina.Although both were recruited from Russia as teenagers, she saw no reason not to support them. “It doesn’t matter where she was born,” Batkuldina said, who described Rybakina as “calm and more introverted, not so social and [an] extrovert, [or an] emotional person”.As the third set built to its climax, the bird had resumed its song. It was almost drowned out by an arena full of noise, amplified by all Sabalenka’s fire and fury. But through the crescendo, Rybakina maintained a quiet determination. She was an eye in the storm, patiently breaking back against Sabalenka, and then completing the upset with the minimum of fuss.She had beaten the queen of hard courts, the best player in the world, the contemporary benchmark for the sport. Yet there were no outbursts after the final point, no dramatic collapse to the court. Just a briefly clenched fist and a nod to her team to mark a very loud victory.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Aryna SabalenkaAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Would they have taken a run of 11 games without a win, Eberechi Eze andMarc Guéhi sold,Oliver Glasner disillusionedand on his way out of the club, and a probable relegation battle ahead? Almost certainly, yes.But equally that Palace fan would be within their rights to ask why there should be a pay-off at all. This isn’t like Portsmouth winning the FA Cup in 2008 while living beyond their meansunder Alexandre Gaydamak, going intoadministration in 2009-10. It’s not like Wigan winning the FA Cup as theywere relegated in 2013having been sustained in the Premier League by Dave Whelan.It’s not even like Leicester who were forced into cutbacks and relegated, two years after adding an FA Cup to their 2016 Premier League title (and werefined on their return to the Championshipfor Financial Fair Play breaches in their promotion season of 2013-14). There is no suggestion at all of Palace having overstretched; rather they have been chewed up by the economic realities of the modern game.The day English football changed: 10 years on from Manchester City naming Pep GuardiolaRead moreThere is no real villain here who has exploited the club for his own ends, even if Steve Parish mayregret working with John Textor, whose Eagle Football Holdings seems to specialise in alienating fans of each of the clubs it owns. There has been no foolish overspending – even if the idea that the fees paid for Brennan Johnson, Yéremy Pino and Jaydee Canvot exceed those recouped for Eze and Guéhi is not immediately easy to justify.If he has any self-awareness, Parish may also be regretting his comments during Covid when, rejecting the idea that Premier League clubs should help out those lower down the food chain, he said that “supermarkets” were not bailing out “corner shops”. That sort of financial Darwinism cuts both ways.None of which changes the fact that Palace have done everything by the book. This is the modern way. Identify young promise and mid-range talent, buy it, develop it, sell it on, replace. That’s how it’s meant to be. It’s how Brighton, Brentford and Bournemouth do things. It’s the reality of existence for the Premier League’s mid-ranks. It makes sense. It’s an accommodation to the economic environment.But there is a ceiling, and Palace pressed against it pretty hard. In all but one season since their return to the Premier League in 2013, Palace have finished between 10th and 15th. In mid-December they were fourth in the league and favourites to win the Europa Conference League, even if they had failed to qualify automatically for the last 16. Something truly spectacular seemed possible.That they were even in the Europa Conference League rather than the Europa League, of course, had been the first intimation that all would not be entirely well after the FA Cup win; the decision to demote them for Nottingham Forest may have been technically correct but it felt a demonstration of how modern football will snuff out romance wherever it can. Textor did, at the deadline, part-own Palace and Lyon; that the beneficiaries were Nottingham Forest, with whose owner, Evangelos Marinakis, Textor enjoys a close business relationship, only heightened the sense of grievance.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace fans hold up a cutout of Oliver Glasner. There are no villains at Selhurst Park, just the harsh economic realities of the modern game.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut since losing 3-0 at home to Manchester City on 14 December, Palace haven’t won. They’re 15th, only eight points clear of a resurgent West Ham in 18th. It’s true that is also only nine points off fifth place and probable Champions League qualification, but nobody at Selhurst Park is looking in that direction at the moment. How then, has it come to this? Is there anything Palace could have done differently?A player of Eze’s quality was always going to leave, as Michael Olise had the previous summer. Perhaps the timeframe has been compressed, but that’s always been true: Champions League players want to play for Champions League clubs. Guéhi falls into a similar category, but the difference is that, with his contract expiring, Palace had to accept a relatively low fee rather than risk losing him for free in the summer.Perhaps there were issues of communication, but none of that can have come as a surprise to Glasner. Or indeed to the other players, notably Jean-Philippe Mateta, who now seems to have been unsettled by themanager’s announcement of his own departure.What seems to have caused the frustration is a perceived failure to build on the FA Cup success but, in truth, it’s not clear what Palace could have done differently. In financial terms winning the FA Cup may bring a short-term boost in exposure, but little more. Palace made around £7.5m from playing in the Conference League.They would have roughly doubled that in the Europa League, but even that is far from life-changing money – although the Europa League is clearly the more attractive competition and offers the possibility of Champions League qualification and a significant boost to revenues. Perhaps they could have been more ambitious while remaining within PSR, but with the decoupling from Textor, Parish can hardly be blamed if he envisaged a quiet summer.And that perhaps is the major issue. For Palace fans, winning a first trophy was the achievement of a lifetime ambition. It’s a day that will endure forever in the collective memory of the club and, less intensely, of football more generally. It feels like it should make some sort of long-term difference to the club’s status, but financially nothing much has changed.Palace will probably end up, once again, finishing between 10th and 15th. And that means that the cycle of sourcing talent and selling at a profit goes on, just with the added fatigue of playing in European competition, and with the FA Cup success having underlined just how good some of their players were, making them even more attractive to predators.It’s very hard, bordering on the impossible, even with an FA Cup success, without an enormous injection of cash, for a club to climb from being a top-15 side to a top-10 side, let alone a top-eight side or a top-six side.And the risk of collapse, of one sale prompting a flurry of departures, the example of Leicester is ever present. Money is destiny.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

He oversaw a period of extraordinary success during his 20-year career with Red Bull, winning eight drivers’ and six constructors’ titles.However, Red Bull’s decision to sack him came a year-and-a-half after he was accused of “inappropriate behaviour” by a female colleague. Horner alwaysdenied the claims and was exoneratedfor a second time of controlling behaviour by an independent KC.Mercedes and Hamilton shine in F1’s first pre-season test in BarcelonaRead moreAlpine confirmed last week that Horner is among a group interested in investing in the team and breaking his silence on Saturday at the European Motor Show in Dublin, Horner said: “I feel like I have unfinished business inFormula One. It didn’t finish the way that I would have liked it to finish.“But I am not going to come back for just anything. I am only going to come back for something that can win. I don’t want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built. I had 21 incredible years in Formula One. I had a great run, won a lot of races, championships and worked with some amazing drivers, engineers and partners.“I don’t need to go back. I could stop my career now. So I would only go back for the right opportunity to work with great people, and to work in an environment where people want to win, and they shared that desire. I would want to be a partner, rather than just a hired hand, but we will see how it plays out. I am not in a rush. I don’t need to do anything.”A Horner-led consortium has discussed purchasing Otro Capital’s 24% stake in Alpine, who finished bottom of the constructors’ championship last season. Horner has also been linked with moves to Aston Martin and Ferrari.Horner added: “What has been fascinating is that I stepped out of Red Bull on July 8, and this is the first time I have actually spoken to anyone. [In the media] I have beengoing to every single Formula One team, which has ranged from the back of the grid, to the middle of the grid, and to the front of the grid.

As the ball hit the back of the net after the substitute Beto had bundled in the equaliser in the seventh minute of injury time, theEvertonmanager set off. Moyes is 63 in April, but he sprinted on to the pitch in a moment of sheer delight as Brighton’s players dropped to their knees in despair.Somehow, Everton’s unbeaten record here that stretches back to 2019 is still intact. It had seemed a goal from Pascal Gross would be enough for Brighton to claim victory at the sixth attempt after they had spurned a number of chances in the first half. But while it is one thing to plan how you are going to overcome a team managed by Moyes, it is not quite so easy in practice.Bournemouth build on Liverpool win as Kroupi and Scott sink WolvesRead more“The only difference between me and Pleaty is that I got booked,” said Moyes when it was suggested his celebration was reminiscent of David Pleat’s jig across Manchester City’s Maine Road pitch when Luton avoided relegation in 1983. “Who wants to see managers getting booked for celebrating? It means they’ve got nothing about them at all. No thoughts about what football means, or what it means to the managers. I’m still shaking my head.”Asked if he would do it again, he said: “I bloody will do it again. Actually, if I had been a bit more mobile, I might have done a knee slide. That would have only got me a yellow as well so I might as well have gone the whole hog.”For Brighton this was another bitter pill to swallow afterlast Saturday’s last-ditch defeat at Fulham. It is now one win in their past 11 Premier League games and hopes of another European campaign are quickly evaporating. They left the pitch to boos, although they were mainly directed at the referee, Chris Kavanagh, for playing beyond the allotted six minutes of added time.Fabian Hürzeler refused to blame the officials, but admitted his disappointment that they could not see the game out after his captain, Lewis Dunk, failed to clear one last cross into Brighton’s penalty area. “In one moment we weren’t alive and this cost us the game,” he said. “It feels painful but we can either feel sorry for ourselves or choose to go again.”View image in fullscreenPascal Gross fires Brighton into the lead during the second half.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesMoyes deployed the 6ft 5in Jarrad Branthwaite at left-back and the England defender impressed on his first start of the season. Michael Keane was back from suspension to make up an intimidating-looking back four alongside James Tarkowski and Jake O’Brien.But Brighton were far too slick for them in the opening exchanges and almost went ahead twice in the opening three minutes. Gross was unlucky to see his volley from Ferdi Kadioglu’s cross deflect wide before Danny Welbeck’s improvised backheel was well saved by Jordan Pickford. Moyes was left scratching his head in disbelief when Welbeck directed a corner just past the post under barely any pressure from Everton’s defenders.They were bystanders again when Kaoru Mitoma brilliantly exchanged passes with Welbeck, but could only poke his shot wide of the far post with Pickford already committed.Brighton could not sustain the intensity of the opening half an hour and it was Hürzeler’s turn to look concerned as his tired-looking side struggled to recapture their rhythm. He exchanged some angry words with the fourth official as the half-time whistle sounded.View image in fullscreenBeto waves to the Everton fans after his dramatic equaliser.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAEverton started the second half with far more attacking intent and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was not far away after being set up by a clever flick from Thierno Barry. Branthwaite headed wide from a long throw and was then booked for an agricultural challenge on Yasin Ayari that left the Sweden international requiring lengthy treatment.Dewsbury-Hall should have broken the deadlock when he latched on toBarry’s cross, only for Bart Verbruggen to save well with his feet. Against the run of play, Brighton finally managed to find a way past Pickford when Mitoma dummied Ayari’s cross and Gross – who rejoined Brighton this month from Borussia Dortmund having spent seven years here this first spell – made no mistake.Mitoma had a goal ruled out for offside and it proved to be a vital moment. O’Brien’s shot was saved by Verbruggen but the ball fell straight to Beto to send Moyes off on his victory lap.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Work on the system, designed to take spectators from the centre of Cortina d’Ampezzo directly to the slopes, began behind schedule, and some residents raised safety concerns about its location in an area prone to landslides.Milan protesters denounce ICE unit at Winter Olympics and ‘creeping fascism’ in USRead moreDespite mounting doubts over the project, still unfinished a week before the opening of the Games next Friday, Simico, the state-backed agency in charge of Olympics infrastructure, said on Friday that work on the site was progressing according to schedule.However, in a letter dated 29 January to the central government’s top representative in the Belluno province, the chief Games operations officer, Andrea Francisi, said Simico had notified organisers the previous day that the gondola lift would not be delivered within the planned timeframe.In a statement on Saturday, Simico said work on the cable car was continuing and that safety checks required for the final commissioning were planned for the coming week. It said logistical problems such as school closures were not part of its remit. The Milano Cortina organising committee declined to comment.In the letter, which has not been previously reported, Francisi described the lift as an essential element of the Olympic mobility plan for Cortina, which will also host curling, bobsleigh, luge and skeleton events. “The loss of this strategic infrastructure, just ahead of the start of Olympic operations, creates significant organisational challenges, with major impacts on flow management, on security and on the overall ability of the system to absorb the alternative mobility required,” the letter said.View image in fullscreenThe Olympic rings against a backdrop of the Alpine skiing at Cortina d’Ampezzo.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesAs a result, organisers asked local authorities to close schools in Cortina on 10 and 12 February, and if possible on 11 February, to ease pressure on the town’s transport network during critical days for Olympic operations.Closing schools on the most critical days was described as “indispensable” to safeguard order and ensure the transport network could function. Games organisers have capped the number of tickets for events in Cortina pending clarity over whether the cable car would be ready.A spokesperson for the Milano Cortina 2026 organising committee said on Friday they have so far released a number of tickets in line with the capacity guaranteed by road transport.Set in the Dolomites, Cortina is one of Italy’s best-known winter resorts and staged the Games in 1956, but it has no railway station and access by the only main road into town can often be slow at peak times. Cars remain the main way to get around a town that is home to only around 5,500 permanent residents.Meanwhile, it was confirmed on Saturday that Milan’s Serie A match against Como, which at one point might have been played in Australia, will now be staged at San Siro during the Games on 18 February, raising the number of Serie A fixtures to be held in Milan during the Olympics to three.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsItalyEuropeShareReuse this content"

Federal prosecutors had identified 6 million files that were “potentially responsive” to the law, meaning that there are millions of files that have still not been released.The release marked a belated and partial compliance with a bill passed by Congress late last year, which had mandated that all government documents pertaining to Epstein and the various law enforcement investigations into his sexual abuse of girls be made public by 19 December 2025.Representatives Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Ro Khanna, a Democrat, quickly condemned the incomplete release and demanded access to the un-redacted files.“The DOJ said it identified over 6 million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions. This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld,” Khanna said, adding: “Failing to release these files only shields the powerful individuals who were involved and hurts the public’s trust in our institutions.”The Republicans’ latest Clinton stunt will not work | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe justice department had long complained that the sheer volume of files related to Epstein and the delicate nature of some of the information contained therein meant that they needed more time to redact sensitive information related to victims, and that therefore only some documents could be released.On Friday, in aletterto Congress, Blanche claimed that some tens of thousands additional documents were not being made public, both because of the presence of child sexual abuse material and because of information contained therein which could identify and endanger victims. But many of the documents made available to the public on Friday did in fact contain names and other sensitive information about women Epstein abused, leading some victims to condemn the Department of Justice’s “betrayal” andobserversto wonder what, exactly, the justice department has been doing with the documents, if not redacting such sensitive content.That the documents’ release was announced by Blanche, and not by his boss, attorney general Pam Bondi, reflects growing tensions within the administration as criticism continues to mount over the bungled response to the Epstein controversy and questions about the nature of Donald Trump’s apparently longstanding and intimate friendship with Epstein persist.In making his announcement, Blanche, who previously worked as Trump’s personal criminal defense attorney,insistedthat the justice department “did not protect Trump” in its decisions about what to redact and release. The White House, he said, “had no oversight” and “did not tell this department how to do our review, and what to look for, and what to redact or not redact”.However, he also claimed that Trump did in fact express preferences regarding the review, claiming that the president has pushed for “maximum transparency”. The US president had opposed the release of the files until it became clear that a congressional vote would override him late last year.The documents themselves contain 2,000 videos and 180,000 images related to Epstein, though according to Blanche, many of these were not taken by Epstein himself, but were gathered as part of the dead man’s estate – including a large cache of commercial pornography, in addition to the homemade abuse material depicting Epstein’s underage victims.The cache also appears to contain a large number ofuncorroboratedtips to authorities from members of the public about Epstein’s conduct, several of which come from people who claimed in their messages to have been abused by Donald Trump.Journalists at the Guardian and elsewhere continue to comb through the material – which is uploaded tens of thousands of files at a time to the Department of Justice’s website, with no index and no explanation of how or when particular documents were obtained. The full picture of what is revealed by the newly unsealed documents will not emerge for some time.But it is unlikely that the new material will quell the public’s interest in the case, or mitigate their sense that Epstein and his impunity represent a paradigmatic example of the ruling elite’s personal corruption, their imperviousness to law or consequence, and their back-scratching, malignant coziness with one another.Already, the newly released documents further underscore the extent to which Epstein was integrated into the social life of some of the worlds’ most powerful people, even after he was initially convicted of charges relating to child sexual abuse in 2008. Among other things, the emails show that in 2012, the businesspersonHoward Lutnik– now Trump’s commerce secretary – appears to have visited Epstein’s private Island with his wife and children. Lutnik hadpreviously claimedthat he had cut off contact with Epstein around 2005, before the financier’s initial conviction.How many big names have paid the price for being linked to Jeffrey Epstein? Fewer than you might think | Emma BrockesRead moreIn a 2013 emailexchangebetween Epstein and the billionaire Richard Branson, Branson writes to Epstein: “Anytime you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a large-scale financial backer of Donald Trump and other Republican candidates, had previously posted on X that Epstein “tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED”. But the emailsshow a warmer relationshipbetween Musk and Epstein, and in 2012 Musk wrote to Epstein with enthusiasm about the prospect of visiting the pedophile financier’s Caribbean island. “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk asked. Both men have denied wrongdoing and attempted to downplay the extent of their connections to Epstein.TheTrump administrationworked hard throughout 2025 to avoid the release of the Epstein files; once the groundswell of public pressure to publish them became too great for congress to resist, they have worked to minimize the public’s sense that the documents reveal anything particularly damning, at least for the president and his allies.But the administration cannot contain the Epstein story because by its nature, the scandal reveals the untrustworthiness and mendacity of the very elites that Trump and his movement now represent. Todd Blanche had an unenviable task on Friday, standing up before the nation to claim that the administration had nothing to hide, that the people in power are acting in good faith and telling the public the whole story. After what the world has learned about those people in power from the Epstein story itself, will anyone believe him?Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

As the US grows increasingly violent, increasingly cruel, every day brings a legion of new horrors. So I’m very sorry to say that I’m here to ruin your weekend by giving you yet another thing to worry about. That thing is called theSave Actand, if the Trump administration gets its way, it could have an oversized impact on the November midterms, particularly when it comes to minorities and married women being able to vote.A good rule of thumb when looking at a Republican-drafted bill or campaign is that its name is directly the opposite of whatever it is meant to achieve. If there is something about ‘protecting women’ in thetitle, for example, then it’s probably actually about controlling women or bullying transgender people. The same is true of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which would change the way US citizensregister to vote. The purpose of the bill doesn’t seem to be to safeguard democracy but to help destroy it through stealth disenfranchisement.If it became law, the Save Act would require Americans to provide a birth certificate, passport, or other citizenship document to register or re-register to vote. Per one Brennan Center Study, more that21 millionAmerican citizens, many of whom are engaged voters, do not have easy access to these documents. While just over 8% of self-identified white American citizens don’t have these documents readily available, the Brennan Center found the number is nearly 11% among Americans of color.Women who changed their name when they got married may also face a logistical nightmare:reports showthat as many as 69 million women who have taken their spouse’s name don’t have a birth certificate that matches their legal name. “The legislation does not mention the potential option for these Americans to present change-of-name documentation or a marriage certificate in combination with a birth certificate to prove their citizenship,” the liberal thinktank the Center for American Progressnoted.To make things even more complicated for everyone, the Save Act would alsodisrupt online voter registration. Americans would have to appear in person, with their original documents, simply to update their voter registration information.A proof-of-citizenship law similar to the Save Act has been tried before, by the way, including between 2013 and 2017in Kansas. And guess what? It was an expensive disaster that prevented more than 30,000 Kansans from voting. It’s well-established that these sorts of laws disproportionately harm low-income, disabled, married women, and marginalized voters. Why are the Republicans so keen on making it harder for these groups to vote? I’m sure I don’t need to spell it out for you.Of course the Save Act isn’t being presented as a way for Republicans to sneakily sway the midterms in their favour asconfidence in Trump dips. Rather, it’s being presented as a way to stop fraudulent voting. “[W]e all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,” house speaker Mike Johnson said during a press conference about the act when it was first introducedin May 2024. “But it’s not been something that is easily provable.” I think we all know, intuitively, that it’s not easily provable because that claim is nonsense. And, in fact, we don’t need to rely on intuition, we have data! OneBrennan Center for Justice studythat looked at the 2016 election found just 0.0001% of votes (30 incidents) across 42 jurisdictions, with a total of 23.5m votes, were suspected to include non-citizens voting. Non-citizens voting is already illegal and not a problem that needs to be solved with new legislation.So just how likely is it that the Save Act, or some version of it, will get passed before the midterms? Unclear, but looking increasingly likely by the day, unfortunately. The Save Actpassedin the House in 2025 but then stalled in the Senate. Now, however, there’s a lot of new momentum to try and get it over the line. In a speech to House Republicans at the beginningof the year, Trump urged lawmakers to pass a national voter ID law ahead of the 2026 midterm election and his cronies have ramped up their efforts to draft what House majority leader Steve Scalise recently called an “even stronger” version of the Save Act.And, of course, if it’s not the Save Act it’ll be something else. The Trump administration has beenbusy chipping awayat the mechanisms that keep election systems free and fair. They can’t (yet) get away with cancelling the November midterms but they can destroy faith in the system throughbaseless claimsof voter fraud. They canredrawcongressional maps and try to impose onerous voting requirements.This, of course, is how democracy dies. Not in darkness, but in daily headlines. Not with a bang, but with a relentless barrage of paperwork. Not with one power-hungry man breaking the law, but with his legion of acolytes weaponizing it.Man accused of attacking Ilhan Omar charged with assaultAnthony Kazmierczak faces federalchargesafterinterruptingthe Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar at a town hall and spraying her with what is now determined to have been apple cider vinegar. After she was relentlessly criticized by the president, some sort of attack on Omar felt inevitable and it’s lucky this one wasn’t worse. “[E]very time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said onWednesday.Older women ‘disappear’ from BBC presenting rolesAnindependent review ofthe British broadcaster found nearly four times as many male presenters over 60 as female in the BBC’s content division and nearly twice as many older men than women in BBC News. This seems to be caused by perceptions that men gain “gravitas and wisdom” as they age. Surely a gander at the president of the US, who gets more manic by the minute, should quickly dispel this idea.The traumatizing impact of the Taliban’s informal birth control banWhile there isn’t an official ban on contraceptives, Afghanistan’s reproductive health system has been decimated over the pastfew years. “After the Taliban came, the contraceptives started reducing,” one doctortold the Guardian. “Within months, they were gone.” The result is more lethal pregnancies and miscarriages that can’t be treated.Shirley Raines, Beauty 2 the Streetz founder, dies at 58The Los Angeles-based activist, known as “Ms Shirley” to her more than 5 million TikTok followers, brought beauty treatments and other servicesto vulnerable people on Skid Row.The war on journalists in Gaza continuesDespite a supposed ‘ceasefire’, international journalistsare still notfreely allowed in Gaza and Palestinian journalists continue tobe killedby Israel. Western journalists should be in uproar about this assault on press freedom. Instead the likes of CBS are simply parrotingIsrael’s talking points.“From the heart, brains, and boobs of Sydney Sweeney”…… comes a new lingerie label called Syrn. And, as you can tell from the marketing copy, it isnot subtle at all. The promo for Sweeney’s latest venture is also in-your-face: the actor, sometimes known as “Maga Barbie”, decorated theHollywood signwith bras. Whether she got permission to do this is unclear and there’s some chatter that she could get in trouble for trespassing. Only kidding! As the Trump administration keeps demonstrating, it’s OK for certain people (particularly those with the right “jeans”) to break the rules.

I am here to see Amazon’s $75m “documentary” onMelania Trump, which has already beencondemned as a flopahead of its release.When I arrive, I panic for a second that I have the time wrong. There are noMelaniaposters anywhere and the screening is tucked into the back bottom corner of the large movie theatre, like the weird leftover table at a wedding.Eventually, just eight people arrive. The cinema has a capacity of about 150 people. There’s a couple, an elderly lady, a few middle-aged men and me. We all sit in the back for some reason.Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreI wonder if the terrible showing is because it’s a weird time of day to watch a movie. But of the five evening screenings of Melania taking place on its opening day at cinemas across Sydney, none have sold more than 16 tickets. One has sold just six.Earlier viewings that were slated for 11am in Australia were pulled at the last minute due to a miscommunication over Amazon MGM Studios’ worldwide embargo, preventing any screenings from going ahead before 4pm AEST.This means I am one of less than 100 people in the city of Sydney, population 5.5 million people, to see Melania’s debut. Who are my peers? Maga fans willing to pay $26.75, or just journalists forced to endure the 1-hour-and-48-minute running time so the general public doesn’t have to?The film, which documents the 20 days preceding Donald Trump’s return to power in January 2025, was screened at the White House on Saturday and had its official premiere at Washington’s Kennedy Center – which the president has renamed the Trump-Kennedy Centerin a legally disputed move– on Thursday, before its release in 27 countries.The timing for its releasecould’ve been better, coming off the back of the second killing of a civilian by ICE in less than a month, but is there ever good timing with the Trump administration?A spoiler of sorts: I am not a big fan of Melania Trump. I have laughed about herweird, oversized hatsand periodically indulged in conspiracy theories that she hasbeen replaced by a lookalike.As celebrities go, she is extremely far down my list of People I Would Like to See a Documentary About.Of course, liking a famous person isn’t a prerequisite for watching a documentary about them. I enjoyed Tiger King despite not enjoying the man commonly known as Tiger King.Yet Melania has been directed by the disgraced film-maker Brett Ratner, marking his first feature in 12 years after being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women in 2017 (which he has denied).It would be hard to view this as anything other than a propaganda exercise: the president’s Battleship Potemkin.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from Amazon’s $75m documentary Melania.Photograph: AmazonWhen the film begins, I immediately regret not buying popcorn so at least one of my senses would be entertained. In what feels excruciatingly slow, the first 10 minutes are just her using various modes of transport. Getting ushered into a black car. Boarding a plane. Wishing staff “Happy New Year” in monotone.Then there is her first voiceover.“Everyone wants to know, so here it is, 20 days in my life, family, business, philanthropy and becoming first lady of the United States again.”The next segment of the film is Melania trying on outfits. Then she is looking at the menu for the inauguration dinner. Then she is with an interior designer, discussing nightstands and cabinets for the White House.Eggs, hats and unfettered ambition: what we learned about Melania Trump from her documentaryRead moreThis could be the ultimate trad wife film, I ponder, except that Melania doesn’t actually do anything domestic – other people do it for her while she instructs them.Some of the weirdest moments are her interactions with the president. In one scene, she is on the phone to Trump as he excitedly discusses how many electoral college votes he won. “That’s a good one,” she says robotically, then “bye, congrats”.In another scene, they briefly discuss their son, Baron. “I love him, he has an incredible mind,” she says poetically.At this point, I have been to the toilet twice, clutched my face and whispered “oh my God” when I’ve checked the time and it has barely passed.The final half is of the inauguration itself. “That’s the hat,” someone in the cinema remarks when her bizarre outfit is revealed.The most animated she gets is when YMCA comes on at their final ball. There is a look of pure delight on her face. Otherwise she looks either robotic or furious.As I emerge from the cinema, I have the strange feeling that I have not only learned nothing but lost brain cells.“What did you think?” I ask the elderly lady. “I loved it, wow!” she cries.I pin down the only two people who didn’t see the movie alone. The couple tell me they’re a fan of Trump, and of Melania, but they found the experience too much like a “PR vehicle”.“It’s not as insightful as I thought it would be,” one says.“I’ve loved Melania for 15 years … and I feel like it was made to make Trump look better,” the other says.“As much as it was for her, it was for him.”Isn’t everything?Explore more on these topicsMelaniaOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps stars like Harry Styles taking a standSimon PriceThe knock-on effect on the rest of the industry is immense. There are many factors at play, but the ones with the power here are the big artistsSat 31 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 16.30 ESTShareIn October 2024, Heat magazine’s list of theUK’s 30 richest celebrities under 30ranked Harry Styles at the very top, with an estimated wealth of £200m. (He’d doubtless have fared well in last year’s survey, too, but he’s 31 now.)Whatever your views on the fabulous wealth accrued by a small elite of megastars, and regardless of your opinion of Styles’ musical merits, that figure doesn’t sit well next to the headlines he is now making.Styles announceda record-breaking 12-date residency at Wembley stadium this week, withticket prices for seats rangingfrom £44.10 in the faraway stands right up to £466.24, while bog standard general standing tickets will set you back £144.65 – and a berth in the fancy Circle, Disco, Square and Kiss standing enclosures up to £279.45. Furthermore, access to the presale wasrestricted to American Express cardholdersand anyone who pre-ordered Styles’ new album,Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, which will be released on 6 March. The pricing has sparked an enormous backlash among Styles’ fans for making the shows inaccessible to vast swathes of his audience, a significant proportion of whom are very young.But Styles is no outlier. The attitude towards ticket pricing in the entertainment industry seems to be, overwhelmingly, simply to charge as much as you can get away with charging. In recent years,Adele,Taylor SwiftandOasishave, like Styles, received intense criticism for their steep ticket prices. The last of those three came under particular scrutiny when it became apparent that dynamic pricing was at play, meaning that the original stated face value of tickets for Oasis gigs was essentially meaningless.In November 2025, the government made it illegal to resell tickets for above face value, preventing ripoffs by ticket touts, while the Competition and Markets Authority is making sellers likeTicketmasterbe more clear about pricing – all heartening measures. But there is a broader problem, one the government will find it much harder to intervene in: the rising cost of those face-value tickets in the first place.The best gig I ever saw cost £4. Spiralling concert prices are a cultural disaster | John HarrisRead moreThe age of streaming has had an extraordinary impact on how money is made in the music industry. Everyone understands this, and nobody begrudges musicians jacking up their prices by a modest amount. Rising prices since the pandemic have also made it significantly more expensive to go on tour, due to huge rises in costs for fuel, visas, transportation, labour and more. However, a small elite of megastars have gone cash-crazy on their concert tours.The knock-on effect on the rest of the industry is immense. In these cash-strapped times, people’s pockets aren’t bottomless when it comes to leisure activities such as gigs. VIP types may be able to spend, spend, spend – but many other people make choices. If they pay for one very expensive ticket, will they be less likely to buy others?The average touring band is struggling. At a recent gig, Shirley Manson of Garbageput it well: “You see all these big pop stars, and they’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars and they’re rich and they’re glamorous and they’re amazing. But the problem is that most of the music industry is not made of these big pop stars. They’re made of working musicians.”As well as musicians, smaller venues are also having a torrid time due, at least in part, to the trickle-up economics of the megaconcert industry. During 2023, one in six small venues closed according to theMusic Venue Trust (MVT), and its 2025 report found that more than half of the surviving venues failed to make a profit. And it’s also due in part to the era of the supertour. “If you’re paying £150 or £200 for a stadium ticket,” MVT chief executive Mark Davydhas said, “that inevitably eats into the budget you have to see new or emerging artists.” The end result is that up-and-coming artists have fewer and fewer places to hone their craft on the way to becoming the next Wembley headliner.Even if they do make it through, will the next generation of fans be waiting? What the practice of gouging gig prices fails to take into account is the emotional effect it has on the purchaser. Yes, they’ll pay, but reluctantly and begrudgingly. It leaves a sour taste and can put people off going to gigs entirely, of whatever size. “OK, this is good … but is it £200 good?”Because it’s not even as if the premium-priced experience feels especially luxurious. In my years as rock and pop critic for the Independent on Sunday, my job involved countless trips to the O2, that soulless enormodome where you’re charged captive-audience prices for your drinks and chain-franchise snacks on top of the extortionate ticket, all for the privilege of watching a band so far away that they might as well be on TV. It has all the charm of a night out in terminal five.I’m done with those shows now. I honestly don’t think there’s an artist alive who could drag me to a megaconcert. The most I’ve personally paid for a ticket was £75, forStevie Nicks in Hyde Parkin 2024 – and though she was great, I’m not even sure I was in the same postcode. And while the shows I sawPrince play at the O2 in 2007were among the best I’ve seen, it was despite, not because of, the surroundings.In fairness to Styles, he’sdonating £1 for every ticket he sellsat his own UK megaconcerts to theLive Trust, which works to protect small venues. This shows that deep down heknowssomething’s wrong. It could be, as some have claimed, that his fanbase is non transferable to other kinds of music and other kinds of venue. But still, I think the greatest gift he could give would be to slash his prices, and leave enough money in the pockets of those of his fans who might actually visit one of those threatened venues.It can be done. And it’s often the older generation that leads the way. The 21 shows Prince did at the O2 werepriced at £31.21. More recently,Paul Heaton capped his arena tour tickets at £35. And in 2023, Robert Smithwent to battle with Ticketmasterover excessive booking fees on the Cure’s US tour, insisting that tickets should cost no more than $35, arguing: “You don’t want to charge as much as the market will bear, and squeeze everyone. It doesn’t sit well with me at all.”Of course different shows cost different amounts to stage, but still the point remains. The likes of Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue and Justin Timberlake have at various points staged hi-tech extravaganzas without charging fans the earth. Artists have a duty of care to fans.So, Harry, don’t go poor: but be more Robert Smith, be more Paul Heaton. Leave the money for someone else who needs it more.Simon Price is a music journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsTicket pricesOpinionPop and rockHarry StylesTicketmasterOasisAdeleConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t mean they are shifting to the rightKarin KanekoSanae Takaichi may seemingly have old-fashioned values, but it’s her economic offering that has captured young people’s imaginationsSat 31 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 05.08 ESTShareJapan has rarely seen a prime minister as bold or as social media-savvy asSanae Takaichi, the country’s first female leader.Where previous prime ministers have gone viral for unflattering moments, such as the spectacle of one scoffing an onigiri in one messy gulp or another caughtdozing off in the parliamentduring a key vote, Takaichi is being read by supporters as a symbol of a different era of leadership – one they feel Japan has lacked in recent years.In January alone, Takaichi’s early diplomatic outings have produced the kind of viral imagery Japanese politics rarely generates.A clip of her drummingwith South Korean president Lee Jae Myung to global sensation BTS’s Dynamite and Golden from Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters spread rapidly online, with some viewers even assuming it was AI-generated. Many expected her to clash with Lee, so the clip helped boost her image as a dependable leader who can navigate through geopolitical challenges.Her appeal isn’t confined to diplomacy. She is so popular that she even has her own fandom, “Sana-katsu” – something more commonly seen with idols rather than prime ministers – complete with adoring supporters circulating clips and copying her look, even down to using the same pen.But there is a unique paradox at the heart of her appeal, especially among young supporters. Outside Japan, Takaichi is oftenframed as not particularly feministwith her socially conservative stance – including her opposition to legal reforms that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames, and same-sex marriage. Traditionally, these are issues that would be important to a progressive, young population.So what explains her unusually high approval among such age groups? In a Sankei Shimbun/FNN poll conducted in mid-December, approval for her cabinet was 92% among those aged between 18 and 29 – a rarity when most young voters are often disengaged from politics.At a glance, it might appear thatJapanis shifting to the right – a trend seen across the world – especially as anxiety about immigration and foreign residents becomes a more visible political theme. In Japan, it is more amplified as Japanese citizens grapple with their identity as a homogeneous society and the reality that their population is declining.But a deeper look may reveal that the answer is more likely to be economic rather than ideological. For young voters, life is becoming unaffordable as wages cannot keep up with the rising living prices along with a weakening yen, which lowers purchasing power. At the same time, the social contract looks increasingly lopsided. Young people pay ever-higher taxes and social insurance, while doubting that the same level of security will be there for them in the future, especially pensions, in a rapidly ageing society. To illustrate, official projections by the government show Japan having moved from 7.7 workers supporting one elderly person in 1975 to around1.9 supporting one by 2025.View image in fullscreenSouth Korean president Lee Jae Myung and Sanae Takaichi bond over a shared drum session, 13 January.Photograph: Japan’S Cabinet Public Relations Office Handout/EPAAs a woman in my mid-20s, I feel the weight my generation carries – the sense that the milestones our parents reached at this age are now harder to achieve. My peers often complain about everyday prices rising (staples such as rice have doubled in price in one year) and the growing difficulty of starting a family when one income rarely feels sufficient and pregnancy or childcare can still derail a career.This is the context in which Takaichi’s economic messaging lands. She has championed tax relief, including raising the income-tax threshold and expanding deductions aimed at boosting take-home pay. To a younger worker watching monthly deductions rise while real purchasing power falls, the promise of more money is hard to ignore.As Takaichi has called a snap election set to happen on 8 February, her promise hinges on whether she can win a majority. But she may have to tread carefully. Reutersreported that Takaichi’sapproval has slipped as voters grow more sceptical about whether her stimulus package, launched late last year, will actually aid the average voter with rising costs. Concerns that Japan may also need to take on additional debt to fund the measures have not helped.But in the current economic situation, part of her undeniable appeal as leader is that she doesn’t come from a political dynasty. In a system full of men who seem to inherit Diet seats like family property, Takaichi stands out as someone who rose to the top in a political culture that has rarely made it easy for women to do so.Among my peers, her boldness is part of the draw. “Someone who can make things happen” is a sentiment I often hear. Even as a progressive-leaning voter, I cannot deny Takaichi’s charisma and the pull she possesses. There are many things to admire about her such as her confident diplomacy and her modern leadership style.But I’m not convinced she’s the answer. The snap election’s timing is hard to defend when it looks like a cynical attempt to cash in on a polling peak, rather than the best thing for the country. The funding and follow-through of her campaign promise – such as temporary tax breaks on essentials – remain unclear. And the optics are bad when her party willingly re-endorses figures previously linked to aslush-fund scandal, when in 2023 multiple members of the party Takaichi now leads were found to have received undeclared funds totalling almost 600 million yen.Having watched other countries fall for charismatic “outsider” narratives, I’m wary of confusing a compelling image with an ability to govern, especially when the country has so many real problems to solve.Karin Kaneko is a freelance journalist and a former reporter for the Japan TimesExplore more on these topicsJapanOpinionSanae TakaichiAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

The shootings have provoked a furious wave of condemnation inMinneapolisand beyond.However, on Saturday, federal judge Kate Menendez denied a request by the state and cities to end the operation and send the 3,000 ICE agents home.The plaintiffs had argued that theTrump administrationviolated the 10th amendment of the constitution, which enshrines states’ autonomy from federal intervention beyond powers outlined in the constitution, through the ICE operation.But these claims “provided no metric by which to determine when lawful law enforcement becomes unlawful commandeering, simply arguing that the excesses of Operation Metro Surge are so extreme that the surge exceeds whatever line must exist”,wrote Menendez, who was nominated to the bench during Joe Biden’s presidency in 2021.“A proclamation that Operation Metro Surge has simply gone ‘so far on the other side of the line’ is a thin reed on which to base a preliminary injunction.”Menendez acknowledged that the operation has had a “profound and even heartbreaking” impact upon Minneapolis and that along with the shootings there was “evidence that ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) agents have engaged in racial profiling, excessive use of force, and other harmful actions”.But the judge said that she was not ruling on the tactics of the operation itself, only that the state and cities had failed to show that the administration had violated the 10th amendment.Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement that he was disappointed by the ruling.“This decision doesn’t change what people here have lived through – fear, disruption, and harm caused by a federal operation that never belonged in Minneapolis in the first place,” Frey said. “This operation has not brought public safety. It’s brought the opposite and has detracted from the order we need for a working city. It’s an invasion, and it needs to stop.”Pam Bondi, the US attorney general,postedon X that the ruling was a “HUGE” win for the administration.“Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law inMinnesota,” Bondi wrote.Eight people have died in dealings with ICE so far in 2026. These are their storiesRead moreBrian Carter, a lawyer for Minnesota, had said that “this situation is unprecedented in the 250-year history of our country” and that the agents were “essentially an army” sent to Minneapolis to undertake “widespread illegal violent conduct”.Trump himself has said that Ice is “going to de-escalate a little bit” in the wake of the shootings, with the president sending border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis to oversee the operation. But the administration has insisted the ICE agents are acting legally to uphold federal immigration laws.The ruling comes asmore than 300 demonstrationsare expected to take place across all 50 states and Washington DC on Saturday in what organizers are calling “ICE Out of Everywhere”.Organizers, led by the national grassroots organization 50501, say today’s protests are a response to a series of recent deaths involving federal immigration agents, including the fatal shootings ofPrettiandGoodin Minneapolis earlier this month, the homicide ofGeraldo Camposin an immigration detention facility in Texas and the shooting ofKeith Porter Jrby an off-duty ICE officer in Los Angeles.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisUS justice systemUS immigrationMinnesota ICE shootingsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotaUS domestic policynewsShareReuse this content"

It indicated the death toll could rise as emergency responders searched for bodies.Another strike hit an apartment in Gaza City, killing three children and two women, while seven more people were killed when Israel bombed tents in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect damage to a tent hit by an Israeli strike in Khan Younis.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP“We found my three little nieces in the street. They say ‘ceasefire’ and all. What did those children do? What did we do?” Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three children killed in Gaza City, told Reuters.The Israeli military said the attacks were carried out in response to an incident on Friday when eight armed men came out of a tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza. The area is still under Israeli military control under the terms of the October ceasefire.Israel accepts health authorities’ Gaza death toll is broadly accurate, saying 70,000 have diedRead moreThe strikes occurred the day before aborder crossing is expected to openin Gaza’s southernmost city, a reminder that the death toll is still rising even as the ceasefire agreement inches forward.All of the territory’s border crossings have been closed since the start of the war, and Palestinians see the Rafah crossing with Egypt as a lifeline for the tens of thousands in need of treatment outside the territory because most of its medical infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli bombardment.Israel wants to ensure that more Palestinians leave Gaza than enter it, according to Reuters, which said Israel was aiming to allow only 150 Palestinians into Gaza through Rafah each day.Shifa hospital said the strike on Gaza City killed a mother, three children and one of their relatives on Saturday morning, while Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said a strike on a tent camp caused a fire, killing a father, his three children and three grandchildren.Gaza deaths graphicGaza’s health ministry has recorded more than 500 Palestinians deaths by Israeli fire since the start of the ceasefire on 10 October.Despite Israel’s frequent killing of Palestinians in violation of the ceasefire, the deal has moved to a crucial second phase. Some of the thorniest issues are contained in this phase, which requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Board of Peace organisation staffed by appointees of the US president, Donald Trump.A recent presentation in Davos by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is also involved in Trump’s Gaza project, showed the Trump administration’s plan for “developing Gaza”, complete with futuristic skyscrapers overlooking the Mediterranean.Most of Gaza has been levelled and basic infrastructure remains inoperable as a result of Israeli bombing over the past two years, which haskilled more than 70,000 Palestinians. Last year, aUN commission of inquiry found that Israel had committed a genocide in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

It would also be significantly taller than Paris’s 164ft-tall Arc de Triomphe – but less than half the height than the Gateway Arch in St Louis, Missouri, the world’s tallest arch.The Post reported that Trump has his eye on a plot of land near Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River, citing two people who are familiar with the plans and spoke to the outlet on the condition of anonymity.The latest proposed addition to the Washington skyline comes as Trump is already constructing a new East Wing to the White House containing a ballroom. At 89,000 sq ft, the new ballroom is supposed to be larger than the White House’s 55,000-sq-ft footprint, at the same 70ft height.Trump sued by preservation group over $300m White House ballroom projectRead moreThe scale of Trump’s envisioned arch, named the Independence Arch, has already alarmed some architectural experts, including one who initially supported a smaller arch.“I don’t think an arch that large belongs there,” Catesby Leigh, an art critic who conceived of a more modest arch in a2024 essay, told the Post. Leigh’s idea was reportedly brought to Trump by allies of the president’s administration.Leigh had initially proposed a temporary, 60ft arch to mark the 250th of the US’s declaration of independence. But Trump went for a permanent design four times larger and funded with leftover donations to the $400m White House ballroom project.“If you’re going to build an arch that big, you should build it in another part of town – and one possible site that comes to mind is Barney Circle,” Leigh was quoted by the outlet as saying. Barney Circle in south-eastWashington DCoverlooks the Anacostia River.“There’s nothing around it competing with it,” Leigh added.But Leigh also recommended an architect, Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, who in Septemberposted enthusiastically on Twitter/X: “America needs a triumphal arch!” together with a rendering. Charbonneau reportedly has since been retained by the White House to work on the project.But the site of the proposed arch on a small plot of land that is under the jurisdiction of the US national park service. It lies between the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery and could reshape the existing relationship between the two memorials as well as obstruct pedestrians’ views.It could also be thematically jarring to plant a celebratory arch on Memorial Circle – amid the sightline of Arlington national cemetery, the Memorial Bridge (envisioned as symbolic representation of peace between the Union and Confederacy after the Civil War) and the Lincoln Memorial.The chairperson of Benedictine College’s architecture program, John Haigh, told the Post: “It’s a very somber corridor”.Trump has reportedly considered more modest arch designs, including 165-ft-high and 123-ft-high versions, that he shared at a dinner in 2025. But the president has decided to go big in part because 250ft mirrors the 250th anniversary of the US’s declaration of independence in July.People at the dinner quoted Trump as saying: “250 for 250 makes the most sense.”Trump is said to have told guests at a White House Christmas reception, “The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And we’re gonna top it by, I think, a lot.”The idea for an enormous arch in Washington DC is not entirely new. Trumptold Politicoin December that he hoped to begin construction of the arch within two months. Earlier in January, heposted imagesto his Truth Social platform of three potential designs, including one with gold gilding.The Post noted that Washington is unusual among major cities for lacking a triumphal arch to commemorate national achievements.Atlanta philanthropist and developer Rodney Mims Cook Jr, president of the National Monuments Foundation, has been appointed by Trump to the Commission of Fine Arts that would in theory oversee the arch.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

It suggested the claim was atacticto support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.The firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation tounnamed“courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.Quinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against ajudgmentfrom a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in itsdeploymentof Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”Adam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”Steven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”If WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”The Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.WhatsAppbills itselfas an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.This contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.A senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.However, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.Woog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppMetaPrivacynewsShareReuse this content"

The sites can help companies lower their operating costs.Photograph: Anna Watson/AlamyThe study, which was commissioned by the National Institute forHealthand Care Research, brought together multiple university teams to establish the first industry-wide framework for defining and identifying dark kitchens.Researchers worked with academics, public health professionals, local authorities, national governing bodies, industry workers and consumers to ensure the definition reflected how the businesses operated.The final wording was: “Technology-enabled commercial kitchen(s) operating primarily for delivery, to fulfil remote, on-demand, consumer online orders of food for immediate consumption.”The academics also examined the scale of dark kitchens on major delivery apps.Using data-scraping methods across platforms such asUberEats and Deliveroo, they identified clusters of food brands operating from the same postcode, a key indicator of delivery-only hubs.The study also cross-referenced locations using tools such as Google Maps, highlighting how difficult these businesses can be for consumers and regulators to spot.Although dark kitchen models offer commercial advantages, including lower operating costs and flexible locations, the research highlighted potential implications for public health.Unlike traditional takeaways, which can be regulated by local authorities using spatial planning policy, dark kitchens are far less visible.Management zones around schools, which are designed to limit the density of takeaways and support healthier food environments, do not apply to dark kitchens and may be undermined by their activities.Researchers also raised concerns around food safety and transparency, particularly for customers with allergies or dietary sensitivities. Because multiple businesses can operate from the same kitchen space, consumers may not always be aware of shared preparation environments or potential allergen cross-contamination.A survey in 2023 found that 40% of participants bought a takeaway at least weekly, commonly via delivery apps and mainly as a treat or for convenience.Awareness of dark kitchens was low, with only a quarter having heard of them and just 9% knowingly using one. However, after reading a working definition, more than half said they would consider buying from a dark kitchen, though most wanted this to be made explicit.The new industry-wide definition is aimed at bringing delivery-only hubs under stricter planning and public health oversight with clearer regulation, inspection processes and consumer understanding.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryDeliverooUberCouriers/delivery industryHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Rising global temperatures may, counterintuitively, be weakening the polar vortex winds that hold such cold air over the Arctic,causing it to spill out further south.In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina – whose official seal is the sun, palm trees and a seagull – 6in (15cm) of snow was expected. The city has no snow-removal equipment, and authorities planned to “use what we can find”, the mayor, Mark Kruea, said.The extreme weather has even forced thecancellationof Saturday’s Myrtle Beach Polar Plunge, an event in which participants swim in the chilly Atlantic to raise money for charity. “We strongly encourage everyone to stay home, stay warm, and stay safe while this storm moves through our area,” the event’s Facebook page advises.Subfreezing weather was forecast into February, with heavy snow in the Carolinas, Virginia and north-east Georgia over the weekend including up to a foot (30cm) in parts of North Carolina. Snow was also said to be possible fromMarylandto Maine.On Saturday night and early Sunday, forecasters said, wind and snow could lead to blizzard conditions before the storm moves out to sea. The frigid cold was expected to plunge as far south as Florida.Temperatures neared the teens (-10C) in Nashville,Tennessee, and frustrations bubbled up for those who spent a week without power.Terry Miles, a 59-year-old construction worker whose home has had no electricity since a previous storm struck on Sunday, resorted to using a fish fryer for heat and worried about the danger of carbon monoxide.“I’m taking a chance of killing myself and killing my wife, because – why?” Miles said after attending a Nashville Electric Service (NES) news conference intended to showcase the utility’s repairs on poles and lines. He then pointed to officials.More than 190,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, mostly in Mississippi and Tennessee, as of Saturday morning, according to the outage-tracking websitepoweroutage.us. That included more than 54,000 in and around Nashville.Tennessee’s governor, Bill Lee, said he shared “strong concerns” with NES leadership, adding that residents “need a clear timeline for power restoration, transparency on the number of linemen deployed, and a better understanding of when work will be completed in their neighborhood”.The utility has defended its response, saying the storm that struck last weekend was unprecedented.Mississippi officials said the massive winter storm was its worst since 1994. About 80 warming centers were opened, and national guard troops delivered supplies by truck and helicopter.Experts warned of the growing risks of hypothermia. Frostbite was also a concern in the south, where some people may lack sufficiently warm clothing, said Dr David Nestler, an emergency medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.The reported deaths have occurred from Texas to New Jersey, roughly half of them in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. While some deaths have been attributed to hypothermia, others are suspected to be related to carbon monoxide exposure. Officials have not released specific details about some deaths.In North Carolina, hundreds of national guard soldiers readied to help and state workers worked to prepare roads.The city of Wake Forest saw a steady stream of people filling propane tanks on Friday at Holding Oil and Gas, including José Rosa, who arrived after striking out at three other places.“I’m here in this cold weather, and I don’t like it,” Rosa said as he held a 20lb (9kg) tank.In Dare county, home to much of North Carolina’s Outer Banks, residents worried that unoccupied houses in communities like Rodanthe and Buxton couldcollapseinto the Atlantic Ocean.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS weatherExtreme weatherNorth CarolinaSouth CarolinaNew YorkTennesseeLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

You won’t find vegetarian or vegan recipes in this book, and you won’t find a single sentence attempting to convince you to eat differently. This book isn’t about policing your plate.”There’s more. Friedrich, a vegan for almost four decades, says meat is “humanity’s favourite food”.“It appears to be biological,” he says. “Meat has dense calories, which come from a lot of fat, and it has an umami flavour that humans have evolved to crave. Plus, meat is deeply rooted in most cultures and is the centrepiece at many social gatherings.”The global damage wreaked by industrial livestock, from climate-heating methane burps to water pollution to the destruction of forests, iswell established. For at least 50 years, says Friedrich, environmentalists, health experts and animal advocates – including him – have been trying to convince people to eat less meat and some have done so.View image in fullscreenCows in a meadow in Wehrheim near Frankfurt, Germany. Cows require vast amounts of land to graze, which is a major driver of deforestation, and also emit methane, a potent planet-warming gas.Photograph: Michael Probst/APBut global meat consumption has risen every single year since good records began in 1961. Humans have eaten meat for about 2.6m years and farmed animals for about 12,000 years.“A decline has never happened in all of human history, so it seems very unlikely that it’s going to happen now,” Friedrich says. “Everywhere in the world where incomes rise, meat consumption rises.”View image in fullscreenBruce FriedrichPhotograph: suppliedHis fundamental argument is this: “If we’re going to address the world’s insatiable craving for animal meat, we’re going to have to replace like for like.” That means cultivating meat from cells in brewery-like factories or making taste-identical plant-based meats. In both cases, for people to buy them, the products must also cost the same or less than conventional meat.These alternative proteins are the electric vehicles (EVs) of food, Friedrich says; the same experience, but better: “Just like a car doesn’t now need a combustion engine, a phone doesn’t need a cord, and you can take pictures without film, you can make meat without the need for live animals.”Friedrich, head of the nonprofitGood Food Institute, which focuses on accelerating scientific research on these alternative proteins, is convinced conventional meat could be replaced: “If plant-based meat or cultivated meat doesn’t reach price and taste parity, it will be because of a lack of will, not because the science doesn’t work.”View image in fullscreenScientists producing cultivated, cell-based meat in a lab.Photograph: Wirestock, Inc./AlamyIt is possible that all industrial meat will be cultivated or plant-based by 2050, he says, with a niche market in regeneratively farmed conventional meat. Analysts at McKinsey, Barclays and Credit Suisse have estimated a 50% share by mid-century.But such progress will require governments to ramp up their support for the scientists overcoming the obstacles in this still-embryonic field. They have done it before for previous transformative technologies, from penicillin to the internet to renewable energy, Friedrich says.If China went all-in for example, he says, conventional meat could be all but history by mid-century: “They took EV sales [at home] from 1% to more than 50% in the 10 years to 2025, and that’s a tougher tech challenge and scaling challenge than alternative meats.” Alternatively, a tech company such as Google or Microsoft could go all-in and leverage AI to solve the key challenges, he says.Friedrich thinks the rapid acceleration in the rollout of alternative proteins – the steep part of theS-curvegrowth that EVs are now on – will happen when they get to price and taste parity, and that could be within a decade. Even if progress is slower, the prize is great, he says, as every 10% of conventional meat replaced by alternative proteins has about the same climate impact as replacing all the world’s fossil-fuelled vehicles with EVs.‘Shockingly inefficient’Friedrich is a compelling advocate for his goal of ending industrial agriculture, with answers for the many criticisms: “It’s just a shockingly inefficient way of producing food. It takes nine calories of crops to get one calorie of chicken, 10 or 11 calories of crops to get one calorie of pig meat or farmed fish and 40 to 100 calories of crops to get one calorie of beef.”But are people ready for such a seismic change? The list of advantages of alternative proteins is long and not just environmental. More efficient food production can feed more people, he says –673 million people went hungryin 2024. Livestock farming also drives up the risks of two of the world’s most concerning global health scourges: antibiotic resistance and pandemics.But these facts have failed to shift people’s diets. “If somebody doesn’t know about these benefits, it’s because they don’t want to know. Meat consumption just continues to go up,” he says.Frequently raised is the “yuck factor” of cultivated meat. This is overblown, Friedrich says.“People are not eating meat because of how it’s produced,” he says. “They’re eating meat because it’s delicious and affordable. All of the polling indicates significant enthusiasm for cultivated meat, especially among people who eat the most meat.”Even the worst polling on cultivated meat still finds 25-30% of people enthusiastic, he says, and that’s 25-30 times more than those who currently eat plant-based meat. Cultivated meat is also clean meat, he argues, compared with the bacteria-laden conventional variety. Ensuring conventional meat is safe requires “cooking the crap out of it – literally” and treating your kitchen “like a biohazard lab”, scrubbing your hands and surfaces and avoiding cross-contamination with other foods.For plant-based meats, a key criticism is that they are ultra-processed foods (UPFs). The idea of UPFs being harmful to health is usually a pretty good rule of thumb, Friedrich says.“But it’s very clear that the reason UPFs are bad for human health is that they tend to be very high in fat and sugar and very low in fibre,” he says. “The thing about plant-based meat is that, on the nutrients that matter, it is better than what it is replacing. All the plant-based meats that meat eaters like have less fat, less saturated fat, less calories, no cholesterol and more fibre.”Another negative narrative about alternative proteins is that they were a flash in the pan, with the hype now extinguished as companies went bust. Friedrich says that’s easy to explain: most of the products were just not good enough to win over meat eaters and all of them cost too much.But it also misunderstands how successful innovations conquer the world: slowly, then fast – the S-curve. “Until very recently, cellphones were big, bulky things that cost a fortune,” he says. The iPhone is still less than 20 years old, while the Impossible burger, seen by many as a rare example of a plant-based product that is near indistinguishable from conventional meat, is less than 10 years old.View image in fullscreenA sign advertising the soy-based Impossible Whopper outside a Burger King in New York.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersFriedrich says his favourite example is the rise of the motorcar. For 5,000 years, people rode horses, he says. In 1900, only 8,000 cars had been sold in the entire US. Just 13 years later, there were 1.2m cars on the streets of New York City alone and during that explosion, most car companies failed. The lesson, according to Friedrich, is that once the product is right, sales fly.Another possible roadblock for alternative meats could be opposition from powerful livestock lobby groups. Ranchers in the US are trying to ban cultivated meat and farming groups in Europe are trying to outlaw plant-based meats from using terms such as burger and sausage (but do not mention beef tomatoes).But it is a different story for the huge companies that actually sell the meat, according to Friedrich. “All of the major meat companies are enthusiastic about alternative proteins,” he says.The world’s three largest meat companies and two largest food companies are investing in plant-based and cultivated meat. For example, JBS has invested $100m in a cultivated meat division in Brazil, and bought the Vegetarian Butcher company in 2025.The motivation may well not be green – JBS has been frequentlycriticised over deforestation– and are more likely pure business. Alternative proteins are far more efficient and have far fewer risks in their supply chains, Friedrich says, whether that is animal disease epidemics or tougher environmental rules.“They want to deliver high quality protein to as many people as possible, as profitably as possible,” he says. “So they’re agnostic on the production process.” Unlike the fossil fuel companies who have successfully slowed climate action, meat companies do not have sunk costs in mines and wells to defend.National securityCultivated meat and plant-based meat can reach taste and price parity, but it is not a given, says Friedrich. Penicillin sat on Alexander Fleming’s shelf for 10 years until the US government was persuaded of its potential and put its might behind its scaleup.“It all happens a heck of a lot more quickly if governments are funding science and incentivising private sector innovation and scaleup,” he says. To those who see government support as a sign that a technology is flawed, Friedrich says look at history.“Literally every successful industry has government support,” he says. “The reason the US, Switzerland or the UK have robust biopharma industries is government support. The reason the big tech companies are in the US is because all of that formative research was funded by the US government. India produces 60% of global vaccines because India’s government incentivised those industries.”The economic opportunities of alternative proteins are one reason Friedrich thinks they can win. Most nations care about the environment, but all prioritise their economies. And there is another trump card alternative proteins can play, he argues: food security, which is also national security.The foreword to Friedrich’s book is written by Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and formerly at the US government’s national security council. “Produced at scale, plant-based proteins and cultivated meats would help mitigate the plethora of national security threats related to animal-protein production,” she writes. “No government wants to be importing significant amounts of their food.”It is telling that Israel and Singapore have pioneered cultivated meat production – both are small countries wanting to shake off their heavy reliance on food imports. China’s self-sufficiency in food plunged from 94% in 2000 to 66% in 2020, says Friedrich, and it is strongly pursuing alternative proteins.Eight of the 20 most active patent grantees for cultivated meat in the last six years are in China, compared with three in the US, three in Israel and three in South Korea. China’s meat system has also been repeatedly rocked by animal diseases. “But without live animals, animal diseases vanish,” says Friedrich.View image in fullscreenPlant-based meatballs produced by Chinese start-up Zhenmeat. Eight of the 20 most active patent grantees for cultivated meat in the last six years are in China.Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/ReutersChina has already eaten the US’s lunch on solar panels, batteries and wind turbines and a 2023 CSIS report, funded by the GoodFoodInstitute, warned of China being a strategic competitor on alternative proteins: “To cede American leadership is to forfeit the food security of the US and its allies.”While alternative proteins may have global consequences, people will experience them directly on their plates. Friedrich grew up a meat eater, his favourites at high school were McDonald’s Big Macs and KFC chicken. But he went vegan in 1987, after readingDiet for a Small Planetby Frances Moore Lappé.Decades later in 2016, when he tried cultivated chicken for the first time, he found he had not lost the taste for it. “I was surprised by the visceral, lighting-up reaction that I had,” he says. “When I smell meat, I think, like the vast majority of human beings, it causes an instinctual salivation.”Will humanity’s insatiable appetite for meat be met through technology or will it consume the planet? If Friedrich is right, that depends on the success or failure of alternative proteins.Meat: How the Next Agricultural Revolution Will Transform Humanity’s Favorite Food– and Our Futureispublished on 2 February.Explore more on these topicsMeat industryFoodFarmingClimate crisisPollutionVeganismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the 1970s the region leaned towards white, but by the 2000s was famed for powerful oak-aged reds.Now it’s turning to a much older form of red with a name familiar to anglophones: claret. With origins in the 12th century, when it was first shipped to Britain, claret was soon our favoured wine, an unofficial byword for bordeaux red, which in recent decades has become increasingly full-bodied.The Bordeaux protected designation of origin has now formally validated bordeaux claret, linking it to the existing Bordeaux appellation. Yet the bottles, available from the 2025 vintage, will differ from what many in Britain consider claret – lighter, less tannic and lower in alcohol.French winemakers ‘battle for survival’ as minister prepares for crisis talksRead moreBordeaux has been greatly affected by climate breakdown. Some impacts have been a “positive challenge”, said Stéphanie Sinoquet, the managing director of the Bordeaux growers’ association, with producers turning to untraditional, heat-resistant grape varieties. Warmer conditions were allowing grapes to reach a “better and more consistent ripeness”.Consequently, ever-rising alcohol levels were of concern – 15% is now common. For Jean-Raymond Clarenc, the director of the Bordeaux branch of the Grands Chais deFrance, the new classification is a “strategic response to these environmental shifts. By opting for shorter macerations and a profile that values freshness over power, we can produce balanced, elegant wines even in warmer vintages. It’s a way of turning a climatic challenge into an oenological opportunity.”Wine consumption habits are changing for several reasons. Warmer weather means drinkers are seeking lighter, fruitier bottles – in France as well as Britain, consumption of red wine is falling. Lighter, chillable reds have become de rigueur – bordeaux claret is designed to be consumed at 8-12C, experts told the Guardian. “Fresher and fruitier styles are perceived as more relaxed and inclusive,” said Sinoquet, adding they were more versatile and easier to drink outside meals.While lighter claret (and the even lighter clairet, a dark rosé) never fully disappeared, Bordeaux producers turned to powerful reds that earned international acclaim and appealed to wealthy collectors, and their prices soared. “Classic bordeaux reds will continue to offer the structured, age-worthy styles,” said Sinoquet.Many cited bordeaux’s spiralling prices as a reason for its struggles. “A 50-year boom is over, vineyards are being abandoned, we’ve even ripped out a few plots ourselves,” said Tony Laithwaite, the founder of the wine retailer Laithwaites. He cited collapsing demand in key markets including China, sales in France dropping and a swing towards white wine. “Bordeaux’s posh and pricey image just doesn’t fit any more, in these times of straitened circumstances for everyone.”For Jonathan Kleeman, a sommelier and wine consultant, millennials are less likely to collect expensive wines than previous generations, preferring wines that are ready to drink. “The new category is going to be interesting,” Kleeman said. “It actually harks back to the old days. Bordeaux didn’t used to be the big wines they are today. It’s actually bringing an old English term back.”Could it confuse drinkers? “Not really, these wines are aimed at younger generations who don’t really use the word ‘claret’,” he said. Kleeman cited other old wines now fashionable again, frompétillant naturelor “pet-nat”, a traditional form of sparkling wine, to the use of amphorae, ceramic storing vessels popular with natural wine producers. “It could be a very good move, and people ‘in the know’ might like the irony of calling it ‘claret’.”Today, Burgundy is widely considered the world’s most expensive wine region. Will claret be more in line with its pinot noir reds? “I don’t think so,” said sommelier Tom Claxton. “I think the similarities will be a lighter body, but I’d expect these to be more playful or ‘fun’ wines.”Explore more on these topicsWineFoodFranceEuropeFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But unlike most other self-proclaimed steak lovers, Vlad eats it only four times a year, on designated “beef days”.The “beef days” phenomenon has been popularised by the brothers John and Hank Green, known collectively asvlogbrothers on YouTube. John, 48, is better known for his YA fiction, including The Fault in Our Stars, while Hank, 45, is a self-described science communicator and entrepreneur.They have been making videos on their shared channel since 2007, and have more than 4 million subscribers. In June 2024, John posted a video announcing that “an idea inspired by early modern humans” – feast days – had pushed him to commit to eating less beef.John did not want to give up beef entirely, but he feared the impact of the beef industry on the Paris agreement’s limit of 1.5C of post-industrial global heating and the devastating effects of beef farming on deforestation.He compared the overconsumption of beef to the “coolness” of tobacco back in the day: “Norms feel permanent, but norms can change and when they do it can be powerful,” he said. He announced that his family would consume beef only on four “beef days” a year, mimicking feast days found across many cultures.View image in fullscreenHank (left) and John Green have popularised the ‘beef days’ idea via their YouTube channel.Photograph: Monica Schipper/Getty ImagesWhen Luca found that video, the idea of “beef days” resonated with him – he loved beef, but not the industry’s impact on the planet. He also found the concept of going entirely vegetarian intimidating.“It’s little changes that could make a difference,” he said. “I’m not preachy about it. I hate blaming consumers for what the industry does.”More than a year on, Vlad continues to observe “beef days”. He cares about climate breakdown, and says a lot of young people do, but he feels that an all-or-nothing approach to social norms – such as completely overhauling how often you drive or eat meat – is unhelpful, and in some cases unrealistic.“Sometimes I look at a burger and salivate over it, but that makes the times that I do eat it more special,” he said.Luca, who is from Romania, often times his “beef days” to coincide with visits to his home country, where his family loves to cook meat. He sees these occasions as celebrations rather than relapses.View image in fullscreenBeef has a large carbon footprint compared with other meats.Photograph: Matt Crossick/Empics EntertainmentBeef is the second-biggest contributor to the UK’s agricultural output, valued at £4.1bn in 2024. However, households waste about 250,000 tonnes of beef, pork and poultry products (not including bones and fat) annually.Compared with other meats, beef hasa much larger environmental footprint. Scientists say that shifting even part of our diets towards lower-impact meats or plant-based proteins can free up land and significantly cut planet-heating pollution.Explore more on these topicsBeefClimate crisisMeat industryCattleFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This allowed it to carry heavier freight and the Evans family was able to order bottled gas from the newly established Calor Gas company, bringing widespread energy access to rural Anglesey (Ynys Môn).“My grandfather and his brother went to pick it up from Bangor or Treborth station, I think, the first ever delivery. We still sell it today,” said Evans, 61.“I look at the bridge every day from my living room window and people come from all over to see it, they park outside my house and wander over. It’s a big part of our community and our history.”Friday marked 200 years to the day since the official opening of the bridge, a masterpiece of engineering that revolutionised the economic and social landscape of northWales, as well as transport and communication links between Great Britain and Ireland.View image in fullscreenThomas Telford was the engineer behind the Menai Bridge and other projects including St Katharine Docks in London. Telford new town in Shropshire is named after him.Photograph: Science & Society Picture Library/Getty ImagesDesigned and built by Thomas Telford, the first president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Menai became the first major suspension bridge in the world when it opened on 30 January 1826.Several designs were discarded before Telford found a way to build over the dangerous strait at a narrow point where tall warships could still pass underneath, said William Day, an engineer who took part in major repair works on the bridge in 1999.“It’s an icon of civil engineering,” added Day. “The precision, the quality control, thinking ahead about ease of maintenance and sustainability … and he needed to figure out how to erect it over wild water. He hung the iron cable chains down the banks to rafts, and then used ropes and pulleys on the other side to winch it up. He established how to do it in future, and some of his ideas are still in use today.”View image in fullscreenThe Menai Bridge spans 579ft (176 metres) and was built between 1819 and 1826. In the distance behind it is a railway bridge designed by Robert Stephenson.Photograph: David Goddard/Getty ImagesEdward I built a pontoon bridge across the Menai strait in 1282 for his invasion of Wales but Telford’s bridge was the first permanent structure over a waterway made especially dangerous by conflicting tides.The engineer made use of meticulous measurement to create hundreds of huge iron cables, all of the same size, that could be used anywhere on the bridge – a practice unheard of at the time. They had adjusting links to compensate for imperfections in size and shape, and tunnels and chambers were cut into rock to move the chains, aided by suspended cradles and webs of scaffolding.It was the last link in the new London-Holyhead road, dramatically reducing travel times to Ireland and making the journey much safer. The project helped earn Telford the nickname “the Colossus of Roads”. Born into poverty in Dumfriesshire, he was ahero of 19th-century Britainwhose legacy survives in roads, bridges and canals across the country.While still much loved byMonwysion– Anglesey residents – the bridge has been plagued by safety issues, leaving severe traffic problems.The Welsh government announced on Monday that more defects had been found and another round of repairs is now not expected to finish until February next year.“Our priority has always been and remains to safeguard the bridge for the future,” said a statement from Ken Skates, the Welsh government’s cabinet secretary for transport. “We continue to invest in maintenance and preservation … extensive inspection, strengthening and refurbishment activity [is ongoing] to ensure the structure’s long-term safety and performance.”Celebrations of the bridge’s bicentenary include the unveiling of a plaque and a day of history talks and stories hosted by Bangor University.Despite the repair issues, the bridge’s future remains bright, according to Day. “The masonry in that bridge is 200 years old, but if you took a sample from it, it could have been laid yesterday,” he said. “It’s already astonishing how well it has lasted, but if it’s looked after properly, it could be in use for another 200 years.”Explore more on these topicsWalesEngineeringTransportHistorynewsShareReuse this content"

He first assaulted the pupil after inviting him and his friends over to his flat, where he gave them alcohol and cigarettes.View image in fullscreenJacob Leland.Photograph: Thames Valley police/PAAfter the victim’s friends left, Leland kissed the boy before placing the pupil’s hands over his own groin, Reading crown court heard. Leland committed a further sexual assault on the schoolboy by performing oral sex on him during a school trip.Eton is England’s largest boarding school, whose former pupils include Prince William and Prince Harry. Twenty former prime ministers, including Boris Johnson most recently, are Old Etonians.Leland, of Tufnell Park, north London, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault on a male after a trial at Reading crown court last year.The headteacher, Simon Henderson, who was not in post at the time of the assault, said in a statement: “Eton needs to acknowledge not only that something this serious was able to take place at our school, but also that it took several years for the details of what happened to come to light.“As headmaster, I remain appalled that this abuse happened at Eton. Leland’s criminal conduct represents the most egregious breach of trust.“Those who were directly impacted by Leland’s actions had the right to be safe and secure in our care. I reiterate my unreserved apologies to them on behalf of the school.”During the sentencing at Reading on Friday, Judge Real, told Leland: “The relationship of teacher and student at a school gives rise, undoubtedly, to a significant level of responsibility towards the victim, upon which the victim would be entitled to rely.”The court was told on Friday that Leland was “trusted” by a housemaster at one of the school’s 25 boarding houses to look after the students and follow the school’s rules.Real added: “For the victim, the psychological effects of what you did to him have been long-lasting and serious.”In his statement, Henderson said the welfare and wellbeing of the school’s pupils were its “top priority”.He said: “When safeguarding issues arise they are dealt with in accordance with our established processes.“We work in close partnership with external authorities, referring matters to them where appropriate, as we did in this case.”Explore more on these topicsPrivate schoolsCrimeChild protectionSchoolsRape and sexual assaultEnglandBerkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Matthews, Fernandez and the other tenants were told to vacate their premises by Monday 2 February.Matthews and Fernandez, through their company Hoxton Beach, are pursuing legal action against the corporation over its decision.They accuse the authority of unfairness and a lack of transparency in the retendering process, which they believe was run as a commercial exercise in a bid to raise money.They have now been informed through their lawyers they do not need to vacate the cafes next week.However, the corporation has said it may try to obtain a court order to repossess the premises.“We are grateful for small mercies,” said Matthews. “We are very relieved we don’t have to get out in a few days’ time, which would have been impractical and probably would have destroyed our business.”The corporation has faced a backlash at its decision to bring in a new cafe operator among the local community and the customers of the cafes, and actors Benedict Cumberbatch and James McAvoy have backed the campaign.More than 22,000 people havesigned a petitioncalling for the corporation to retain the current cafe operators, while Matthews and Fernandez have raised more than £9,000through a crowdfunding campaignto fund their legal action.View image in fullscreenCustomers of the Lido cafe in Parliament Hill Lido, Hampstead Heath, include the actors Benedict Cumberbatch and James McAvoy, who have backed the owners’ campaign to retain the lease.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianA spokesperson for the City of London Corporation said the authority had “followed a legitimate and open process in awarding the new cafe leases” and it rejected any suggestion “that the process was in any way unlawful”.They added: “Hoxton Beach have refused to leave the cafes they occupy despite their tenancies having been terminated. The City Corporation may if appropriate seek an order for possession in the county court.“We want the approved operators to move in as soon as possible.”Daisy Green brings “relaxed and buzzing Australian food and coffee culture to London”, according to its website, and it operates 21 sites across the capital, ranging from the National Portrait Gallery to a barge moored on the Thames at Richmond.The corporation said Daisy Green had committed to retaining existing staff and paying them the London living wage, while also pledging to purchase equipment from the current operators where possible.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryFood & drink industryLondonCommunitiesCity of LondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has seen evidence that appears to show that the email was sent on 22 December.The cathedral spokesperson added: “We also do not comment on security matters; however, our systems and suppliers are regularly reviewed, working with external advisers.”Dahua’s technology was installed by a UK security firm, ARC Fire Safety & Security, according to the Chinese company’s website. The UK company did not return a request for comment.The WUC raised the same concerns in an email to authorities in charge of the Parthenon temple in Greece, which uses cameras made by Hikvision, urging it to remove the CCTV.It called for the technology to be removed at both sites.The WUC, which operates from Munich, also pointed to reports that the companies’ cameras have systemic vulnerabilities that allowed them to be hacked by Russia in reconnaissance during the invasion ofUkraine.Oleksii Kuprienko, of the Ukrainian organisation Don’t Fund Russian Army, said there had been several incidents where footage from surveillance cameras appeared to have been accessed – and even broadcast online – during Russian missile strikes.“Such footage can be used to analyse the effectiveness of strikes and, at the same time, to intimidate civilians by openly showing the power of Russian weapons,” he said.Kuprienko referred to an incident in early 2024 when footage from a camera believed to have been made by Hikvision broadcast the operation of a Ukrainian air defence system. “Shortly afterwards, that position was struck,” he said.Grigory Mamka, a Ukrainian MP who sits on a parliamentary committee scrutinising law enforcement, confirmed that cameras made by Dahua and Hikvision were being removed.“[The security services] established that entrance codes were hacked and connection was made to equipment installed by these two companies,” Mamka said, in an interview mediated by a translator.Mamka said security services identified in 2024 that the cameras had been hacked, apparently by the Russian army, to spy on defensive positions.Footage of missile strikes, apparently from CCTV cameras, has also appeared on video streaming sites, which Kuprienko said was part of Russian psychological warfare, designed to intimidate Ukrainian civilians.A spokesperson for Dahua said: “Dahua never has, and never will, develop a product or solution designed to identify or otherwise target any specific ethnic, racial or national group, including the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. The company has investigated these allegations and found no evidence that our products have been used to this end.“All Dahua products and solutions adhere to the highest international standards of cybersecurity, and are certified by globally recognised standards organisations. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Dahua immediately suspended shipments to Russia and does not supply any surveillance equipment to the country.”Hikvision did not return requests for comment. An email to a representative of the authority responsible for stewardship of the Parthenon went unanswered.Explore more on these topicsChinaMagna CartaHuman rightsUyghursUkraineTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

It accuses Gayton McKenzie of acting unlawfully and violating the right to freedom of expression and demands the high court reinstates her participation by 18 February, the deadline for confirming installations with biennale organisers.View image in fullscreenGayton McKenzie said Elergy was related to a ‘widely polarising’ conflict.Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty ImagesGoliath, whose video work Elegy pays tribute to a Palestinian poet killed by an Israeli airstrike, told the Guardian: “We hope to reclaim the pavilion, which we believe is rightfully ours.“But more importantly than that, it is the significance of the work … that speaks far more eloquently to these very difficult questions of whose life is recognised as a life worth grieving after.”The Venice Biennale rotates between art and architecture each year. A main exhibition features works chosen by a central curator, while governments organise national exhibition pavilions. In2024, 86 nations participated.McKenzie responded to the backlashin astatementearlier this month, indicating his concern originated from the suggestion that “a foreign country” had offered to fund South Africa’s exhibition, and alleging that South Africa’s platform was being “used as a proxy by a foreign power to endorse a geopolitical message about the actions of Israel in Gaza”.The statement seemed to refer to Qatar Museums’ inquiry about the possibility of funding South Africa’s pavilion and buying the artworks, before Goliath was selected by an independent panel.These discussions did not go anywhere, Goliath’s affidavit said. Goliath said: “I utterly reject the accusation of foreign capture,” calling it a “damaging conspiracy theory”.View image in fullscreenA still from Gabrielle Goliath’s video installation Elegy.Photograph: Andrea Rossetti/Héctor ChicoMcKenzie, in a letter on 22 December included in Goliath’s court filing, said: “The subject matter, as outlined, is known to be highly divisive in nature and is related to an ongoing international conflict that is widely polarising.”A second letter, dated 2 January, said: “It would not be wise or defensible for South Africa to support an installation against a country currently accused of genocide, while we as South Africa are also fielding unjustified accusations of genocide.”South Africa’s government launched a lawsuit in 2023accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Before McKenzie’s Patriotic Alliance party joined a national coalition government in 2024, McKenzie had said there was“no genocide”of Palestinians. Donald Trump and US officials havefalsely claimedthere is a “white genocide” in South Africa.View image in fullscreenA scene from Gabrielle Goliath’s Elegy.Photograph: Courtesy the artistGoliath had planned to exhibit three videos ofElegy, a work that has been shown for more than a decade, in which female singers take turns to step on to a dais and sing the same note. One video was to honour the Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada, who waskilled alongside her sonby an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis on 20 October 2023.The other videos would have paid tribute to Ipeleng Christine Moholane, a 19-year-old murdered in South Africa in 2015, and two female victims of theGerman genocide in Namibia.The minister’s decision provoked outrageamong South African artists, with groups of writers andnon-profitsalso signing open letters condemning Goliath’s removal. The Democratic Alliance, which is in the national coalition, reported him to the country’s public watchdog.The minister and his department have not made public any plans to replace Goliath’s work in Venice. McKenzie’s spokesperson did not respond to follow-up questions.In July 2025, the Lebanese-Australian artist Khaled Sabsabi wasreinstated as Australia’s representativeat the 2026 biennale. He had beendropped that Februaryafter controversy over some of his past works, including a depiction of the former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a video rendering of the 9/11 attacks on the US.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaVenice BiennaleGazaPalestineVideo artExhibitionsWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The Jerash site turns that genetic signal into a human story about who died, and how a city experienced crisis,” said Rays Jiang, the study’s lead author and associate professor in the University of South Florida’s department of global, environmental and genomic health sciences.View image in fullscreenA tooth from the site in Jerash.Photograph: Greg O’Corry/FAU-Crowe“Pandemics aren’t just biological events, they’re social events. By linking biological evidence from the bodies to the archaeological setting, we can see how disease affected real people within their social and environmental context.“This helps us understand pandemics in history as lived human health events, not just outbreaks recorded in text.”A multidisciplinary team of archaeologists, historians and genetic experts from the University of South Florida, Florida Atlantic University and the University of Sydney produced the paper, with Jiang and her researchers looking at DNA extracted from teeth.They found that a diverse demographic range of victims, which she said showed that a largely mobile population was together and effectively stuck in the same place by the disease, similar to how travel shut down during the Covid pandemic.“People move. They’re transient, and vulnerable, and normally they are disturbed, dispersed. Here, they were brought together by crisis,” Jiang said, adding that ancient pandemics thrived in densely populated cities shaped by travel and environmental change.View image in fullscreenRays Jiang of the University of South Florida College of Public Health.Photograph: Torie Doll/University of South FloridaExcavations revealed more than 200 people were buried in the grave at the hippodrome in Jerash, known as the Pompeii of the Middle East for its preserved Greco-Roman ruins. Jiang said they were a mix of men and women, old and young, “people in their prime, and teenagers”.“At that time there were slaves, mercenaries, all sorts of people, and our data is consistent with this being a transient population. That’s not a new thing,” she continued.Jiang said the research exposed other parallels in more modern pandemics, particularly Covid, dismissed by Donald Trump in its early days as “a hoax”.“There’s a whole school of thought that says the first pandemic did not happen,” she said. “The denialists argue that if you look at census data, the population did not collapse like the Black Death, if you look at economic tracking, you don’t see anything, if you study residence density maps you don’t see a disruption. And plus, no one had found a mass grave.“But the first plague is actually much easier to untangle than Covid. We haveYersinia pestisas the microbe; we have a mass grave, and bodies, hard evidence that it happened. Whether society or institutions collapsed is a separate matter. You can have a disease rampage through and don’t have to have a revolution, a revolt, a regime change to prove that it did.”Explore more on these topicsInfectious diseasesArchaeologynewsShareReuse this content"

For him, the decree raises the prospect of a future that need not be spent pounding the streets and selling cheap umbrellas in all weather to earn between €200 (£173) and €400 a month.“I don’t have my papers so I can’t get a proper job,” said the man, who came toSpain14 months ago and asked not to be named.“I really worry about paying my rent and I’m also trying to support my wife and daughter, who I left behind. I can’t get public housing or go to the doctor. I’m out on the street all day in the rain and the cold and the sun, just trying to earn a living.”That, he added, was why he had been so delighted by Tuesday’s announcement.“I’m so excited,” he said. “It’s like a gift from God that will help keep me going.”View image in fullscreenThe Madrid base of the Valiente Bangla Association, which provides food, toys and Spanish language books for undocumented workers and their families.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianSitting next to him, Mohammed Elahi Alam Alam, the president of theValiente Bangla Association, which works to help undocumented migrants, also welcomed the decision by the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), saying it was long overdue recognition of reality.It was also a necessary counter to Vox’s stated intention ofdeporting 8 million people of foreign origin, including their Spanish-born children.“There are people who don’t want immigrants here – the fascists – but who’s going to work in the fields?” Alam asked. “Immigrants. Who’s going to work in the restaurants? Immigrants. Who’s going to look after people’s families? Immigrants.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Elahi Alam Alam says immigrants do the jobs shunned by Spanish people.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianEvidence of Valiente Bangla’s multi-faceted outreach work crammed Alam’s office: sacks of potatoes for communal, charitable meals; megaphones; children’s toys; and a stack of Spanish language books.Many of those eligible for regularisation, however, will not need to work on their Spanish. Rosa (not her real name), who came to Spain from her home country of Colombia almost two years ago, is one of the huge number of Latin American women who work informally as cleaners, cooks and carers. Many are badly paid and some are mistreated by their employers.Rosa said: “A lot of us have sacrificed so much to come here in search of a better life and yet some days you get up and think: ‘I just can’t do this any longer – I’m going to go back.’“Some people deliberately hire undocumented people because they know they won’t need to pay them what they should or cover their social security.”For Rosa, the regularisation programme is the chance to get a job that pays more than €120 a week, and to access the protections and benefits enjoyed by legal workers.Despite the shrill political opposition to regularisation, it is far from unprecedented in Spain; PP and socialist governmentsenacted similar programmes between 1986 and 2005. Research suggests such initiatives can yield economic benefits for newly legalised workers and for government coffers.Joan Monràs, one of the authors ofa study into the 2005 regularisationof almost 600,000 non-EU immigrants, said tax revenues increased by about €4,000 per regularised immigrant a year, adding that the policy had not led to “magnet effects” in encouraging further arrivals.“The first part of the paper looked at whether there was a ‘pull effect’ or not and we concluded that there wasn’t … there was no relative change in the flow of migrants,” said the labour economist.“Something else we saw very clearly was that the career paths of immigrants who entered the social security system improved significantly. A good example of this was domestic workers who entered the labour market. After starting off working for families, within six months, they’d started working for larger companies and earning higher salaries.”The decree is also not the first time the administration of Pedro Sánchez has defended the moral and economic case for immigration as Spain struggles withan ageing population and low birthrate.View image in fullscreenPedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, says migration is a driver of economic development.Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAHe said in October 2024: “Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations. The key is in managing it well.”But his government’s words and policies have infuriated the far right in Spain and beyond, and fake news stories about the regularisation have proliferated on social media. Although the measure will confer official resident status on successful applicants, it will not give them citizenship and the accompanying right to vote in general elections.On X this week, Elon Musk reposted a claim that Sánchez was using the move to conduct “electoral engineering” adding: “Wow.”Sánchez reposted the SpaceX tycoon’s comment witha reply of his own: “Mars can wait. Humanity can’t.”Amid the squabbling and point-scoring, some of those who have spent years campaigning for regularisation have called for reflection about what the decree means and why it is needed.Catholic groups, including the migration department of the Spanish conference of bishops, see the measure as “an act of social justice and recognitionof so many migrants who, through their work, have long contributed to the development of our country, even at the cost of keeping them in an irregular situation”.Edith Espínola, a spokesperson for the Regularisation Now! movement, said the decree would go a long way to restoring the rights that so many people had lost when they crossed borders in search of safety or a better life.“Regularisation makes you feel like a citizen and a person,” she said. “It stops you feeling like an object and it lets you fight for your rights. You know those rights are yours but they’re never really yours until you have a plastic card that says you’re a resident of this country.”Regularisation, she added, allowed people to work, study and live with dignity. “It means that you can break through that invisible border. It means you can feel a little bit more human from the moment that you have that plastic card.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeMigrationRefugeesPedro SánchezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Dopredicted a future in which a student “sits in a college library and removes an electronic device from her purse”. It serves as her “mobile phone, information portal, entertainment platform, and personal organiser. She takes this device almost everywhere and feels lost without it.”Such devices, Fogg argued, would be “persuasive technology systems … the device can suggest, encourage, and reward.” Those rewards could have a powerful effect on our relationship with these devices, akin to gamblers pumping quarters into slot machines.Four years later, Apple launched the first iPhone. At Stanford University, Fogg taught Behavior Design Boot Camps that Wired magazine called “a toll booth for entrepreneurs and product designers on their way to Facebook and Google”. There, Fogg proved his theory to be spectacularly true: portable computers really could be used to “change what we think and do”.As it turns out, one of the main ways they do so is by compelling us to spend hours and hours in front of them. Today, anxiety around screen time is ubiquitous throughout the generations.Ofcom foundnearly a quarter of UK five- to seven-year-olds have their own phone, with 38% using social media. But it’s just as likely the oldies among us will be spending hours on ours. I was shocked to find my daily average was over four hours: mostly before and after sleeping, spent on news websites and YouTube.There is huge debate in academia as to the effect smartphones, and their social media apps, are having on us. While psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge argue that they make children more anxious, fragile and depressed, and amplify political polarisation, others, including Pete Etchells and Amy Orben, believe the evidence for this is thin.I am inclined to think the effect of Apple’s brilliant invention, plus Fogg’s dark genius, has been profound. My use of these machines has been compulsive: when I walk my dogs having left my phone at home, I find myself repeatedly grabbing for an empty coat pocket, my arm moving independently of free will. I read fewer books because of social media; I concentrate less in front of films and TV shows. I watch YouTube more than the BBC, ITV or Channel 4. I have been through phases of forcing myself on to a virtually app-less dumb phone, but the convenience and often necessity of maps, parking apps and train tickets pushed me back.My main impression of how the world has changed is we’re all a lot more pissed off with each other. And I really do blame phonesYet my smartphone has affected my life in often negative ways. The world I disappear to inside it has made me – and probably you – angrier. That’s my main impression of how the world has changed since 2007: we’re all a lot more pissed off with each other. And I really do blame phones. Humans are profoundly social and wired to solve the problems of existence by forming into collaborative groups. When we feel we belong and are valued, we’re happy; when we feel isolated and worthless, we become anxious and depressed.Smartphones have gamified and monetised these powerful aspects of human nature. They don’t benignly offer us the connection and status we desire: they strategically withdraw it in order to drive engagement. Whenever we’re outraged by the behaviour of an identity group that’s not our own, it’s an attack on our status: we are drawn further into our phones to find out more and perhaps take part in a counterattack – an attempt to restore our threatened status and reinforce the connection with our team. We’re made to feel good or bad by likes, reposts, comments or follower-counts, but our phone issues these precious rewards unpredictably, just as a slot machine does – and just as Fogg described. It’s this unpredictability that helps make them compulsive.For us deeply social animals, much of our social life now takes place inside apps designed to manipulate via the manufacturing of social competition and tribal conflict. Of course we’re tired and angry and suspicious of each other. But at least we have a greater awareness of this now. More than 60 Labour MPs have recentlyurged the prime ministerto follow the example of Australia where under-16s have been prohibited from using social media sites.My own social media habit has been mostly vanquished by dint of the sites becoming dreadful. Instagram – where I used to post photos and enjoy those of friends and colleagues – now forces me to watch endless short videos by annoying people I have no interest in. Facebook is mostly absent of news from friends and family, and is instead a stinking river of dreadful memes and inane arguments. What was Twitter – a useful tool for promoting my work – has been superseded by X and Bluesky, both useless for this and petri dishes for the worst of human behaviour.I do worry, however, about what is coming. The heavy-handed way in which large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, flatter egos to give users a sense of status is currently a bit of a joke. But LLMs are new, and will rapidly improve. Human psychology is eminently hackable – as dogs have learned over tens of thousands of years, and romance scammers have figured out in 20. As BJ Fogg predicted, “suggest, encourage, and reward” and we will be yours. The deviceSam Altman and Jony Iveare rumoured to be making, in which a wearable AI buddy will accompany us all day, learning about us and helping us and telling us we’re great, has the potential to burrow into our minds and become a relationship that feels essential and profound – the ultimate example of a technology that can “change what we think and do”.Will Storr’s book And You’ll Be Okay Forever: Selected Essays is out now.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMobile phonesSmartphonesSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A disinformation-laden film was even made about him.But 16 years after the death of his friend and lawyer Sergei Magnitskyat the hands of Putin’s regime, Browder is unrelenting in his fight for justice. It is an endeavour that, by his estimation, has cost Putin and his cronies billions of dollars already, viaasset freezes and sanctions. Hence the considerable risk to his safety.Browder has the restless intensity of a man who made his millions in post-SovietRussiaas the chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, yet took on the even tougher challenge of standing up to the Kremlin.On a recent visit to the World Economic Forum at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, he pursued chief executives, European leaders and US senators in his quest to impose even more financial pain on Putin and ultimately try to bring about the downfall of a murderous regime.Like many seasoned Russia watchers, he is sceptical that any of the drawn-outattempts to secure a peace dealacceptable to Moscow, Kyiv and Washington will be a success.Putin’s fate depends on the war, and Browder says the Russian president has no way out.“Putin has no ability to stop the war because he started the war as a war of distraction against his own incompetence. This is a war not because there’s any real problem withUkraine.“It’s because he needs to be at war so that there’s a foreign enemy and not people getting angry with him for a lousy life that he’s created for most Russian people. And so if he were to stop the war, he would lose power. And if he lost power, he’d end up getting killed.“And the Ukrainians can’t stop the war or can’t stop defending themselves because they understand they will die.“When they get occupied,Bucha is the model. The Ukrainians understand full well that the women will be raped, the men tortured and killed and the children kidnapped. So neither side has any capacity to stop.”Almost four years on, the intractable nature of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is clear for many of Europe’s leaders. The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, says Russia’s exhausted financial reserves, economic stagnation, surging inflation and high interest rates mean it is incapable of paying its soldiers when the war ends.Stubb told an audience at Davos: “I’m more worried about Russia’s unwillingness to end this war because they cannot afford to do so than about Russia’s capability to win this war. This war has been an utter strategic failure of President Putin.”Browder, who in 2012 succeeded in gettingsanctions imposed on Russians involved in Magnitsky’s death, has for several years been trying to convince Europe to divert more than $200bn (£146bn) of Russian assets that were frozen in 2022 towards Ukraine’s defence.But with progress on those frozen assets stalled because ofopposition primarily from Belgium,he has a new focus: refineries in India, China and Turkey. These plants process Russia’s oil, turning it into products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel, and keep dollars flowing into the Kremlin’s coffers.Browder reckons the eight refineries are collectively funnelling between $500m and $1bn a day to Russia by buying its crude oil, and is pushing for sanctions to be imposed on their owners.“It’s just the most straightforward, obvious thing I’ve ever seen. How does Putin afford this war? And it’s with the sale of crude oil. Who buys the crude oil? There’s three countries that are the main purchasers: China, India and Turkey.“If they stopped buying the Russian oil, the price that Russia would be able to get from their oil, considering that it would be the oil equivalent of blood diamonds, it would sell at some enormous discount. And then, I believe in six months’ time, Putin would be pretty much out of business.”Attention in recent weeks has focused on Russia’s shadow fleet oil tankers that transport its crude but whose ownership is often sheltered via opaque layers of ownership. Browder calls that a “really indirect” way of targeting Putin’s resources.“You can either go to the people who buy the oil and they don’t buy it, or you can go to the 200 ships that are transporting the oil and they don’t transport it. It’s easier to get the people.”There are some signs that some of the refineries are starting to act: Bloomberg reported recently that deliveries of Russian crude into India ports slumped in December to their lowest level in more than three years.Meanwhile, Browder has not given up on the frozen Russian sovereign assets, that are primarily held at Belgian depository Euroclear.Tortuous negotiations around transferring those assets to Ukraine to help fund the war ultimately hit a road block in the form of Belgium. Its prime minister, Bart De Wever, as well as thebosses of Euroclear, have faced personal threats. Europeagreed in December to lend Ukraine €90bn(£78bn) – although not secured against those assets – money that will start to arrive in April or May.De Wever insisted at Davos that sending those assets to Ukraine would be a bridge too far: “Europe is not at war with Russia. You cannot simply confiscate money. That is an act of war. You should not underestimate it – it has never happened in history.”But Browder argues Belgium’s leader is putting his personal safety above national interests, and that sending the money to Ukraine would be an extension of Europe’s current policy of handing their interest paid on those assets to Kyiv.“Regardless of all these 20-point peace plans, negotiations, the war’s not going to end,” he says. “And so we’re going to be sitting here a year from now. We’ll have burned through half of that loan and we’re going to need to be thinking about what happens next.“I’ve been at war with Putin for the last 15 years, I don’t feel good about it, but for my reasons, taking responsibility for the murder of one of my colleagues, I chose to go after them. This guy [De Wever] has infinitely greater resources.“So if I can handle it, so can he.”Explore more on these topicsOilRussiaOil and gas companiesUkraineEuropeCommoditiesEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The absolute size of the discounts on battery cars is larger, at £7,091, mainly because manufacturers have been slower to produce electric versions of the smaller, cheaper cars that are the backbone of the petrol market.UK probably needs large new factory to meet target of 1.3m cars a year, say industry bossRead moreWhile this is all good news for consumers, car industry executives complain that official EV sales targets are too tough, forcing them to offer “unsustainable” discounts on battery cars amid intense competition – particularly from new Chinese brands.Also, despite the car industry’s focus on EVs, as they lobby for easier targets, for some models the discount on a petrol model is proportionally bigger. Take the popular British-made Nissan Qashqai: the price data suggest that a new model can be found for £36,000, or 17.9% off the recommended retail price.Nissan has not begun producing its electric Qashqai, but its similar-sized electric vehicle, the Ariya, has a discount of only 13.1%, putting it at an average price of £45,264 (with some versions eligible for grants).Kia’s Niro EV can be found at a 7.1% discount, at £38,460, without being eligible for a grant, whereas there is 13.2% off a Kia Niro Hybrid, which combines a small battery with a petrol engine, putting it at £33,225.Whichever choice buyers make, it usually pays to haggle – particularly at the end of the month or the quarter when dealers may have sales targets they need to meet.Even if the upfront price for a new electric car remains higher in many cases, the total cost of ownership may well be lower, particularly forpeople who can charge the car at home. Battery motors are much more efficient, meaning less energy is lost to heat and noise, whichleads directly to lower energy costs(andmuch lower carbon emissions), while maintenance costs are also lower on average.The Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a campaign group, last month calculated that internal combustion engines cost drivers an annual £1,300 “petrol premium” at 2025 fuel prices.Colin Walker, the ECIU’s head of transport, says: “With a majority of people able to charge their vehicles at home and take advantage of cheap, night-time charging tariffs, these vehicles can deliver savings worth hundreds, even thousands of pounds a year.”The UK’s electric car grant of up to £3,750 has meant that price parity between electric and petrol has arrived for some new car models. Walker highlighted the Ford Puma, the bestselling car in the UK in 2025, which starts from £26,580. That compares with £26,245 for the electric Puma Gen-E, after the grant.“It’s no surprise that EV sales increased so significantly in 2025,” says Walker. “The choice of models is constantly expanding and, crucially, the price of EVs is coming down as manufacturers compete with each other to hit their EV sales targets.”Shortages of new cars during the coronavirus pandemic and theconsequent chip shortagemeant discounts were not needed to shift cars, but the market is shifting back – with theadded impetus of competition from Chinese marquessuch as BYD, SAIC’s MG and Chery’s Omoda and Jaecoo offering keen prices. That has put bargains back on the table at car dealerships.Pat Hoy, the founder of Insider Car Deals, says the level of discounting is “not unprecedented. The market as a whole is starting to look a lot like it did just before Covid, where the manufacturers are getting back to usual sale patterns, turning discounts on and off.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryMotoring (Money)Electric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoring (Technology)newsShareReuse this content"

The culture shock is significant | David RayfieldRead moreA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlostopped using appssuch as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.Last week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.The continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.Charges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.In recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.Workers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.It was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.Urban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.Dreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.However, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.Dreams declined to comment.Temper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.Statutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”Temper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”It said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”Temper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.Explore more on these topicsGig economyRetail industryHospitality industryMinimum wageWorkers' rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Thus far in his career, the formerOne Directionfrontman and unproblematic fave has been the golden boy of British music, one of our few stars to successfully crack America and not embarrass us in the attempt. Amid ever-dwindling sources of national pride, Styles has been a constant, the UK’s preferred Prince Harry and even less controversial than Paddington. But is his charmed run about to come to an end?As Styles gears up for his big comeback, after a three-year hiatus from music and in large part public life, there are signs he may have set his sights too close to the sun, with controversy over ticket prices and a backlash brewing. Can Harry style it out?He is once again asking for your credit card numberStyles announced his plans for a “seven-city global residency” last month along with hisnew album, the irritatingly titled: Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally.But fans’ enthusiasm for his return was quickly tempered when they saw the ticket prices, with standing tickets at Wembley starting at £144.65 (the 65p is important) and VIP packages stretching to £725.45. Even nosebleed seatscost£92. Meanwhile the most expensive package available, for Styles’ month-long stint at Madison Square Garden in New York, is quoted at $1,667 (£1,208). Fans’ outrage caused the presale to be a trending topic on X this week, with manypointing outthe irony of the tour’s title – Together, Together – given the prices and limited stops. “Nobody can afford to go,” said one user. Someone elsechallengedStyles to front up and collect the cash himself: “I want you to stand in the pit … look every fan in the eye and ask them for $1,200.” Of course, many fans would pay double for that.View image in fullscreenStyles at the Brit Awards in 2023.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage… but fans seem willing to pay“HOW MUCH,”tweetedLiam Gallagher when Styles’ presale went live. When someone said Oasis’s reunion tour tickets were hardly cheap,Gallagher replied: “They were reasonable looking back at it now.” In fact, Styles’ ticket prices arein linewith other recent stadium pop shows by Taylor Swift, Coldplay, Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo – reflecting rising costs across the board. Fans have certainly been willing to pay. A massive 11.5 million people, equivalent to the population of Belgium, registered for the Madison Square Garden presale, making it Ticketmaster’s “highest volume ever recorded for an artist presale” in New York and “the largest artist presale registration ever seen for a single market or residency-style run”. The Hollywood Reportercrunched the numbersand found that even with Styles performing a whopping 30 shows at the venue, totalling about 585,000 tickets, 95% of those who signed up to the presale will miss out. Not every registration will have been legitimate, of course, or an earnest attempt to buy – but it’s still indicative of demand. “Sorry, kids, you’re not going to college because mommy had to see Harry Styles 30 times at Madison Square Garden,”joked one X user.He’s being set up for a hero’s welcomeThough Styles’ ticket prices are hardly exceptional, there’s a sense that his comeback is being pitched as a cut above the average pop tour, with not just shows but “global residencies”. On Wednesday, Styles announced two more dates at Wembley,setting him upto break the records set by Coldplay and Taylor Swift at the venue. Next month, he’ll perform at the Brit Awards. The album’s first single Aperture, meanwhile, justbecame his third UK No 1. It all points to a triumphant return to the spotlight for Britain’s favourite son – and perhaps a boost in GDP. In 2023, following his third album, Harry’s House, Styles was named UK music’smost successful export. Last year, the Sunday TimesRich Listestimated his worth at £225m.

In August 2024, Network Railunveiled“Harry’s Wall” specifically for fans to deface in place of the nearby, Grade II-listed Twemlow viaduct, where Styles reportedly spent time in childhood. A lookalike competition later that yearreportedly lifted“London gloom”, even without an appearance from the man himself.… but he has a long way to fallFor all the goodwill behind Styles, there are signs of a brewing backlash. Many fans have taken his ticket prices as a sign of Styles forgetting his roots in bubblegum, of-the-people pop. (Don’t forget, he was discovered on The X Factor.) One longtime fanaccusedhim on X as having “lost touch with reality”: “I’m at a loss for words … Music should be accessible. Remember how you started.” By claiming A-list prices, Styles has raised the question of whether even fans will feel like they’ve got their money’s worth. Whatever your feelings about Coldplay and Taylor Swift, they have proven track records of putting on a spectacle, and the back catalogues to support a show of several hours; Styles’ new album will be his fourth, while his easy, relaxed stage presence –always part of his charm– may not translate to a stadium. He’s also somewhat out on a limb as one of the few male solo artists jostling for a place among pop’s big names. Culture writer Emily Bootlearguedthis week that Styles’ “songs do not stand up to the heft of his public image”, and he’s built a career on good looks and charm while female pop stars are held to far higher standards. The Daily Mail has already begun fomenting backlash,claiming this weekthat the ticket-price controversy was just the beginning of “good boy” Styles revealing his “true colours” – though it failed to drum up any actual dirt.View image in fullscreenStyles and Emma Corrin in My Policeman.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/APWill he impress Shania much?The best the tabloids may be able to hope for is some disgruntled gym-goers prepared to go on the record that Styles doesn’t put his weights away. (Regularly sighted at Barry’s Bootcamp, he’sin fact knownfor holding the studio door open for others.) Historic charges of him “queerbaiting” with gender-fluid fashion and sporadic forays into acting (with 2017’s Dunkirk, and 2022’s My Policeman and Don’t Worry Darling) have failed to make a lasting dent in Styles’ “Mr Perfect” image. He’s also broadly escaped badmouthing from the other members of One Direction – a rarity among broken boybands. It could be that Styles is just a generally good egg. Jenny Lewis, frontwoman of Rilo Kiley, supported Styles on his 2021 arena tour and had nothing but good things to say, telling theHow Long Gone podcastthat Styles loaned her his AV equipment to beef up her “DIY” show and seemed a genuine fan of her music. Photographer Myriam Boulos, whose images are being used for the Together, Together tour, has alsopraisedhis support and collaboration. For the UK leg, Styles is donating £1 from every ticket soldto the LIVE Trust, raising about £780,000 for small music venues. Shania Twain is supporting; we’ll see what she has to say.Harry may have a different finish line in mindIt might seem a bumpy start to Styles’ comeback, but perhaps, on the verge of his 32nd birthday, his measures of success have changed. For someone so famous he’s kept an impressively low profile during his three-year hiatus, even while starting up a relationship with actor Zoë Kravitz. The pair have been frequently photographed together since last summer, but in a low-key, natural way suggestive of an actual relationship; Page Sixreported this weekthat Kravitz has been calling Styles her “soulmate”. For his part, Stylesrecently alludedto “some more positive things” in his life, though he might have been referring to the other passion he’s picked up during his time out: marathon running. Styles ran the Berlin event last year under the pseudonym “Sted Sarandos” (an apparent play on Netflix’s CEO Ted Sarandos – please let this not foreshadow a docuseries) andloggedan impressive 2:59:13 time. There’s now speculation Styles might have another goal in mind for his “global residencies”. Runnershave noticed thatthe dates seem to line up with marathons in each city and allow time for training – though the New York City race, the day after the last of Styles’ gruelling 30-show run at Madison Square Garden, might be a stretch, even for Mr Perfect.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesCelebrity crib sheetOne DirectionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He knew that the team had built something special – “but I never thought it would be like this,” he laughs, marvelling at what came next.Mere weeks after its release in June, the animated film – about Korean girl band Huntr/x who battle soul-hungry demons through song – became Netflix’s most-watched title ever. The film’s soundtrack, a fleet of emotionally charged, devilishly catchy hits crafted by real K-pop heavyweights, became a platinum-rated phenomenon all its own.The film made history when four of its tracks hit the US Top 10 simultaneously, and soaring lead single Golden was the world’s most-streamed new song last year. It has already very appropriately won a Golden Globe and is up for best international song at the Brit awards. Not since the Lion King’s Circle of Life has a song from an animated film been nominated for the Academy award for best song and song of the year at theGrammys. This weekend, if the bookies are right and Golden wins both, it will be the first original song from an animation ever to do so.Eisendrath, the film’s executive music producer, credits an unusually collaborative songwriting process – and K-pop’s innate theatricality – with the song’s appeal. “K-pop is larger than life, a whiplash in the best way possible,” he enthuses. “Something can happen, musically, for eight measures, and then you snap to a whole other vibe.”Huntr/x’s sonic battle against demonic boyband Saja Boys demanded thrilling, radio-friendly hits that pushed the story forward with every beat. It also demanded genuine K-pop credibility, provided by Seoul’s taste-making The Black Label (home to Blackpink’s Rosé and her own Grammy-nominated megahit APT.), and a who’s-who of independent hit makers.Danny Chung, an A&R and songwriter with a decade of chart-toppers, co-wrote the Saja Boys’ bubbly, pastel-hued introduction, Soda Pop. He describes working on the film and voicing the husky Baby Saja as a “dream come true” and a “much more engaged” process than he anticipated, due to the challenge of putting character arcs before musical taste or trends.“Soda Pop isn’t exactly The Black Label’s signature sound,” he confesses. “In one of our weekly calls, Ian expressed his concern with where Soda Pop was because it felt ‘too cool’ sonically. One of The Black Label’s head producers said: ‘So make it a bit tacky by design?’ There was an overwhelming ‘Yes!’” Embracing the cheese was a risk to their street cred that paid off: Soda Pop had to be cutesy, to emphasise the boyband’s sinister, soul-reaping second act – and has since been certified platinum.View image in fullscreenEjae … lead vocalist on Golden.Photograph: Ricky Middlesworth/NetflixSaja Boys’ switch-up from sweet to edgy is itself a classic K-pop trope, as Ejae, the lead vocalist on Golden, explains: “[Groups] do a 180 and turn into sexy, cool guys – it’s when interest from fans turns into obsession.” A writer for major Korean girl groups (Twice, Red Velvet, Aespa), Ejae was drawn to the film’s deep celebration of Korean culture – in particular how Huntr/x’s powers are inspired by Korean shamans’ use of bells and voices to ward away, or invite in, spirits – and its nuanced approach to a story of good versus evil.Rumi, Huntr/x’s leader, harbours a secret, and Golden’s victorious lyrics clash with her reality: burnt out, isolated and ashamed. These emotional complexities inspired Ejae to put a lot of herself into the lyrics, drawing on the 10 years she spent training to be a K-pop idol before becoming a songwriter instead, as she explains.View image in fullscreenRumi, Mira and Zoey, who form the girl group Huntr/x.Photograph: Netflix“I always connected with Rumi and [her bandmates] Zoey and Mira. Mira being a black sheep in the family – that’s me. Being from two different places and not knowing your identity, that’s absolutely me as well.” Ejae was born in Seoul and raised in New Jersey before returning toSouth Korea. “And Rumi being really hard-working, but also putting herself through a lot of pressure and perfectionism, that’s exactly me, too.”But when Eisendrath asked her to sing as Rumi for the soundtrack, she needed “a lot” of convincing. “Performing has always been a scary thing,” she admits, “but Ian helped me come out of my little turtle shell!”Recording in the studio was one thing, but embodying Rumi – and nailing Golden’s heart-leaping vocal gymnastics – on live TV, for an audience of millions? Ejae says she never saw it coming. Huntr/x’s firstIRL performance on the US late-night talkshow The Tonight Showunited Ejae with singers Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami, who voice her bandmates, and she describes it as “climbing Mount Everest”. Yet singing with them, and the fans, proved “incredibly spiritual,” she says. “Stage fright is real, but I was able to find the beauty in performing.”View image in fullscreenIRL … Huntr/x’s performance on The Tonight Show, (l-r) Rei Ami, Ejae, and Audrey Nuna.Photograph: NBC/Todd Owyoung/Getty ImagesFor Eisendrath, watching Huntr/x come to life from backstage was deeply emotional: “Life imitating art. It’s incredibly meaningful that Huntr/x are being viewed as artists, as opposed to characters from a film.” They’ve since performed on the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and at Los Angeles’s Jingle Ball, and fans are hungry for more concerts, more songs – but Netflix remains tight-lipped on any further plans for Huntr/x, or the franchise in general. Bloomberg reported that a sequel is slated for 2029, but Netflix would not confirm or deny this to the Guardian.‘Almost collapsed’: behind the Korean film crisis and why K-pop isn’t immuneRead moreIn the meantime, all eyes remain on the real-life talent. Huntr/x’s popularity has supercharged the profiles of Ami and Nuna, who have gained tens of millions of listeners, and the soundtrack’s success is likely to have contributed to The Black Label gaining almost $68m in investment ahead of a rumoured IPO stock launch; label head Teddy Park recently received a commendation from the Korean prime minister in the awards for Overseas Expansion Merit.But for Ejae, KPop Demon Hunters’ success goes deeper than the numbers. With a growing confidence, she is slowly releasing her own solo material, after years of writing for others. “I’m so grateful,” she says, softly. “A dream I had shelved for a very long time, that I never thought I needed to open up again … is open.”Explore more on these topicsMusicKPop Demon HuntersK-popAwards and prizesGrammysOscars 2026Pop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about a life on the run and finally settling downSat 31 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareHadFatima Bhuttobeen left to her own devices, her devastating forthcoming memoir would have been almost entirely about her relationship with her dog, Coco. “I know it sounds nuts,” she laughs. And it’s true that being dog-crazy doesn’t quite track with the public perception of Bhutto as a writer, journalist, activist and member of Pakistan’s most famous political dynasty. But the pandemic had forced something of a creative unravelling and when Bhutto took stock, she found herself only really able to write about Coco. Her agent politely suggested her memoir might need something more. A second draft was written, then abandoned.“Until I thought, what if I just tell the truth? And then it fell out of me – it didn’t even pour, it fell.” In around three weeks Bhutto had reworked her draft and, in the process, revealed a shocking chapter of her life that she’d kept secret from everyone around her.The resulting book, The Hour of the Wolf, is a raw, vulnerable account of an abusive, decade-long relationship that Bhutto endured, certain in her belief that this was love. It charts the painful realisation that this man (she only refers to him as The Man), who she writes is “unlike anyone that I have ever met: uninhibited, blazingly sure of himself … beautiful, rugged, old-school masculine … a free spirit”, had manipulated her into accepting that flashes of kindness and sporadic adventure were the real deal.The two met in New York in 2011, when Bhutto was on tour with her sensational family memoir,Songs of Blood and Sword. The book caused a major stir in Pakistan and beyond by re-evaluating the Kennedy-esque Bhutto dynasty; Fatima held her aunt, Benazir, partially responsible for her father’s murder. The grief was palpable.The book is a necessary reminder that being ‘strong’, accomplished, widely admired and fiercely clever doesn’t offer a protective shieldFatima embarked on a long-distance relationship with The Man, meeting around once a month over a period of 11 years. It suited her; she was often travelling for journalistic assignments or being invited to speak at literary events and festivals across the world. She wrote novels and essays. She was nominated for the Women’s prize for fiction. None of this was really of interest to The Man, who became controlling. His darker side was full of rage; he would treat her with abuse then silence, contempt and scorn. In Bhutto’s description, he would switch from dazzling to demonic without warning. He isolated her from her friends.Her memoir is a short but astonishing account, articulated in such calm, quiet prose that it makes the burning cruelty of what Bhutto experienced all the more harrowing. Coco still features prominently. But mostly the book is a necessary reminder that being “strong”, accomplished, widely admired and fiercely clever doesn’t offer a protective shield. Frankly, none of these qualities offers a woman immunity from the psychological violence of a coercively controlling man.“I didn’t really want to do it,” she says of writing about her relationship. “Because I felt ashamed, I felt embarrassed, I did feel all those kinds of things. But I also know that if I’d read something like this, it would have helped me.”This is the first time Bhutto has spoken publicly about the book. The relationship ended in 2021 when, after years of her expressing a desire to have a family, to put down roots, even going through fertility preservation in Spain, Bhutto finally realised that The Man would never give her what she needed. She was 39. She left him, met her husband, Graham, in 2022 and had two babies within three years.View image in fullscreenMurtaza Bhutto in 1978.Photograph: Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesWe are meeting in the Chelsea home of the friend, Allegra, who introduced them. Both women are present, along with Bhutto’s husband, their sons Mir and Caspian, and a babysitter, who is in the process of organising coats, boots and a pushchair for an outing to the park.This is a home from home – the family largely live abroad but, for security reasons, Bhutto prefers not to specify where. “My toxic trait is that I think I can get through anything,” she says, when I ask, bluntly, how she put up with some of The Man’s most egregious behaviour. Not only did Bhutto endure it alone, but she recalls the delight he took in belittling her in front of an audience, routinely humiliating her in restaurants, in shops, on holiday. (There is one encounter in an electronics shop that I was willing to be the final straw, but their relationship continued for several more years.)“I have a really high tolerance for stress or discomfort or whatever, and I just, for so long, had told myself this was the same thing.” Irrespective of the highs in their relationship, it’s awful to consider the extent to which Bhutto contorted her feelings or rationalised his. “The only way to survive 11 years of that is to think of it as a love story,” she says, almost with a shrug. “And you think it’s toughening you up for, you know, the great success that awaits you. You think that it’s hardening you up for life. And I did tell myself that. And also, because I didn’t tell anyone else anything, no one turned around to me and said:‘What are you talking about?’”Bhutto has always guarded her privacy – which makes her account all the more difficult and exposing – but that she didn’t tell any of her many friends that she had a boyfriend, let alone what their relationship was like, is hard to reconcile. This, of course, was due to the nature of the “love” The Man had manufactured between them: he insisted they had to remain a secret, they weren’t to indulge in “normal” behaviour such as meeting each other’s friends or family, living in the same city, let alone the same home.“I had read stories and seen things throughout my life about women who’d been put in dangerous situations by men. I just never thought I was one of them because it hadn’t been physical, you know?” (She says this, though in the book she recounts that he once bit her finger so hard, it gave her nerve damage.) “So I just thought that that would never happen to me, that itcouldnever happen. All the while it was happening, and happening, and happening, and I hadn’t connected it. I just thought the cliche was too obvious. You know, that someone wants to break a strong woman?” Bhutto projects poise, even when she’s being wry. “I mean, I was not young enough for this to be excusable.”Was there a part of her, in the years she spent independently travelling and living all over the world, establishing her career, that thought this relationship was all she deserved?“That’s the amazing thing,” she says, trying to reconcile her solid self-esteem against what she was put through. “There was no part of me that thought that. It wasthe opposite. I used to say to him: ‘If I hadn’t had the father I had, you would have damaged me. You know, if I had an absent father, if I had a father that was cruel, or if I had a father that never told me I was clever or smart or strong, you would have done harm to me.’ And he didn’t break me in the end.” On this she is clear. “I felt damaged by him, but I know that the damage he wanted to do was total.”Bhutto’s father, Murtaza Bhutto, was the eldest son of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, founder ofPakistanPeople’s party (PPP) and prime minister of the country in the 1970s. The story of the Bhuttos is in many ways the story of Pakistan. Their family history is the nation’s history, and it is under the weight of immense scrutiny and violence that Fatima has lived her whole life.The fear I had growing up really played into this relationship. The need for secrets? I understood thatHer grandfather Zulfikar was overthrown by a military coup and executed in 1979, in circumstances that sent shockwaves around the world. Three years later his youngest son, Shahnawaz Bhutto, a young radical fighting to overthrow the military dictatorship that killed his father, was found dead in Nice at 26 years old. The family have long believed he was poisoned.Fatima was born in 1982, and spent her early years in her grandfather’s vast Karachi residence. She was close to her father, who retained sole parental custody after divorcing her mother when she was a toddler. After Shahnawaz’s death, the two of them spent the rest of her childhood living together – in exile – in Syria. Plainly, Fatima adored him and wrote Songs of Blood and Sword largely as a righteous biography of her father.“This will sound disjointed,” she begins, “because this is the first time I’m thinking about it out loud. But I don’t think I had properly – to use a word that I findoof– ‘healed’ from my life, really. Not until after this relationship, because so much of what had traumatised me had been part of my life. The fear I had growing up really played in beautifully to this whole thing [with The Man]. The need for secrets? I understood that because I have had to live like that, even until now.” Being a Bhutto comes with significant baggage around security, which may partly explain why Fatima has lived such a peripatetic existence.She recalls being told to pack a bag by her father and being whisked “on an adventure” countless times, upping and leaving with a moment’s notice. Of being really chatty as a young girl on the phone and then being told by her father not to talk to those calling the house. Not to give away any detail of where they were. “I adored my father because he adored me,” she says. “He would make it fun, so it wasn’t like you were holed up in some scary place. But you still understand, something’s not right.”Political activism was a central tenet of family life, with all its associated danger. “The adults in my family never really hid anything from us. They didn’t ever say, ‘leave the room, children, because we have to talk about something’. That’s just how they talked.”“I used to struggle with it because my father sometimes would say things like, ‘You know, when they kill me …’. And when I was much younger, I’d get really upset at these family lunches where they casually talked like that. He would never treat it as …” She pauses. “There was never any ‘Oh no, I’m sorry, darling. I didn’t mean that.’ That’s just how it was.”Fatima and her father returned to Karachi in 1993. By then her aunt Benazir had assumed the role as head of the PPP and, at 35, served as the world’s youngest female prime minister, between 1988 to 1990. Despite a bitter feud with her brother about her right to lead the party, Benazir began her second term in 1993. Murtaza publicly accused his sister and her husband of political corruption and revived a breakaway faction of the PPP. Three years later, Murtaza was dead, killed by Karachi police in a brutal shoot-out outside the family home. Fatima was 14.View image in fullscreenGhinwa Bhutto (right) and Fatima at a press conference after the death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996.Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty ImagesFatima was left with her stepmother Ghinwa and her baby brother, Zulfikar Jr. For a while, the siblings lived secretly in Syria, for their own safety. “Again, they didn’t hide any of the stuff from us,” she says, trying to explain a childhood layered with contradictions, a collision of fear, privilege, violence and grief. “It was: ‘We’re sending you to Damascus on a flight at midnight. Don’t tell anyone that you’re going. Yes, keep the plan to see your friends tomorrow, nothing out of the ordinary, but you’re going to be gone by midnight.’ And so I asked: ‘Why do we have to go to Damascus?’ And I was told: ‘Well, we don’t know if they’re going to kill the children next.’” Bhutto recounts all of this flatly matter of fact. “Whether they intended to or not, they definitely traumatised us in this way.”In 2007, Benazir was assassinated on the campaign trail while fighting to win her third term in office. Fatima bears a striking resemblance to her aunt. Their relationship was complicated, especially given the circumstances of her father’s death, but to this day the Bhutto family’s legacy can be seen in Pakistan; Asif Ali Zardari, Benazir’s widely reviled husband, is sitting his second term as president, and has assumed co-chairmanship of the PPP with his son, Bilawal.Fatima remains deeply politicised. “It’s made me uncomfortable around power though, rather than craving it,” she explains. “I’m very well aware of the dangers of power. I’m not stupid enough to think, ‘Oh, ifIwent into politics, I’d be different’. I know no one is different.”The question of whether she would follow in the family tradition receded a long time ago. But the urge to do something worthwhile still remains.“There are moments when I feel in a rage about the world, that I think maybe there is a duty to be more involved, because maybe you can’t do anything from outside. Maybe you can’t do anything from writing. But there’s no appeal for me. I never think, ‘Oh, what I’d like right now is to surrender what dregs I have of privacy’. No.”A passing glance at her writing and social media accounts for the past two years and more shows Bhutto to have been almost completely dedicated to Gaza, amplifying and giving voice to the horrors inflicted on Palestinians. She has continued this work through two pregnancies, culminating in the blistering book of essays she edited, Gaza: The Story of a Genocide, which was published last October.“I couldn’t help thinking throughout the experience that, you know, when I was in labour, I was in a hospital. I had anaesthesia, I had an epidural, I had doctors, I wasn’t being bombed. I could reliably be left there and no one would have to worry for my safety.”Bhutto has processed so much, in such a short time span, I wonder how she’s managed to stay sane and keep her composure. “You’ve got to, I don’t know, exist in this otherworldly kind of space where this isn’t happening.” “This” being anything from documenting Israeli war crimes to excavating her own personal history, all the while with a baby on her hip, husband and dogs in tow.“I thought I was a fairly compassionate, sensitive person beforehand, but it just kind of rips you open in a new way.”The Hour of the Wolf by Fatima Bhutto is published by Daunt.

They swore they would never work together. “Circus couples are a pain in the arse,” Charlotte tells us on the mic at the start of the show, chatting like an old friend.Inevitably they did end up working together, forming the companyOckham’s Razor,and making warm, insightful and gently joyful circus theatre shows full of humanity and connection. They stepped back from performing into directing after having a daughter. The pair were not quite ready to retire from the stage, however, and Collaborator is one last hurrah. It’s an ode to their performing lives together, from the hopeful anticipation of day one to the challenging days when nothing is in sync, demonstrated through simple but telling games, with props, ropes and some mesmerising pendulums that make waves of energy visible.View image in fullscreenDreamy … Collaborator by Ockham’s Razor.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe theme of waves, and shared energy – and how one person’s energy might amplify or dampen another’s – is woven through the piece. There is a dreaminess about the mellow pace, a contentedness through the ups and downs (#couplegoals) and an effective soundtrack by Holly Khan that you almost don’t notice because it’s so fused with the action and feeling on stage.The heart and soul of Collaborator is when Mooney and Harvey get on the trapeze. In this case it is a square frame that they hang from and slowly, lift, curl, fold, balance and pretzel themselves around each other. This is not Cirque du Soleil pyrotechnics but intimate, up-close, physical conversation. It embodies all the trust and care, the attention and deep listening to each other, the physical attunement, the strength they offer each other (and like any long-term relationship, there’s hard work too, that’s clear).In one moment, Harvey is hanging underneath the bar, the ball of his foot pushing upwards against the metal, and Mooney is crouched on top of it, her toes mirroring his – its a tiny, probably unintended, detail, but a surprisingly tender moment of yin and yang. Earlier in their acrobatics, a toe comically almost goes up someone’s nose, so it’s not all so serene. This short piece is an engaging memento of what’s clearly a beautiful partnership.Atthe Place, London, until 31 January.Then touringExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreCircusMimeDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

As a strong wave hit, Ortiz, sitting at the bow, felt his body lift and come down sharply on his seat. The sudden impact fractured a vertebra. He was taken to hospital and underwent emergency surgery.“I’ve always been captivated by the power of water and the sense of freedom and escape one feels when diving into it,” Ortiz says, “but until that point, I’d never considered the other side of this freedom and the risks it carries.”‘The boy’s contented face, his red hair matching the pig’s – you couldn’t plan for it’: Kelli Radwanski’s best phone pictureRead moreWhen he was back home in Barcelona, the accident and recovery inspired a new photographic series,The Swimmers, nowa book(Alep Publishing). “What happened sparked a newfound appreciation for life and for the resilience of the body,” he says. “With the support of a coach, I began swimming, and I felt compelled to document this world with my camera.”Ortiz shot the series on medium format film, but would occasionally use his iPhone 16 Pro Max to assist him in setting up. This image was shot on his phone at a pool used in Barcelona’s 1992 Olympic Games; the city’s cathedral and the Torre Glòries skyscraper are visible in the background. The swimmers are from two of the city’s teams, Sabadell and Mediterranean. Ortiz told them where to stand but adds that their poses were not directed.“I was really surprised by the confidence they showed in front of the camera and the powerful energy they transmitted,” he adds. “This project is a tribute to hard work and unwavering dedication.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The smell of spice and smoke fills the air amid a cacophony of sounds, from the clink of pint glasses to the beats of Punjabi bhangra music.This is a scene that you might not associate with the traditional British pub, but for many communities in the Midlands it is commonplace in the growing number of Desi pubs.It is a phenomenon that has transformed struggling pubs into communal hubs by south Asian landlords who have fused the warmth of the British pub with the heart of south Asian hospitality, food and culture.“We’re proud of what we’ve achieved – creating jobs in the community. We’re breaking down barriers, we’re creating social cohesion,” Satnam Purewal, the landlord at the Red Lion in West Bromwich, said.Purewal’s father, Jeet, took over the Red Lion pub in 1997, when the brewery was looking for new owners. It is one of several taken over by south Asian people in the Midlands in the second half of the 20th century, when a growing number of people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh arrived in the UK.Such communities were often met with hostility and prejudice, including at pubs where a bar operated that disallowed people of colour from entering. Although it was made illegal in 1965,it still continued to operate years after.The racial discrimination endured by Black and Asian communities prompted the American civil rights activistMalcolm Xto meet Avtar Singh Jouhl from the Indian Worker’s Association (IWA) in Smethwick in 1965. On the day of his visit, Malcolm X was refused service at the nearby Blue Gates pub – this meeting is now depicted in stained glass art on display at the Red Lion.Over the decades, Desi pubs have continued to grow in number and popularity in the region. “We were one of the early ones,” Purewal said. “And then it started to get really, really popular and more and more people embraced it.”The continued popularity, however, has coincided with growing fears the UK is witnessing a return to the racism and discrimination seen decades before. The Midlands, believed to be the birthplace of the campaign that has led toSaint George’s and union jack flags erectedacross the UK, has been a particular focal point.View image in fullscreenAmrik Singh Saini, the landlord of the Royal Oak in West Bromwich, says people of all backgrounds visit his pub.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianFor Purewal, he said pubs like his are a symbol and celebration of diversity in the UK. “Our customers are very aware that we’re a melting pot of loads of different cultures, all mixing together and being able to sit down together,” he said. “We don’t just get Indian clientele. We get loads of English people, the Black community, the Muslim community.”“When you start sitting down with people you realise actually there’s very little difference between us – we all do the same thing; we all go to work, we come back and we all worry about the kids,” he said. “By having pubs like ours, it breaks down those barriers that might exist.”Amrik Singh Saini, the landlord of the Royal Oak, also described positive relations between different communities in the area.His pub is located in Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham that recently made headlines after the former Conservative MP Robert Jenrick described it as“one of the worst integrated places I’ve ever been to. In fact, in the hour and a half I was filming news there I didn’t see another white face”.When asked about these comments, Saini said he “always” sees white faces at his pubs and people from a variety of backgrounds frequent his establishments. His pub regularly serves home and away fans at West Bromwich Albion.In many ways, the decor of the Royal Oak is a physical manifestation of the fusion of cultures. The pub, which is dedicated to the late Punjabi musician Sidhu Moose Wala, has several paintings of him while two large statues of the Queen’s Guards sit in front of the kitchen.“Different communities mix together,” Saini said.Saini, who bought the pub in 2011, said it was “hard work” to establish and renovate it. “It’s not like you buy a building, buy a pub, and just put a mixed grill in. It doesn’t work like that.” Good quality food and atmosphere is a focus for Saini, who said businesses like his are booming.“All Desi pubs [are] busy.”Explore more on these topicsPubsWest MidlandsCurryEnglandMalcolm XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sometimes, my answer is a Sri Lankan potato curry, ora Gujarati one. Perhaps a slow-cooked Spanish omelette if it’s a date night with Hugh at the kitchen island (like this Friday) but today, the solution is Greek.Yahniis the Greek word for a style of cooking: vegetables braised in plenty of olive oil and tomatoes, until tender. It’s a way of being, a vote for the simple and the slow and the good (but it is also dinner, if you wish).Patates yahniServe with crusty bread or Greek flatbreads for a main meal, or with some picky bits on the side or even with a fried egg for breakfast.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4Extra-virgin olive oil1 large red onion, peeled, halved and thinly slicedFine sea salt4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1kgdesiree potatoes, cut into wedges 2½cm at the widest point2 tsp dried oregano, plus extra to finish2 tbsp tomato puree2400g tins finely chopped tomatoes– I likeMutti150g feta75g Greek yoghurt1 lemonfinely zested, plus 1 tbsp juice80g kalamata olives, pittedPut five tablespoons of oil in a wide, deep-sided pan for which you have a lid and set it on a medium to high heat.

How about if £50 was up for grabs?Richard from Suffolk is a customer of Octopus Energy, and now eight of his family and friends are, too, after he recommended the provider to them all through its referral scheme. “I really think [referral schemes] are a good idea. It’s an incentive to swap – without it, I think people wouldn’t bother switching and would carry on as they were,” he says.For each referral, Octopus gives £50 of credit to the referrer and the referee. Richard says his dad was delighted with this arrangement. “That paid for a month’s worth of electricity for my dad, which he was really happy about,” he says.Across energy, banking, shopping and entertainment, there are lots of companies and brands offering existing customers perks for bringing in new business. How it normally works is that a customer shares a link or code with a friend or family member, and then the referred friend or relative either signs up to the service or buys a product.In return, either or both parties get a pre-agreed reward, which might be cash, credit, money off, a free month or points.For businesses, these schemes can often be seen as an easy win as they can be a way of bringing in good-quality new customers for less than the cost of paying for more advertising. But for customers, there are potential dangers.“Refer-a-friend schemes can be genuinely useful in offering cash bonuses or discounts for both parties,” says Jane Hawkes, the founder of the consumer rights websiteLady Janey.“However, it is important to approach them with a degree of caution and common sense.”View image in fullscreenIf you like cinema, Cineworld offers a month of free Unlimited membership if members refer a friend. That means free cinema … for a month.Photograph: Matt Crossick/PAIf you are the referrer, she says you should “be honest about your experience, and transparent about the fact that you’ll receive a bonus if someone uses your link”.If you are the friend or relative, her advice is to “check the small print, compare alternatives and make sure the product genuinely fits your needs and budget”.Martyn James, a consumer rights campaigner, says everyone should read the terms and conditions of not just the product but also the scheme itself, just to ensure that all parties are happy with any agreement.He adds: “Be wary of social media referrals. These can condemn both parties to endless spam linked to the sector of the business you’ve referred to.”Most of these schemes require the referred friend to be a brand-new customer who has never used the company or service before.Naturally, you are going to want the people you have referred to have a good experience. It probably helps if the company being recommended is well regarded. This month Octopus Energy wasnamed a Which? recommended providerfor the ninth year running (the only big energy supplier to get this accolade) after coming second in a survey of 17 firms – so hopefully Richard’s friends and relatives will be glad they made the switch.Banking and financeSome banks, investment companies and finance firms offer rewards to people who refer their friends, and sometimes also to the referred friends.Lloyds bank gives each successful current account sign-up – both the existing customer and the new one – £50. Anyone with a qualifying Lloyds current account can refer up to five people a year, which means you can get up to £250.View image in fullscreenMonzo’s refer-a-friend offer is ‘up to £50’, meaning the customer has a chance of getting £10, £20 or £50 every time they refer someone.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersMonzo’s current refer-a-friend offer is “up to £50”, which means the customer has a chance of getting £10, £20 or £50 every time they refer someone, with that person also getting the incentive. To be eligible, the referred person must add some money and pay for something using their Monzo card within 30 days.Starling Bank offers a free National Trust day pass to the referrer and the new customer. This is done when the existing customer sends a referral through the app, and the new person signs up and is accepted by the bank. The passes offer a free day out for two at a National Trust site of your choice.And online savings marketplace Raisin offers £100 to each party if a customer refers a friend or relative who then opens a fixed-rate savings bond via the referral link – though the referred person must deposit a minimum of £10,000 in a single account to qualify.Digital investing service Wealthify offers £50 to a referrer and a referred friend when the new customer opens a stocks and shares Isa, self-invested personal pension (Sipp), junior Isa or investment account. They have to put in at least £1,000 and leave it invested for a minimum of six months. The £50 is paid directly into your investment accounts.For many banks, there also is a condition that money must be spent from the new account that has been opened, and that the account is open for a minimum set period of time.Energy, broadband and other billsMany broadband, electricity, gas and mobile network providers also offer cash and other rewards to those who successfully get a new customer to use their service.The Octopus Energy deal Richard used offers £50 of credit for both parties, which gets added to their accounts when the new customer has fully switched over and made their first direct debit payment. “It typically takes around four weeks from when your friend joins,” says the firm.View image in fullscreenOctopus Energy’s referral deal offers £50 of credit for energy use for the referrer and the new customer.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesSimilarly, British Gas has schemes for its boiler services and its gas and electricity.Every boiler referral, where the friend or family member has a new energy-efficient boiler fitted by the company, gets each party a reward (a £100 Amazon voucher, or £100 in your PayPal account, or a £50 Hive voucher). To refer someone, you need to be a British Gas customer who had a boiler installed by the company in the last seven years. For energy, both people get an Amazon gift card worth either £50 (when they switch their gas and electricity to British Gas) or £25 (when they switch just one). Again, the referrer needs to be an existing customer.Virgin Media’s refer-a-friend deal offers cash rewards – up to £50 each – for referring friends and family to its services. This includes its broadband, TV and home phone packages. There are a few offers that you can’t refer friends to, and check to make sure your friend is able to receive Virgin Media in their area before referring them.Similarly, if a friend or family member signs up for a Sky product (including Sky Glass, Sky Stream, Sky Mobile or broadband), you will both get up to £100 in vouchers to spend at big retailers. “You must only send the referral link to close friends and family. Please don’t spam,” says the company.View image in fullscreenIf a friend or family member signs up for a Sky product, you will both get up to £100 in vouchers to spend at big retailers.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBroadband provider Plusnet has a scheme for customers where, for every person they get to sign up, it will give the referrer up to £1.25 off their monthly bill for as long as the signed-up person remains a customer. “You can recommend us to as many people as you like, so there’s a chance that you could end up with free broadband or even making money,” says the company.The mobile network Three has refer-a-friend deals for a number of its products and services, including its pay monthly phone and home and mobile broadband plans. The provider gives £40 to each person for a successful broadband referral, and £20 each for a successful pay monthly sim referral. Your reward can be paid straight into your current account or PayPal account. And, unusually, you can recommend someone and receive a reward even if you are not a Three customer.Its rival mobile network Voxi – a Vodafone brand – will give both parties a gift card (Amazon, PayPal or Just Eat) worth up to £20 after they have both paid their monthly plan bills for two months.Lifestyle and shoppingSome gym companies including LifestyleFitness, Anytime Fitness, Gymbox and Third Space offer deals to members who recommend their chain to friends.Third Space offers gym credits to use, while Anytime Fitness gives money off your membership (it says the offers may vary depending on the club). Gymbox gives both parties a month of free membership. And Lifestyle Fitness offers the referring member points and rewards which can include one or more months of free membership, with the referred person getting a free day pass to try out the facilities.View image in fullscreenAnytime Fitness offers money off membership to people who refer a new customer.Photograph: JEP News/AlamyWhen it comes to shopping, LG Electronics gives both parties 10% off their first or next order.Clothing retailer Hobbs gives you 15% off your next online purchase for referring a friend, who will also get 15% off their first order (provided they haven’t shopped with it before).Zoom by Ocado, the app-based food delivery service, gives both parties £10 off their first or next order, though the service is only available in some London neighbourhoods at the moment.EntertainmentFor those who want the most of entertainment – from TV and cinema to music, there are plenty of deals on offer.If you like going to the cinema, Cineworld has a deal for its Unlimited membership. It allows both parties to get a free month of membership.The company says that if 12 friends sign up with your code, you will get 12 months’ Unlimited membership – that is, one year of cinema for free.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsRetail industryBankingFitnessShoppingHospitality industryTravel & leisurefeaturesShareReuse this content"

French Connection was founded in 1972 by Stephen Marks,who named itafter the film starring Gene Hackman released the previous year.The entrepreneur hired the French designer Nicole Farhi to head his design studio in the 1970s and she later launched her own label under the company’s umbrella. Together they made French Connection a hit, with a London stock market float in 1983 helping make Marks the UK’s 15th richest man for a time.The pair also became partners romantically and had a daughter together before separating at about the end of the decade. By that point the brand had fallen out of favour, prompting Marks to retake directorial control in 1991.It recaptured the public’s imagination thanks to the swear-adjacent slogan coined by the ad man Trevor Beattie in 1997 after he noticed the initials used in French Connection internal memos. It was emblazoned on T-shirts in phrases such as “FCUK Fashion” and “Hot as FCUK”.For several years over this period Marks’s wife, Alisa, had a key design role, but they split in late 2003 after a decade of marriage and their expensive divorce forced Marks to sell shares in the business, relinquishing majority control.View image in fullscreenStephen Marks, who founded French Connection in 1972 and was once one of the richest men in the UK, in 2001. He sold up in 2021.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianBy the mid-noughties, shoppers had tired of the FCUK joke and it was dropped in 2005. The company, which still owns the Great Plains brand and once owned the YMC and Toast labels as well as Nicole Farhi, struggled to find a new identity and was also hit by bad debts partly related to thecollapse of House of Fraser, where it had concessions.A return to thebawdy branding in 2016failed to revive the company in the face of heavy competition from cheaper rivals such as Asos, Zara and H&M.Marks ran the business until he sold up in 2021, eventually relinquishing control after years of losses andmounting pressure from investorsas the value of the firm dived from half a billion pounds in its heyday to less than £50m.Its new owners no longer use FCUK in the chain’s handful of British stores, although the brand has been sold for short periods in the UK via retailers such as Urban Outfitters as a retro label that appeals to 1990s nostalgia.It has, however, become a hit in India, where local licensee Myntra describes the clothing as having “distinct laid-back attitude for when you don’t want to look like you are trying hard to look good” accompanied by “powerful, provocative slogans”.Apinder Singh Ghura, a Newcastle-based businessman, oversaw the £29m rescue takeover in 2021 of the brand that took it off the London Stock Exchange. The current owners also include his Manchester-based business partner, Amarjit Singh Grewal, and KJR Brothers, which is led by Rafiq Patel, a textile businessman.View image in fullscreenA new French Connection design.Photograph: French ConnectionThe group’s new North American licensing deal with G-III Apparel Group, which controls brands including Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld and DKNY, forms part of the road to reinvention. G-III will take over French Connection’s existing team in the US and oversees distribution via more than 700 boutiques and department stores.Ghura, who spent years in the clothing industry before shifting to other investments including property and care homes and the Bench streetwear brand, which he has now sold, said French Connection was targeting the 25-plus market with good-quality garments at an affordable price.“I see French Connection as a great brand with great equity and recognition, everything a blue-chip brand should have we have got,” he said.Ghura said the UK government “hadn’t done the business community any favours” with its decisions on tax and pay, but the label could compete against cut-price competitors such as Shein as “every brand has its place and we appeal to our customers because of the DNA we possess”.View image in fullscreenA summer sale sign at French Connection on Oxford street in central London in 2007.Photograph: Kevin Foy/AlamyThe brand, which at one time had more than 140 stores in the UK and hundreds of franchise outlets elsewhere, now has just 10 French Connection stores in the UK and 15 discount outlets but sells through 60 concessions, including every John Lewis.It is also distributed on the websites of Marks & Spencer, Asos and Next in the UK and Otto in Germany and Austria, and is planning a small number of new high-street outlets.In 2024, the brand’s sales fell 10% to £108m, but pre-tax profits shot up to £1.6m from just £0.3m a year before according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.View image in fullscreenThe FCUK logo once felt ubiquitous, but is no longer used in the chain’s British stores. Picture taken in 2010.Photograph: Universal Images Group North America LLC/AlamySales at established stores are now rising by more than 10% after the group improved quality, ditched poor-performing branches and brought in a new head of design – Helen Gallagher – from fashion brand Mint Velvet.The performance stands out among the UK’s mid-market fashion brands, which have been hit by lacklustre spending as younger shoppers have less spare cash amid rising energy and phone bills and other costs such as Netflix subscriptions, gym memberships and music festivals.The revival comes as fellow 90s stalwart Topshop attempts to win its way back into wardrobes via a new online stores andoutlets in John Lewis, whileRiver Island battles for survivalwith a rescue restructure.View image in fullscreenA model sports new designs from French Connection.Illustration: French ConnectionGhura said French Connection would be focusing on “capital light” expansion via licensees, with hopes to find partners in south-east Asia and China and to widen its footwear and accessories ranges, rather than opening dozens of expensive UK outlets.Simon Donoghue, the managing director of French Connection’s retail and online business, said the company had “zero tolerance of loss-making stores” and was now in its third season of strong underlying growth as it got the “value for money equation really sorted”.“Prices are now similar to four years ago, but it is better quality and that resonates,” he said. “It comes back to design and product. Getting that right gives confidence to invest more in inventory.”Explore more on these topicsFrench ConnectionRetail industryFashion industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Greater Manchester mayor, appearing at the launch of aClass Ceiling reportat the city’s Whitworth gallery on Monday, looked quietly, subtly, the outsider.It might not sound like much. But that is the point of Burnham’s largely unnoteworthy look, which tends to involve Left Bank intellectual-adjacent black-on-black. In direct contrast to his tie-wearing colleagues in parliament, Burnham’s style feels particularly symbolic.Ever since his move away from Westminster politics, Burnham has been dressing differently, eschewing the uniform of his former suited-and-booted colleagues. Largely ditching the suit and tie, he prefers black bomber jackets, black jumpers with no shirt underneath, black blazers and black T-shirts, with the odd workwear jacket thrown in. Last week he wore a white T-shirt and aptly workwear-esque navy jacket to unveil a “concrete plan to reindustrialise the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution”.Andrew Groves, a professor of fashion design and director of theWestminster Menswear Archive, says Burnham’s “all-black workwear look is as calculated as any Westminster suit, just aimed at a different audience”. Its casualness is loaded. As Groves puts it: “It rejects parliamentary polish and signals Mancunian proximity: practical, ordinary, and deliberately outside London political dress codes.”According to Jonathan Tonge, a professor of politics at the University of Liverpool, Burnham’s fashion statements match his politics: mildly “left of centre, moderately radical, nonconformist”. While he will, he says, “wear a formal suit when needs must … for day-to-day business, what he’s saying is, ‘I’mAndy Burnham, I’m different from Westminster, and my fashions are different from Westminster’.”His style is also a byproduct of his unique position. The first “metro mayor“ ofGreater Manchester, he could, says Tonge, “chisel out the job as he wanted it and part of that was to set the fashion rules and say, actually, the old conventions don’t apply to this, I’m going to be smart-casual in my own way”.The way he dresses represents “the Manchester way” he talks about. It feels more inspired by his Mancunian musical heroes than any political ones. Tonge describes his look as “the Smiths meets Britpop”.Andy Burnham’s ‘king of the north’ jacket goes on display in ManchesterRead moreIt also sits uncomfortably but aptly close to the style of the man he arguably hopes one day to topple. Keir Starmer also wears dark shirts – he defended his national executive committee vote against Burnham this week wearing a navy shirt under a black suit jacket – and Britpop-adjacent styles such as Stone Island and Harrington jackets. As Tonge says: “Starmer, when he arrives in Liverpool for the annual party conference or whatever, he’ll turn up in an open neck shirt, sometimes trainers on.” But it is not, he says, “at a Burnham level in terms of non-conformity”.A former parliamentary politician who is now a thorn (from a Lancastrian red rose) in the side of the Labour government in Westminster, Burnham has not always avoided suits – there was controversy when, in 2015, two years before his move up the M1, he admitted tobuying Armani suits, albeit in Boxing Day sales.In an interview with the Guardian in 2022, he said of his Westminster suit and tie era: “I remember, when I left, slowly realising: ‘I don’t have to do this any more … it was an evolution and I’m not going back.” If he does make it back to Westminster, it will be interesting to see whether his style returns south too.Explore more on these topicsMen's fashionAndy BurnhamLabourGreater ManchesteranalysisShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been visiting the happiest country on Earth every year since I was a baby. At first glance, Finland doesn’t seem like an obvious breeding ground for happiness. In midwinter the sun only appears for two to five hours a day and temperatures can plummet to below -20C. (It would seem a warm-year-round, sunny climate is not a prerequisite to happiness.)The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.TheWorld Happiness Reportis based on a survey in which people rate their satisfaction with life – and the Finns have been happiest with their lot for the last eight years. Not short of marketing savvy, Visit Finland latched on to this with a “Masterclass of Happiness” advertising campaign. And it’s probably no coincidence that Lonely Planet named Finland in its 2026 Best in Travel guide as a country “for finding happiness in wild places”.I’m half-Finnish, and I’m interested to find out what Finns think is the secret to happiness, as well as what visitors can learn from them. I started by asking my friends and family. The answer was unanimous: “It’s because we have low expectations” – a response which speaks volumes about Finns. Direct, to the point and wry.View image in fullscreenA sculpture at the Helsinki Art Museum on Vallisaari island on display during the city’s biennial last year.Photograph: Maija Toivanen/Helsinki BiennaaliOf course, there are societal factors, too, such as relatively high levels of education and equality. But I see another reason, one that visitors can tap into: Finland is all about the peace of mind that comes from simple pleasures, a slower pace of life and connecting with nature.Each summer, I look forward to visiting the woods of birch and pine trees, with moss-covered granite boulders, carpeted with ferns and blueberry and lingonberry bushes. There is the joy of spotting tiny, jewel-like wild strawberries and popping them in your mouth, where the taste explodes. Then blueberry-picking season arrives, another excuse to roam the woods, container in hand – if you don’t pop them into your mouth first. These are not plump supermarket berries; they are smaller, with the concentrated essence of the forest. Finland has a unique right to roam tradition known asJokamiehenoikeudet(Everyman’s Right), so you can follow where the berry trail takes you as long as you respect the privacy of gardens.I love swimming in the cool, soft, deep blue water , then warming up on a sandy beach. On a warm summer’s evening, there is no place I would rather beFinland is gaining popularity as a “coolcation” destination – an alternative to the sweltering summer heat of the Mediterranean – although last summer it experienced a 20-day heatwave of its own, turning the lake beaches riviera-like.The area of Finland I know best is South Karelia, most of which is in Finnish Lakeland. It is dominated by the island-dottedLake Saimaa, the fourth largest in Europe. I love swimming in the cool, soft, deep blue water that stretches to the horizon, then warming up on a sandy beach backed by the ever-present pine and birch trees. On a warm summer’s evening, there is no place I would rather be. That is happiness.The happiness that comes from being in the woods is backed up by science. Research shows that being among pine trees increases our feeling of relaxation and reduces stress, thanks to the compounds found in the scent of trees. It’s a further encouragement to slow down and breathe in the forest air.View image in fullscreenLöyly sauna in HelsinkiMany English-speaking people know only one word of Finnish, but it’s one that is another key to the nation’s happiness:sauna(pronounced by the Finns as sow-na). The rush of endorphins released by a sauna helps Finns get through the long, dark winters. In Helsinki, one of the most popular saunas on the seafront isLöyly(the Finnish word for the steam that rises when water is thrown on the hot stove). In winter, they cut a hole in the sea ice so you can cool off by plunging in. If you visit Finland in winter, embrace the darkness, saunas and twinkling lights, and make the most of the few hours of daylight. It is magical to explore the woods, branches piled high with snow, on foot, snowshoes or cross-country skis. There’s a particular hush and stillness the snow brings. And maybe it is learning to hold the dark and light that leads to a satisfaction among Finns.There is plenty to explore beyond lakes, forests and saunas. Helsinki is a thriving capital that blends nature with culture. TheHelsinki Biennialtakes place inHAM Helsinki Art MuseumonVallisaariisland, a 20-minute ferry ride from the city centre. Wandering around the wooded island is a joy in itself, with the art a bonus. The next biennial is in the summer of 2027.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s favourite Helsinki restaurant is Magu.Photograph: NA/Andrew TaylorLast summer I stayed in the new timber-framedSokos Hotel Pier 4on the harbour. The rooftop garden and bar offers a 360-degree view of the sea and across the city. On a warm July evening, with a DJ playing and the sunset filling the sky well after 10pm, it is a happy place to be. Nearby in the harbour is theAllas sea pool, where you can enjoy a sauna and swim, with a choice of heated and unheated pools, depending on your level of bravery.Maybe a bucket list approach is not in keeping with the Finnish ethos – their happiness comes from getting to know a place intimatelyThe Esplanadi is lined with design shops if you want to take a piece of Finnish style home with you. There are the distinctive floral patterns ofMarimekko, the glassware ofIittala, and the china ofArabia, including Moomin mugs and plates.Restaurants showcasing seasonal and local produce are thriving. My favourite isMagu, which serves a five-course plant-based tasting menu, each dish bursting with creativity. And, of course, there is coffee and cinnamon rolls to keep everyone fuelled (Finns have thehighest per capita coffee consumption in the world).There is so much of Finland I still haven’t seen. I’ve never been to Lapland, to see the autumn colours and northern lights. I’d love to explore the wilds of north Karelia, go canoeing on Lake Saimaa and cycle around the Lakeland area. I have sailed through Baltic archipelagos on the ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki, but I’ve never spent time on the islands themselves. But then maybe a bucket list approach is not in keeping with the Finnish ethos – their happiness comes from familiarity, getting to know a place intimately, which is why so many Finns return to their summer cabins year after year.View image in fullscreenTove Jansson’s Moomin stories are infused with Finnish spirit and cultural traits.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyThe Moomins, the lovable children’s characters created byTove Jansson, are one of Finland’s most famous exports. Moomintroll lived by a simple ethos: “I only want to live in peace, plant potatoes and dream.” Happiness is a choice we can make, and that’s what I’ve learned from the Finns and being in Finland – it’s not the pursuit of happiness that makes you happy, it’s being in the moment, letting go of striving, letting go of expectations. Breathe in the trees. Plunge in cold water. Wake up and smell the coffee. Make a snow angel. Watch the sun setting into the blue expanse of a lake. That is happiness, Finnish-style.OliviaSprinkel’s book,To Hear the Trees Speak, is published by Bedford Square (£18.99).To support the Guardian, buy a copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

I’ve heard some of my friends’ parents tell them, “You should be like that, too.”I got my first phone when I was 12, as my mum wanted to be able to contact me to pick me up from school. When I got it, I had strict screen time rules: it was turned off after an hour. I still don’t use it much.I’m not on social media.Instagram and TikTok can lead to a lot of problems for your mental health. I’ve definitely seen friends get self-conscious; double-checking everything they say.Some friends spend more than six hours a day on social media. They use it to keep in touch and post nice pictures. After school, many scroll on Instagram late into the night, and it sometimes affects how focused they feel the next day. They tell me it’s a good thing I don’t have it so I can focus on school work. Sometimes I feel left out of their conversations, but it doesn’t really affect my relationships with them. They’re not intending to leave me out and they don’t judge me, they just think it’d be easier.Itisannoying when friends are on their phone while we are hanging out – scrolling on Instagram and talking about what they’re looking at. It’s boring. I don’t understand why people meet up in real life to then look at their phone.There’s so much online that’s trackable. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your pastI worry that there’s so much online that’s trackable, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I was part of a dance group in elementary school when I was 10 and now videos of me dancing are still online – I didn’t even know they’d been posted. Even if I type my friends’ names into Google, I can see stuff they did when they were much younger. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your past.Neither of my parents have social media. My dad uses screens up to 15 hours a day, because he is a software engineer and is constantly online. But if you took away his work, he probably uses them for around one hour a day for pleasure. My mum uses her phone for around five hours a day for watching shows.I don’t really worry if my screen time will go up in future. Right now, focusing on my school work and relationships is more important than being on social media. I think even when I am in university or working, I won’t doomscroll.CMDaily screen timePhone30 minutes-1 hourComputerNone outside of school workTVNone‘I worry about the time I spend on my phone. I get carried away’Shere, 85: the octogenarian whose social life revolves aroundWhatsAppView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI like WhatsApping. Mostly I speak to my family and friends in Trinidad. In the morning I open my messages and say good morning to everyone; I try to find a nice image and emoji to send.The phone hooks you in. I’m part of different WhatsApp groups, I’m in one called “Curry and Chips” with the boys. I’ve got TikTok andYouTubeon my phone to watch videos they send; some are funny, a lot are rubbish. You get so engrossed. The other day I was making my porridge and it boiled over because I was on my phone.My wife died earlier this year; we met when I was 14. Being on my phone doesn’t make me feel less lonely, but it helps me communicate with people, otherwise I don’t speak to anyone. I’ve joined three old people’s groups that operate locally. We organise meet-ups on WhatsApp and swap pictures. Once a week we get together to do some exercise and have breakfast.I watch westerns every day. My son just gave me a smart TV and I want to learn how to use YouTube on it, so I can find old calypsos. I find typing difficult, so I use Alexa to listen to music and the radio, and set alarms.The downside is there’s so much rubbish – pictures of ducks in the park, things like thatThe phone is a must these days and older people need to learn to use it. Everything is online and we’re getting left behind. Doctors send messages online, and we need the NHS app to book appointments.I check the phone first thing in the morning and before I go to bed. I don’t want to miss texts confirming hospital appointments. I check every day, but then I get sucked into reading and sending messages. I’d like to learn how to use a computer or tablet.The downside of the phone is it takes too much of my time. There’s so much rubbish. Some people send too many pictures – ducks in the park, things like that. I don’t need to see everything they do. I don’t like sitting down too much. I’d prefer to do more gardening or housework, and have more energy to spend on my exercise bike.I worry about the time I spend on my phone. I just get carried away reading messages from people – sometimes it seems as if they have nothing better to do. Also, I don’t like all the adverts and posts from people you don’t know on Instagram – I don’t know why they appear. The family don’t really comment on me using the phone – my son and granddaughter say I use it a lot, but they prefer that I’m active on it. It keeps us in touch.CMDaily screen timePhone3 hoursComputerNoneTV2 hours‘I am very strict about not looking at the comments any more’Pippa, 29: the priest who’s big on TikTokView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianAs a priest, I do see far more phones in church than you might expect. Luckily, my parishioners are very well trained, and I’ve never caught one scrolling during a service so far. But I have had funerals where people’s phones go off – you think, “Come on!”I’ve been making TikToks for about 18 months. It was my sister who suggested it and at first I was hesitant. We hadTikTokaccounts and watched other people’s content, but I’d never considered making my own. She said, “You should be a TikTok vicar!” but I thought it would be naff. Besides, in the first half of my curacy I was in a village and I wasn’t sure I’d find enough material. When I moved to my current church in a town, it seemed there was more of a buzz to tap into, and I softened to the idea. As a priest, I don’t think I should sit in church saying, “Well, where is everyone? Why haven’t they come to church this week?” This is a response to me thinking, “OK, where are people? How can I go and engage with them?”To start with, it took me hours to film and edit each one, but it’s a pretty slick operation now. One of the first TikToks I made showed me at a Ministry of Sound event on a Saturday night, then cut to me leading a service the next morning – that’s had well over 2.2m views now, and I have more than 30,500 followers. It’s always difficult to tell which ones are going to be a hit – I thought the most recent one was hysterical, so it was a bit dispiriting to check after it had been up for a few hours and find it had only had 500 views. I think that’s just human nature – with anything you’ve worked on, it’s a good feeling to have people go, “Ooooh!!” I’ve seen people suggest a good way to build your followers is to post controversial stuff, even if you don’t believe it, but I think that would be so wrong.I stay off my phone if I’m with friends or family – it’s rude not to give people your full attentionI am still quite bad for checking if each TikTok is getting likes and new followers, but the thing I am very strict about is not looking at the comments any more. On that Ministry of Sound post, for example, one said, “Girl, what in the lukewarm?” with a crying face emoji. “Lukewarm” was being used there as a denunciation, warning other Christians not to be like me, and that comment got close to 24,000 likes. Many people seemed to think it was a genuinely offensive thing for me to have done, though there were lots of positive comments, too. In fact, the event I went to began at 6pm and ended at nine – it wasn’t as if I was out partying all night.There was still a story about it in the Sun, though I didn’t realise until the parish administrator messaged me with a link. I had to write an email to my bishop: “Dear Your Grace …” She was lovely about it, very supportive. I’ve since become friends with another vicar from my diocese, David Sims, who also posts on TikTok.I do spend time scrolling through other people’s TikToks – it’s my most used app, followed by Safari, which will just be me checking my emails, then YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp.As a single person who lives alone, it feels like the only socialising you can do sometimes is through a screen, even if FaceTime isn’t the way you want to do it. I open my Hinge app every evening, but unless I start messaging someone, I’ll just sift through people’s profiles with half an eye. I make a point of staying off my phone if I’m with friends or my parents – not just because it’s rude not to give people your full attention, but because when you don’t share a living space with someone, you appreciate the company more. In terms of my friends, my screen time is somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. I think I have quite a low threshold for looking at them – I get a bit of a headache if I do it for too long. Maybe my eyes aren’t used to it – my sister stares at a screen all day for her work, whereas I spend a lot of time talking to people face-to-face. I can feel it when I’ve hit that time; I think, “I need to switch off now and read a book.”CBDaily screen timePhoneUp to 4 hoursComputer3 hours 10 minutesTV1 hour (plus occasional bingeing)‘Gaming is beneficial to my brain. It brings me some quiet’Paula, 40: the stay-at-home mother who is hooked on phone gamesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianFor me, screen time is a release from the routine – I live on a farm with kids aged 13 and five, so every day it’s house chores, kids bouncing around, dogs barking. Gaming is my “me” time – I play a war game calledPuzzles & Chaos on my phone for around four hours a day, which involves strategically building kingdoms and attacking others. I only do it when I have pockets of time – dropping one kid off, picking the other up, making a coffee.Some friends look at me like I have two heads when I say I game. Because I’m 40, and have a busy life, they wonder why I don’t do other activities instead – but I work out every day, I’m an avid reader, and I have stacks of things to do in the house. Honestly, I don’t care what people think. I have racing thoughts 24/7. Gaming brings me some quiet. I’m challenging my brain while not thinking about other things. Sure, everything in excess is bad, but if you play the right amount of time, it’s stimulating.I don’t spend much time doing other things on screens, apart from some TV. I have Facebook, but social media is irrelevant and gets boring. It’s just people posting the same things – food, pictures of places, or just whining. The game is strategic and much more proactive. I crave something that fills my brain up other than just doomscrolling.Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big wayI’m born and bred in Spain, where I was in the army. When I met my British husband, I left everything to build a life with him in the UK, but I don’t game because I’m lonely. I have lots of friends here. I’m just a selectively sociable person. Sometimes I make plans with friends, then two hours later I’m regretting it!In the game I play, you can’t do anything individually, you have to join with other players to plan attacks and win points. We’ve created a community that’s amazing. My alliance is mostly women. I like that you can talk to other gamers with no judgment. Everyone has stuff going on at home – people who have lost a relative, or are recovering from an illness. We can message within the game, but can’t send screenshots, so we also use Discord and WhatsApp.I don’t get a dopamine rush when I game, or get too hyped up. Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big way. My friends in the game know that real life comes first.CMDaily screen timePhone4 hoursComputerNoneTV1 hour‘My screen use became unhealthy, so I got rid of my phone’Barnaby, 43: the tech CEO who’s deeply offlineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI don’t generally look at a screen until after 10am. I’ve built “buffer time” into my mornings where I don’t have plans and don’t use any tech. I wake around 6.30am, spend time with my children, take a walk, exercise. For years, my mornings were a smartphone-induced blur – I used to be immediately checking the news, responding to emails or Slack messages. I always felt behind, even from the first minute of the day. Now, generally, the first time I engage with a screen is after I get to my office.Even there, I work off a paper to-do list. At the end of each week I write down the top five things I want to do the following week and use that as a guide. I used to have about 300 tasks on a content management system that I’d struggle to get through, but a bout of severe depression made me reassess how I worked.I suppose an unhealthy relationship with screens began when I started my first tech business, aged 17. It was a web hosting company. I would come home from college at 3pm and work on the business until 7am, then sleep for an hour and go back to college. By 2018 I was turning over millions with my second company,Time etc, and thought I’d cracked the code to work-life balance. Less than five years later, everything caught up with me and I had a “breakdown” of sorts. I was checking emails all day and well into the night. I was always available via instant messaging, and even when I wasn’t working I was doomscrolling the news. I became completely overwhelmed.That was three years ago; eventually I saw I needed to get rid of my phone. I have hundreds of people who might need to contact me, so it wasn’t realistic to be completely offline, but I realised I could be more selective.At first, my anxiety was really strong: I need to be connected because something bad might happenNow, I don’t browse the internet. This means no news and no social media – I might look at my phone to play music, but otherwise it’s not a big part of my day any more. If there’s an important news story, I know someone will tell me about it eventually. In fact, I’ve ended up having these beautiful, curious conversations with people. For years I was like, “Yeah, I’ve seen that” whenever anyone mentioned a news story. Now, someone will say, “Did you see the budget?” and I’ll reply, “No, tell me about it, what is your opinion?” So I have a lot more rich, human, old-school conversations about the world than I ever did before.I only spend an hour a week on email. I don’t have email on my phone or MacBook, only my desktop. I complete as many tasks as I can in person or via a phone call.Slack was ruining my life – constant notifications, constant buzzing, someone always needed something – so I stopped using it. At first, my anxiety was really strong – “I need to be connected because something bad might happen.” I was addicted to scanning for messages for probably 25 years, so it was hard to just let go – but nothing bad happened when I freed myself from that habit. I’ve never missed an important update, and if the fact that I’m slower to reply annoys anyone, they haven’t told me about it.My partner is fully supportive even if I’m not always contactable. I got out of a depression directly off the back of making these changes, so it’s been a huge net positive.I’ve found the time and space to do things with my children. My daughter and I are doing a painting project in her room, for instance – we just hang out and chat rubbish. My temper is at a different base to where it was when I was constantly behind and felt as if my phone was shouting at me from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep.AJDaily screen timePhone1 hour 30 minutesComputerFive to six hoursTVNone‘I feel shackled to my phone. Adding up thescreen time is embarrassing’Katrina, 31: the social media manager who’s always onlineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI’m reaching for my phone from the moment I open my eyes at 7am. I check the news, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, X and Facebook. I scroll as I brush my teeth and get dressed. I check emails and messages as I walk to the station and more news during my commute.At work I’m triple screening – I switch between my phone, iPad and desktop. I count this as “giving my eyes a break” – they have recently started watering at random moments and I think it’s because I focus on a tiny screen for hours each day. Bigger screens and blue-blocking glasses help my eyes relax. I’ve had other physical effects from so much screen time, too – my back hurts, my shoulders hurt, I feel as if I’m getting a buffalo hump.Most of the time I feel shackled to my phone and it’s tragic. Adding up the hours of screentime is embarrassing, but it’s necessary in my industry. I take my phone to the bathroom so I can scroll on the toilet (I think most people do this, they just don’t admit it). And there are good parts – going viral feels amazing; waking up to a post that’s had 1m views overnight is a huge dopamine rush. In 2024, I organised a Harry Styles lookalike contest in London. It blew up, it made global news – that’s the power of social media.By the end of the day my brain is fried and I feel exhaustedLike most people who make themselves visible online, I’ve been trolled. I’ve had death threats and some really personal comments about being in an interracial relationship. I read them all, I just don’t let them bother me. If someone says something mean to me online I just think, “That’s not real, so I don’t care.”By the end of the day my brain is fried and I feel exhausted. If I’m not working, I’ll watch a couple of hours of TV or scroll TikTok to wind down – its algorithm knows exactly what I want to see, so it’s better than television because it’s curated to my mind. TikTok also connects me with other people from my community. Around Diwali, for instance, I could see people talking about what it meant to them.For a while I got into a habit of waking in the night to check news alerts – there was a period of rising tension between India and Pakistan which caused me a lot of anxiety. Now when I’m looking at my phone in bed, my husband will put his hands on my eyes and say, “It’s time to put your phone away.” Sometimes I just wait until he’s fallen asleep and get it back out.AJDaily screen timePhone12 hrs, overlapping with …Computer8 hoursTV2 hoursExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaAppsDigital mediaTikTokInstagramWhatsAppYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

To solve this, we take turns delivering monologues of complaint – my wife going first. Because I’m a good listener, I can’t help but notice that a lot of my wife’s complaints are about me. Finally, she exhausts herself.“Anyway,” she says, “thank you for listening to my podcast. Now it’s time for your podcast.”“Thanks, and welcome,” I say. “I have been having problems with my email.”“Oh dear,” my wife says.“It keeps freezing for no reason, and then I have to Force Quit to shut it down, but almost as soon as I open it again …”“Quick, hide!” she shouts, jumping behind the trunk of a big oak.“What?” I say.“Take that tree,” she says. I get behind an oak and hold my breath, imagining the imminent approach of someone we don’t like. But when I peer round the tree, it becomes apparent we’re hiding from the dog.“Really?” I say.“Ssh!” my wife says.The dog is about 50 metres ahead of us, lapping at a puddle. Suddenly she looks up in a panic, and then goes haring off across a field in pursuit of a strange woman. When she is close enough to realise the woman is not my wife, the dog turns and races blindly in circles, before finally spotting my wife behind the tree and making a beeline for her. Such is the dog’s relief that it begins to leap and twist in the air, like a hooked marlin.“You found me!” my wife says.“Bit cruel,” I say.“It’s part of our training,” my wife says. “It’s supposed to teach them to stay in your orbit.”At the end of Decembermy wife and the dog came home from the final evening of dog school with a certificatebearing the word “Completed” alongside no other merits.“Not even ‘successfully completed’?” I said.“I don’t think they were prepared to go that far,” my wife said. “Anyway, I’ve signed her up for the Intermediate class.”I don’t know what happens at Intermediate Dog School, apart from hiding. I also don’t know how far my wife intends to pursue the dog’s education, or whether they will eventually branch out into forensics, maybe, before going off to locate decomposing corpses for the police. All I know is, even after all those lessons, the dog still has a tendency to court trouble, especially when she is out with me.On dog walks, my wife and I take it in turns to deliver monologues of complaint – I can’t help but notice that a lot of my wife’s are about meThe next day at lunchtime my wife comes home to find the dog and me on the sofa, both looking glum.“How was the park?” she says.“We had a fight with Violet,” I say.“Oh no,” my wife says.“But even Violet’s owner agreed that Violet started it,” I say. “Also Violet was unscathed, and this one has a big tooth mark in her neck.”“I don’t even know Violet,” my wife says.“Violet,” I say, “is violent.”The next morning we leave the house a bit later, and find the park nearly empty. I throw the ball for the dog for a few minutes without incident. There follows a mildly awkward incident when my dog and another dog swap balls and then refuse to swap back, running circles around me and the other owner. This goes on past the point of amusement.I don’t actually care which ball I end up with (I know for a fact we stole ours off another dog anyway) but there seems to be some principle at stake.“It might be easier to swap dogs,” I say. The other owner says nothing.Eventually my dog gets bored, drops the other dog’s ball and wanders across the field to a big hole, which it proceeds to excavate further. After a few minutes of this I decide to hide, for training purposes.While the dog’s head is in the hole, I crouch low behind a tree, and wait. I take out my phone to check the time. I answer a couple of texts, then scan the headlines. Every time I peer round I see the dog still digging. The longer it goes on, the weirder I feel.Finally, after seven minutes, the dog stops digging and starts to head my way. She ambles straight past the tree, sniffing the ground, and then turns to see me crouched there. I stand. The dog looks at me, head tilted, bewildered.“That’s right,” I say. “You came here with me. Remember?”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than90% of human rights violations, including murders of prominent defenders such as the Indigenous leaderBerta Cáceres, go unpunished, with many cases never being formally investigated.In 2016, the country earned the tragic title of the “world’s most deadly country to be an environmentalist” – a reputation from which it has never truly recovered. Data sourced fromannual reportsby the investigative environmental organisation Global Witness shows that Honduras continues to register among the world’s highest per capita killings of land and environmental defenders, while holding the record of total killings of defenders in Central America.View image in fullscreenBerta Zuniga, daughter of the murdered activist and Indigenous leader Berta Cáceres, at a protest against Trump’s pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández.Photograph: APToby Hill, an investigator with Global Witness, says: “The massive scale of impunity is at the root of this bleak reality, particularly as state capacity and judicial institutions are weakened by rampant corruption.”He believes Trump’s pardon risks reinforcing the crisis of impunity, which “leaves defenders and communities exposed, vulnerable and without recourse when facing threats and violence”.For Delphine Carlens and Jimena Reyes, respectively head of the international justice desk and head of Americas at theInternational Federation for Human Rights(FIDH), Honduras’s crisis is not just about impunity but also “selective justice”.In Honduras, you have a few families owning a large share of the economy, who capitalise on that powerJimena Reyes, FIDH“As soon as accountability is purely based on power, it protects perpetrators and exposes those who challenge them,” Carlens says. “Environmental defenders are targeted precisely because they challenge classical power dynamics.”Reyes says Trump’s decision points to a pattern of “state capture”, adding: “In many cases, especially inHonduras, you have a few families owning a large share of the domestic economy, who capitalise on that power and influence the justice system to advance their interests.”Under Hernández and his rightwing National party of Honduras (PNH), that connection became particularly visible. His governmentpromoted extractive industriesthrough mining, hydroelectric projects and large-scale agribusiness, often in territories claimedby Indigenous and Afro-descendantcommunities.View image in fullscreenAn oil palm plantation near Tela, on the border of a national park.

In the new push, prosecutors have sought to fire up the investigation into those who instigated and funded the murder – a process that had stagnated for more than eight years.Yet progress quickly stalled.

These were just two of at least 155 murders of land and environmental defenders in Hondurasdocumented by Global Witnessbetween 2012 and 2024, the vast majority unresolved.Since then, no arrests have been made.

She says theTrump administrationopenly endorses authoritarian leaders who target defenders and undermine the separation of powers, which has become a new strategy for hardline governments in Latin America.“We are observing an open embrace of authoritarian politics throughout Latin America,” she says. “When leaders who weaken judicial independence are rewarded internationally, it legitimises state capture.”View image in fullscreenA fence built on land in Intibuca claimed by the energy firm Desa for a dam.

For years he dominated the territory’s badminton scene, winning the singles and doubles championships almost every year. He won several medals at the Island Games, earning himself a reputation for “very competitive” play on the court.As it turned out, that was useful preparation for his time in office.The 34-year-old was sworn in last April after winning a surprise election victory fought against the backdrop of Donald Trump’sthreats to acquirehis homeland. Those threats morphed into a full-blown crisis this year when, fresh from his seizure of Nicolás Maduro from Caracas, the US president reiterated his desire for Greenland and initially refused to rule out taking it by force.View image in fullscreenGreenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, often sports a blue anorak in keeping with Greenlandic formal attire.Photograph: Tom Little/ReutersEurope’s biggest crisis since the second world war saw Nielsen, who often sports a blue anorak in keeping with Greenlandic formal attire, thrust into the geopolitical spotlight. He seems to have weathered the storm: Greenlanders say that, after Trump pulled back from threats of military intervention at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the young leader has more of a voice on the world stage.A key moment in Nielsen’s handling of the rapidly escalating crisis came in January, on the eve of a tense meeting in Washington DC with the US vice-president, JD Vance. “If we have to choose between the US andDenmarkhere and now,” he said, “we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU”.Aqqaluk Lynge, a veteran of Greenlandic politics who co-founded the party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), said shortly afterwards it was the moment Greenlanders had been waiting for. “I don’t know if I could have done that when I was his age,” he told the Guardian.View image in fullscreenJens-Frederik Nielsen, left, in Paris with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, centre, and Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesNielsen grew up in Nuuk, capital of the semi-autonomous Danish territory, with a Greenlandic mother and Danish father. He speaks both languages, which some say helps him to see both sides of the relationship between Greenland and its former colonial ruler, Denmark.He has previously said he was bullied in school for looking Danish. On the badminton court, however, he flourished.In 2020, aged 28, having helped shape its direction as a consultant while studying social sciences at the University of Greenland in Nuuk, he became chair of his party, the centre-right Democrats. “Even I probably wouldn’t have seen it coming so soon. But the opportunity presented itself and I jumped at the chance because I want this,” he told the newspaper Sermitsiaq the same year.For a short period he had a government position as minister of industry and mineral resources but lost it when he withdrew his party from the government. Then, last March, the Democrats more thantripled their seatsto become the biggest party in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament.Weeks later, just hours before Vance arrived in Greenland at the US’s Pituffik space base, Nielsen and the leaders of three other parties announced a broad four-party coalition government in a show of national unity. In a clear rebuke to Trump’s threats, the first page of the coalition agreement stated: “Greenland belongs to us.”Nielsen’s straightforward style and clear messaging seem to be impressing leaders in the rest of Europe. This week he was received by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, side by side with Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister.“We have some red lines we cannot cross but, from a Greenlandic perspective, we will try to sort out some sort of agreement,” he said in Paris. “We have been working with the US for many years now.”View image in fullscreenA campaign poster of Jens-Frederik Nielsen of the Demokraatit party for Greenland’s legislative elections hangs in the center of Nuuk, Greenland, April 2021.Photograph: Christian Klindt Soelbeck/AFP/Getty ImagesAlongside the pragmatism Nielsen painted a vivid picture of the fear and stress of the unprecedented situation. “We are under pressure, serious pressure,” he said, adding that many in Greenland were “afraid and scared”.Government figures in Denmark appreciate his style.A source close to the Foreign Office said his comments about choosing Copenhagen over the US were appreciated. “In the Danish public he is a very well-liked figure and people are very impressed that he has been able to handle it under pressure and young.”His good rapport with Frederiksen also helps. “He is a great guy and he has a great chemistry with the Danish prime minister and Danish government in general, so we are pleased it is him in office,” said the source.Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a Greenlandic member of the Danish parliament and representative of IA,who has known Nielsen since he was a child, said she thought he was doing “an amazing job” on the global stage.It takes courage to do what he has done, she said: “He is a young leader and a leader gaining experience as we speak, so of course it is a big task.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkDonald TrumpShareReuse this content"

Before the visit, she and her team were advised to get dressed under the covers because of the risk of hidden cameras having been placed in their hotel rooms to record compromising material.Keir Starmer, in Beijing this week, was more sanguine about his privacy, even though the security risks have, if anything, increased since the former Tory prime minister was in town.China has been accused of spying on parliament, has sanctioned British MPs and peers, engaged in severe cyber-attacks, adopted aggressive trade practices and generally been, in the government’s own words,an “epoch-defining challenge”.“I can confirm that I didn’t,” Starmer replied to whether he had taken refuge while getting dressed. “I’ve always said that we need to seize the opportunities, mindful of our national security.”China has lifted sanctions from six serving British MPs and peers, Starmer saysRead moreThe prime minister’s instincts are indicative of his broader approach to balancing the risks on this trip – one of the most significant of his time in office.After years of what Starmer has described asthe “ice age” in relations between the UK and China, it was intended to begin the thaw.But for all the potential offered by closer ties with the world’s second-biggest economy for a country desperate for growth, Beijing does not open the doors for nothing.While officials stress there was no political involvement,the UK’s decision to green-light the new Chinese mega-embassy in Londonsmoothed the way.After that, Starmer was given the full works: ceremonial welcome, military march-past, lavish banquet, praise from his host and, crucially , more than three hours of talks with President Xi Jinping.The prime minister appeared to be getting into the spirit. When Xi’s business secretary greeted him with a deep bow, Starmer looked quizzically at Peter Kyle, his British counterpart. Kyle managed a polite nod.While there weresome tangible gains from the trip– a visa waiver, cuts to whisky tariffs, investment in China by British firms – it was the 10 different agreements signed that will really make the difference.One British official described them as “jam tomorrow” deals. But the Chinese state is such a bureaucratic monolith that unless the man at the top is signed up, British businesses will struggle to get access to the market.So while some back home may have asked “was that it?”, in No 10’s view what mattered was the turning up – and a “more sophisticated” future relationship.1:24Starmer says progress made on tariffs and visa-free travel in Beijing talks – video“This trip is just the start,” Kyle told a reception at the British embassy on Thursday night.But a more sophisticated relationship means not just cosying up toChinafor the sake of our domestic economy – and ending up in a second “golden age” despite Beijing’s aggression.Before the trip, the prime minister promised he would raise “issues that need to be raised” – including the fate of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai and the persecuted Uyghur community.He did raise them, but whether that will have any effect has yet to be seen. There was one clear breakthrough:China lifted its sanctions on six serving British parliamentarians.While Starmer will be leaving China for the next leg of his trip on Saturday, he will feel that it is job done.Of course, deepening bilateral relations does not happen in a vacuum, as Donald Trump reminded the UK with his usual bluntness. Starmer’s attempts were“very dangerous”, he warned.It is the US president’s unreliability, however, that encourages “middle powers” such as Britain, France and Canada to consider their options. China spies an opportunity.But the biggest challenge for the prime minister waits back at home. While he is at his most comfortable – and some say most effective – on the international stage, it is not lost on his team that he is seen as the very opposite in the UK.While leadership speculation has abated while he has been out of the country, it has not gone away. When he returns to Westminster on Monday, his many political and policy problems await him.He has had a confidence boost in China, and is more intent than ever to keep calm and carry on. But he may not get long to do so.On Wednesday afternoon, as the British Airways plane carrying Starmer and his delegation began its descent into Beijing, a familiar voice came over the cabin’s public address system.It was the prime minister. “Sit back, enjoy the rest of the flight – I’ll be bringing the plane in from here,” he joked. It remains unclear whether he’ll be able to deliver a safe landing at home.Explore more on these topicsChinaKeir StarmerForeign policyTrade policyAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

The changes Minns is considering to avoid ‘unnecessary burden’ from demonstrationsRead moreIt follows a recommendation from a NSW sentencing council review released on Sunday, which was commissioned in April 2024 after a campaign by Your Reference Ain’t Relevant to remove good character references during sentencing for child sex offenders.Under NSW’s current laws, child sex offenders are subject to a “special rule”, meaning they cannot rely on good character or a lack of previous convictions during sentencing if the court decides those factors helped them commit the offence.The majority of the 16-person sentencing council, led by the retired supreme court judge Peter McClellan, called for the abolition of good character considerations for all offences, although two members provided dissenting opinions.The review said good character was “based on a vague and uncertain concept, lacks evidence in support of its value in predicting a risk of reoffending or prospects of rehabilitation, and engages an unjustified form of moral and social accounting”, adding it can have a re-traumatising effect and encourage victim blaming.Your Reference Ain’t Relevant cofounder Harrison James, a survivor of child sexual abuse, said the reforms would ensure “survivors’ lived trauma outweighs an offender’s social reputation”.“This is one of the most monumental shifts in how the courts approach sentencing,” he said.View image in fullscreen‘Victim survivors shouldn’t have to sit in court and hear the person who hurt them described as a good person,’ said Michael Daley, the NSW attorney general.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPUnder the changes, judges will still be able to consider evidence about someone’s prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending, as well as a lack of previous convictions, but the latter will no longer be used to demonstrate someone is of “good character”.The NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, said offenders will not be able to “use their reputations and social standing to commit serious crimes and then minimise their culpability”.“Victim survivors shouldn’t have to sit in court and hear the person who hurt them or their loved one described as a ‘good person’,” he said. The discussion of good character during a trial itself to establish an alleged offender’s credibility or the likelihood they committed an offence will remain.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMany survivors of sexual abuse wrote to the sentencing council in support of Your Reference Ain’t Relevant. One anonymous submission said that hearing the “good character” of a parent who had perpetrated sexual abuse referenced during the legal process was “deeply retraumatising”.“It sent the message that his reputation mattered more than the harm he caused me and my sisters he raped,” the submission said.The government said the reform also responds to concerns that good character evidence perpetuates social disadvantage. Submissions to the review said people who are well-connected, wealthy people or those from a privileged background had greater access to good character references. The Community Restorative Centre said “it is generally white, middle-class men who most benefit from prior good character considerations”.But others also advised against a change. The Aboriginal Legal Service recommended the government instead take steps to improve victim-survivors’ experience through procedural changes or support systems that don’t infringe “on the rights of the defendant or the judicial discretion of sentencing courts”.“We recognise the need to improve the experience of victim survivors in the court system, noting that processes are frequently not trauma-informed or culturally safe and can be distressing and retraumatising for many victim-survivors, particularly Aboriginal victim-survivors,” the legal service wrote.Two members of the sentencing council, barristers Felicity Graham and Richard Wilson SC, said they supported giving the court discretion to give good character no weight, but said removing the principle for all criminal offences was “reactive to populist demands for … a more severe approach to sentencing”.They rejected the idea good character was “synonymous with social privilege”, saying it encouraged rehabilitation, including in exceptional circumstances.“A person may have committed an offence in exceptional or pressured circumstances or whilst labouring under a momentary lapse in judgement,” they said.All federal, state and territory authorities currently consider good character, a centuries-old legal principle, during sentencing, although all apart from Western Australia have variations on the “special rule” for child sexual offences, which was endorsed in 2017 by the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.The ACT is moving to make character references irrelevant in all sentencing for sexual offences against children. Last year, Queensland legislated to remove good character offences for all sexual offences, following Tasmania in 2016.NSW introduced the “special rule” after a 2008 review by the sentencing council, but advocates have raised concerns about its efficacy, with Sunday’s review acknowledging concerns it was “difficult to apply, and when applied, it is often done inconsistently or problematically”.In 2023, Paul Frost, a Sydney swim coach convicted of grooming and sexually abusing 11 young students,received referencesfrom his mother, Lola Frost, and restaurateur John Fink, who described him as hard working, devoted and a “champion and a protector of young people and children of all ages”.Speaking outside court, Harrison James said he hoped Frost’s sentence – 24 years in prison before being eligible for parole – would set a precedent for others convicted of similar crimes.Additional reporting by Jordyn BeazleyIn Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact theKids Helplineon 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help atBlue Knot Foundationon 1300 657 380.

Most states regulate labour hire companies, which serve as intermediaries between farmers and seasonal workers, but NSW does not.Guardian Australia has reported onallegations of underpayment, poor living conditions and exploitation, particularly of workers who arrived on the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (Palm) scheme but left their employers, often allegedlyas a result of worker exploitation.Bitter fruit: the dark underside of the booming NSW blueberry industryRead moreFaehrmann’s bill aims to address the environmental impacts of intensive berry farming.“People move into these beautiful valleys for the lifestyle and the environment but then wake up one day and within months they are looking at an industrial-scale blueberry farm,” she said.“It beggars belief that you can erect hectares of poles [and] white netting without telling your neighbours or getting council approval, but people have to apply to put up a carport.”Faehrmann said there was a “deliberate massive carve-out” for the berry industry from planning laws that was “unfathomable”. She called on Labor to fix the problems, which she attributed to previous National party influence on policy.Faehrmann’s bill will call for mandated buffers between intensive horticulture farms and homes and waterways, as well as strict controls on spraying, runoff and irrigation and greater monitoring of produce for pesticides.She also wants to see councils given greater powers to regulate blueberry farms after the Coffs Harbour council lost in the NSW land and environment court last week.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe council had brought a case against two raspberry farmers at Bonville who had challenged a stop-work order that the council had imposed on their raspberry farm.The council said polytunnels under construction required development approval. The tunnels – constructed with metal tubing and hoops to create tunnels 2.5 metres high and up to 60 metres long – were farm buildings within their local environment plan (LEP) and required approval. The tunnels covered 4 hectares.The farmers said they were part of “intensive horticulture” which does not require a development application under the Coffs Harbour LEP.The court upheld the farmers’ case, agreeing that these were not farm buildings, because they could be disassembled and stored when not in use.“The legal prerequisites for the order do not exist,” the court said. “The appropriate course, if there were an ambition to require polytunnels and the like to be subject to development consent, would have been to make intensive plant agriculture a use permissible subject to development consent.”View image in fullscreenLocals are concerned that runoff from blueberry farms could affect the environment.Photograph: Zahn PithersThe chief executive of Berries Australia, Rachel Mackenzie, told Guardian Australia in October that the proposal for DAs was not supported by the planning department or the state government, and that “validates the industry’s position”.At Scotts Head, people are concerned about the proximity of new blueberry farms to waterways and South Beach national park. Blueberry farming is rapidly expanding beyond Coffs Harbour, where it began several decades ago, into the Nambucca Valley and the Kempsey area to the south, and west toward Grafton and Bellingen.“I have been in the area for a while and it’s just devastating when blueberry farms arrive,” Zahn Pithers, a local photographer said.“It devalues the land because no one wants to live next to a blueberry farm – except another blueberry farm.“We are losing farming families who have been here for generations. The blueberry investors come in and just lowball them because they know there aren’t any other buyers once there is a blueberry farm next door.”Pithers is particularly concerned about the proximity of a very large blueberry farm next to Warrell Creek and the South Beach national park and the beach.“People from Nambucca fish here and eat crabs out of the creek. Where does the spray drift go? What’s happening with the runoff? This farm is built on sand,” he said.Pithers has asked the EPA to investigate but there are no results as yet. Previous monitoring in the Nambucca Valley by the EPA detected three different pesticides in low levels in three creeks, suggesting water quality in the area was not being impacted by excessive amounts of pesticides.In November 2024, Nambucca Valley council asked the NSW planning department to include a requirement for blueberry farms to seek development approval as part of its LEP. The planning department rejected the requirement, saying it was not supported by sufficient evidence.View image in fullscreenA blueberry farm near Warrell Creek and Gaagal Wanggaan (South Beach) national park on the NSW mid north coast.Photograph: Zahn PithersThe council is nowworking on a second proposalfor the planning department, but is struggling to agree on whether issues like buffer zones should be left to self-regulation rather than mandated.The state minister for planning, Paul Scully, said it was open to councils to seek changes to their LEPs so they could require horticulture providers to seek development approval.The current standard LEP, developed by the state government, says that intensive agriculture in RU1 primary production and RU4 primary production small lots zones must be permitted without a development approval. However, councils can choose to regulate the RU2 rural landscape zone.“There’s no one-size-fits-all approach but requiring mandatory development applications across all rural zones would hinder efforts to reduce regulatory burdens and support modern farming practices across NSW,” Scully said.“Overly restrictive local planning controls may delay or prevent necessary farm upgrades, deter investment, and create uncertainty for landholders looking to modernise their operations.”Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsFarmingAustralian GreensnewsShareReuse this content"

Heatwave warnings remained in place for parts of every state and territory excluding Tasmania, with Canberra forecast to reach a top of 41C and parts of inland New South Wales, including Broken Hill, expected to climb higher than 45C.‘Air conditioners are struggling’: parts of NSW, Queensland and Victoria swelter as heat records tumbleRead moreMaximums peaked around 50C on Friday across the northern parts of South Australia and western NSW, including 49.8C at Marree and 50C at Andamooka near Roxby Downs – both record temperatures. It was the seventh day the temperature was above 46C in Marree.Ceduna climbed above 49C this week, while temperatures rose above 48C in Port Augusta, Port Pirie and Tarcoola.Top temperatures forecast for Saturday included 49C at Ivanhoe in western NSW, 48C at Wilcannia and 47C at Cobar. Mildura in Victoria was forecast to reach 45C, while further north, Thargomindah in Queensland was expected to reach 46C.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailDean Narramore, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said inland parts of south-eastern Australia had suffered through record heat all week, with Saturday marking the final day of temperatures in the mid to high 40s.He said widespread rain and storms across tropical north Australia due to a monsoon low would bring cooler air to parts of Victoria and South Australia on Saturday, sweeping through the remainder of the country’s south-east on Sunday. Temperatures could tumble by as much as 15C.“Through inland areas, heat will really be the big story once again, where we see another day of temperatures in the mid to high 40s through south-western parts of Queensland,” he said.“Another very hot day is on the way on Saturday in northern South Australia, but it’ll be much cooler through southern South Australia thanks to those fresh and gusty south to south-easterly winds, with temperatures in the high 20s to low 30s.”In NSW, Narramore said temperatures would once again soar in the mid to high 40s in the west, with cooler conditions expected on the coast and thunderstorms in the south-east.Temperatures were expected to reach the mid 40s in Victoria’s north-west for the final day, with cooler conditions continuing along southern parts of the state.Twofires in Victoriawere not yet under control on Saturday, including at Carlisle River in the Otways and the Walwa bushfire on the NSW border. Both were at a watch and act level, with communities slowly returning to the area.On Sunday, Sydney was expected to reach a top of 29C, with showers and thunderstorms possible, while Canberra was forecast to drop down to 31C and Melbourne to reach a maximum of 19C with a few showers. Brisbane was forecast to reach 33C, while Adelaide was expected to reach 25C.Australia is experiencing its second major heatwave for January, off the back of another earlier in the month, which analysts said was made five times more likelydue to global heating.The climate crisis hasincreased the frequency and severityof extreme weather events, including heatwaves and bushfires.Hotter than average days and nights were expected to continue until April for much of the country, according to the latest long-range forecast.

From the dais of the blond-wood committee room in Brussels, he was clear: “If anyone thinks that theEuropean Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t.”And ifEuropewanted to supplant the US nuclear deterrent, existing spending commitments would have to double, he added – “so hey, good luck!”Armed by America: how Europe’s militaries depend on the US – a visual analysisRead moreHis comments left some MEPs fuming. The former Dutch prime minister – who provoked mockery when hecalled Donald Trump “Daddy”– had already irritated some deputies with his robust defence of the US president’s interest in the Arctic.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, chided Rutte a day later on social media: “Europeans can and must take charge of their own security. Eventhe United States agrees. It is the European pillar of Nato.”Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, suggested a different approach: “We must go for a ​European army,” he told reporters in Brussels this week, adding, “I’m very much aware that you don’t do that from one day to ​another”. Europe, he said, needed “all sort​s of deterrence – economic, political, security deterrence – in our hands”.But a European army has always raised more questions than answers. Is it an EU, or Europe-wide army? A brand-new forcecommanded from Brussels, or a souped-up version of existing structures?View image in fullscreenJoint forces of the Swedish, Finnish, Italian and French army conduct an amphibious assault demonstration during the Nordic Response 24 military exercise above the Arctic Circle in Norway last March.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesSophia Besch, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, observed: “To supporters, it is a very visionary goal, and then to critics it is the symbol of overreach – and it’s just vague enough that we never have to really discuss details.”Behind the discordant public tones, however, lies a consensus that Nato’s European members need to pull their weight.Natomust “become more European” to maintain its strength, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week. “Europe must step up,” she told a defence industry audience. “No great power in history has ever outsourced its survival and survived.”The Nato alliance last yearpledged to increase defence spending to 5% national incomeby 2035. The EU, which includes 23 Nato countries among its 27 members, has embarked on an€800bn defence spending plan. But after a longholiday from history, can Europe get its act together?“The Europeans are moving in the right direction and can do it,” Camille Grand, a former Nato assistant secretary-general, told the Guardian. “It is a matter of a sustained effort over a few years. It is a matter of buying and acquiring the right set of capabilities to reduce their dependency on the US,” said Grand, now secretary general of the Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association for Europe.Europe’s ability to stand on its own two feet does not have a precise launch date. “It is not as if we could say on the 1st of January 2030: the Europeans will be completely autonomous,” Grand said.View image in fullscreenItalian marines take up positions during the Nordic Response 24 military exercise in Norway.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesBut the date matters because policymakers, responding to warnings from the security services about a possible Russian attack, say Europe should have “credible deterrence” to put off potential invaders by 2030.From the point of view of military planners, 2030 is “tomorrow”, said Grand, but Europe could achieve “significant progress” by then in acquiring stronger capabilities across a swathe of “strategic enablers”.This refers to a mixed bag of critical capabilities where the US dominates, such as intelligence, satellites, long-range missiles, airlift and ballistic missile defence. Europe probably would not “tick every single box by 2030” but “we can achieve significant progress”, Grand said. Although, he added, it would also require an “honest conversation with the US” that Europe would need some American assets beyond 2030.But Trump’s threats over Greenland and hot-cold support for Ukraine that often tips into Russian talking points, have called into question Washington’s commitment in a crisis.Tobias Billström, a former foreign minister of Sweden who helped negotiate his country’sNato entry, retains confidence that the US would come to Europe’s aid if the collective defence clause, article 5, was triggered. He pointed out the US benefitted from Nato, citing the location and military capabilities of Arctic members, such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland.Billström, who now works for Nordic Air Defence, a startup developing low-cost drone interceptors, said Europe would have to be ready to defend itself for years to come. “Regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, Russia will be, graphically, where it is. It will be revanchistic. It will be set on hybrid actions. It wants to disrupt. It’s going to have a very, very clear incentive to be aggressive against us for a foreseeable future.”View image in fullscreenHDMS Knud Rasmussen of the Royal Danish Navy patrolling near Nuuk in Greenland on 15 January.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APNot everyone is so sure about US guarantees. Besch, the defence expert at the Carnegie centre in Washington, thinks trust has gone. “I don’t think that there is very much illusion among any European policymakers now that they can trust in US security guarantees.”Europe, she suggested, had to shake off decades-old habits about defining its defence interests. Europe’s capability planning – “what we buy and what we develop” – is derived from Nato’s regional capability plans, which still rely on a substantive contribution from the US, she said.“The risk of what I believe is happening right now, is that we’re all spending huge amounts of money and will not actually be much more independent from the US in 10 to 15 years’ time, because that money is not being spent in a coordinated and directed way to actually replace these US enablers.”Money alone is not the answer to Europe’s defence weakness, as illustrated by the troubled €100bn Franco-German fighter jet project,beset by disagreement and mistrust between the developers. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, indicated this week that the project could bescaled down to joint systems, without an aircraft. A fighter-jet system without a fighter jet would be an emblem of European defence for all the wrong reasons.Meanwhile, Europe has long struggled to join up its defence spending, meaning costly duplication and a mishmash of different systems that hinder effectiveness on the battlefield. EU countries, for instance, have provided 10 different types of howitzer capable of firing 155mm shells to Ukraine “creating serious logistical difficulties for Ukraine’s armed forces”, according to a report by the former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi. In another example of fragmentation, Draghi noted EU member states operated 12 different types of battle tanks, while the US used one.View image in fullscreenA full-size model of the New Generation fighter developed by France, Germany and Spain is presented at Paris-Le Bourget airport.Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Besch, the problem runs deeper than national industrial rivalries. “The key question here is who is Europe, what is Europe, and then what are we actually trying to do? … If our standard for success is to replace everything the US does now with European capabilities, militaries, enablers etc, we are bound to fail,” she said.Europe, she said, needed to figure out its own strategic interests, for instance a European version of nuclear deterrence or how to safeguard its interests in regions from the Arctic to the Pacific, which could mean “cheaper, faster” systems.“My fear is that we are still caught up in this conversation around ‘can we replace the US’, rather than trying to decide what are we actually trying to do without them.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeNatoTrump administrationEuropean UnionUS foreign policyAerospace industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A disinformation-laden film was even made about him.But 16 years after the death of his friend and lawyer Sergei Magnitskyat the hands of Putin’s regime, Browder is unrelenting in his fight for justice. It is an endeavour that, by his estimation, has cost Putin and his cronies billions of dollars already, viaasset freezes and sanctions. Hence the considerable risk to his safety.Browder has the restless intensity of a man who made his millions in post-SovietRussiaas the chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, yet took on the even tougher challenge of standing up to the Kremlin.On a recent visit to the World Economic Forum at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, he pursued chief executives, European leaders and US senators in his quest to impose even more financial pain on Putin and ultimately try to bring about the downfall of a murderous regime.Like many seasoned Russia watchers, he is sceptical that any of the drawn-outattempts to secure a peace dealacceptable to Moscow, Kyiv and Washington will be a success.Putin’s fate depends on the war, and Browder says the Russian president has no way out.“Putin has no ability to stop the war because he started the war as a war of distraction against his own incompetence. This is a war not because there’s any real problem withUkraine.“It’s because he needs to be at war so that there’s a foreign enemy and not people getting angry with him for a lousy life that he’s created for most Russian people. And so if he were to stop the war, he would lose power. And if he lost power, he’d end up getting killed.“And the Ukrainians can’t stop the war or can’t stop defending themselves because they understand they will die.“When they get occupied,Bucha is the model. The Ukrainians understand full well that the women will be raped, the men tortured and killed and the children kidnapped. So neither side has any capacity to stop.”Almost four years on, the intractable nature of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is clear for many of Europe’s leaders. The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, says Russia’s exhausted financial reserves, economic stagnation, surging inflation and high interest rates mean it is incapable of paying its soldiers when the war ends.Stubb told an audience at Davos: “I’m more worried about Russia’s unwillingness to end this war because they cannot afford to do so than about Russia’s capability to win this war. This war has been an utter strategic failure of President Putin.”Browder, who in 2012 succeeded in gettingsanctions imposed on Russians involved in Magnitsky’s death, has for several years been trying to convince Europe to divert more than $200bn (£146bn) of Russian assets that were frozen in 2022 towards Ukraine’s defence.But with progress on those frozen assets stalled because ofopposition primarily from Belgium,he has a new focus: refineries in India, China and Turkey. These plants process Russia’s oil, turning it into products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel, and keep dollars flowing into the Kremlin’s coffers.Browder reckons the eight refineries are collectively funnelling between $500m and $1bn a day to Russia by buying its crude oil, and is pushing for sanctions to be imposed on their owners.“It’s just the most straightforward, obvious thing I’ve ever seen. How does Putin afford this war? And it’s with the sale of crude oil. Who buys the crude oil? There’s three countries that are the main purchasers: China, India and Turkey.“If they stopped buying the Russian oil, the price that Russia would be able to get from their oil, considering that it would be the oil equivalent of blood diamonds, it would sell at some enormous discount. And then, I believe in six months’ time, Putin would be pretty much out of business.”Attention in recent weeks has focused on Russia’s shadow fleet oil tankers that transport its crude but whose ownership is often sheltered via opaque layers of ownership. Browder calls that a “really indirect” way of targeting Putin’s resources.“You can either go to the people who buy the oil and they don’t buy it, or you can go to the 200 ships that are transporting the oil and they don’t transport it. It’s easier to get the people.”There are some signs that some of the refineries are starting to act: Bloomberg reported recently that deliveries of Russian crude into India ports slumped in December to their lowest level in more than three years.Meanwhile, Browder has not given up on the frozen Russian sovereign assets, that are primarily held at Belgian depository Euroclear.Tortuous negotiations around transferring those assets to Ukraine to help fund the war ultimately hit a road block in the form of Belgium. Its prime minister, Bart De Wever, as well as thebosses of Euroclear, have faced personal threats. Europeagreed in December to lend Ukraine €90bn(£78bn) – although not secured against those assets – money that will start to arrive in April or May.De Wever insisted at Davos that sending those assets to Ukraine would be a bridge too far: “Europe is not at war with Russia. You cannot simply confiscate money. That is an act of war. You should not underestimate it – it has never happened in history.”But Browder argues Belgium’s leader is putting his personal safety above national interests, and that sending the money to Ukraine would be an extension of Europe’s current policy of handing their interest paid on those assets to Kyiv.“Regardless of all these 20-point peace plans, negotiations, the war’s not going to end,” he says. “And so we’re going to be sitting here a year from now. We’ll have burned through half of that loan and we’re going to need to be thinking about what happens next.“I’ve been at war with Putin for the last 15 years, I don’t feel good about it, but for my reasons, taking responsibility for the murder of one of my colleagues, I chose to go after them. This guy [De Wever] has infinitely greater resources.“So if I can handle it, so can he.”Explore more on these topicsOilRussiaOil and gas companiesUkraineEuropeCommoditiesEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Hungarian Roma organisations, NGOs and opposition politicians demanded that Lázár, a high-ranking ally of the rightwing populist prime minister,Viktor Orbán, apologise and resign. “He has crossed all boundaries,” said Péter Magyar, the leader of the largest opposition party, Tisza.Portugal’s far-right Chega party ordered to take down posters targeting Roma peopleRead moreThe scandal comes 10 weeks before an election that could cement or break the rule of Orbán’s Fidesz party, which came to power for the second time in 2010.“Fidesz is over, its mandate has expired permanently,” said Ádám Lakatos, an 18-year-old Roma activist and the organiser of Saturday’s protest.Independent polls show a stable lead for Tisza – a centre-right party founded in 2020 – ahead of Fidesz. Outrage over Lázár’s racist remarks could further alienate undecided voters from the governing party.Lázár has apologised, but refused to resign, and has recently appeared alongside Orbán at a party event. He didn’t respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.Roma communities, who have long been scapegoated by the government, experience worse living conditions, higher levels of poverty, and face lower life expectancy than the rest of the Hungarian population.“During its 16 years of rule, Fidesz has not created jobs, or supported [Roma] families,” said Szandi Minzári, a 37-year-old international policy expert with Roma heritage. Roma people are overrepresented in low-paying public jobs, which she said can be exploited by local politicians.Independent organisationshave raised concerns that these public work programs are being leveraged by officials for electoral gain.“Lázár’s resignation would be a positive move for Fidesz, helping recover some Roma support, and setting an example” said Bernadett Orbán (no relation to the PM), a 33-year-old activist. “But I don’t think he will resign.”Orbán, and her partner, Tamás Könyves, are not Roma, but will attend the protest on Saturday. “I feel it is my duty to speak up and stand up for the Roma community,” said Könyves, 51, who will give a speech at the event.Fidesz has faced increasing public anger in recent years. In 2024, the party president, Katalin Novák, resigned after mass demonstrations erupted over a decision to pardon a man convicted for covering up child sexual abuse claims at a state-run orphanage.There were also protests in 2025 after news of systemic abuse at a juvenile correctional centre. The opposition demanded resignations in Orbán’s government over inaction.“Fidesz’s actions have become unacceptable for Hungarians, forEuropeand for the entire world,” said Lakatos, who grew up in state care.Both of the main parties have increased their voting base in the past year, but as Tibor Závecz from Závecz Research Institute highlights, this growth primarily drew support from smaller parties, not the large swathe of undecided voters.“And it seems like Fidesz is taking the voters from the far right,” Závecz said. While anti-Roma speeches might gain the trust of these voters, they could alienate up to half a million hesitant voters.Balázs Böcskei, a political scientist and research director at the Idea Institute,says it is surprising that Fidesz’s campaign did not help the party gain much ground. He attributes this partly to a strong opposition, and partly to a series of “public policy failures” in “every sphere that is important to people today” he said, citing the economy, and welfare services.Explore more on these topicsHungaryProtestRoma, Gypsies and TravellersViktor OrbánEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But diplomatic sources said the UK is keen to discuss restarting negotiations on defence as soon as it can.Talks for the UK to join the EU’s €150bn (£130bn) Security Action forEurope(Safe) defence fund collapsed in November 2025 amid claims that the EU had set too high a price on entry to the programme.Starmer prepares for parliamentary battles over imminent EU ‘reset’ billRead moreFrance has denied it was responsible for the breakdown in talks, but diplomatic sources say tension remains between Paris and other member states, particularly Germany, where sources have said they want the UK to be involved in Safe “as soon as possible”.One European source said that France wanted to make the UK’s involvement in Safe conditional on London participating in a second defence programme agreed in December by EU leaders, who are providing a €90bn loan to Ukraine securitised against Russian frozen assets held in Belgium. Germany does not want any preconditions.Sources in Brussels have admitted that the failure to agree terms in November was “an embarrassment” given the EU and both sides had already declared the prospect of “enhanced cooperation” through Safe at the summit hosted by Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen in May last year.However, there is understood to be greater appetite for a deal on the UK to join a future round of Safe on all sides, especially since Donald Trump’s threats to take over Greenland and criticism of Nato.Speaking in Beijing on Friday, Starmer did not mention defence, but stressed that the UK wants to see a closer relationship in areas that go beyond what has already been agreed on trade.View image in fullscreenTalks for the UK to join the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe defence fund collapsed in November last year.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersPossible areas for future extra deals are chemicals and cars, which will be hit with tariffs from next year for non-electric vehicles. The UK is also negotiating the details of a youth mobility scheme, with Starmer seeking a cap on numbers and fixed duration for free travel.“I think we should not just follow through on what we’ve already agreed. I think the relationship with the EU and every summit should be iterative,” he said.“We should be seeking to go further. And I think there are other areas in the single market where we should look to see whether we can’t make more progress. That will depend on our discussions and what we think is in our national interest.“But what I’m indicating here is – I do think we can go further. And the place to look is the single market, rather than the customs union, which doesn’t now serve our purpose very well.”View image in fullscreenStella Creasy MP, chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said there was ‘growing recognition our future lies with restoring a strong working relationship’ with the EU.Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PAStarmer is facing pressure from within his own party for closer ties with the EU, especially since relations with the US have been chequered under Trump.Stella Creasy, Labour MP and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said: “There’s now a growing recognition our future lies with restoring a strong working relationship not just on defence but on national and economic security. That means everything should be on the table in talks with EU countries.”Šefčovič will meet Nick Thomas-Symonds on Monday for the annual meeting of the EU-UK Partnership Council, the body created to oversee the EU-UK post-Brexit agreement. Defence is not currently on the agenda, with the UK understood to be prioritising progress on food and drink.Šefčovič and EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis are also due to meet Rachel Reeves to discuss geoeconomics, and he will also have meetings with Peter Kyle, the business secretary.There may be further opportunities for the EU and UK to discuss defence at a political summit, convened by Marco Rubio to discuss critical minerals, in Washington on Wednesday, with the Foreign Office sending a minister.On the prospect of further cooperation on defence, one source close to the government said: “The UK government was prepared to pay a certain amount, but there was a huge gap between the parties.View image in fullscreenMaroš Šefčovič is due to meet Rachel Reeves for a political exchange on geoeconomic issues, and he will also have meetings with Peter Kyle.Photograph: Juan Pablo Pino/EPA“Europe needs the UK, so they thought this could all be revisited and fixed. And there was a political obstacle.“The UK government is open to a second go but clearly if the EU came back with the same kind of proposition, it would be the same answer. It was very much the French who were seen as pushing this unreasonable position.”It is understood that the EU had demanded that the UK contribute around €2bn to the fund, but that the British felt a contribution “in the hundreds of millions” was more appropriate.The fund is made up of money the European Commission raises on a credit markets, which is then lent to member states over 45 years, who can buy everything from ammunition to drones and missiles.The money is then offered via low-cost loans to help member states procure military equipment from within the EU and outside the EU including the UK and other countries, such as Canada.The aim of the fund was to enable the EU to quickly build up a defence capability, something given an extra urgency by the lack of support from Trump.The UK is not eligible to apply for a Safe loan, but if it joined the programme under third country rules, UK companies could tender for more procurement contracts to provide arms to the EU, boosting the British defence industry.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyEuropean UnionEuropeKeir StarmerTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

ICE is facing an intense backlash after its agents shot dead two US citizens in Minnesota this month.Capgemini admitted that its US subsidiary, Capgemini Group Solutions (CGS), had signed acontract with ICEin December but said it had not yet come into effect.The websiteObservatoire des Multinationales, a corporate watchdog, revealed that CGS had agreed a $4.8m deal with ICE’s Detention Compliance and Removals office for “investigation and personal background check services”. The document states that CGS will provide “skip tracing services for enforcement and removal operations” with bonuses of up to $365m for successfully identifying and localising foreigners.France’s armed forces minister, Catherine Vautrin, said: “The contracts of French groups deserve close scrutiny,” adding: “Respect for human rights is an issue.”Hadrien Clouet, an MP with the leftwing party La France Insoumise, said: “It’s time for France to accept its responsibilities. French private companies are collaborating with ICE. We do not accept this.”The economy minister Roland Lescure told the National Assembly he had urged Capgemini to “shed light in a highly transparent manner on its activities … and surely question the nature of these activities”.Capgemini, founded in 1967, has 350,000 employers around the world. Research ofpublicly available documentsshows it has 13 current contracts with ICE. One of these involves managing a hotline for victims of crimes committed by foreigners.A page on the company’s website, since removed, stated it was working “closely” with ICE’s deportation operations to reduce expulsion delays and costs. Observatoire des Multinationalespublished a screenshotin which Capgemini boasts of its role in “enforcement and removal operations” for ICE.It reads: “Capgemini leveraged supply chain best practices to help ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) become more efficient … the team from Capgemini is working closely with ERO to help it minimize the time required and the cost incurred to remove all removable illegal aliens from the US.”The CGT union at Capgemini has called for an immediate halt of all collaboration with ICE. “These partnerships are not only contrary to the values espoused by Capgemini but they make our group an active accomplice in serious human rights violations,” a union spokesperson said.In an email sent to Capgemini employees, the company executive Mathieu Dougados accepted that the ICE contract raised “legitimate questions” but said the Paris company had only recently become aware of the nature of the contract and was unable to obtain details of CGS’s technical operations “in accordance with US regulations”.“At this stage, the contract is not being executed because it is the subject of an appeal,” he wrote.Lescure said he had been in touch with Capgemini to express his concerns and told the company its explanations were “not good enough”. “I urge Capgemini to shed light in an extremely transparent manner on its activities and this policy, and to question the nature of these activities,” he said.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)FranceEuropeTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

He has threatened to intervene in Iran in the wake of a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.“Well, we can’t tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan – it could be worse, actually,” he said.Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreWashington has deployed a naval battle group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier off Iran’s shores, after Trump threatened to intervene in response to a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.The Qatari premier, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as foreign minister, held talks in Iran on Saturday to try to “de-escalate tensions in the region”, the kingdom’s foreign ministry said.At a meeting with Ali Larijani, head of Iran’s supreme national security council, he reiterated Qatar’s support for “all efforts aimed at reducing tensions … in the region”, the statement said.The announcements came with Washington’s naval battle group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier off Iran’s shores, after Trump threatened to intervene in the wake of a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.The arrival of the flotilla has raised fears of a direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies – notably Israel – in the event of an attack.But Trump has said he believes Iran will prefer to make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action – and Tehran has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missiles and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.“Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing,” said Larijani, a day after the Kremlin said Larijani held talks in Moscow with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Saturday said a broader conflict would hurt both Iran and the US.“The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought, and in no way seeks, war and it is firmly convinced that a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region,” he said in a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, according to the Iranian presidency.Iran’s army chief, Amir Hatami, had earlier warned the US and Israel against any attack, saying his forces were “at full defensive and military readiness” to respond.“If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime,” Hatami said, according to the official news agency IRNA.He said Iran’s nuclear technology and expertise “cannot be eliminated”.With tensions heightened, Iranian authorities rushed to deny that several incidents on Saturday were linked to any attack or sabotage, including an explosion in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas that local firefighters said was caused by a gas leak.On Friday, US Central Command said the Revolutionary Guards would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.In a statement, US Central Command warned Iran against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”.It drew criticism from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.“Operating off our shores, theUS militaryis now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf,” he wrote on X.EU designates Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisationRead moreThe US designated the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organisation in 2019,a move the European Union followed on Thursday, prompting angry reactions from Tehran.The US carried outstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sitesin June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe.Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living then erupted on 28 December, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on 8 and 9 January in what authorities called “riots” and blamed on the US and Israel.The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117.However, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 6,563 deaths, including 6,170 protesters and 124 children.On Saturday, Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations and “serve the people”.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

It indicated the death toll could rise as emergency responders searched for bodies.Another strike hit an apartment in Gaza City, killing three children and two women, while seven more people were killed when Israel bombed tents in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect damage to a tent hit by an Israeli strike in Khan Younis.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP“We found my three little nieces in the street. They say ‘ceasefire’ and all. What did those children do? What did we do?” Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three children killed in Gaza City, told Reuters.The Israeli military said the attacks were carried out in response to an incident on Friday when eight armed men came out of a tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza. The area is still under Israeli military control under the terms of the October ceasefire.Israel accepts health authorities’ Gaza death toll is broadly accurate, saying 70,000 have diedRead moreThe strikes occurred the day before aborder crossing is expected to openin Gaza’s southernmost city, a reminder that the death toll is still rising even as the ceasefire agreement inches forward.All of the territory’s border crossings have been closed since the start of the war, and Palestinians see the Rafah crossing with Egypt as a lifeline for the tens of thousands in need of treatment outside the territory because most of its medical infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli bombardment.Israel wants to ensure that more Palestinians leave Gaza than enter it, according to Reuters, which said Israel was aiming to allow only 150 Palestinians into Gaza through Rafah each day.Shifa hospital said the strike on Gaza City killed a mother, three children and one of their relatives on Saturday morning, while Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said a strike on a tent camp caused a fire, killing a father, his three children and three grandchildren.Gaza deaths graphicGaza’s health ministry has recorded more than 500 Palestinians deaths by Israeli fire since the start of the ceasefire on 10 October.Despite Israel’s frequent killing of Palestinians in violation of the ceasefire, the deal has moved to a crucial second phase. Some of the thorniest issues are contained in this phase, which requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Board of Peace organisation staffed by appointees of the US president, Donald Trump.A recent presentation in Davos by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is also involved in Trump’s Gaza project, showed the Trump administration’s plan for “developing Gaza”, complete with futuristic skyscrapers overlooking the Mediterranean.Most of Gaza has been levelled and basic infrastructure remains inoperable as a result of Israeli bombing over the past two years, which haskilled more than 70,000 Palestinians. Last year, aUN commission of inquiry found that Israel had committed a genocide in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The cache of documents also includes emails which indicateMountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace in September 2010, two years after he was convicted of soliciting girls as young as 14 for sex.What have we learned from the newly released Epstein files?Read moreLast year Suhas Subramanyam, a Democratic member of the oversight committee in the House of Representatives,askedMountbatten-Windsor to sit for a deposition as part of its investigation into how the US government handled the case against Epstein.Subramanyam said Mountbatten-Windsor “has been hiding from us, and I think he will continue to try to hide from people doing meaningful investigations of this matter”.Speaking after the release of the latest Epstein files, Starmer said: “Firstly, I have always approached this question with the victims of Epstein in mind. Epstein’s victims have to be the first priority. As for whether there should be an apology, that’s a matter for Andrew.“But yes, in terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that. You can’t be victim-centred if you’re not prepared to do that.”‘She needs to fix it’: Jeffrey Epstein’s plot to win redemption via Sarah FergusonRead moreThe documents suggest that, a month before the Buckingham Palace invite, Epstein had suggested he could arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clever, beautiful and trustworthy” Russian woman, who was 26. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to see the woman. He also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free” from house arrest.Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park later that year.In his calamitous Newsnight interview, broadcast in 2019, Mountbatten-Windsor claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in person in light of his conviction.However, the newly released emails suggest that the Hollywood publicist Peggy Siegal arranged a star-studded dinner in Mountbatten-Windsor’s honour at Epstein’s New York home during the trip. Siegal invited the film director Woody Allen and George Stephanopoulos, a talk show host and former senior aide to Bill Clinton.Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have continued to send Epstein intimate family pictures featuring his adult daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.In 2022,Mounbatten-Windsor paid a reported £12m settlement to the late Virginia Giuffre, who claimed she had been forced to have sex with him after she was trafficked by Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor made the payment without accepting liability and has always denied wrongdoing.However, he and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, have been ostracised from royal circles thanks to their decision to maintain friendships with Epstein after his first conviction. Epstein gave Ferguson £15,000 to pay off debts and she described him in an email as the “brother [she] always wished for”.Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019, while awaiting trial on fresh child sex abuse charges. The files also detail apparent correspondence between Mountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence in a US jail for child sex trafficking.They feature an email from Mountbatten-Windsor to Maxwell, written in 2005, about a proposed trip to the US. Mountbatten-Windsor wrote: “I am in your hands (literally) until Saturday/Sunday.” He signed off: “Love you A xxx.”The newly released documents contain a string of embarrassing revelations for prominent British figures.They show that Epstein sent £10,000 to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, the husband of Labour peer Peter Mandelson, in the year after his conviction. Emails suggest this was to fund an osteopathy course.They also reveal that Lord Mandelson requested to stay at one of Epstein’s properties while Epstein was serving his first jail term. The terms of Epstein’s sentence allowed him to work from his office during the day and return to jail each night.Mandelson said on Friday he had been “wrong” to continue his association with Epstein after his conviction. He added that he was “never culpable or complicit” in his crimes.He was sacked as the UK’s ambassador to the US last Septemberwhen it emerged he had sent supportive messages to Epstein after his offending had come to light.View image in fullscreenA photo of Richard Branson and Jeffrey Epstein released as part of the Epstein files.Photograph: US Department of Justice/PAThe files show that Richard Branson met Epstein in 2013, at the Virgin Group founder’s private Necker Island, and offered him advice on restoring his reputation in light of his 2008 conviction.In an email, Branson told Epstein: “Any time you’re in the area, would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!”“I think if Bill Gates was willing to say that you’ve been a brilliant advisor to him, that you slipped up many years ago by sleeping with a 17½-year-old woman and were punished for it,” Branson wrote.“You’ve more than learnt your lesson and have done nothing that’s against the law since and, yes, as a single man, you seem to have a penchant for women. But there’s nothing wrong with that.”A Virgin Group spokesperson said: “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event.“When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.“As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again.“Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever. Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.”Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The Labour party said the peer died on Friday night “peacefully and at home”.The former prime minister Tony Blair paid tribute to David Triesman as a “vital part of the New Labour movement”. Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, Angela Smith, described him as “respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit”.Triesman was the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers trade union and the general secretary of the Labour party before he joined Blair’s government in the House of Lords in 2004.He served as a Foreign Office minister and then later as undersecretary of state for innovation, universities and skills.Triesman was later Labour’s shadow minister for foreign affairs and also sat on several prominent select committees.Labour’s statement said: “He pursued a very active role in the House of Lords from 2004 until his death. And served as a lord in waiting to Queen Elizabeth II from 2004 to 2022.”The party added: “A passionate Spurs fan, Lord Triesman became the first patron of theTottenham HotspurFoundation and the first independent chair of the FA (Football Association) from which platform he advocated intensely against racism in football and for the increased centrality of the women’s football.“He later played an important role in the exposing of corruption within Fifa.”In 2010, heresigned as FA chairafter being secretly recorded making bribery allegations about rival countries’ attempts to host the men’s World Cup.Blair, prime minister from 1997 until 2007, said in a statement: “David was a vital part of the New Labour movement and became in time a great friend.“Passionate about the cause, whether the Labour party or football, he was deeply committed to making change to improve people’s lives.“Unwavering in his loyalty and dedication, he was someone both liked and admired by those who had the privilege of working with him.“He was a gentle, genuine, good guy who put others before himself naturally and without hesitation. My profound condolences to Lucy and all his family.”Lady Smith said: “As a Labour peer, David was respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit.“He was great company with a wide circle of friends who shared lively conversations on his many interests and enthusiasms, particularly, but not exclusively, politics and football.“David bore his illness with amazing courage and even in the last weeks of his life he was engaging company. He will be sadly missed by all who knew him, but we are proud to have had his friendship.”Hollie Ridley, Labour’s general secretary, also paid tribute to her predecessor.She said: “Far too few general secretaries have had the privilege of serving the Labour party and the country while Labour is in power – and the work David did while in that role helped to ensure our campaign machinery had the solid foundations needed to help us go on to win that third term in government.“His commitment to public service was admirable and he will be much missed by those who he worked so closely with.”Triesman is survived by his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Ilona.Explore more on these topicsLabourThe FATottenham HotspurFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That tells you everything about the politics they intend to inject into this byelection, the politics of poisonous division, so we can see exactly where that’s going.“So we are the only contender. So it’s Labour versus Reform, and we will fight for renewal, for inclusive communities and bringing people together, and for true patriotism against the plastic patriotism of Reform. But only Labour can beat Reform, and therefore it’s the only way to win this byelection.”The prime minister did not say whether he would be campaigning in the seat. Labour is vying with theGreen partyto attract progressive votes to beat Reform.The Greens selected Hannah Spencer, a Manchester plumber who is a councillor in Trafford, on Friday. The party’s leader, Zack Polanski, was campaigning in Levenshulme, in the south of the constituency, on Saturday.In a post on Facebook, Polanski said: “What a turning point we can make happen for our country!”Reform has selected Goodwin, a former academicwho is now a hard-right activistand GB News presenter.On Saturday Stogia was chosen to fight the seat for Labour after a hustings event and vote by local members at the Jain community centre in Levenshulme.Stogia beat Eamonn O’Brien, the leader of Bury council inGreater Manchester, who had been said to be the favourite of No 10. Labour insiders said the contest was closely fought, but Stogia was seen as the more local candidate. She is a ward councillor in nearby Whalley Range, also in south Manchester.Labour’s deputy leader,Lucy Powell, said: “I’m absolutely thrilled that my good friend Angeliki Stogia has been selected as Labour’s candidate today. She’s a local girl, she’s Mancunian, she’s up for it.“She’s been delivering for people in this area for a long time, and that’s what we’re going to be going out on the doorsteps to say to people.”Stogia said she was “absolutely thrilled and excited” to have been chosen as Labour’s candidate.“I am a proud Mancunian woman,” she said. “I have walked the streets of this constituency. This is about Manchester. Manchester is a city united, we are rejecting division. I am so looking forward to going out on the doorstep and winning this for Labour.“I am so excited that I got selected, and I am raring to go,” she added. “We’ve got a right fight on our hands, but we’ve got the people with us, and we will win this.”The byelection was triggered bythe resignation of the former Labour MP Andrew Gwynnebecause of ill health.Gwynne remains under a parliamentary standards investigation into a scandal involving a WhatsApp group, called Trigger Me Timbers, that shared inflammatory comments about constituents, local party members and other MPs, which led to him being suspended by Labour.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Lucy Powell, deputy leader of the Labour party, Angeliki Stogia and Anna Turley, chair of the Labour party, in Denton.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAPowell told activists that the Labour brand is resilient, and mentionedAndy Burnham, the mayor of the region who was turned down to be a candidate.She said: “The Greens aren’t being entirely straight with people about this. They’ve got no councillors in this constituency at all, they’ve got no real base here at all.‘Quietly, subtly, the outsider’: Andy Burnham’s dress sense decodedRead more“You might look at the national polls, but here in Manchester, the Labour brand is particularly strong and resilient, and in Denton as well, because of what Andy [Burnham]’s been doing, with better buses, more housing, more skills, opportunities for people. But also we’ve got a really good Labour council here.“So we’ve got a very strong, resilient brand and we’ve spoken to over 15,000 people in a week,” she added. “We know that this race is between us and Reform. The Greens aren’t really in this race at all, and they’re not being straight with people about that.”Labour’s chief whip, Jonathan Reynolds, said there was “no complacency” about the scale of the challenge, and that the party was ready to defend the seat.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner attended the announcement at the Jain community centre in Denton.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAHe said: “It is definitely a Reform-Labour head-to-head. I don’t say that to disrespect any other political party, but I think the sense is, had the Greens really thought they were in it, Polanski would have been the candidate.”Labour’s candidate selection came amid a high-profile row after Burnham, who wanted to surrender the mayoralty of Greater Manchester to contest the seat for Labour,was denied the chanceby the national executive committee.The briefing war has continued, with a cabinet member telling the Times: “He’s been handed everything on a plate for his whole career. He’s now angry because people won’t make way for his second coming. It’s typical Andy.”The latest remarks prompted the mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotheram, to defend Burnham, saying: “These gutless people hide behind the cloak of anonymity, just like the keyboard warriors they rail against. These anonymous attacks help nobody but our opponents. For the sake of our party, please, just stop.”On Saturday night, Burnham congratulated Stogia and said she would do “a great job”.

End Israel’s occupation of Gaza & West Bank.”He called his arrest an “attack on free speech” and said police claimed the word intifada was unlawful. He was taken to Sutton police station in southLondon.In a statement released by the Peter Tatchell Foundation, the 74-year-old, who is one of the country’s best known gay rights campaigners, said his arrest was “part of a dangerous trend to increasingly restrict and criminalise peaceful protests”.“The Arab word intifada means uprising, rebellion or resistance against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. It does not mean violence and is not antisemitic. It is against the Israeli regime and its war crimes, not against Jewish people.View image in fullscreenHuman rights activist Peter Tatchell, photographed in his London flat in 2016 surrounded by memorabilia from his numerous campaigns and protests.Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer“By ‘non-violent resistance’ I was advocating boycott, sanction and divestment – the same tactics that helped bring down the apartheid regime in South Africa. ‘Globalise the intifada’ means create a worldwide campaign like the anti-apartheid movement.“The police are totally wrong to conflate support for Palestinian resistance to oppression with hatred and attacks on Jews,” he said.In December, theMetropolitan policesaid that protesters who chanted “globalise the intifada” would now be arrested because the “context has changed” after the Bondi Beach terror attack in Sydney.On Saturday afternoon, the force said: “Officers policing the Palestine Coalition protest have arrested a 74-year-old man on suspicion of a public order offence. He was seen carrying a sign including the words ‘globalise the intifada’.”The Metropolitan police said there were 13 arrests from the Palestine Coalition protest and one from the Stop the Hate counter demonstration.Tatchell said three people “were charged with this new ‘crime’ of expressing support for an intifada against Israel’s war crimes and genocide” at a London rally last month.“I have a long history of defending Jewish people against the antisemitism of the far right and Islamist extremism. I joined the March AgainstAntisemitism, with the chief rabbi and thousands of Jewish people, on 26 November 2023, just after the 7 October massacre,” he said.Last May,Tatchell was arrested by policefor holding a placard that read: “Stop Israel genocide! Stop Hamas executions! Odai Al-Rubai, aged 22, executed by Hamas! RIP!” for a racially and religiously aggravated offence. He said he is taking legal action against the Met over this arrest.“My placard did not mention anyone’s race or religion. The police have since admitted that I was wrongly arrested and I am awaiting a settlement,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPeter TatchellIsrael-Gaza warProtestMetropolitan policeLondonPalestineAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

Chicago is leading the way as the first city to create infrastructure for holding ICE and CBP agents accountable for crimes against our communities”.The order comes as a federal judge order deniedMinnesota’s bidto temporarily block the immigration crackdown, rejecting an argument that the federal immigration crackdown in the state did not violate the 10th amendment of the constitution which limits federal power.Judge denies Minnesota’s request to end ICE surge in MinneapolisRead moreChicago’s move opens up a different avenue, and asserts power to investigate and prosecute the actions of federal law enforcement in the city. But federal authorities typically have the power to block local inquiries, and federal judges typically uphold federal authority over local, especially in matters relating to immigration.City officials drafted the measure in response to immigration operations that, according to the mayor’s office, have “violated constitutionally protected rights, destabilized communities, and provoked life-threatening confrontations while remaining insulated from local or civilian oversight”.The order allows Chicago police to ensure that any body-camera footage captured during an incident is preserved; seek to identify the federal supervisory officer on scene; and report any violation of state or local law by federal agents.Cook county’s state attorney office said it “remains committed to protecting public safety, ensuring accountability and upholding the rule of law alongside our law enforcement partners”.The directive comes as concerns in Chicago mount that ICE operations could ramp up in the city when operations begin to wind down in Minneapolis, as theTrump administrationhas indicated they will – subject to local cooperation.Johnson signed an executive order in October that sought to limit where federal agents can gather, declaring city-owned or controlled parking lots, vacant lots and garages as “ICE-free” zones.Last week, he called for a national civil rights movement in response to federal immigration actions.“This moment calls for boldness – not some sort of pragmatic pragmatism to a tyrant,” he said. “In fact, that’s how we got in this mess in the first place. It’s because we were too tepid. We nibbled around the edges as Democrats, and instead of fighting and standing up for the interests of working people, we capitulated to corporations and the ultra-rich.”US cities increasingly compelled to police abuses by immigration agentsRead moreHe added that his administration was looking for ways “not just to bring charges and investigation against the federal overreach, but how we can create a process that allows for prosecution of these individuals”.On Saturday, Donald Trump warned he wouldn’t send federal help to quell protests in “poorly run” Democratic cities unless they ask for help.“I have instructed Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, that under no circumstances are we going to participate in various poorly run Democrat Cities with regard to their Protests and/or Riots unless, and until, they ask us for help,”Trump posted on Truth Social.“We will, however, guard, and very powerfully so, any and all Federal Buildings that are being attacked by these highly paid Lunatics, Agitators, and Insurrectionists,” he added.Explore more on these topicsChicagoICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationIllinoisUS immigrationMinnesota ICE shootingsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The local sheriff told the local news outlet that the parade was immediately shut down.One person is in custody, officials told the outlet – and investigators are searching for a vehicle suspected to have been used for the shooting.The East Feliciana parish sheriff’s office, which oversees Clinton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.WBRZ reported that theLouisianastate police has taken over the investigation. Streets near the courthouse were reportedly blocked by state troopers and officials with the sheriff’s office.Clinton has a population of about 1,300 people. It is part of the metropolitan area surrounding Louisiana’s capital city, Baton Rouge.At the time of the bloodshed reported in Clinton on Saturday, there had been at least 24 mass shootings in the US so far in the year, according to the nonpartisanGun Violence Archive.The archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed.Constantly high rates of mass shootings in the US have led many to call on Congress to enact more meaningful gun control measures.

Searchers found a debris field near where the alert had been sent along with a body in the water and an empty life raft, the coast guard said.Crews covered about 1,000 sq miles (2,600 sq km) using multiple aircraft, cutters and small boats over a 24-hour period. However, after consultation among search-and-rescue mission coordinators and on-scene commanders, the coast guard announced Saturday that it had determined that all reasonable search efforts for the missing crewmembers had been exhausted.Officials said there wasn’t a mayday call from Lily Jean as it navigated the frigid Atlantic Ocean on its way home to Gloucester, Massachusetts, the US’s oldest fishing port. The coast guard was notified by the boat’s beacon that alerts when it hits the water.Maine’s ‘Lobster Lady’ who fished for nearly a century dies aged 105Read moreThe fate of the Lily Jean, owned by a beloved member of Gloucester’s historic fishing community, is the latest maritime tragedy to befall the US’s oldest seaport. The city that inspiredThe Perfect Stormis tied to its fishing heritage in a way that has brought 400 years of history and, sometimes, tragedy. That book and movie were inspired by the FV Andrea Gail, which went missing at sea in 1991.The Lily Jean; its captain, Gus Sanfilippo; and his crew were featured in a 2012 episode of the History Channel show Nor’Easter Men. Sanfilippo was described as a fifth-generation commercial fisher, fishing out of Gloucester in the Georges Bank. The crew is shown working in dangerous weather conditions for hours on end, spending as many as 10 days at sea on one trip fishing for haddock, lobster and flounder.The Republican state senator Bruce Tarr grew emotional as he talked about Sanfilippo, who was a good friend.“He’s a person that has a big smile, and he gives you a warm embrace when he sees you,” Tarr said. “He is very, very skilled at what he does.”Tarr said that the “fact that vessel now rests at the bottom of the ocean is very hard to understand”, given the captain’s experience.“This is a community that has felt this type of loss in the past,” Tarr said. “I’m going to make a prediction. Tonight, tomorrow and the days that follow, no matter what happens, you’re going to see the strength, strength that has made this the most historic fishing port in the United States.”At the time of the emergency alert, the National Weather Service said wind speeds out at sea were around 27mph (24 knots) with waves around 4ft high. It was 12F (-11C) with water temperatures of about 39F (4C).Deep-sea fishing in New England can always be hazardous, but it can be especially dangerous in the winter because of high waves, frigid temperatures and unpredictable weather. Commercial fishing is often cited as one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.Everett Sawyer, 55, a childhood friend of Sanfilippo, said that he was still processing the news of his disappearance. “He was hardworking. He loved fishing,” he said.After more than five decades living and working near the Atlantic Ocean, Sawyer said, he has known 25 people who were lost at sea. Cold-winter conditions can complicate operations even for experienced sailors, Sawyer said.“Things happen very quickly when you’re out on the ocean,” he said.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday it was aware that there was a fishery observer onboard the vessel. Fishery observers are workers who collect data onboard fishing boats for the government to use to inform regulations.Massachusetts’s governor, Maura Healey, said she was “heartbroken” to hear about the boat’s sinking.“Fishermen and fishing vessels are core to the history, economy and culture of Gloucester and Cape Ann, and this tragedy is felt all across the state,” she said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsMassachusettsFishing industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The release was an effort to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and, according to US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, includes more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, all subject to “extensive redactions”.In a letter to Congress, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and Blanche indicated that Friday’s document “marks the end” of the government’s efforts to comply with the law, drawing sharp condemnation fromDemocratsand the bill’s authors.Robert Garcia, the Democratic ranking member on the House oversight committee, which has taken a lead role in investigating the government’s handling of the files release, accused Bondi of breaking the law.Emails reportedly show Epstein scouted women for New York Giants co-owner Steve TischRead more“Donald Trump and his Department of Justice have now made it clear that they intend to withhold roughly 50% of the Epstein files, while claiming to have fully complied with the law. This is outrageous and incredibly concerning,” Garcia said in a statement. “The oversight committee subpoena directs Pam Bondi to release all the files to the committee, while protecting survivors.”He added: “We are demanding the names of Epstein’s co-conspirators and the men and pedophiles who abused women and girls. We will begin a thorough review of this latest limited production, but let’s be clear: our work and investigation are just getting started.”In a joint statement, a group of 20 Epstein survivors said the document once again shields powerful figures while exposing victims to renewed harm.“This latest release ofJeffrey Epsteinfiles is being sold as transparency, but what it actually does is expose survivors,” they said in the statement. “As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and re-traumatized while Epstein’s enablers continue to benefit from secrecy.”They continued: “Once again, survivors are having their names and identifying information exposed, while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected. That is outrageous.”The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “The law required all the Epstein files to be released on December 19, 2025. For 43 days, the justice department delayed release, cherrypicked documents – many were heavily redacted – all to obscure the truth and delay justice for the survivors.“Until yesterday, the justice department admitted to having released less than 1% of all documents. Now it’s saying the work is done. Americans are very dubious.“The American people want the complete truth on the Epstein files, not puffed-up statistics. AG Bondi thinks she can dupe the American people. But we see right through her lies. Stop the cover-up and follow the law.”The release came more than a month after a 19 December deadline set by the Republican-controlled Congress for the disclosures. The federal law mandating the release came after months of mounting political pressure requiring the justice department to release documents related to the Epstein investigation.While a review of the files – the largest batch of Epstein documents to be released to date – is still underway, the public disclosure has exposed previously unknown financial ties and social connections between Epstein and prominent figures in the US and UK, including oneback-and-forth email chainbetween Epstein and Elon Musk in 2012.On Friday, the bipartisan sponsors of the transparency law sent a formal letter to Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, demanding a meeting to review the un-redacted files, saying Congress cannot fulfill its oversight duties – or protect survivors – under the justice department’s current approach.“Congress cannot properly assess the department’s handling of the Epstein and Maxwell cases without access to the complete record,” Ro Khanna, a California Democratic representative, and Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican representative, wrote to Blanche, who was previously Trump’s personal lawyer.Trump commerce secretary Howard Lutnick arranged to visit Epstein island, files showRead moreIn a separate statement on Friday, Khanna said the partial release raises fundamental questions about DoJ’s compliance.“The DoJ said it identified over 6m potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5m after review and redactions,” he said. “This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld.”Khanna said he would be watching closely for the release of specific materials he has long sought, including the FBI’s victim interview statements, a draft indictment and prosecution memo from the 2007 Florida investigation and extensive emails and files from Epstein’s computers.“Failing to release these files only shields the powerful individuals who were involved and hurts the public’s trust in our institutions,” he said.The justice department has argued that privacy protections, legal sensitivities and the sheer volume of material justify its approach. But critics say the law was designed to prevent selective disclosure – and the latest release has deepened concerns that survivors are paying the price for secrecy surrounding Epstein’s powerful associates.Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund and an Obama-era ethics lawyer, assailed the justice department for what he said was a “failure to fully release all eligible files relating to the Epstein investigation”.“They are trying to sell this as full compliance and the ‘complete’ Epstein record,” Eisen said. “But everything about their rollout signals the same old playbook: heavy redactions, selective disclosure and a public-facing archive that does not reliably reflect what the government actually has.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationDonald TrumpPam BondiUS politicsUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Weeks of growing national anger over deadlyimmigrationcrackdowns in the US have highlighted how much has changed.Publicly, the US’s top CEOs have stayed – mostly – quiet during Trump’s second term, even as his administration has undermined free trade policies, cracked down on the immigration that many businesses relied on, and attacked the Federal Reserve – a pillar of the US’s financial hegemony.But the administration’s brutal handling of its immigration raids in Minnesota and thekilling of Alex Prettiin Minneapolis have tested the reticence of the corporate class to its limits, highlighting their lack of leadership amid growing public anger.A day after federal agents pinned down and shot protester Pretti, 37, to death on 24 January, a group of 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies including Target, Best Buy, 3M and General Mills released a group statement calling for the “immediate de-escalation of tension” and for law enforcement agencies “to work together to find real solutions”.“The recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life,” the statement read, which came afterRenee Good, an unarmed woman, was also killed by federal agents in Minneapolis.A separate statement from Michael Fiddelke, incoming CEO of Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, also did not mention Pretti, Good or the actions of federal law enforcement. “What’s happening affects us not just as a company, but as people, as neighbors, friends and family members within Target,” Fiddelkesaid.The statements ended up producing abacklashagainst what many saw as a response too soft given the circumstances. People pointed out that neither Pretti nor Good were mentioned by name.At least eightpeople have either been killed by federal agents or died while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2026 so far.The pressure to say something is mounting, but the US’s CEOs have so far failed to rise to the moment. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who on Saturday attended a VIP screening of the Melania Trump documentary at the White House,saidhe was “heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis” and that it was “time for de-escalation” in an internal message to Apple’s workforce. Apple’s workers are reportedly “livid” about Cook’s attendance at the screening.“De-escalation” has become the go-to safe word for US CEOs, according to an analysis bythe Wall Street Journal. In the meantime, protesters are organizingstrikesand businessboycotts.Historically, American corporations have been careful to stay out of politics as best as they can, framing themselves as friendly and neutral to all. But as American politics have become more divisive over the last decade, corporations have found themselves caught in a tightening bind. Whether they respond or not, there will be consequences.“There’s no good decision. That’s the kind of era that we’re in right now,” said Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern business school.In the last few years, corporations have gone from fearing liberal consumer backlash to anxieties about conservative boycotts. Now, many companies’ biggest concern is being targeted by theTrump administration.“The risks are really not theoretical – they’re real,” Taylor said. “The administration is using a mix of public shaming and litigation. Are you going to be exempt from tariffs, or is your industry going to be subject to tariffs? Are we going to favor your competitors? There’s a lot of economic levers the administration is using.”Trump has made clear he’s unafraid to use his vast executive powers against his enemies or anyone he deems to be too “woke”.Many corporate executives have done their best to maintain friendly ties. Trump made sure the most powerful tech CEOs, including Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman, were in attendance at hisinaugurationlast year. Paramount and Disney, owners of CBS News and ABC News, respectively, paid out millions of dollars to settle defamation lawsuits, and Meta paid $25m to the president over its decision to deplatform Trump after the January 6 insurrection. Amazon recently paid $30m to Melania Trump to acquire thedocumentaryabout her life.“The government’s voice has become hugely amplified on a state and federal level to the point where, when Paramount and Netflix are talking about acquiring Warner Bros, the headlines are: ‘Does Netflix have a White House problem?’,” said Elizabeth Doty, executive director of Third Side Strategies, a thinktank and advisory firm that helps companies with public affairs. Doty said there’s been a high-level shift toward “allegiances and loyalties, rather than rules and entrepreneurial competition” in Trump’s second term.The responses from corporate America today are dramatically different from in the 2010s and early 2020s, an era when companies were trying to align themselves with liberal causes like Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ rights and climate activism.When Donald Trump said there were “some very fine people on both sides” in the aftermath of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally in 2017, CEOs started to publiclydistance themselvesfrom the president. As climate activism became more prominent, companies promised to pivot to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments.After George Floyd’s murder, also in Minneapolis, social media was flooded with corporations making statements in support of Black Lives Matter. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was photographedtaking the kneein front of a bank vault. Companies flowed right along the tide of the racial reckoning, promising billions of dollars of investment into ensuring diversity and inclusion.The corporate backlash against the January 6 insurrection was also swift and pronounced, with some companies announcing they wouldtemporarily haltpolitical donations and spending after the riot.But even before Trump was reelected, the tides were starting to turn. The conservative movement against “woke” politics, including state laws banning diversity, equity and inclusioninitiatives, started to take hold.Conservative boycottson social media fueled backlashes against products and companies like Bud Light and Target. Companiesquietly droppedthe diversity teams they formed after George Floyd.And when Trump started his second term, he reentered the White House with a vengeance that has shaken many corporations.“Corporations or brands felt like they were trapped between the left wing and the right wing,” Taylor said. “The problem then was perceived to be polarization. Today, we’ve still got polarization, but it’s more about retaliation from the regime … and how we manage backlash from the government, versus backlash from the general public.”Last week, Trump, through his personal lawyer,filed a lawsuitagainst JPMorgan and Dimon for “debanking” him after the US Capitol insurrection. The lawsuit came quickly after Dimon spoke up in defense of US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump’s justice department put under criminal investigation. Dimon said that chipping away at Fed independence “is not a good idea”, to which Trump quickly responded: “It’s fine what I’m doing.”But the calculus for speaking out against issues like what’s happening in Minnesota isn’t just mitigating “woke” consumers and employees and a threatening federal government, Doty said. Even more is at risk when key institutions and principles are kicked away without consequences or criticism.“Due process, rule of law, civic spaces and adherence to the constitution – all of those are essential to the environment [corporations] need,” Doty said. “The bigger choice right now is, are we going to be an economy based on loyalties and allegiances, or [one] based on institutions?”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsMinnesota ICE shootingsUS immigrationDonald TrumpTim CookTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

The president found a man to lead the central bank who would “provide exactly that type of leadership”, he declared.“He’s strong, he’s committed and he’s smart.”This is not how Trump described Kevin Warsh, the former Fed governor whom he unveiled as his new nominee to chair the central bank on Friday – but how he hailedJerome Powell, the current Fed chair, when nominating him for the job about eight years ago.“If he’s confirmed by the Senate, Jay will put his considerable talents and experience to work leading our nation’s independent central bank,” Trumpsaidas the November sun shone down on him in the White House Rose Garden in 2017.Trump nominates Federal Reserve critic Kevin Warsh as its next chairRead moreTrump has long stopped praising Powell. After refusing to bow to Trump’s demands for drastic interest rate cuts, he is now “a moron”, “stupid”, and “incompetent”, according to the president. “There’s something wrong with him,” Trumpclaimedin November. “I’ll be honest, I’d love to fire his ass.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve building in Washington DC on 24 July 2025.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/ReutersPowell, whose second term as Fed chair is due to expire in May, has refused to give Trump the loyalty he requires of every other leader in the executive branch. And while the president has been able to fire the vast majority of officials who he sees as disloyal, the Fed has so far proven out of his reach.Courtsand Wall Street have moved to defend the central bank’s longstanding independence from political interference.With Warsh, Trump believes he’s struck a balance. Global markets were broadly steady after the announcement, which was welcomed by figures in the central banking establishment, like Mark Carney, former governor of the banks of England and Canada – and the president seems confident he has tapped a Fed chair who will prove loyal.“I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” Trump said in a social media post Friday. “On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting,’ and he will never let you down.”Warsh has a reputation for being “hawkish”, meaning he takes a more conservative approach to monetary policy. Fed hawks typically are sensitive about inflation, encouraging high interest rates – which tame price increases – even when it could lead to more unemployment.When Warsh was a Fed governor, he often focused on rising inflation, even as the labor market was in freefall. But over the last year, as Trump openly considered who should replace Powell at the top of the central bank, Warsh publicly made arguments that were more in line with the president’s demands for rate cuts.In a Wall Street Journalop-edin November, he praised Trump’s “pro-growth policies” and argued (just like the president has) that the Fed had held back the economy with high rates.Some have voiced skepticism that Warsh will remain dove-ish on inflation, and maintain his belief that rates should be lower, once he walks back through the doors of the Fed. “His dovishness today stems from convenience,” researchers at Renaissance Macro Research said on Friday. “The president risks getting duped.”Warsh’s nomination does not guarantee him the job. He still requires confirmation by the US Senate – and the support of key figures in Congress who have grown alarmed by the administration’s treatment of the current Fed chair.Trump unveiled Warsh as his pick two weeks after the White House has faced widespread backlash when it emerged the Department of Justice had launched acriminal investigationinto Powell. Republican senator Thom Tillismade clearon Friday that, though he supports Warsh as nominee, he will block his confirmation until the investigation is resolved.And even if Warsh is confirmed, chairing the Fed is tantamount to walking a delicate tightrope.The US central bank depends on the credibility of its independence. This credibility could be damaged if its leader even appears to prioritize pleasing the president over steady guidance of the world’s largest economy.US interest rates since 2019There are built-in protections to insulate the Fed from politics. Its chair doesn’t decide on interest rates alone: any change requires a consensus among the 12 voting members of the rate-setting Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC).Seven of FOMC’s voting members are Fed governors who serve out 14-year terms. And while Trump has tried to kick out Lisa Cook, one of those governors, the US supreme court seemsprepared to protecther from the president’s wrath.Powell’s term as chair is set to end in May, but his term as a Fed governor is not up until 2028. While most chairs usually step down from the board after their term as chair concludes, Powell has so far refused to comment on whether he will stay on.That staying on even remains a possibility for Powellpoints tothe unspoken uncertainty surrounding the end of his term.At a press conference earlier this week, after the Fedagain declined to cut rates, Powellrefusedto answer any questions about Trump, the justice department’s investigation, or his possible successor. “I have nothing for you on that,” he repeatedly told assembled reporters.But one thing he was willing to speak on, at length, was the importance of the Fed’s independence. Should it ever be used to sway elections, Powell cautioned: “It would be hard to restore the credibility of the institution.“If people lose their faith that we’re making decisions only on the basis of our assessment of what’s best for everyone … it’s going to be hard to retain it,” he said. “We haven’t lost it, I don’t believe we will. I certainly hope we won’t.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

He might have been talking aboutChinaas well.Not a week earlier, Beijing had revealed that China’s trade surplus ballooned by 20% in 2025, to $1.2tn. DespiteDonald Trump’s wall of tariffs that crashed Chinese sales to the US, its overall exports expanded more than 5%. Sales to the 11 countries in Asia’s Asean bloc increased more than 13%. Exports to the European Union rose over 8%. Chinese imports, by contrast, were flat.This gargantuan imbalance is strangling manufacturers from rich countries in Europe to poorer nations in Asia and Latin America. As Eswar Prassad, a former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund, now at Cornell University,pointed out: “Forget Trump’s Tariffs. The Real Danger Lies in China’s Trade Surplus.”The wave of Chinese exports should remind us that the United States’ turn against the global order it did so much to build did not happen in a vacuum. The US commitment to globalization and liberal democracy blew up under the strain imposed by China’s export-led economic surge.Canada PM hails strategic partnership with China to adapt to ‘new global realities’Read moreAmerica’s fragility is not China’s responsibility. But Beijing must understand that its strategy is putting enormous stress on international economic institutions. If it wants to preserve any semblance of the global trading order upon which it built its wealth and power, it must reconsider mercantilistic policies that are mopping up global demand in the service of Chinese jobs, undercutting other countries’ shot at prosperity.Many factors contributed to the implosion of American governance. But Trump’s rise was largely propelled by a sense of grievance against a world order that, Americans believed, had taken the US for a ride.America’s pain was largely self-inflicted. Manufacturing’s footprint shrunk in Germany over the last quarter century, like it did in the US. It shrunk in the UK and France, Italy and Japan. While those shifts have caused domestic political disruptions, in none of these other countries did voters try to punish the rest of the world for the loss, as Trump has.The “China shock” – the wave of imports from China following its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 – played a big role in twisting America’s politics, delivering a blow to manufacturing in many regions of the United States which have yet to recover, providing Maga fertile ground in which to grow.But Americans’ exceptional fury arose largely because the US failed to build the social infrastructure deployed in other affluent countries to manage these industrial disruptions and mitigate the downsides of increased globalization and technological change. Even as the US got extremely rich from the globalized economy, ordinary Americans fumed about beingleft behind.China, however, would be making a huge mistake if it were to conclude that its policies had no part in setting off convulsions across the global economy.China’s overbearing exports are changing minds about the benefits of open tradewell beyond the United States. The World Trade Organization (WTO) reports more than 300 antidumping investigations since 2020 by low- and middle-income countries against Chinese exports, from steel and cutlery to footwear and washing machines.Late last year, Mexico imposed tariffs of up to 50% on Chinese goods. India raised tariffs on steel imports to stem a surge in imports, largely from China. And China’s export wave is a big part of the reason that the European Union now agrees with the US that the WTO no longer works.“We urgently need a new system of global trade governance fit for the 21st century,” Maroš Šefčovič, the EU commissioner for trade, wrote as the meetings in Davos got under way. In particular, he noted that it may be time to jettison the WTO’s bedrock “most favored nation” rule, which ensures that tariff reductions offered to one trading partner must in most cases be offered to all.The principle was embraced in the heyday of globalization, when the overriding goal of trade negotiations was to expand global trade. It responded to the concern that a spaghetti bowl of differential tariffs might distort investment, encouraging firms to invest based on a country’s tariff portfolio rather than its natural and human endowments, undercutting global prosperity.And yet the sense that China does not play fairly – undervaluing its currency and providing state support to exporting firms in the form of subsidized credit and other incentives, even as it keeps its own domestic market largely closed to imports – is nurturing a consensus that countries need new tools to protect themselves from China’s overbearing tactics.“A single country’s manufacturing production exceeds that of the nine next-largest manufacturing countries combined,” noted the United States in acommunication to the WTOabout ways to reform the organization. “These imbalances and policies present the greatest threat to a global economy of fair and reciprocal trade.”Šefčovič largely agreed. “Access to lower tariffs cannot be unconditional,” he wrote. “It must be earned through stronger, credible commitments to the core principles of free and fair trade.”The world needs an engaged China. As the US turns its back on international law and institutions, the world’s second-largest economy could provide a valuable counterbalance to preserve the open trading system. Before traveling to Davos, Carney visited Beijing, where he and China’s president, Xi Jinping, signed anew strategic partnership. Last October, China expanded itsfree trade agreementwith the Asean bloc. South Korea and China have traded state visits.But preserving a liberal trading regime requires China to do much more than define itself as a reasonable nation, in contrast with a United States that went off the rails. From steel to cars, it is producing stuff way beyond the world’s capacity to absorb. Beijing’s argument that its purchases of raw materials are producing prosperity across the global south, even as its exports overwhelm developing countries’ manufacturing industries, is unlikely to build support for China’s leadership in the global economy.Sticking to its export-led strategy does not even serve China well.Business investmentis hitting diminishing returns, requiring more capital to generate each additional job. And this is delivering scant prosperity to ordinary Chinese. China’shousehold spendingamounts toonly 40% of GDP, compared with 60% across the nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Trump is offering Beijing an unparalleled opportunity, opening space for China to become a global leader as the US retreats into itself, the steward of an alternative trading system. But by sticking to its guns China will, instead, validate the US turn against the global economy, and continue to erode faith in a trading system by which it has done remarkably well.Explore more on these topicsUS economyChinaDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

But with a certain inevitability and a devastating, gamechanging performance, theLiverpoolstriker haunted Eddie Howe and the club who coveted him all the same.Pain came in various forms for Newcastle. Superior for 40 minutes and deservedly ahead through Anthony Gordon, the visitors trailed at the interval thanks to a quick-fire brace from the player they tried to sign from Eintracht Frankfurt. Liverpool swept in for Ekitiké instead and their initial £69m outlay, rising to £79m, is proving money very well spent.Konaté offered to make early Liverpool return after father’s death, Slot revealsRead moreThe 23-year-old reminded Newcastle fans of the scoreline when he left the fray at 3-1 and, when Ekitiké reached the Liverpool bench, there was Alexander Isak to congratulate him. Salt well and truly rubbed into gaping wounds. Florian Wirtz capped his own stylish display with a third before Ibrahima Konaté, playing for the first time since the death of his father, capitalised on another Newcastle mistake to score his first league goal at Anfield. The Liverpool defender dissolved into tears when the moment sunk in. Here was the consistency that Arne Slot has been searching for.After the 6-0 rout of Qarabag in midweek, another impressive and heavy win showed his appeal for improvement in both boxes is getting through to his players. This was the first time Liverpool had come from behind to win in thePremier Leagueat Anfield since the day they won the title against Tottenham last season. It was a recovery few saw coming when Gordon gave Newcastle a merited lead. Howe selected a forward line in Gordon, Anthony Elanga and Harvey Barnes designed to punish Liverpool with speed and on the counterattack.The visitors’ gameplan worked to perfection until, to their manager’s disbelief, they found themselves chasing the contest at a ground where Newcastle have not won since 1994. Liverpool initially struggled to find gaps in the visitors’ compact midfield trio or find space behind their defence. Mohamed Salah was presented with a clear route to goal when Newcastle lost possession while committed to attack and Dominik Szoboszlai pierced their back-line. Salah had a three-yard start on 35-year-old Kieran Trippier but was caught by the veteran full-back by the time he reached the Newcastle penalty area. Time marches on.The visitors, by contrast, attacked with pace and purpose. Virgil van Dijk had to be at his sharpest to prevent Gordon’s cross reaching an unmarked Barnes in front of the Liverpool goal and did well to block Dan Burn when a Barnes cross sailed just in front of Malick Thiaw and his fellow centre-half. Barnes also curled a free-kick against a post, with Alisson well beaten, after being tripped just outside the box by Ryan Gravenberch.View image in fullscreenIbrahima Konaté scored in his first game since his father’s death.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersNewcastle took the lead when Joe Willock surged down the left and found Barnes on the edge of the Liverpool area. Mac Allister challenged but inadvertently turned the ball into the path of Gordon, who pinged a low shot through the legs of Milos Kerkez and into Alisson’s right hand corner. It was the England international’s first Premier League goal from open play in 12 months and atoned for an early booking for a reckless foul on Alisson.Newcastle were in control, their approach delivering an accomplished away display, and then Ekitiké leapt on to centre stage and single-handedly wrestled the game away from them. The growing rapport between the France international and Wirtz engineered a swift equaliser when, after Gravenberch turned the ball into his path, the Germany international slalomed through the Newcastle defence and squared for Ekitiké to poke home.Liverpool 4-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – liveRead moreTwo minutes later the Liverpool striker collected a Kerkez ball in space and set off towards Nick Pope’s goal. For reasons best known to himself, Thiaw made no attempt to close down Ekitiké and invited the in-form forward to shoot for the far post. Ekitiké obliged in style for his 10th league goal of the campaign and Liverpool’s 100th at Anfield under Slot, the century arriving in 46 games.The shell-shocked visitors continued to threaten after the break and Barnes was denied by a fine Alisson save. But Liverpool were now a far more confident proposition and seized on any lapses or gaps in the Newcastle defence. Ekitiké could have had a hat-trick when capitalising on a slip by Burn but rolled his shot wide of Pope’s far post.A poor clearance by Thiaw led to Liverpool enjoying the comfort of a two-goal advantage. Wirtz broke clear and found Salah, then held back on the edge of the area for the return pass. It fell perfectly, and Wirtz tucked a clinical finish inside the far corner. Konaté prodded home after Pope dropped a Szoboszlai corner in stoppage time. Newcastle’s Anfield torment continues.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is her second major title after herwin at Wimbledon in 2022.Elena Rybakina rocks Aryna Sabalenka to grab first Australian Open triumphRead more“I always believed that I can come back to the level I was,” she said. “We all have ups and downs. Like everyone, I thought maybe I will never be again in the final or even get a trophy, but it’s all about the work.“We’ve been putting a lot of work in with the team and they were also very supportive. In the moments when I was maybe not that positive, they would be helping out on the side. When you getting after some wins, big wins against top players, then you start to believe more, you get more confident.”Last year, Rybakina’s coach, Stefano Vukov, was suspended from the tour during the Australian Open due to alleged verbally abusive behaviour towards her. One year on, he received a trophy on-court as recognition of his work with her. Hissuspension was lifted on appealin August. Rybakina said she did not consider his trophy a significant moment.“I didn’t think anything in particular, because we won many titles together, and even last year in Ningbo, WTA Finals, and now this trophy I felt just, again, proud and thankful to my team for the work,” she said. “We did good preparation. We had some ups and downs during the pre-season, even beginning of this year, first tournament. I’m just super glad. It’s a win for all the team, all the people who support me. I just hope I can carry this moment throughout the whole season and keep on improving.”View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka says she ‘couldn’t resist the aggression’ from Rybakina.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersSabalenka did not hide her frustration after another tough loss in a major final, but she handled it with greater composure than after her loss to Coco Gauff at the French Open final. She is now 4-4 in major finals.“I was really upset with myself because, once again, I had opportunities. I played great until a certain point, and then I couldn’t resist that aggression that she had,” said Sabalenka.“But I played great tennis here. Even in this final I feel like I played great. I was fighting. I did my best and today she was a better player.“We’ll speak with the team. Now they try to avoid and escape me because they see that it’s not really healthy to be around me right now.”Sabalenka digested the defeat with plenty of humour. Asked when she would debrief with her team, she jokingly asked her hitting partner, Andrei Vasilevski, when the meeting would occur. When he suggested doing so afterwards, she said, laughing: “When? Today? Oh, fuck you, no.“Maybe in a week. Or maybe in few days. Whenever I feel like: ‘OK, I can move on from this one.’”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Aryna SabalenkaAustralian OpenAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”According to emails that were among the 3 million pages of documents, Epstein connected Tisch to numerous women. Tisch, 76, was never charged with any crime connected to the investigation.Tisch won an Academy Award in 1994 for producing Forrest Gump and is chairman and executive vice president of the Giants. He has been involved with the team since his father, Preston Tisch, bought 50% of it in 1991 from the Mara family.The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.Explore more on these topicsNew York GiantsNFLUS sportsJeffrey EpsteinShareReuse this content"

George said in a statement to ESPN that he had taken something “improper” while seeking treatment for a personal issue.Unrivaled sets women’s pro basketball attendance mark of 21,490 in PhillyRead more“Over the past few years, I’ve discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication,” George said. He apologized to the team and its fans and said he takes “full responsibility for my actions”.Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and the NationalBasketballPlayers Association, a 25-game ban indicates a first violation. George began serving the suspension on Saturday when Philadelphia hosted New Orleans.The suspension will cost George – a nine-time All-Star – roughly $11.7m of his $51.7m salary, or about $470,000 per game. Part of the forfeited money will count as a tax credit, leaving the 76ers about $1.3m over the luxury-tax line.George is expected to be eligible to return on 25 March, when Philadelphia host Chicago, with 10 regular-season games likely remaining. The 76ers entered Saturday at 26-21, sixth in the Eastern Conference, and are 16-11 when George plays compared with 10-10 in his absence.He has averaged 16 points in 27 games this season, third on the team behind Tyrese Maxey (29.4) and Joel Embiid (25.7). Earlier this week he scored 32 points, hitting nine three-pointers in a win over Milwaukee.The 35-year-old signed a four-year, $212m contract in free agency before the 2024-25 season, but his first year in Philadelphia was disrupted by knee and adductor injuries and proved one of the least productive of his career. He averaged 16.2 points in 41 games, his lowest full-season scoring mark since his second year in the league with Indiana, later describing the campaign as “rock bottom”.George underwent surgery on his left knee in July after a workout injury and missed the first 12 games of the current season. With Joel Embiid fit and Maxey emerging as an All-Star starter, the 76ers had remained in the playoff mix, while rookie No 3 overall pick VJ Edgecombe provided further optimism.With the 5 February trade deadline approaching, George’s suspension could shape Philadelphia’s plans as they weigh their push for the postseason.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia 76ersNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The protest was as much against the news that agents from a division of ICE would participate in security for the US delegation as against what many saw as creeping fascism in the United States.“No thank you, from Minnesota to the world, at the side of anyone who fights for human rights,’’ read one banner. “Never again means never again for anyone,’’ read another, and “Ice only in Spritz,’’ a reference to a popular aperitif, read yet another.News of the deployment of ICE agents has provoked a backlash in Italy. Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala has said they were not welcome. Interior minister Matteo Piantedosi has been called to Parliament to testify about the deployment this week.Protester Silvana Grassi held a sign that read “Ice = Gestapo”. She said the scenes of ICE agents in Minneapolis shooting and killing protesters and detaining children were deeply upsetting. “It makes me want to cry to think of it,’’ Grassi said. “It’s too terrible. How did they elect such a terrible, evil man?’’The ICE agents to be deployed to Milan are not from the same unit as the immigration agents cracking down in Minnesota and other US cities.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a demonstration against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ahead of the Milano Cortina Olympic Games.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty ImagesHomeland Security Investigations, a ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the US is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.“Even if it’s not the same ones, we don’t want them here,’’ Grassi said.Paolo Bortoletto, also holding a banner, was aware that the officers would have an investigative and not a street role. Still, he said, “We don’t want them in our country. We are a peaceful country. We don’t want fascists.

He oversaw a period of extraordinary success during his 20-year career with Red Bull, winning eight drivers’ and six constructors’ titles.However, Red Bull’s decision to sack him came a year-and-a-half after he was accused of “inappropriate behaviour” by a female colleague. Horner alwaysdenied the claims and was exoneratedfor a second time of controlling behaviour by an independent KC.Mercedes and Hamilton shine in F1’s first pre-season test in BarcelonaRead moreAlpine confirmed last week that Horner is among a group interested in investing in the team and breaking his silence on Saturday at the European Motor Show in Dublin, Horner said: “I feel like I have unfinished business inFormula One. It didn’t finish the way that I would have liked it to finish.“But I am not going to come back for just anything. I am only going to come back for something that can win. I don’t want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built. I had 21 incredible years in Formula One. I had a great run, won a lot of races, championships and worked with some amazing drivers, engineers and partners.“I don’t need to go back. I could stop my career now. So I would only go back for the right opportunity to work with great people, and to work in an environment where people want to win, and they shared that desire. I would want to be a partner, rather than just a hired hand, but we will see how it plays out. I am not in a rush. I don’t need to do anything.”A Horner-led consortium has discussed purchasing Otro Capital’s 24% stake in Alpine, who finished bottom of the constructors’ championship last season. Horner has also been linked with moves to Aston Martin and Ferrari.Horner added: “What has been fascinating is that I stepped out of Red Bull on July 8, and this is the first time I have actually spoken to anyone. [In the media] I have beengoing to every single Formula One team, which has ranged from the back of the grid, to the middle of the grid, and to the front of the grid. And there just seems to be an appetite as to: ‘What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?’“The reality is that until the spring I can’t do anything anyway.

Horner’s former rival, Toto Wolff, is the chief executive and co-owner of the Mercedes F1 team.However, Horner added: “A lot of people made a lot out of the rivalry I had with him. I have a huge amount of respect for him. He has been tremendously successful. He has won a huge amount. He is very bright.“We are just different people, equally competitive, just different. And sport is boring if everybody is friendly and loves each other. You have got to have a rivalry that will create a real interest.

Unrivaled hit the road for the first time in its brief history, breaking free of its Florida bubble to expand its reach and stage two games on Friday night in Philadelphia.The first tour stop was a smashing success.Cloud held an “Abolish Ice” sign as she was introduced to a roaring ovation from a professional women’s basketball regular-season record crowd of 21,490 that included Good Morning America host Robin Roberts, Sixers guard Kyle Lowry, and comedians Leslie Jones and Wanda Sykes.The previous regular-season attendance record of 20,711 was set in the WNBA by the Indiana Fever and Washington Mystics on 19 September 2024.Kelsey Plum scored 22 points to lead the Phantom to a 71-68 win over the Breeze in the first game. Marina Mabrey then gave the record-setting crowd a record to cheer on – she scored an Unrivaled-high 47 points to lead the Lunar Owls to an 85-75 win over Philly native Kahleah Copper and league champion Rose.Copper, the 2021 WNBA NBA Finals MVP for the Chicago Sky, played her role as both tour guide – she took her teammates to Dalessandro’s Steaks – and promoter – she needed 64 tickets to the event – to perfection.“I think the city is ready for women’s professional sports,” Copper said. “I’m excited that, one, that it’s here, and two, that I’m a part of it.”Philly’s rich basketball history is largely comprised of household name Hall of Famers and All-Stars out of the men’s game. Wilt Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant played high school basketball in the area. Sixers stars from Iverson to Julius Erving to Joel Embiid have brought fans to their feet for decades.Yet no women’s pro game had been played in the city since 1998 when the Philadelphia Rage played for the now-defunct AmericanBasketballLeague. Philly native Dawn Staley, who attended the doubleheader, has carried the banner for women’s basketball out of the city – her hometown street was named in her honor in 2017 – but the college teams have largely been immaterial on the national scene.Unrivaled’s debut is the expected first step toward Philly basketball breaking into the conversation as a women’s hotbed of hoops. Pep rallies and watch parties sprouted Friday night around Philly and a pair of lower bowl tickets on the secondary markets matched the price and high demand of recent Sixers’ games.Philadelphia is planning on a new arena that will be completed hopefully by 2030 and will serve as the new home for the WNBA team set to join the league.For all the hype in the city – Cloud gave a shoutout to a credentialed media member wearing a Philly Loves Women’s Sports sweatshirt – Unrivaled’s doubleheader also comes at a pivotal moment for a league experiencing growing pains in televised viewership in its second season.The eight-team league is averaging 92,000 viewers on TNT and truTV, down 49% from last year through the comparable number of games (183,000 through 26 games). Unrivaled telecasts on TNT in primetime are averaging 68% fewer viewers than primetime programming on TNT the four weeks prior to Unrivaled starting (93,000 viewers v 291,000).While ratings matter to prove 3-on-3 is more than a novelty act, Cloud focused more on the packed house later that night as proof of “how hot, booming, [in-]demand, that women’s sports, women’s basketball in general is, right now.”Co-founded by Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, Unrivaled’s first tour stop in Philadelphia could represent a proving ground on whether taking the product on the road can lead to new revenue and expand the league’s fan base, while recalibrating a business model that was originally rooted in centralization.“I would love to see Unrivaled tour more often,” said Breeze forward Cameron Brink. “We saw that this is a city that wants to cheer on women’s basketball.”Brink flashed a TikTok-worthy moment when she dunked at practice Thursday for the first time since the WNBA Los Angeles Sparks star suffered a torn ACL in her left knee in June.Breeze and former UConn star Paige Bueckers – the 2021 AP Player of the Year – are just two of the players responsible for packing the place on Friday night. Unrivaled players participated in community events and connected with fans – especially young girls – that opened their eyes to how starved the Philly sports scene is for professional women’s basketball.“To see the turnout, to see the sold-out arena, to just see the love that they have for women’s sports, it means a lot for the future too in terms of getting a WNBA team,” Bueckers said. “It’s really cool just for the game to continue to expand and for us to see that turnaround and for us to see that support everywhere we go.”Unrivaled CEO Alex Bazzell did not specifically take questions Friday but popped into the press room for a brief rah-rah speech and suggested more touring dates could be ahead.“We’re going to continue to make the sports world proud by the product we put out,” Bazell said.Explore more on these topicsBasketballPhiladelphiaUS sportsWNBAShareReuse this content"

Lurching between extremes is their speciality. They were shambolic against struggling West Ham for 45 minutes, had Stamford Bridge ready to turn on Liam Rosenior at half-time and still found a way to mount a comeback so wild it left their opponents in a state of utter, uncontrollable rage at the end of an incomprehensible London derby.Where to begin? With the end, perhaps, and Enzo Fernández running on to a cutback from João Pedro to make it 3-2 to Chelsea in the 92nd minute. It was some turnaround. João Pedro had made the difference after coming on at the start of the second half. The forward scored Chelsea’s first, heading home just before the hour, and was cool when he broke into the West Ham area when the game ran into added time. João Pedro had options. He could have shot and he could have crossed. Instead he threw West Ham by pulling the ball back to Fernández, who is beginning to resemble Frank Lampard with his knack of deciding games with late unnoticed runs from midfield.Proud Liam Rosenior wants to be best choice Chelsea have ever madeRead moreWest Ham, who remain five points below Nottingham Forest in 18th place, were broken. They dominated the first half, goals from Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville lifting them into a commanding position. The revival led by Nuno Espírito Santo looked set to continue. West Ham were strong, muscular and dangerous. They defended and attacked as a unit. They rattled Chelsea. It would not be enough. The red mist descended. A mass brawl ended with West Ham fortunate that Jean-Clair Todibo was the only player to be sent off. The defender will miss three games for throttling João Pedro but could have been followed down the tunnel by Konstantinos Mavropanos and Adama Traoré.Nuno could not hide his disappointment. He criticised his side’s defending during the second half, although he has to take his share of the blame. Nuno was bold at first but too quick to retreat when the tide turned. Not for the first time, he relinquished the initiative with his changes. The most inexplicable was taking off Pablo and replacing the striker with Max Kilman. Chelsea were level three minutes later. Liam Delap headed against the bar and Marc Cucurella, one of three half-time changes from Rosenior, stooped to head in the equaliser.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro urges on the crowd and his teammates after pulling a goal back for Chelsea.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersIs Rosenior a lucky manager or a tactical genius? Chelsea’s head coach has six wins from seven games since replacing Enzo Maresca but few have been convincing. The recoveries are becoming a theme. Rosenior responded after making a mess of his initial approach, just as he had when he bungled his starting lineup duringChelsea’s victory over Napoliin the Champions League last Wednesday.Chelsea’s mentality against inferior opposition was under the spotlight. Rosenior wanted to see if they could back up the win in Naples. He said this game would tell him a lot about his players. He did not discover anything good about them at first.West Ham rattled Chelsea with an intense, coordinated press. Taty Castellanos and Pablo were dangerous front two. Pablo was involved in the opening goal. His presence deceived Robert Sánchez, who let Bowen’s cross from the right drift inside the far post after seven minutes.Quick GuideChelsea 3-2 West Ham key factsShow• Chelsea won a Premier League match having been two goals behind at half time for the first time ever in the competition, while West Ham lost an away match that they were two goals ahead at the break for the second time (lost 3-2 against Wigan in May 2011).• Liam Rosenior (pictured) became the fourth English manager to win his first three Premier League games in charge, after Bobby Gould in August 1992, Sam Allardyce in August 2001 and Craig Shakespeare (first 5) in April 2017.Photograph: John Walton/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Chelsea, who made seven changes before the second leg of their League Cup semi-final against Arsenal, were miles off the pace. The passing was abysmal and their left flank was a mess. Bowen tormented Jorrel Hato before Cucurella replaced the left-back. It was 2-0 when Alejandro Garnacho failed to track Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The right-back ran on to a pass from Bowen and set Summerville up for his fourth goal in as many games.The mood darkened. Trevoh Chalobah was arguing with a home fan when the teams walked off at half-time. Rosenior acted. Benoît Badiashile, Garnacho and Hato were taken off. João Pedro, Cucurella and Wesley Fofana brought on. West Ham kept attacking, though; Bowen and Mateus Fernandes were close to making it 3-0.View image in fullscreenJean-Clair Todibo clashes with João Pedro and is later sent off, much to Chelsea supporters’ delight.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersChelsea’s substitutions began to make an impact. Nuno was enraged by his side allowing Fofana to advance and cross for João Pedro to head past Alphonse Areola. West Ham faded. Areola made a stunning stop from Moisés Caicedo. Nuno wanted to protect the lead. The introduction of Kilman made no difference. Pedro Neto, another substitute, crossed. Malo Gusto won the first header and Cucurella scored after the otherwise disappointing Delap hit the woodwork.West Ham are without a clean sheet since August. That will have to change if they are to stay up. This was agonising. They hit the post through Todibo in the 86th minute. It seemed they would have to settle for a point. Fernández had other ideas.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This against a team who have lost once since the start of December and with a ferocious home crowd behind them.Bournemouth build on Liverpool win as Kroupi and Scott sink WolvesRead moreFifteen minutes before kick-off, Bukayo Saka picked up a hip problem in the warm-up, but to the their credit Arsenal navigated a tricky test to return to winning ways in emphatic fashion. Time will tell on how long Saka will be missing for, with Mikel Arteta only saying the winger had a “little niggle”.What would have been most encouraging for Arsenal, aside from the result, was the man who replaced Saka. Noni Madueke’s goal contributions have fallen firmly under the spotlight in recent days, as have the entirety of the Arsenal attack. At one stage on Saturday, own goals were their joint-highest Premier League scorer this season.View image in fullscreenLeeds’ Karl Darlow punches the ball into his own net in the 38th minute, his view from an Arsenal corner obscured by teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBut this was a coming of age performance for Madueke in an Arsenal shirt. His sumptuous cross allowed Martín Zubimendi to head his side into the lead midway through the first half and in the 38th minute the winger’s corner was punched into his own net by Karl Darlow, who had an afternoon to forget.The£50m price taghas seemed to be an immense burden on Madueke and though he is still waiting for his first goal, his performance was encouraging. The news on Saka will become clearer in the coming days, but Arsenal can take some comfort that a player brought in to boost squad depth delivered.Quick GuideLeeds 0-4 Arsenal key actsShow• After wins at Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Chelsea, Inter and Leeds in January 2026, Arsenal have won five away games across all competitions in a single month for just a second time in the club’s history, with the previous instance coming in April 2000 (that run also included a 4-0 win at Elland Road).• Only in 2009-10 (6) have Arsenal benefited from more own goals in a single Premier League campaign than the five they’ve benefited from so far in 2025-26.• Aged 27 years and 17 days, Declan Rice (pictured) became the fifth youngest player to reach 300 Premier League appearances after Wayne Rooney (26y 58d), James Milner (26y 117d), Gareth Barry (26y 247d) and Raheem Sterling (26y 348d).OptaPhotograph: Lee Smith/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I’m very happy,” Arteta said. “It was a very impressive performance and result. We really wanted to show how much we wanted it given the fact three results haven’t gone our way in the league and we certainly did that.”Leeds will look back on this with frustration, but their season will not be defined by these sorts of fixtures. The visit of Nottingham Forest on Friday is a far more significant encounter for their survival hopes, but the lack of anything too noteworthy in attack will have disgruntled Daniel Farke.“Arsenal were deserved winners,” the Leeds manager said. “We faced the best side in Europe. There’s a reason they’re top of the league and you need a perfect day to give yourselves a chance, as well as a bit of luck. We didn’t have that and they were on it from the first second to the last.”Arsenal dominated most of the contest and when Madueke’s cross was headed in by Zubimendi midway through the first half, it was the least they deserved. That was bad enough for the hosts, but the second goal was hugely damaging. Arsenal’s set-piece routines proved decisive again, as Darlow flapped at a Madueke corner.Farke responded at half-time by reverting to a back four and for a short while there was a brief upturn from Leeds. But as the game entered the final quarter the substitute Gabriel Martinelli’s cross was turned home by Viktor Gyökeres for his sixth league goal of the season. Darlow again could have done better.Arsenal were not done. With four minutes left, another of their attacking options scored a much-needed goal as Gabriel Jesus spun away from Pascal Struijk before curling home a marvellous effort that, this time, Darlow could do nothing about.Teams rarely win at Elland Road by margins as great as this, but this was as decisive and convincing an away win as you are likely to find. After an unsteadying couple of weeks, Arsenal’s position as champions in-waiting has emphatically returned.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He said Klopp had joked about taking the role if Lijnders didn’t.Lijnders joined Guardiola’s coaching staff in the summer and will be alongside the Spaniard, who missed Friday’s press conference for “personal reasons”, at Tottenham on Sunday. Lijnders spent almost 10 years at Liverpool, mostly alongside Klopp, and the pair had three title battles with City, twice finishing as runners-up.That sparked some internal debate for Lijnderswhen the opportunity arose to move to Manchester.The day English football changed: 10 years on from Manchester City naming Pep GuardiolaRead more“The moment Pep called, and the feeling he gave me about what he wanted to do with the team by bringing me in, the trust he already had before we discussed how it would look, that made the decision much easier,” Lijnders said. “But you cannot put away 10 years ofLiverpoolthat easily. But I’m really proud to come to a club of this magnitude, so successful over the last 10 years and with a manager that defined football. When I spoke with Jürgen he was so clear: ‘If you don’t do it, I will take the assistant job.’”Asked about the experience of working under Guardiola, Lijnders said: “Intense. He’s brilliant, of course. He has a passion and a game understanding from a different planet in my opinion. He knows exactly what he wants and the good ones and the top ones, what sets them apart is their love, in my opinion, for his team. You always have people who are geniuses in terms of how to prepare a team, but the quality lies in how you touch the heart of the players, how you convince them to play in a certain way. That is something that didn’t surprise me of course because I knew, but [it is] what I really like about Pep.”Next Sunday Lijnders returns to Anfield for the first time since leaving in 2024. “It will be special, maybe more special for my family than me,” he said. “But my mindset is to win and to try to beat them.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Would they have taken a run of 11 games without a win, Eberechi Eze andMarc Guéhi sold,Oliver Glasner disillusionedand on his way out of the club, and a probable relegation battle ahead? Almost certainly, yes.But equally that Palace fan would be within their rights to ask why there should be a pay-off at all. This isn’t like Portsmouth winning the FA Cup in 2008 while living beyond their meansunder Alexandre Gaydamak, going intoadministration in 2009-10. It’s not like Wigan winning the FA Cup as theywere relegated in 2013having been sustained in the Premier League by Dave Whelan.It’s not even like Leicester who were forced into cutbacks and relegated, two years after adding an FA Cup to their 2016 Premier League title (and werefined on their return to the Championshipfor Financial Fair Play breaches in their promotion season of 2013-14). There is no suggestion at all of Palace having overstretched; rather they have been chewed up by the economic realities of the modern game.The day English football changed: 10 years on from Manchester City naming Pep GuardiolaRead moreThere is no real villain here who has exploited the club for his own ends, even if Steve Parish mayregret working with John Textor, whose Eagle Football Holdings seems to specialise in alienating fans of each of the clubs it owns. There has been no foolish overspending – even if the idea that the fees paid for Brennan Johnson, Yéremy Pino and Jaydee Canvot exceed those recouped for Eze and Guéhi is not immediately easy to justify.If he has any self-awareness, Parish may also be regretting his comments during Covid when, rejecting the idea that Premier League clubs should help out those lower down the food chain, he said that “supermarkets” were not bailing out “corner shops”. That sort of financial Darwinism cuts both ways.None of which changes the fact that Palace have done everything by the book. This is the modern way. Identify young promise and mid-range talent, buy it, develop it, sell it on, replace. That’s how it’s meant to be. It’s how Brighton, Brentford and Bournemouth do things. It’s the reality of existence for the Premier League’s mid-ranks. It makes sense. It’s an accommodation to the economic environment.But there is a ceiling, and Palace pressed against it pretty hard. In all but one season since their return to the Premier League in 2013, Palace have finished between 10th and 15th. In mid-December they were fourth in the league and favourites to win the Europa Conference League, even if they had failed to qualify automatically for the last 16. Something truly spectacular seemed possible.That they were even in the Europa Conference League rather than the Europa League, of course, had been the first intimation that all would not be entirely well after the FA Cup win; the decision to demote them for Nottingham Forest may have been technically correct but it felt a demonstration of how modern football will snuff out romance wherever it can. Textor did, at the deadline, part-own Palace and Lyon; that the beneficiaries were Nottingham Forest, with whose owner, Evangelos Marinakis, Textor enjoys a close business relationship, only heightened the sense of grievance.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace fans hold up a cutout of Oliver Glasner. There are no villains at Selhurst Park, just the harsh economic realities of the modern game.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut since losing 3-0 at home to Manchester City on 14 December, Palace haven’t won. They’re 15th, only eight points clear of a resurgent West Ham in 18th. It’s true that is also only nine points off fifth place and probable Champions League qualification, but nobody at Selhurst Park is looking in that direction at the moment. How then, has it come to this? Is there anything Palace could have done differently?A player of Eze’s quality was always going to leave, as Michael Olise had the previous summer. Perhaps the timeframe has been compressed, but that’s always been true: Champions League players want to play for Champions League clubs. Guéhi falls into a similar category, but the difference is that, with his contract expiring, Palace had to accept a relatively low fee rather than risk losing him for free in the summer.Perhaps there were issues of communication, but none of that can have come as a surprise to Glasner. Or indeed to the other players, notably Jean-Philippe Mateta, who now seems to have been unsettled by themanager’s announcement of his own departure.What seems to have caused the frustration is a perceived failure to build on the FA Cup success but, in truth, it’s not clear what Palace could have done differently. In financial terms winning the FA Cup may bring a short-term boost in exposure, but little more. Palace made around £7.5m from playing in the Conference League.They would have roughly doubled that in the Europa League, but even that is far from life-changing money – although the Europa League is clearly the more attractive competition and offers the possibility of Champions League qualification and a significant boost to revenues. Perhaps they could have been more ambitious while remaining within PSR, but with the decoupling from Textor, Parish can hardly be blamed if he envisaged a quiet summer.And that perhaps is the major issue. For Palace fans, winning a first trophy was the achievement of a lifetime ambition. It’s a day that will endure forever in the collective memory of the club and, less intensely, of football more generally. It feels like it should make some sort of long-term difference to the club’s status, but financially nothing much has changed.Palace will probably end up, once again, finishing between 10th and 15th. And that means that the cycle of sourcing talent and selling at a profit goes on, just with the added fatigue of playing in European competition, and with the FA Cup success having underlined just how good some of their players were, making them even more attractive to predators.It’s very hard, bordering on the impossible, even with an FA Cup success, without an enormous injection of cash, for a club to climb from being a top-15 side to a top-10 side, let alone a top-eight side or a top-six side.And the risk of collapse, of one sale prompting a flurry of departures, the example of Leicester is ever present. Money is destiny.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

As the ball hit the back of the net after the substitute Beto had bundled in the equaliser in the seventh minute of injury time, theEvertonmanager set off. Moyes is 63 in April, but he sprinted on to the pitch in a moment of sheer delight as Brighton’s players dropped to their knees in despair.Somehow, Everton’s unbeaten record here that stretches back to 2019 is still intact. It had seemed a goal from Pascal Gross would be enough for Brighton to claim victory at the sixth attempt after they had spurned a number of chances in the first half. But while it is one thing to plan how you are going to overcome a team managed by Moyes, it is not quite so easy in practice.Bournemouth build on Liverpool win as Kroupi and Scott sink WolvesRead more“The only difference between me and Pleaty is that I got booked,” said Moyes when it was suggested his celebration was reminiscent of David Pleat’s jig across Manchester City’s Maine Road pitch when Luton avoided relegation in 1983. “Who wants to see managers getting booked for celebrating? It means they’ve got nothing about them at all. No thoughts about what football means, or what it means to the managers. I’m still shaking my head.”Asked if he would do it again, he said: “I bloody will do it again. Actually, if I had been a bit more mobile, I might have done a knee slide. That would have only got me a yellow as well so I might as well have gone the whole hog.”For Brighton this was another bitter pill to swallow afterlast Saturday’s last-ditch defeat at Fulham. It is now one win in their past 11 Premier League games and hopes of another European campaign are quickly evaporating. They left the pitch to boos, although they were mainly directed at the referee, Chris Kavanagh, for playing beyond the allotted six minutes of added time.Fabian Hürzeler refused to blame the officials, but admitted his disappointment that they could not see the game out after his captain, Lewis Dunk, failed to clear one last cross into Brighton’s penalty area. “In one moment we weren’t alive and this cost us the game,” he said. “It feels painful but we can either feel sorry for ourselves or choose to go again.”View image in fullscreenPascal Gross fires Brighton into the lead during the second half.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesMoyes deployed the 6ft 5in Jarrad Branthwaite at left-back and the England defender impressed on his first start of the season. Michael Keane was back from suspension to make up an intimidating-looking back four alongside James Tarkowski and Jake O’Brien.But Brighton were far too slick for them in the opening exchanges and almost went ahead twice in the opening three minutes. Gross was unlucky to see his volley from Ferdi Kadioglu’s cross deflect wide before Danny Welbeck’s improvised backheel was well saved by Jordan Pickford. Moyes was left scratching his head in disbelief when Welbeck directed a corner just past the post under barely any pressure from Everton’s defenders.They were bystanders again when Kaoru Mitoma brilliantly exchanged passes with Welbeck, but could only poke his shot wide of the far post with Pickford already committed.Brighton could not sustain the intensity of the opening half an hour and it was Hürzeler’s turn to look concerned as his tired-looking side struggled to recapture their rhythm. He exchanged some angry words with the fourth official as the half-time whistle sounded.View image in fullscreenBeto waves to the Everton fans after his dramatic equaliser.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAEverton started the second half with far more attacking intent and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was not far away after being set up by a clever flick from Thierno Barry. Branthwaite headed wide from a long throw and was then booked for an agricultural challenge on Yasin Ayari that left the Sweden international requiring lengthy treatment.Dewsbury-Hall should have broken the deadlock when he latched on toBarry’s cross, only for Bart Verbruggen to save well with his feet. Against the run of play, Brighton finally managed to find a way past Pickford when Mitoma dummied Ayari’s cross and Gross – who rejoined Brighton this month from Borussia Dortmund having spent seven years here this first spell – made no mistake.Mitoma had a goal ruled out for offside and it proved to be a vital moment. O’Brien’s shot was saved by Verbruggen but the ball fell straight to Beto to send Moyes off on his victory lap.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While Wolves’ fate is all but sealed, they seek to carry good vibes into the Championship. Bournemouth’s objective was to make lastSaturday’s defeat of Liverpoolthe staging post for one of those streaks of good results that have made Andoni Iraola’s reputation.Mission accomplished for the Cherries, who could celebrate their second away win of a troubled season, a first since August. In the performance of the debutant Rayan, a second-half sub, who supplied Alex Scott’s late clincher, there is much to look forward to.Arsenal stroll back to winning ways against outclassed Leeds and go seven points clearRead more“I’m buzzing for Rayan, it was fantastic from him,” said Scott, central to victory in commanding midfield. “The only way is up now, hopefully.” AnyBournemouthrelegation concerns are surely now forgotten.“I really don’t think we’re spiralling,” said Rob Edwards, the Wolves manager. “We will turn it around.” Relegation, though, looks unavoidable.Edwards seeks consistency beyond doomed mediocrity, but this result dimmed recent optimism. “We played into their hands a bit,” he said. “We’ve got to be more ruthless.”Mateus Mané, Portugal via Rochdale teenage shining light, had the ball in the net in the eighth minute, and took so long to notice the offside flag against Rodrigo Gomes he had completed his celebration routine.Without Antoine Semenyo, a scorer against Wolves last week, Iraola is finding solutions. “We have had a good month despite the departure of Antoine,” he said. An asset-stripped squad is still full of callow promise. The explosive Eli Junior Kroupi played behind the centre-forward wiles of Evanilson and duly delivered a brilliant first-half strike.View image in fullscreenAlex Scott wraps up Bournemouth’s victory.Photograph: Jacob King/PAWolves’ plight lends freedom. A number of their players are playing forPremier Leaguefutures in the sense of showing their talent to potential top-echelon suitors. Mané leads the list, while Hugo Bueno’s scampers from left-back impressed. André and João Gomes may be capable midfielders but struggled against Scott. “Alex has performed very well all season,” said his manager.Wolves’ response to conceding went against the grain of Edwards’ toothy optimism. Amine Adli firing over after an Evanilson layoff might have served as warning. For Kroupi’s goal, André carelessly lost the ball in midfield. The execution was brilliant. Scott’s winding run was followed by an Adli flick that Kroupi first controlled before his shot billowed the net. “Until the goal we scored, nothing clear was happening in the game,” said Iraola.Beto snatches last-gasp equaliser for Everton to spark Moyes sprint and frustrate BrightonRead moreWolves’ immediate response was irritation, José Sá and Yerson Mosquera getting involved in an unseemly row with Adli, Kroupi and Evanilson as the teams left the field at half-time.Mané remained the home beacon of hope, chasing down channels and testing Djordje Petrovic with a grubber as Wolves attacked towards their fans in the Jack Hayward Stand for the second half with renewed vigour. Tempers were also fraying, with Mosquera and Adli fighting out a running battle. Wolves’ biggest chance came when Bueno crossed from the left and Arokodare’s first-time effort was straight at Petrovic.“If we had found an equaliser, I am convinced we could have won it,” said Edwards. “I don’t feel we deserved to lose.”While Wolves pleaded for a Lewis Cook handball, on came Rayan, with Kroupi and Adli withdrawn as a caution against any further nonsense. Each of Rayan’s touches were glimpses of gliding, leggy flair, direct, raw running into the heart of the Wolves defence. “We have to help him,” said Iraola of the player who joined on Tuesday from Vasco da Gama. “It’s clear the skillset is very good.”With all not yet lost, Wolves’ substitutes included Jørgen Strand Larsen, linked with a £50m move to Crystal Palace, but he did his valuation little good with a shank of a serviceable chance. “He’s been focused on the here and now with us,” said Edwards. Mané’s own rawness was evidenced by going for goal with others better placed. Next, Gomes nodded a corner against a post.A game Bournemouth should already have won still hung in the balance. Had Alex Toth, another January arrival, coming off the bench, not slashed Rayan’s pass wide it might have been secured. Instead, Scott, as 90 minutes arrived, poked home to confirm Wolves’s 18th Premier League defeat of the season. Good luck with those good vibes.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But I know this group, I know what they’ve shown this season. I was the first one to say it [the lead) could be gone in a three-game week, and it took a month.“So it’s very clear now. It’s in front of the players. We have two home games coming up, and the only way to go through any lack of confidence – if there is one – is to work and fight your way out of it.

The visitors had taken the lead through Lewis Gibson’s scrambled effort but Ipswich’’s leading scorer calmly fired past David Cornell to prevent his side from falling to their second home loss of the season. There was still time for penalty appeals for fouls and handballs in the Preston area, but John Busby turned them away as Preston ended their three-match losing run.Kieran McKenna was disappointed Ipswich were not awarded at least another penalty. The manager said: “I think we should have had another two. I think the second one, the shove on Jack Clarke as he comes in the box and someone comes in and crashes into him from behind, is a clear pen.“For me the one that comes back to Jack Clarke, he tries to pop it round the corner for Chuba [Akpom] in the box, a midfielder is there with his arm out and moves his arm towards the ball and knocks it away from Chuba and the referee is 10 yards away and staring straight at it.”Mihailo Ivanovic’s poacher’s goal earnedMillwalla 1-1 draw againstSheffield United, who often looked the better side at the Den.

The 24-year-old joined Saints from Manchester City on loan in 2023, with the move becoming permanent after winning the Championship playoff final at the end of that season.He stayed with Southampton after their relegation, but West Ham have made a reported £12m move to sign him in the final days of the winter window.Harwood-Bellis’s exceptional pass led to Finn Azaz’s opener at the bet365 Stadium before Flynn Downes wrapped up the victory. “Taylor is an ultimate professional,” Eckert said. “I think you don’t find many like him in the game. The quality to block the noise at the moment. He was outstanding.”Harwood-Bellis is among a number of Saints players being linked with a move before Monday’s deadline, with Adam Armstrong, a target for Middlesbrough, left out of the squad, as was Cameron Archer, who has been linked with Rangers.“There’s been a lot of noise around a couple of players,” said Eckert. “Let’s see what the next days bring and then next week, we are clear on what the team is going to look like for the game coming up.”Andy King concededLeicestercould get dragged into the relegation dogfight as his spell in interim charge started with a 2-0 home loss toCharlton. Sonny Carey and Lyndon Dykes struck before half-time with Leicester’s cause hugely hampered by a 15th-minute red card for centre-back Caleb Okoli.Asked if the drop was a concern, King, who stepped in after Martí Cifuentes’ sacking on Sunday, said: “Yeah, potentially. I don’t think we can get away from the fact we’re not where we want to be in the table. But let’s try looking up and reversing the momentum, rather than looking down.”Conor Chaplin scored the first goal of his second spell at his boyhood club to setPortsmouthon course for a dominant 3-0 victory over relegation rivalsWest Brom. Chaplin, who joined Pompey as a six-year-old before returning on loan from Ipswich, opened the scoring before January arrivals Millenic Alli and Ebou Adams gave them comfort.Eric Ramsay, who replaced Ryan Mason as West Brom’s manager 20 days ago, has failed to turn around the poor form with three defeats and a draw, and the away fans sang: “Eric Ramsay, your football is shit,” during the game at Fratton Park.Ramsay said: “I knew the level of challenge I was coming into. I hoped the first four games had gone differently and when we got to this stage, we were in a different situation. The reality means I have to stay level, stay constructive and keep the group on track. I have to believe I can get more out of the group.”Birmingham’s2-0 victory over strugglersOxfordat the Kassam Stadium was their fourth away win of the season. Birmingham took the lead in the 23rd minute through an own goal by Myles Peart-Harris, who headed Jamie Cumming’s flapped clearance at a Paik Seung-ho free-kick into his own net from five yards. Marvin Ducksch made it two in the 67th minute with a clinical right-foot finish from 22 yards, after substitute Carlos Vicente’s backheel, for his seventh goal of the season.On Friday night,DerbythrashedBristolCity5-0 at Ashton Gate to leapfrog their opponents in the table.

Hopefully we can improve and come back tomorrow,” said Marsh, suggesting things will be different once the rest of his cavalry arrive.“We have got experienced guys who know that partnerships are really important in run-chases. We were not able to do that today. So some really good lessons,” he said.After capitulating for just 108, with all 10 wickets falling to spin, in just the 16th over as they chased Pakistan’s formidable 198-5, a second comprehensive defeat in three days on the low, slow Gaddafi Stadium track means any real edge has been removed from Sunday’s third clash.After Salman Agha had win the toss and opted to lead from the front for the hosts, hammering 76 off 40 balls with four thumping sixes, wicketkeeper Usman Khan kept up the pressure with a 35-ball half-century.Bartlett (1-52) went at 13 an over, and Matt Kuhnemann’s spin (1-40) was deposited for 10 an over, with experienced legspinner Adam Zampa once again the pick of the Australian attack with his 1-27, while Cooper Connolly (1-30) also did well not to get mauled.Zampa snared Babar Azam lbw for just two with a beauty to continue the concerns in Pakistan about their batting hero’s lean run, but it was just a mini-success as Shadab Khan (28no off 20) combined with Usman for a late charge.Pat Cummins ruled out of T20 World Cup as Australia overlook Smith for final squadRead moreChasing 199 always looked a pretty forlorn task and once Abrar Ahmed, the spinner nicknamed Harry Potter for his wizardry, trapped Marsh lbw in the third over before Saim Ayub (1-32) bowled Travis Head the very next ball with one that kept low, it soon felt hopeless.Abrar (3-14) then got Josh Inglis (five) with a devilish wrong ‘un the next over, with only Cam Green’s sixth-over assault on Ayub, with two sixes and a four, giving a flicker of hope before Matt Renshaw was trapped lbw by Mohammad Nawaz for just two and Cooper Connolly was skittled by Shadab Khan (3-26) for one.Once Green (35 off 20) sliced a simple catch off Usman Tariq (2-16), the fifth spinner to torment them after being introduced late into the attack, only Matt Short, fresh from the disappointment of being left out of the World Cup squad, was able to mount any kind of last stand with his 27 off 23 balls.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamPakistan cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Many fans are unhappy with the club’s owners and Stamford Bridge felt mutinous when Chelsea were 2-0 down at home to West Ham on Saturday.Enzo Fernández seals thrilling Chelsea fightback to shatter 10-man West HamRead moreThe atmosphere shifted when Chelsea mounted a stirring comeback, levelling through two goals from João Pedro before snatching victory with a stoppage-time winner from Enzo Fernández. Yet the unease is palpable. Rosenior, who has never had a job of this stature before, accepts that part of his task is to get supporters onside.“It’s on me, it’s on me,” the 41-year-old said. “I hope in time they’ll say it’s the best decision this club’s ever made. But I can’t focus on that. This is a really proud club with an incredible tradition, recent history of winning trophies. They want that and I want that too.“So for a start, for a manager to come in midway through a season with not many sessions and have six wins out of seven games, it’s not a bad way to start. As long as the team showed a fight and the energy and the intensity that they did in that second half, the fans showed that they’ll be with us and they’ll support us. And I’m really enjoying being part of this football club.”View image in fullscreenNuno Espírito Santo watches Jean-Clair Todibo leave the pitch as his team unravelled.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersChelsea had never won a Premier League game from 2-0 down at half-time. “It’s a massive thing to do against a side in good form,” Rosenior said. “A lot of positives, a lot of things we need to improve. I’m not shying away from that. But to see the heart, the mentality, the spirit of the group and their quality in the second half makes me a very, very happy man.“I have to say the fans were magnificent in the second half. I could sense after two minutes of the second half they were with us. They were right to boo. I would have booed us in the first half. Our performance was nowhere near the level it needed to be collectively in terms of our energy and our decision-making. That’s fair.“To see them after the game, 45 minutes later, so happy and delighted with what they saw from the team makes me very proud. I said to the players at half-time we can make what probably is the worst feeling of the season the best feeling of the season.”Nuno Espírito Santo insisted that West Ham can stay up. They are five points below 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand. “As long as we can keep maintaining the levels of performance like we did in the first half, we’re going to win matches,” Nuno said. “But this match with all the respect that I have for Chelsea, it should be our game.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The postponement of the first day of the Dublin racing festival at Leopardstown was followed by a victory for Fergal O’Brien’s Sixmilebridge in the Grade One Scilly Isles Novice Chase at Sandown.Willie Mullins’s Kitzbuhel set off as the 10-11 favourite for Sandown’s four-runner feature event, with Gordon Elliott’s Kala Conti next in the list at 2-1, but the market leader got no further than the sixth fence, where a bad mistake unseated Paul Townend, his rider. Sixmilebridge, at 6-1, was far more fluent at his fences and having made all the running, Kielan Woods’s mount stayed on well from the last to beat Kala Conti by five lengths.“He’s in the Arkle and the three-mile novice [Brown Advisory Novice Chase at Cheltenham in March] as well,” O’Brien told Racing TV. “My gut feeling is probably the three-miler, but my gut feeling is wrong more than it’s right sometimes, so Kielan will inevitably be the one who decides which race we go in. He’s the one that’s riding him and he’ll know what he wants to do.”Paddy Power cut Sixmilebridge to 12-1 (from 20-1) for the Brown Advisory Novice Chase on 11 March, in a market headed by Mullins’s Final Demand, who is declared to run at Leopardstown on Sunday, at around 11-10.View image in fullscreenKielan Woods smiles after victory on Sixmilebridge.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAAt Leopardstown, officials remained “cautiously optimistic” that the Dublin racing festival would get under way 24 hours late on Sunday, with an eight-race card that is due to feature four Grade Ones including the Irish Champion Hurdle.“They are working away on the track,” Mark Clayton, Leopardstown’s chief executive, said. “When we went out there this morning it was unraceable after 17 millimetres of rain overnight, with 100mm during the week.“We were expecting 4mm to 5mm this morning but we have had about 2mm and we are forecast a dry day today and then through until Monday. Given the forecast we would be cautiously optimistic about Sunday’s card but we will have an inspection at 8am.”The seven-race card, which was due to open the festival meeting on Saturday has been postponed until Monday, a bank holiday in Ireland, with the Irish Gold Cup due off at 3.30pm.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowMarket Rasen:12.47 Wind Your Neck In 1.17 Cinquenta 1.47 Grandad’s Cap 2.20 Sunshine Diamond 2.55 Smurfette 3.30 Mr Zee (nb) 4.02 Lone Soldier.Musselburgh:12.55 Mossy Fen Road 1.25 Dedicated Hero 1.55 Koukeo 2.30 Magna Victor 3.05 Transmission 3.40 Double Powerful (nap) 4.15 Lizzie Luna.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The card was abandoned on Saturday morning, around half an hour before a scheduled inspection at 8am, with Paddy Graffin, the clerk of the course, saying in a statement on X that “what appeared to be perfectly fine yesterday is now unraceable”.Saturday’s scheduled card at Wetherby was also abandoned due to a waterlogged track, but the jumps card at Musselburgh went ahead as planned, as did the all-weather Flat meetings at Newcastle and Lingfield.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowSandown12.20 Sinchi Roca 12.55 Bollin Thou 1.25 Rip Wheeler 2.02 Escapeandevade 2.40 Kala Conti 3.10 Henri The Second 3.42 Fortunate ManLingfield12.35 Dream Of Mischief 1.05 Survie 1.38 Al Baahy 2.15 Haveagobeau 2.50 Completely Random 3.20 Knight Templar 3.55 Master Of My Fate 4.30 Baloo’s BluesMusselburgh1.10 Made U Blush 1.43 Williethebuilder (nap) 2.20 Insurrection 3.00 Absolutely Doyen 3.37 Gemini Man 4.11 Sammy SmartNewcastle4.25 Londoner 4.55 Our Absent Friends 5.25 Cerelia 5.55 Beattie Is Back 6.25 Relevant Range 6.55 Mademoiselle Belle 7.25 Lord CapuletWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Galopin can land record fourth Gold CupGalopin Des Champswas finally beaten in a Leopardstown chase at the eighth time of asking whenonly third behind Affordale Furyin the Savills Chase in December, but Willie Mullins’s gelding was making his seasonal debut and will be strongly fancied to register a record-equalling fourth win in the rescheduled Irish Gold Cup on Monday.Galopin Des Champs was also beaten first time up in 2023 and 2024 before taking a three-mile Grade One at Leopardstown on his next outing, and showed more than enough to suggest that his talent remains largely intact.The dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner should also appreciate the sterner test on much softer ground, and can beat a top-class field to match Florida Pearl’s record of four wins in the race.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

In what appears to be a public rebuke to Göttlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public”.The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament”.Trump has sowed discord in Europewith his takeover bid for Greenland and threats to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed it, whileUS actions in Venezuela and at homein dealing with protests in American cities have also raised alarm. The former Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, last weekadvised fans to stay awayfrom the tournament, which starts on 11 June.There has been disquiet in Germany over Trump’s behaviour on the global stage. The Germany international and Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka said on Wednesday that Trump’s actions have left himfeeling “not onlyGerman but also European”.The French government has ruled boycotting theWorld Cup, with the sports minister, Marina Ferrari, saying on Wednesday: “As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition. Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs.View image in fullscreenGermany’s DFB said a boycott ‘is not currently under consideration’.Photograph: Thorsten Wagner/Reuters“I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.”Fans already had concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending.Germany’s team, at least, will be there. “We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer,” the DFB said. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones – just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”Germany face Curaçao in Houston, Côte d’Ivoire in Toronto and Ecuador in New Jersey in the World Cup group stage.

It suggested the claim was atacticto support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.The firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation tounnamed“courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.Quinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against ajudgmentfrom a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in itsdeploymentof Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”Adam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”Steven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”If WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”The Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.WhatsAppbills itselfas an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.This contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.A senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.However, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.Woog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppMetaPrivacynewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve heard some of my friends’ parents tell them, “You should be like that, too.”I got my first phone when I was 12, as my mum wanted to be able to contact me to pick me up from school. When I got it, I had strict screen time rules: it was turned off after an hour. I still don’t use it much.I’m not on social media.Instagram and TikTok can lead to a lot of problems for your mental health. I’ve definitely seen friends get self-conscious; double-checking everything they say.Some friends spend more than six hours a day on social media. They use it to keep in touch and post nice pictures. After school, many scroll on Instagram late into the night, and it sometimes affects how focused they feel the next day. They tell me it’s a good thing I don’t have it so I can focus on school work. Sometimes I feel left out of their conversations, but it doesn’t really affect my relationships with them. They’re not intending to leave me out and they don’t judge me, they just think it’d be easier.Itisannoying when friends are on their phone while we are hanging out – scrolling on Instagram and talking about what they’re looking at. It’s boring. I don’t understand why people meet up in real life to then look at their phone.There’s so much online that’s trackable. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your pastI worry that there’s so much online that’s trackable, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I was part of a dance group in elementary school when I was 10 and now videos of me dancing are still online – I didn’t even know they’d been posted. Even if I type my friends’ names into Google, I can see stuff they did when they were much younger. It’s scary, there’s no way to reset your past.Neither of my parents have social media. My dad uses screens up to 15 hours a day, because he is a software engineer and is constantly online. But if you took away his work, he probably uses them for around one hour a day for pleasure. My mum uses her phone for around five hours a day for watching shows.I don’t really worry if my screen time will go up in future. Right now, focusing on my school work and relationships is more important than being on social media. I think even when I am in university or working, I won’t doomscroll.CMDaily screen timePhone30 minutes-1 hourComputerNone outside of school workTVNone‘I worry about the time I spend on my phone. I get carried away’Shere, 85: the octogenarian whose social life revolves aroundWhatsAppView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI like WhatsApping. Mostly I speak to my family and friends in Trinidad. In the morning I open my messages and say good morning to everyone; I try to find a nice image and emoji to send.The phone hooks you in. I’m part of different WhatsApp groups, I’m in one called “Curry and Chips” with the boys. I’ve got TikTok andYouTubeon my phone to watch videos they send; some are funny, a lot are rubbish. You get so engrossed. The other day I was making my porridge and it boiled over because I was on my phone.My wife died earlier this year; we met when I was 14. Being on my phone doesn’t make me feel less lonely, but it helps me communicate with people, otherwise I don’t speak to anyone. I’ve joined three old people’s groups that operate locally. We organise meet-ups on WhatsApp and swap pictures. Once a week we get together to do some exercise and have breakfast.I watch westerns every day. My son just gave me a smart TV and I want to learn how to use YouTube on it, so I can find old calypsos. I find typing difficult, so I use Alexa to listen to music and the radio, and set alarms.The downside is there’s so much rubbish – pictures of ducks in the park, things like thatThe phone is a must these days and older people need to learn to use it. Everything is online and we’re getting left behind. Doctors send messages online, and we need the NHS app to book appointments.I check the phone first thing in the morning and before I go to bed. I don’t want to miss texts confirming hospital appointments. I check every day, but then I get sucked into reading and sending messages. I’d like to learn how to use a computer or tablet.The downside of the phone is it takes too much of my time. There’s so much rubbish. Some people send too many pictures – ducks in the park, things like that. I don’t need to see everything they do. I don’t like sitting down too much. I’d prefer to do more gardening or housework, and have more energy to spend on my exercise bike.I worry about the time I spend on my phone. I just get carried away reading messages from people – sometimes it seems as if they have nothing better to do. Also, I don’t like all the adverts and posts from people you don’t know on Instagram – I don’t know why they appear. The family don’t really comment on me using the phone – my son and granddaughter say I use it a lot, but they prefer that I’m active on it. It keeps us in touch.CMDaily screen timePhone3 hoursComputerNoneTV2 hours‘I am very strict about not looking at the comments any more’Pippa, 29: the priest who’s big on TikTokView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianAs a priest, I do see far more phones in church than you might expect. Luckily, my parishioners are very well trained, and I’ve never caught one scrolling during a service so far. But I have had funerals where people’s phones go off – you think, “Come on!”I’ve been making TikToks for about 18 months. It was my sister who suggested it and at first I was hesitant. We hadTikTokaccounts and watched other people’s content, but I’d never considered making my own. She said, “You should be a TikTok vicar!” but I thought it would be naff. Besides, in the first half of my curacy I was in a village and I wasn’t sure I’d find enough material. When I moved to my current church in a town, it seemed there was more of a buzz to tap into, and I softened to the idea. As a priest, I don’t think I should sit in church saying, “Well, where is everyone? Why haven’t they come to church this week?” This is a response to me thinking, “OK, where are people? How can I go and engage with them?”To start with, it took me hours to film and edit each one, but it’s a pretty slick operation now. One of the first TikToks I made showed me at a Ministry of Sound event on a Saturday night, then cut to me leading a service the next morning – that’s had well over 2.2m views now, and I have more than 30,500 followers. It’s always difficult to tell which ones are going to be a hit – I thought the most recent one was hysterical, so it was a bit dispiriting to check after it had been up for a few hours and find it had only had 500 views. I think that’s just human nature – with anything you’ve worked on, it’s a good feeling to have people go, “Ooooh!!” I’ve seen people suggest a good way to build your followers is to post controversial stuff, even if you don’t believe it, but I think that would be so wrong.I stay off my phone if I’m with friends or family – it’s rude not to give people your full attentionI am still quite bad for checking if each TikTok is getting likes and new followers, but the thing I am very strict about is not looking at the comments any more. On that Ministry of Sound post, for example, one said, “Girl, what in the lukewarm?” with a crying face emoji. “Lukewarm” was being used there as a denunciation, warning other Christians not to be like me, and that comment got close to 24,000 likes. Many people seemed to think it was a genuinely offensive thing for me to have done, though there were lots of positive comments, too. In fact, the event I went to began at 6pm and ended at nine – it wasn’t as if I was out partying all night.There was still a story about it in the Sun, though I didn’t realise until the parish administrator messaged me with a link. I had to write an email to my bishop: “Dear Your Grace …” She was lovely about it, very supportive. I’ve since become friends with another vicar from my diocese, David Sims, who also posts on TikTok.I do spend time scrolling through other people’s TikToks – it’s my most used app, followed by Safari, which will just be me checking my emails, then YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp.As a single person who lives alone, it feels like the only socialising you can do sometimes is through a screen, even if FaceTime isn’t the way you want to do it. I open my Hinge app every evening, but unless I start messaging someone, I’ll just sift through people’s profiles with half an eye. I make a point of staying off my phone if I’m with friends or my parents – not just because it’s rude not to give people your full attention, but because when you don’t share a living space with someone, you appreciate the company more. In terms of my friends, my screen time is somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. I think I have quite a low threshold for looking at them – I get a bit of a headache if I do it for too long. Maybe my eyes aren’t used to it – my sister stares at a screen all day for her work, whereas I spend a lot of time talking to people face-to-face. I can feel it when I’ve hit that time; I think, “I need to switch off now and read a book.”CBDaily screen timePhoneUp to 4 hoursComputer3 hours 10 minutesTV1 hour (plus occasional bingeing)‘Gaming is beneficial to my brain. It brings me some quiet’Paula, 40: the stay-at-home mother who is hooked on phone gamesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianFor me, screen time is a release from the routine – I live on a farm with kids aged 13 and five, so every day it’s house chores, kids bouncing around, dogs barking. Gaming is my “me” time – I play a war game calledPuzzles & Chaos on my phone for around four hours a day, which involves strategically building kingdoms and attacking others. I only do it when I have pockets of time – dropping one kid off, picking the other up, making a coffee.Some friends look at me like I have two heads when I say I game. Because I’m 40, and have a busy life, they wonder why I don’t do other activities instead – but I work out every day, I’m an avid reader, and I have stacks of things to do in the house. Honestly, I don’t care what people think. I have racing thoughts 24/7. Gaming brings me some quiet. I’m challenging my brain while not thinking about other things. Sure, everything in excess is bad, but if you play the right amount of time, it’s stimulating.I don’t spend much time doing other things on screens, apart from some TV. I have Facebook, but social media is irrelevant and gets boring. It’s just people posting the same things – food, pictures of places, or just whining. The game is strategic and much more proactive. I crave something that fills my brain up other than just doomscrolling.Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big wayI’m born and bred in Spain, where I was in the army. When I met my British husband, I left everything to build a life with him in the UK, but I don’t game because I’m lonely. I have lots of friends here. I’m just a selectively sociable person. Sometimes I make plans with friends, then two hours later I’m regretting it!In the game I play, you can’t do anything individually, you have to join with other players to plan attacks and win points. We’ve created a community that’s amazing. My alliance is mostly women. I like that you can talk to other gamers with no judgment. Everyone has stuff going on at home – people who have lost a relative, or are recovering from an illness. We can message within the game, but can’t send screenshots, so we also use Discord and WhatsApp.I don’t get a dopamine rush when I game, or get too hyped up. Sometimes, winning and losing battles can affect my mood, but not in a big way. My friends in the game know that real life comes first.CMDaily screen timePhone4 hoursComputerNoneTV1 hour‘My screen use became unhealthy, so I got rid of my phone’Barnaby, 43: the tech CEO who’s deeply offlineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI don’t generally look at a screen until after 10am. I’ve built “buffer time” into my mornings where I don’t have plans and don’t use any tech. I wake around 6.30am, spend time with my children, take a walk, exercise. For years, my mornings were a smartphone-induced blur – I used to be immediately checking the news, responding to emails or Slack messages. I always felt behind, even from the first minute of the day. Now, generally, the first time I engage with a screen is after I get to my office.Even there, I work off a paper to-do list. At the end of each week I write down the top five things I want to do the following week and use that as a guide. I used to have about 300 tasks on a content management system that I’d struggle to get through, but a bout of severe depression made me reassess how I worked.I suppose an unhealthy relationship with screens began when I started my first tech business, aged 17. It was a web hosting company. I would come home from college at 3pm and work on the business until 7am, then sleep for an hour and go back to college. By 2018 I was turning over millions with my second company,Time etc, and thought I’d cracked the code to work-life balance. Less than five years later, everything caught up with me and I had a “breakdown” of sorts. I was checking emails all day and well into the night. I was always available via instant messaging, and even when I wasn’t working I was doomscrolling the news. I became completely overwhelmed.That was three years ago; eventually I saw I needed to get rid of my phone. I have hundreds of people who might need to contact me, so it wasn’t realistic to be completely offline, but I realised I could be more selective.At first, my anxiety was really strong: I need to be connected because something bad might happenNow, I don’t browse the internet. This means no news and no social media – I might look at my phone to play music, but otherwise it’s not a big part of my day any more. If there’s an important news story, I know someone will tell me about it eventually. In fact, I’ve ended up having these beautiful, curious conversations with people. For years I was like, “Yeah, I’ve seen that” whenever anyone mentioned a news story. Now, someone will say, “Did you see the budget?” and I’ll reply, “No, tell me about it, what is your opinion?” So I have a lot more rich, human, old-school conversations about the world than I ever did before.I only spend an hour a week on email. I don’t have email on my phone or MacBook, only my desktop. I complete as many tasks as I can in person or via a phone call.Slack was ruining my life – constant notifications, constant buzzing, someone always needed something – so I stopped using it. At first, my anxiety was really strong – “I need to be connected because something bad might happen.” I was addicted to scanning for messages for probably 25 years, so it was hard to just let go – but nothing bad happened when I freed myself from that habit. I’ve never missed an important update, and if the fact that I’m slower to reply annoys anyone, they haven’t told me about it.My partner is fully supportive even if I’m not always contactable. I got out of a depression directly off the back of making these changes, so it’s been a huge net positive.I’ve found the time and space to do things with my children. My daughter and I are doing a painting project in her room, for instance – we just hang out and chat rubbish. My temper is at a different base to where it was when I was constantly behind and felt as if my phone was shouting at me from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep.AJDaily screen timePhone1 hour 30 minutesComputerFive to six hoursTVNone‘I feel shackled to my phone. Adding up thescreen time is embarrassing’Katrina, 31: the social media manager who’s always onlineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI’m reaching for my phone from the moment I open my eyes at 7am. I check the news, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, X and Facebook. I scroll as I brush my teeth and get dressed. I check emails and messages as I walk to the station and more news during my commute.At work I’m triple screening – I switch between my phone, iPad and desktop. I count this as “giving my eyes a break” – they have recently started watering at random moments and I think it’s because I focus on a tiny screen for hours each day. Bigger screens and blue-blocking glasses help my eyes relax. I’ve had other physical effects from so much screen time, too – my back hurts, my shoulders hurt, I feel as if I’m getting a buffalo hump.Most of the time I feel shackled to my phone and it’s tragic. Adding up the hours of screentime is embarrassing, but it’s necessary in my industry. I take my phone to the bathroom so I can scroll on the toilet (I think most people do this, they just don’t admit it). And there are good parts – going viral feels amazing; waking up to a post that’s had 1m views overnight is a huge dopamine rush. In 2024, I organised a Harry Styles lookalike contest in London. It blew up, it made global news – that’s the power of social media.By the end of the day my brain is fried and I feel exhaustedLike most people who make themselves visible online, I’ve been trolled. I’ve had death threats and some really personal comments about being in an interracial relationship. I read them all, I just don’t let them bother me. If someone says something mean to me online I just think, “That’s not real, so I don’t care.”By the end of the day my brain is fried and I feel exhausted. If I’m not working, I’ll watch a couple of hours of TV or scroll TikTok to wind down – its algorithm knows exactly what I want to see, so it’s better than television because it’s curated to my mind. TikTok also connects me with other people from my community. Around Diwali, for instance, I could see people talking about what it meant to them.For a while I got into a habit of waking in the night to check news alerts – there was a period of rising tension between India and Pakistan which caused me a lot of anxiety. Now when I’m looking at my phone in bed, my husband will put his hands on my eyes and say, “It’s time to put your phone away.” Sometimes I just wait until he’s fallen asleep and get it back out.AJDaily screen timePhone12 hrs, overlapping with …Computer8 hoursTV2 hoursExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaAppsDigital mediaTikTokInstagramWhatsAppYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As established in the first piece in our series, liberals have totally failed to grasp this fact. The right, however, are thriving in this new world. Future historians studying the role that fringe online ideas played in the US republic’s demise will be spoiled for choice. One episode in particular comes to mind: Tucker Carlson, a former primetime speaker at a Republican convention, inviting a white supremacist livestreamer, Nick Fuentes,on to his YouTube show in 2025for a chat in which he talked about the influence of “organised Jewry” in the US.Carlsonspent yearsechoing white nationalist talking points on his Fox News show, but Fuentes’ style – combiningNazi saluteswith cheeky grins – places him beyond the pale for broadcast television. However, under the logic of YouTube, the meeting of these two major influencers is almost inevitable. Platforms incentivise audience cross-pollination, which is why Fuentes routinely livestreams with figures such as Adin Ross and Andrew Tate, who are known more for their homophobia and misogyny than their thoughts on ethnostates.Establishment politicians have denounced Carlson, but despite – or perhaps because of – the backlash, his subscriberaccount continues to climb steadilyafter hosting Fuentes, who was rewarded for his appearance with morethan100,000 new X followers. For every corporate advertiser that pulls out, another selling, say, seed-oil-free beef tallow crisps will find a new market of people looking to resist establishment corruption with something natural and authentic.But this is not just about follower counts. It is also about harnessing online engagement and turning it into a worldview. If you can cultivate online engagement, you can create new political styles and advance even the most extreme political ideas, such astotal remigration. Only a year ago, this call to deport anyone with a migrant background – potentiallyeven naturalised citizens– wastoo toxicfor far-right parties to embrace openly. Now, the US Department for Homeland Securityposts calls for remigration on X,and Alice Weidel, leader of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – the second-largest party in the Bundestag – has incorporatedremigrationinto the party’s official platform.Reform UK – not so much a party as a corporation orbiting an influencer – understands the power of this politics well. When LBC’s Nick Ferrari recently tried to pin Nigel Farage down over Donald Trump’s dubious suggestion that paracetamol causes autism,Farage framed itas a question of national sovereignty, saying the important thing is not to cede ground to the World Health Organization, which “now seem to want to take some extraordinary powers that would allow them to lock us down in the future”. A large audience could interpret this as a reference to the“great reset” conspiracy, a vague conspiracy theory that encompasses the loss of civil liberties and the creation of a new economic system.This theory remains a touchstone years after the pandemic because it joins the dots between the upheaval of lockdown and the political and economic instability that has followed. This is why Joe Rogan and Tate were quick to link Labour’s digital ID scheme to the “great reset”. Reactionary digital politics tells a compelling story: a nebuloustheyhave gone too far and must be resisted. This niche online view then helps to shape a wider worldview that can influence voters during elections. Once ideas such as remigration or worries over the “great reset” find a mainstream audience, they exist alongside debates about cutting taxes and funding the NHS, and their extremist origins get buried.As well as the ability to influence public opinion, there is also the chance of earning cold hard cash for enterprising posters. The since-deleted X account @EuropeInvasions helped spark the July 2024 riots with a post claiming the Southport attacker was a “Muslim immigrant”. The post was viewed nearly 7m times. Over the next month, the account’s relentlessly Islamophobic posts attracted almost 240m views. X’s ad revenue-sharing programme is opaque, but based onother users’ stated earnings, in August 2024 @EuropeInvasions would have earned roughly $2,000.This convergence of monetary incentives with ideologically charged engagement produces a kind of ambient extremism in contemporary politics. Far-right ideas, memes and tropes that were once confined to the fringes of 4chan and Telegram now circulate as part of mainstream discourse, where they no longer stand out as extreme. In the span of a few weeks in the summer of 2024,Jordan Petersoninterviewed Farage, Tommy Robinson and Elon Musk. Robinson’s rants about grooming gangs did the best numbers. Soon after, Musk began calling Starmer “two-tier Keir” adopting one of Robinson’s favoured phrases, which Reform also adopted.Robinson’s blunt-force communication style wears thin, but the secret of his current success is his ability to tie his far-right project to the playfulness of meme culture and the self-help discourse of reactionary gurus such as Peterson. Musk welcoming him back to X has been a massive boon as well. As an influencer, he is in a far better position to shape British politics than he was as leader of the English Defence League. He can let the currents of the attention economy carry him along.There are risks involved: as Trump has learned, as his QAnon posting comes back to bite him with the Jeffrey Epstein debacle, many can feed online attention, but none can control it. Nor can they satiate it. Robinson firstclaimed victoryfor Labour’s hardline asylum reforms and then described the home secretary as a “Pakistani” who has “welcomed the invaders”. Musk has suggested that there could be civil war in the UK. Scenes from the US of masked agents nabbing people off the streets – and evenfrom daycarecentres – and shooting civilians is a grim reminder that what starts online can end in real-life violence.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London"

The culture shock is significant | David RayfieldRead moreA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlostopped using appssuch as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.Last week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.The continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.Charges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.In recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.Workers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.It was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.Urban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.Dreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.However, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.Dreams declined to comment.Temper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.Statutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”Temper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”It said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”Temper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.Explore more on these topicsGig economyRetail industryHospitality industryMinimum wageWorkers' rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.Meta’sMark Zuckerbergis among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.The initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap andTikTokhave settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.Why are social media companies on trial?The legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies fromangry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”Why are these cases unprecedented?The cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.There’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.What are the legal arguments?Plaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.The trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thingMetais doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.What does science say about social media addiction?Social media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however,catalogued compulsive use with severe consequencesamong young people, andlegislators across the worldare engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.Which tech executives are testifying?Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan andInstagramCEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.A Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.Google spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.What evidence is already unsealed?While much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employeecompared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.The 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes,according to NPR.Will big tech win?Legal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.Still, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaUS justice systemMetaTikTokInstagramSnapchatDigital mediaexplainersShareReuse this content"

In prosperous Denmark, which was all-in on petrol and diesel cars until just before Covid, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reached a share of 68%. In California, the share of zero-emissions vehicles hit 20%. And at least every third new car now bought by the Dutch, Finns, Belgians and Swedes burns no fuel.These figures, which would have felt fanciful just five years ago, show the rich world leading the shift away from cars that pump out toxic gas and planet-heating pollutants. But a more startling trend is that electric car sales are also racing ahead in many developing countries. While China is known for its embrace of electric vehicles (EVs), demand has also soared in emerging markets from South America to south-east Asia. BEV sales in Turkey havecaught upwith the EU’s, data published this week shows.Is the electric car revolution finally entering the fast lane? Let’s take a look – after this week’s most important reads.Essential readsThe Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?The UK government didn’t want you to see this report on ecosystem collapse.

Burn gas instead of coal, or replace power plants with wind turbines or solar panels, and you can slash the amount of planet-heating gas spewed into the atmosphere for little cost.Now, early signs suggest transportation may be on the brink of delivering similar wins. EVs have quickly gained ground in markets outside Europe and North America, avoiding a rise in fuel-burning vehicles and “leapfrogging” the development path that richer countries have taken in transport.“Five years ago you might have thought [transportation] is really going to be a bottleneck [for climate progress],” says William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But now with the widescale adoption of EVs, it’s looking a little bit easier.”The EV race has gone global, according to areport(pdf) published last month by Ember, a climate thinktank, which looked at BEV and plug-in hybrid sales for the first 10 months of last year. It found 39 countries around the world have an electric sales share above 10%, up from just four countries (all in Europe) in 2019. Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have overtaken the EU in their EV uptake. India, Mexico and Brazil have overtaken Japan.“It’s good news that we’re seeing growth in the EV market in more countries now,” said Robbie Andrew, a scientist who tracks electric vehicle sales at Cicero, a research centre in Oslo, the world’s EV capital. “In developing countries, this is largely about the recent arrival of much cheaper models from China. The Chinese companies have innovated extraordinarily quickly.”Half of the cars registered in China last year were electric, and carmakers such as BYD have driven the boom in much of the global south. The Ember report found that three of the ten largest-value markets for Chinese EV exports are outside the OECD – Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia – while the value of its exports to non-OECD countries and Mexico has tripled in the last two years.The countries that benefit range from Ethiopia, which in 2024 became the first nation toban imports of combustion engine cars, to Nepal, a polluted countryscarred by a blockade11 years ago that left it with severe petrol shortages. But it is not just the Chinese driving progress. Turkey’s share of BEV sales hit 17% last year – the same as the EU’s – in a transition led by domestic carmaker Togg. It has overtaken Tesla as the country’s leading supplier, with BYD in third place.The question of whether to buy an electric vehicle has also been complicated by a culture war surrounding some of the brands that make them.Tesla has seen sales plummetacross Europe and the US in response to Elon Musk’s support for far-right parties, and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. But in Turkey, the brand is viewed somewhat more favourably.“If you have a Togg in Turkey, some people think you are a government-lover and a political Islamist,” says Berke Astarcioğlu, an engineer from Istanbul and an early adopter of EVs. “But if you have aTesla, you are seen as secular, educated and open-minded.”A challenge for developing countries seeking to sustain the EV boom is whether they can build charging infrastructure fast enough to avoid customer frustration. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the global charging stock, areportby the International Energy Agency found last year. But charging infrastructure in many other markets is lagging behind EV adoption rates.There are also fears the surge in EVs may taper out as the rich customer base in lower- and middle-income countries is exhausted. New cars are generally bought by wealthier residents, while others buy theirs second-hand.Still, in places like Turkey and Thailand (to name two of many), where falling prices and rising subsidies bring the price of EVs in line with petrol cars, Andrew says the question of whether only the rich can afford them falls away. “With price parity, people buy the cars because they’re simply better and cost less to run.”If that trend continues to spread around the world, we may soon see electric cars leave their fume-belching rivals in the dust.Read more:Powering up: how Ethiopia is becoming an unlikely leader in the electric vehicle revolution‘My Tesla has become ordinary’: Turkey catches up with EU in electric car salesThe electric vehicle revolution is still on course – don’t let your loathing of Elon Musk stop you joining upTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletterElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsClimate crisisTeslaTravel and transportGreenhouse gas emissionsMotoringnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Dopredicted a future in which a student “sits in a college library and removes an electronic device from her purse”. It serves as her “mobile phone, information portal, entertainment platform, and personal organiser. She takes this device almost everywhere and feels lost without it.”Such devices, Fogg argued, would be “persuasive technology systems … the device can suggest, encourage, and reward.” Those rewards could have a powerful effect on our relationship with these devices, akin to gamblers pumping quarters into slot machines.Four years later, Apple launched the first iPhone. At Stanford University, Fogg taught Behavior Design Boot Camps that Wired magazine called “a toll booth for entrepreneurs and product designers on their way to Facebook and Google”. There, Fogg proved his theory to be spectacularly true: portable computers really could be used to “change what we think and do”.As it turns out, one of the main ways they do so is by compelling us to spend hours and hours in front of them. Today, anxiety around screen time is ubiquitous throughout the generations.Ofcom foundnearly a quarter of UK five- to seven-year-olds have their own phone, with 38% using social media. But it’s just as likely the oldies among us will be spending hours on ours. I was shocked to find my daily average was over four hours: mostly before and after sleeping, spent on news websites and YouTube.There is huge debate in academia as to the effect smartphones, and their social media apps, are having on us. While psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge argue that they make children more anxious, fragile and depressed, and amplify political polarisation, others, including Pete Etchells and Amy Orben, believe the evidence for this is thin.I am inclined to think the effect of Apple’s brilliant invention, plus Fogg’s dark genius, has been profound. My use of these machines has been compulsive: when I walk my dogs having left my phone at home, I find myself repeatedly grabbing for an empty coat pocket, my arm moving independently of free will. I read fewer books because of social media; I concentrate less in front of films and TV shows. I watch YouTube more than the BBC, ITV or Channel 4. I have been through phases of forcing myself on to a virtually app-less dumb phone, but the convenience and often necessity of maps, parking apps and train tickets pushed me back.My main impression of how the world has changed is we’re all a lot more pissed off with each other. And I really do blame phonesYet my smartphone has affected my life in often negative ways. The world I disappear to inside it has made me – and probably you – angrier. That’s my main impression of how the world has changed since 2007: we’re all a lot more pissed off with each other. And I really do blame phones. Humans are profoundly social and wired to solve the problems of existence by forming into collaborative groups. When we feel we belong and are valued, we’re happy; when we feel isolated and worthless, we become anxious and depressed.Smartphones have gamified and monetised these powerful aspects of human nature. They don’t benignly offer us the connection and status we desire: they strategically withdraw it in order to drive engagement. Whenever we’re outraged by the behaviour of an identity group that’s not our own, it’s an attack on our status: we are drawn further into our phones to find out more and perhaps take part in a counterattack – an attempt to restore our threatened status and reinforce the connection with our team. We’re made to feel good or bad by likes, reposts, comments or follower-counts, but our phone issues these precious rewards unpredictably, just as a slot machine does – and just as Fogg described. It’s this unpredictability that helps make them compulsive.For us deeply social animals, much of our social life now takes place inside apps designed to manipulate via the manufacturing of social competition and tribal conflict. Of course we’re tired and angry and suspicious of each other. But at least we have a greater awareness of this now. More than 60 Labour MPs have recentlyurged the prime ministerto follow the example of Australia where under-16s have been prohibited from using social media sites.My own social media habit has been mostly vanquished by dint of the sites becoming dreadful. Instagram – where I used to post photos and enjoy those of friends and colleagues – now forces me to watch endless short videos by annoying people I have no interest in. Facebook is mostly absent of news from friends and family, and is instead a stinking river of dreadful memes and inane arguments. What was Twitter – a useful tool for promoting my work – has been superseded by X and Bluesky, both useless for this and petri dishes for the worst of human behaviour.I do worry, however, about what is coming. The heavy-handed way in which large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, flatter egos to give users a sense of status is currently a bit of a joke. But LLMs are new, and will rapidly improve. Human psychology is eminently hackable – as dogs have learned over tens of thousands of years, and romance scammers have figured out in 20. As BJ Fogg predicted, “suggest, encourage, and reward” and we will be yours. The deviceSam Altman and Jony Iveare rumoured to be making, in which a wearable AI buddy will accompany us all day, learning about us and helping us and telling us we’re great, has the potential to burrow into our minds and become a relationship that feels essential and profound – the ultimate example of a technology that can “change what we think and do”.Will Storr’s book And You’ll Be Okay Forever: Selected Essays is out now.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMobile phonesSmartphonesSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why?Sat 31 Jan 2026 11.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 11.32 ESTShareThe justice department released a trove of 3.5m files related to the dead financier and pedophile sex traffickerJeffrey Epsteinon Friday, with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche declaring that the release would likely be the last major declassification of files relating to Epstein. Federal prosecutors had identified 6 million files that were “potentially responsive” to the law, meaning that there are millions of files that have still not been released.The release marked a belated and partial compliance with a bill passed by Congress late last year, which had mandated that all government documents pertaining to Epstein and the various law enforcement investigations into his sexual abuse of girls be made public by 19 December 2025.Representatives Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Ro Khanna, a Democrat, quickly condemned the incomplete release and demanded access to the un-redacted files.“The DOJ said it identified over 6 million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions. This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld,” Khanna said, adding: “Failing to release these files only shields the powerful individuals who were involved and hurts the public’s trust in our institutions.”The Republicans’ latest Clinton stunt will not work | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe justice department had long complained that the sheer volume of files related to Epstein and the delicate nature of some of the information contained therein meant that they needed more time to redact sensitive information related to victims, and that therefore only some documents could be released.On Friday, in aletterto Congress, Blanche claimed that some tens of thousands additional documents were not being made public, both because of the presence of child sexual abuse material and because of information contained therein which could identify and endanger victims. But many of the documents made available to the public on Friday did in fact contain names and other sensitive information about women Epstein abused, leading some victims to condemn the Department of Justice’s “betrayal” andobserversto wonder what, exactly, the justice department has been doing with the documents, if not redacting such sensitive content.That the documents’ release was announced by Blanche, and not by his boss, attorney general Pam Bondi, reflects growing tensions within the administration as criticism continues to mount over the bungled response to the Epstein controversy and questions about the nature of Donald Trump’s apparently longstanding and intimate friendship with Epstein persist.In making his announcement, Blanche, who previously worked as Trump’s personal criminal defense attorney,insistedthat the justice department “did not protect Trump” in its decisions about what to redact and release. The White House, he said, “had no oversight” and “did not tell this department how to do our review, and what to look for, and what to redact or not redact”.However, he also claimed that Trump did in fact express preferences regarding the review, claiming that the president has pushed for “maximum transparency”. The US president had opposed the release of the files until it became clear that a congressional vote would override him late last year.The documents themselves contain 2,000 videos and 180,000 images related to Epstein, though according to Blanche, many of these were not taken by Epstein himself, but were gathered as part of the dead man’s estate – including a large cache of commercial pornography, in addition to the homemade abuse material depicting Epstein’s underage victims.The cache also appears to contain a large number ofuncorroboratedtips to authorities from members of the public about Epstein’s conduct, several of which come from people who claimed in their messages to have been abused by Donald Trump.Journalists at the Guardian and elsewhere continue to comb through the material – which is uploaded tens of thousands of files at a time to the Department of Justice’s website, with no index and no explanation of how or when particular documents were obtained. The full picture of what is revealed by the newly unsealed documents will not emerge for some time.But it is unlikely that the new material will quell the public’s interest in the case, or mitigate their sense that Epstein and his impunity represent a paradigmatic example of the ruling elite’s personal corruption, their imperviousness to law or consequence, and their back-scratching, malignant coziness with one another.Already, the newly released documents further underscore the extent to which Epstein was integrated into the social life of some of the worlds’ most powerful people, even after he was initially convicted of charges relating to child sexual abuse in 2008. Among other things, the emails show that in 2012, the businesspersonHoward Lutnik– now Trump’s commerce secretary – appears to have visited Epstein’s private Island with his wife and children. Lutnik hadpreviously claimedthat he had cut off contact with Epstein around 2005, before the financier’s initial conviction.How many big names have paid the price for being linked to Jeffrey Epstein? Fewer than you might think | Emma BrockesRead moreIn a 2013 emailexchangebetween Epstein and the billionaire Richard Branson, Branson writes to Epstein: “Anytime you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a large-scale financial backer of Donald Trump and other Republican candidates, had previously posted on X that Epstein “tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED”. But the emailsshow a warmer relationshipbetween Musk and Epstein, and in 2012 Musk wrote to Epstein with enthusiasm about the prospect of visiting the pedophile financier’s Caribbean island. “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk asked. Both men have denied wrongdoing and attempted to downplay the extent of their connections to Epstein.TheTrump administrationworked hard throughout 2025 to avoid the release of the Epstein files; once the groundswell of public pressure to publish them became too great for congress to resist, they have worked to minimize the public’s sense that the documents reveal anything particularly damning, at least for the president and his allies.But the administration cannot contain the Epstein story because by its nature, the scandal reveals the untrustworthiness and mendacity of the very elites that Trump and his movement now represent. Todd Blanche had an unenviable task on Friday, standing up before the nation to claim that the administration had nothing to hide, that the people in power are acting in good faith and telling the public the whole story. After what the world has learned about those people in power from the Epstein story itself, will anyone believe him?Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

As the US grows increasingly violent, increasingly cruel, every day brings a legion of new horrors. So I’m very sorry to say that I’m here to ruin your weekend by giving you yet another thing to worry about. That thing is called theSave Actand, if the Trump administration gets its way, it could have an oversized impact on the November midterms, particularly when it comes to minorities and married women being able to vote.A good rule of thumb when looking at a Republican-drafted bill or campaign is that its name is directly the opposite of whatever it is meant to achieve. If there is something about ‘protecting women’ in thetitle, for example, then it’s probably actually about controlling women or bullying transgender people. The same is true of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which would change the way US citizensregister to vote. The purpose of the bill doesn’t seem to be to safeguard democracy but to help destroy it through stealth disenfranchisement.If it became law, the Save Act would require Americans to provide a birth certificate, passport, or other citizenship document to register or re-register to vote. Per one Brennan Center Study, more that21 millionAmerican citizens, many of whom are engaged voters, do not have easy access to these documents. While just over 8% of self-identified white American citizens don’t have these documents readily available, the Brennan Center found the number is nearly 11% among Americans of color.Women who changed their name when they got married may also face a logistical nightmare:reports showthat as many as 69 million women who have taken their spouse’s name don’t have a birth certificate that matches their legal name. “The legislation does not mention the potential option for these Americans to present change-of-name documentation or a marriage certificate in combination with a birth certificate to prove their citizenship,” the liberal thinktank the Center for American Progressnoted.To make things even more complicated for everyone, the Save Act would alsodisrupt online voter registration. Americans would have to appear in person, with their original documents, simply to update their voter registration information.A proof-of-citizenship law similar to the Save Act has been tried before, by the way, including between 2013 and 2017in Kansas. And guess what? It was an expensive disaster that prevented more than 30,000 Kansans from voting. It’s well-established that these sorts of laws disproportionately harm low-income, disabled, married women, and marginalized voters. Why are the Republicans so keen on making it harder for these groups to vote? I’m sure I don’t need to spell it out for you.Of course the Save Act isn’t being presented as a way for Republicans to sneakily sway the midterms in their favour asconfidence in Trump dips. Rather, it’s being presented as a way to stop fraudulent voting. “[W]e all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,” house speaker Mike Johnson said during a press conference about the act when it was first introducedin May 2024. “But it’s not been something that is easily provable.” I think we all know, intuitively, that it’s not easily provable because that claim is nonsense. And, in fact, we don’t need to rely on intuition, we have data! OneBrennan Center for Justice studythat looked at the 2016 election found just 0.0001% of votes (30 incidents) across 42 jurisdictions, with a total of 23.5m votes, were suspected to include non-citizens voting. Non-citizens voting is already illegal and not a problem that needs to be solved with new legislation.So just how likely is it that the Save Act, or some version of it, will get passed before the midterms? Unclear, but looking increasingly likely by the day, unfortunately. The Save Actpassedin the House in 2025 but then stalled in the Senate. Now, however, there’s a lot of new momentum to try and get it over the line. In a speech to House Republicans at the beginningof the year, Trump urged lawmakers to pass a national voter ID law ahead of the 2026 midterm election and his cronies have ramped up their efforts to draft what House majority leader Steve Scalise recently called an “even stronger” version of the Save Act.And, of course, if it’s not the Save Act it’ll be something else. The Trump administration has beenbusy chipping awayat the mechanisms that keep election systems free and fair. They can’t (yet) get away with cancelling the November midterms but they can destroy faith in the system throughbaseless claimsof voter fraud. They canredrawcongressional maps and try to impose onerous voting requirements.This, of course, is how democracy dies. Not in darkness, but in daily headlines. Not with a bang, but with a relentless barrage of paperwork. Not with one power-hungry man breaking the law, but with his legion of acolytes weaponizing it.Man accused of attacking Ilhan Omar charged with assaultAnthony Kazmierczak faces federalchargesafterinterruptingthe Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar at a town hall and spraying her with what is now determined to have been apple cider vinegar. After she was relentlessly criticized by the president, some sort of attack on Omar felt inevitable and it’s lucky this one wasn’t worse. “[E]very time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said onWednesday.Older women ‘disappear’ from BBC presenting rolesAnindependent review ofthe British broadcaster found nearly four times as many male presenters over 60 as female in the BBC’s content division and nearly twice as many older men than women in BBC News. This seems to be caused by perceptions that men gain “gravitas and wisdom” as they age. Surely a gander at the president of the US, who gets more manic by the minute, should quickly dispel this idea.The traumatizing impact of the Taliban’s informal birth control banWhile there isn’t an official ban on contraceptives, Afghanistan’s reproductive health system has been decimated over the pastfew years. “After the Taliban came, the contraceptives started reducing,” one doctortold the Guardian. “Within months, they were gone.” The result is more lethal pregnancies and miscarriages that can’t be treated.Shirley Raines, Beauty 2 the Streetz founder, dies at 58The Los Angeles-based activist, known as “Ms Shirley” to her more than 5 million TikTok followers, brought beauty treatments and other servicesto vulnerable people on Skid Row.The war on journalists in Gaza continuesDespite a supposed ‘ceasefire’, international journalistsare still notfreely allowed in Gaza and Palestinian journalists continue tobe killedby Israel. Western journalists should be in uproar about this assault on press freedom. Instead the likes of CBS are simply parrotingIsrael’s talking points.“From the heart, brains, and boobs of Sydney Sweeney”…… comes a new lingerie label called Syrn. And, as you can tell from the marketing copy, it isnot subtle at all. The promo for Sweeney’s latest venture is also in-your-face: the actor, sometimes known as “Maga Barbie”, decorated theHollywood signwith bras. Whether she got permission to do this is unclear and there’s some chatter that she could get in trouble for trespassing. Only kidding! As the Trump administration keeps demonstrating, it’s OK for certain people (particularly those with the right “jeans”) to break the rules. Laws are for poors.The week in pawtriarchyGrrrr-ipping news from San Francisco’s Pacific Heights neighborhood where a live TV report on the capture of a young mountain lion wasinterrupted by a coyotestrolling past the camera.

They should stand firmClaire FinkelsteinMinnesota should not cave to Trump’s demands. The rights of 49 other states and their citizens are hanging in the balanceSat 31 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 10.40 ESTShareDonald Trump appears to be practicing his “art of the deal” on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz: he is attempting to extract concessions from the North Star state in exchange for a “drawdown” of federal ICE agents. While the details of the contemplated agreement are not clear, border czar Tom Homan’sremarks on Thursday morningand reports of his negotiations with state and local leaders suggest dialing back Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is contingent on strikingan agreementfor increased cooperation between federal and local law enforcement: Minnesota must agree to participate in ICE roundups by turning over undocumented immigrants in its custody, ending various “sanctuary city” protections, and giving ICE agents more direct access to state penitentiaries to conduct their own roundups prior to the release of undocumented inmates. Aletterfrom Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, sent earlier this week went even further and suggested the justice department’s civil rights division might be demanding access to state voter rolls in exchange for the ICE drawdown. Trump’soffhand remarkThursday evening denying plans to draw down ICE confused matters by contradicting Homan’s statement from earlier in the day – but perhaps that was just an indication that negotiations on Thursday did not go all that well for Team Trump.That would not be surprising. If Walz were to agree to such terms – concessions literally extracted at gunpoint under threat of continued use of unlawful force by federal immigration agents – he would be abandoning critical domains of state autonomy for the fruitless attempt to appease a president that will accept no limits except those forced upon it by necessity or recommended to it by self-interest. As law firms, universities, foreign leaders, and even former partners in crime have discovered, it is perilous to negotiate with a rank opportunist who lives by no other rule than that of self-interest. For Trump, the alternative to getting handed what he wants voluntarily is taking it by force. TheFBI raidon the Fulton county elections office in Georgia to seize about 700 boxes of ballots from the 2020 election sent a well-timed message to Minnesota as well as to any other swing state from which the Trump administration may demand such data: if you don’t give us what we asked for, we’ll take it anyway.A deal with Minnesota may also target another critical area of state autonomy, namely the state’s authority over its own prosecutorial process, including access to crime scene investigations. Two Americans have been shot dead by the federal government, and the state of Minnesota will need to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute the agents who carried out these crimes. That will prove inconvenient for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as any such investigation could reveal embarrassing information about the origins of the systematic violations of lawful rules for the use of force. Perhaps this is why DHS isbarringstate investigators from accessing the crime scene, despite their possession of an appropriate warrant from a federal judge.The right to investigate and eventually prosecute government officials can be a powerful tool for enhancing transparency and exposing government corruption. Under prosecutorial pressure, government officials tend to defend themselves by saying they were acting according to their orders and consistent with any training they received. Indeed, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, even took this tack in a 24 January press conference when sheinsistedthat the agents who shot Alex Pretti were responding “according to their training”. That was a significant admission against interest: rather than throwing those agents (who remain unidentified) and Jonathan Ross (who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good) under the bus, the Trump administration has signaled in every possible way that they intend to protect them. A state investigation, however, could expose not only the federal agents in question to potential murder charges under state law, but higher-ups like Noem herself to criminal investigation and possible prosecution.Presumably in part to forestall this possibility, the federal government has consistently argued that the state lacks the authority to prosecute federal agents. JD Vance tipped his hand when hedeclaredthat federal agents had “absolute immunity”, a statement he later appeared to walk back when he said that ICE officers who violated the lawcould be investigated. But we can predict from other Trump-era litigation that the president will argue that state courts lack the authority to exercise judgment over federal officers – a version of theclaim Trump madein his own prosecution by Fani Willis in the Georgia election interference case.Protecting the state’s ability to prosecute anyone who commits crimes within its jurisdiction is more important than the short-term goal of getting ICE out of Minnesota and is not worth trading away. It may even be more important than protecting the autonomy of state elections. This is because in the long run, ensuring that states can enforce the law in their own jurisdictions is the only true protection states and their residents have from a federal government that would threaten their first amendment rights, detain their citizens without due process, invade their homes without a warrant, steal their elections, and yes, kill their citizens in cold blood the streets. The ability to investigate and to prosecute crime ultimately protects all the other rights of states and their citizens under the US constitution.Minnesota is the thin edge of the wedge for states’ rights and the ability of states to protect their citizens. The rights of 49 other states and their citizens are hanging in the balance.Claire Finkelstein is the Algernon Biddle professor of law and professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.

And he is not the only oneSeth SternThursday’s arrests of Lemon and independent journalist Georgia Fort demonstrate the administration’s lawless crusade against routine journalismFri 30 Jan 2026 19.05 ESTFirst published on Fri 30 Jan 2026 16.30 ESTShareTwo federal courts reviewed the government’s evidence against journalist Don Lemon and declined to approve his arrest last week. But nevertheless, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, persisted, desperate to please her authoritarian boss no matter what the constitution and law say or what her ethical obligations as an attorney require.Thursday’sarrestsof Lemon and Georgia Fort, an independent journalist – like the recentraidon Hannah Natanson, the Washington Post reporter – demonstrate the administration’s lawless crusade against routine journalism. In normal times the expectation is that even when a journalist’s conduct might technically fit the legal elements of a crime – jaywalking to get footage of a protest, for example – prosecutors will exercise their discretion and judgment to not apply the law in a manner that chills the free press.Those assumptions are inverted now. Even when journalists’ conduct is plainly non-criminal, prosecutors will work overtime to figure out some way to harass them, no matter how frivolous. Discouraging journalists from doing their job is not a side-effect they seek to avoid – it’s the whole point. There is no telling what nonsensical legal theories the administration may advance if it decides to make an example of a reporter it doesn’t like. The law and constitution are only marginally relevant – the only real rule is don’t piss off Trump.The two federal laws under which Lemon and Fort are reportedly charged are entirely inapplicable.One punishesconspiracies to stop people from exercising constitutional rights. The journalists, of course, didn’t conspire with anyone to do anything nefarious. They simply documented news. It’s ironic that Lemon and Fort are accused of exactly what the Trump administration actually did – intimidating those who exercise core constitutional freedoms, like documenting news. In fact the very nextsectionof the criminal code prohibits deprivation of constitutional rights “under color of law”, ie, by the government. Maybe the officials involved in Lemon and Fort’s arrests should think about lawyering up.Theother lawbeing wielded against the journalists similarly requires an intent to interfere with religious worship (or access to reproductive health clinics), not the lawful documentation of news events by journalists who neither plan protests nor participate in them.Journalists follow the news – they don’t decide where it happens. Protesters in Minneapolis chose to demonstrate at the church because the pastor was a higher-up with ICE – one of the federal agencies terrorizing their city and murdering their neighbors – not because some journalists told them to.For those of us who have been monitoring press freedom abuses at the local level, it’s all too familiarThese recent developments are unprecedented at the federal level – never before has an attorney general personally involved herself in pursuing vindictive criminal charges against journalists the administration doesn’t like, who merely covered a protest. But for those of us who have been monitoring press freedom abuses at the local level (my employer, Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) operates theUS Press Freedom Trackerdatabase), it’s all too familiar.When Natanson was raided,we pointedto the 2023 raid of the Marion County Record in rural Kansas on sham allegations that reporters broke identity theft laws, as well as the raid the same year of the Florida journalist Tim Burke’s home newsroom over nonsensical computer crime charges for publishing news he found online.This time, the first case that came to mind was that of the North Carolina journalists Matilda Bliss and Veronica Coit of theAsheville Blade. It’s a small, self-proclaimed leftist news co-op with which local officials have long feuded.On Christmas night of 2021, Bliss and Coit went to a public park to document a homeless encampment sweep. Their filming of the obviously newsworthy event was routine, except that the park closed at 10pm, and police chose to conduct the encampment sweep after that time. They were arrested, charged and convicted, to the dismay of press freedom advocates everywhere – after all, they didn’t decide where and when news would take place.The cases against Lemon and Fort may be even weaker given the legal elements of the laws under which they were charged. But they underscore the same absurdity. What if police had shot someone at the encampment sweep (an even more realistic possibility at protests in Minneapolis)? Would reporters be expected to not report the news due to a curfew?When an outlet like the Blade is targeted it’s easy to assume that more mainstream reporters with larger audiences have nothing to worry about. Obviously, that’s not so. We shouldn’t give the Trump administration too much credit for creativity – their playbooks have been tested outside of the national headlines in places like Asheville.The Blade is not the only example. Before Trump’s administration sought to charge Lemon and Fort under a conspiracy law, nonsensically connecting dots between their first amendment-protectedconductand alleged crimes by protesters, prosecutors in Atlanta tried (and failed) to convict people who had merely distributed pamphlets or held press conferences for “conspiring” with other activists opposing the “Cop City” police training facility who allegedly committed real crimes. Trump’s federal prosecutors tried something similar last year byindictingthe Texas activist Daniel “Des” Sanchez for conspiring to conceal evidence by transporting anarchist literature after a protest attended by his wife where someone else allegedly shot a police officer.Once again, what starts on the fringes at the local level previews what’s to come in the national news headlines. If local authorities like those who targeted Biss and Coit in furtherance of their own petty grudges don’t like what they’re seeing from the Trump administration, they need to take a good look in the mirror. And journalists need to be the ones to hold that mirror up to their censorial faces. Reporters are often reluctant to make themselves the story, but they’re not the ones doing that, the government is.Of course these days being seen as navel-gazing isn’t the only thing journalists may be afraid of. It’s understandable – no one wants to be arrested. But the Trump administration’s unconstitutional prosecutions haverepeatedlyfailedin court because judges and juries don’t find them credible (unfortunately, the judges who rule against the administration have largely declined to sanction or hold in contempt attorneys who disregard the law – hopefully that’ll change in Lemon and Fort’s cases). We’ve already seen in Minneapolis that public pressure makes a difference, even with this administration. Fighting back has a far better track record than self-censorship andcapitulation, which only invites more attacks.Seth Stern is the director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation and a first amendment lawyerExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But human rights must be more than a debating pointGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastSat 31 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 19.22 ESTShareFor decades, Labor governments have been waiting for a “catalysing political trigger” to convince the opposition that there was a real and urgent need for a comprehensive, codified Australian charter of rights as exists in all other comparable nations.It is a shame that thetragic event at Bondilast December has not yet become that political trigger. The shock was palpable, public sentiment was high, human rights had demonstrably been trashed, lives were lost and irrevocably changed, the social fabric frayed.Clearly something needed to be done to reinforce the rights and safety not just of the Jewish community, but all Australians.Who will bear the brunt of Labor’s hate speech laws? The government has failed to give a clear answer | Luke McNamaraRead moreTheimmediate responseto criminalise and punish was understandable – outlaw hate speech, ban hate groups, prohibit demonstrations and phrases, make the hatred of other human beings and their views go away by force of law and ministerial decree.This punitive response lies deep in the Australian psyche. No doubt it provides a moment of comfort and reassurance that something can be done – visas revoked, bad actors detained and outlawed, arrests made, charges laid, guns bought back.But as UNSW law professorLuke McNamara wrote, “We need to moderate our expectations on how much ever-expanding forms of criminalisation can deliver the community safety and social cohesion to which we aspire. We must also recognise both the harms that can be done by hastily widening the net cast by the criminal law, and that there are often better ways of encouraging public discourse that is both robust and respectful.”Despite thenational day of mourning, “robust and respectful” are probably not the words that come to mind when reflecting on the discourse of the past few weeks.Instead we have had low-grade political posturing.Legislative overreachin two parliaments and retreat into the safe ground of Australian politics: the theatre ofleadership speculation.Give us a break. I don’t really care who leads the Liberal or National party; they have a snowball’s chance in a heatwave of forming government anytime soon. But I do care if we keep putting Band-Aids on top of foundational flaws.It is slightly paradoxical that these parties that for decades were at the forefront of opposing a bill of rights, which would have included freedom of speech as one of its key principles, were the strongest opponents of the proposal to criminalise hate speech.That human rights were again reduced to a debating point in a political game pointed to the need to better define the rights and responsibilities of all citizens and residents. This would be an important step in building the positive social capital that shapes the essence of what it means to be Australian.It only takes a few minutes of watching what is happening on the streets in America to know that a codified bill of rights does not prevent overreach by the state. But public knowledge of these enforceable rights helps embolden the opponents of an out-of-control state.Company handling Australia’s immigration detention playing key role in Trump’s ICE migrant crackdownRead moreDespite longstanding Liberal and National party opposition to legislating for rights, as documented in the comprehensivereportpublished late last year by the Whitlam Institute and the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC), the Australian public hasn’t needed much convincing.More than 50 years of polls, surveys, reports, inquiries, town halls and focus groups have shown that somewhere between 70% and 87% of the population want a codified charter of rights. To know what their rights are and be reassured that they are used to frame policy and legislation. To make the ideal of “a fair go” real. Where everyone has the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, expression, privacy and association, to hold opinions, vote, move, have legal protections and minimum living standards – including for health, education, work, culture and the environment.Instead, if you read the op-eds, debates in parliament or the petitions presented by MPs over decades, you would think that most Australians consider an articulation of rights, such as exists in every comparable country, as an “evil” plot to strip citizens and states of their rights.More than 130 groups have now signed up to the campaign beingled by the HRLC, which considers that more than 80 years after the idea was first put to the Australian people in the 1944 referendum, the time is right to finally catch up with the rest of the world.In the debates leading up to federation 125 years ago, there were some who advocated including a bill of rights, which was already a feature of other constitutions. But the fear that this would limit the power of the colonies that were about to become states presented an insurmountable obstacle. And so it has proved to be ever since.If constitutional change is too hard, there is at least a need for national legislation to buttress the limited rights defined in the constitution and replace the scattered and piecemeal legislation that otherwise frames. To paraphraseMark Carney, the “pleasant fiction” that we don’t need it has been blown apart by events, royal commissions and increasing concern about social cohesion.All that has been lacking has been the political will to act.Sadly, it is a repeated pattern.“They are nowhere near recognising this,” one government insider told me during the week. “It’s just too hard.”But changing the terms of the political debate to a positive assertion of rights could do more to build social capital and enhance social cohesion than punitive laws.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsHuman Rights ActOpinionHuman rightsAustralian politicsAustralian lawcommentShareReuse this content"

There are many factors at play, but the ones with the power here are the big artistsSat 31 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 16.30 ESTShareIn October 2024, Heat magazine’s list of theUK’s 30 richest celebrities under 30ranked Harry Styles at the very top, with an estimated wealth of £200m. (He’d doubtless have fared well in last year’s survey, too, but he’s 31 now.)Whatever your views on the fabulous wealth accrued by a small elite of megastars, and regardless of your opinion of Styles’ musical merits, that figure doesn’t sit well next to the headlines he is now making.Styles announceda record-breaking 12-date residency at Wembley stadium this week, withticket prices for seats rangingfrom £44.10 in the faraway stands right up to £466.24, while bog standard general standing tickets will set you back £144.65 – and a berth in the fancy Circle, Disco, Square and Kiss standing enclosures up to £279.45. Furthermore, access to the presale wasrestricted to American Express cardholdersand anyone who pre-ordered Styles’ new album,Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, which will be released on 6 March. The pricing has sparked an enormous backlash among Styles’ fans for making the shows inaccessible to vast swathes of his audience, a significant proportion of whom are very young.But Styles is no outlier. The attitude towards ticket pricing in the entertainment industry seems to be, overwhelmingly, simply to charge as much as you can get away with charging. In recent years,Adele,Taylor SwiftandOasishave, like Styles, received intense criticism for their steep ticket prices. The last of those three came under particular scrutiny when it became apparent that dynamic pricing was at play, meaning that the original stated face value of tickets for Oasis gigs was essentially meaningless.In November 2025, the government made it illegal to resell tickets for above face value, preventing ripoffs by ticket touts, while the Competition and Markets Authority is making sellers likeTicketmasterbe more clear about pricing – all heartening measures. But there is a broader problem, one the government will find it much harder to intervene in: the rising cost of those face-value tickets in the first place.The best gig I ever saw cost £4. Spiralling concert prices are a cultural disaster | John HarrisRead moreThe age of streaming has had an extraordinary impact on how money is made in the music industry. Everyone understands this, and nobody begrudges musicians jacking up their prices by a modest amount. Rising prices since the pandemic have also made it significantly more expensive to go on tour, due to huge rises in costs for fuel, visas, transportation, labour and more. However, a small elite of megastars have gone cash-crazy on their concert tours.The knock-on effect on the rest of the industry is immense. In these cash-strapped times, people’s pockets aren’t bottomless when it comes to leisure activities such as gigs. VIP types may be able to spend, spend, spend – but many other people make choices. If they pay for one very expensive ticket, will they be less likely to buy others?The average touring band is struggling. At a recent gig, Shirley Manson of Garbageput it well: “You see all these big pop stars, and they’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars and they’re rich and they’re glamorous and they’re amazing. But the problem is that most of the music industry is not made of these big pop stars. They’re made of working musicians.”As well as musicians, smaller venues are also having a torrid time due, at least in part, to the trickle-up economics of the megaconcert industry. During 2023, one in six small venues closed according to theMusic Venue Trust (MVT), and its 2025 report found that more than half of the surviving venues failed to make a profit. And it’s also due in part to the era of the supertour. “If you’re paying £150 or £200 for a stadium ticket,” MVT chief executive Mark Davydhas said, “that inevitably eats into the budget you have to see new or emerging artists.” The end result is that up-and-coming artists have fewer and fewer places to hone their craft on the way to becoming the next Wembley headliner.Even if they do make it through, will the next generation of fans be waiting? What the practice of gouging gig prices fails to take into account is the emotional effect it has on the purchaser. Yes, they’ll pay, but reluctantly and begrudgingly. It leaves a sour taste and can put people off going to gigs entirely, of whatever size. “OK, this is good … but is it £200 good?”Because it’s not even as if the premium-priced experience feels especially luxurious. In my years as rock and pop critic for the Independent on Sunday, my job involved countless trips to the O2, that soulless enormodome where you’re charged captive-audience prices for your drinks and chain-franchise snacks on top of the extortionate ticket, all for the privilege of watching a band so far away that they might as well be on TV. It has all the charm of a night out in terminal five.I’m done with those shows now. I honestly don’t think there’s an artist alive who could drag me to a megaconcert. The most I’ve personally paid for a ticket was £75, forStevie Nicks in Hyde Parkin 2024 – and though she was great, I’m not even sure I was in the same postcode. And while the shows I sawPrince play at the O2 in 2007were among the best I’ve seen, it was despite, not because of, the surroundings.In fairness to Styles, he’sdonating £1 for every ticket he sellsat his own UK megaconcerts to theLive Trust, which works to protect small venues. This shows that deep down heknowssomething’s wrong. It could be, as some have claimed, that his fanbase is non transferable to other kinds of music and other kinds of venue. But still, I think the greatest gift he could give would be to slash his prices, and leave enough money in the pockets of those of his fans who might actually visit one of those threatened venues.It can be done. And it’s often the older generation that leads the way. The 21 shows Prince did at the O2 werepriced at £31.21. More recently,Paul Heaton capped his arena tour tickets at £35. And in 2023, Robert Smithwent to battle with Ticketmasterover excessive booking fees on the Cure’s US tour, insisting that tickets should cost no more than $35, arguing: “You don’t want to charge as much as the market will bear, and squeeze everyone. It doesn’t sit well with me at all.”Of course different shows cost different amounts to stage, but still the point remains. The likes of Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue and Justin Timberlake have at various points staged hi-tech extravaganzas without charging fans the earth. Artists have a duty of care to fans.So, Harry, don’t go poor: but be more Robert Smith, be more Paul Heaton. Leave the money for someone else who needs it more.Simon Price is a music journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsTicket pricesOpinionPop and rockHarry StylesTicketmasterOasisAdeleConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t mean they are shifting to the rightKarin KanekoSanae Takaichi may seemingly have old-fashioned values, but it’s her economic offering that has captured young people’s imaginationsSat 31 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 05.08 ESTShareJapan has rarely seen a prime minister as bold or as social media-savvy asSanae Takaichi, the country’s first female leader.Where previous prime ministers have gone viral for unflattering moments, such as the spectacle of one scoffing an onigiri in one messy gulp or another caughtdozing off in the parliamentduring a key vote, Takaichi is being read by supporters as a symbol of a different era of leadership – one they feel Japan has lacked in recent years.In January alone, Takaichi’s early diplomatic outings have produced the kind of viral imagery Japanese politics rarely generates.A clip of her drummingwith South Korean president Lee Jae Myung to global sensation BTS’s Dynamite and Golden from Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters spread rapidly online, with some viewers even assuming it was AI-generated. Many expected her to clash with Lee, so the clip helped boost her image as a dependable leader who can navigate through geopolitical challenges.Her appeal isn’t confined to diplomacy. She is so popular that she even has her own fandom, “Sana-katsu” – something more commonly seen with idols rather than prime ministers – complete with adoring supporters circulating clips and copying her look, even down to using the same pen.But there is a unique paradox at the heart of her appeal, especially among young supporters. Outside Japan, Takaichi is oftenframed as not particularly feministwith her socially conservative stance – including her opposition to legal reforms that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames, and same-sex marriage. Traditionally, these are issues that would be important to a progressive, young population.So what explains her unusually high approval among such age groups? In a Sankei Shimbun/FNN poll conducted in mid-December, approval for her cabinet was 92% among those aged between 18 and 29 – a rarity when most young voters are often disengaged from politics.At a glance, it might appear thatJapanis shifting to the right – a trend seen across the world – especially as anxiety about immigration and foreign residents becomes a more visible political theme. In Japan, it is more amplified as Japanese citizens grapple with their identity as a homogeneous society and the reality that their population is declining.But a deeper look may reveal that the answer is more likely to be economic rather than ideological. For young voters, life is becoming unaffordable as wages cannot keep up with the rising living prices along with a weakening yen, which lowers purchasing power. At the same time, the social contract looks increasingly lopsided. Young people pay ever-higher taxes and social insurance, while doubting that the same level of security will be there for them in the future, especially pensions, in a rapidly ageing society. To illustrate, official projections by the government show Japan having moved from 7.7 workers supporting one elderly person in 1975 to around1.9 supporting one by 2025.View image in fullscreenSouth Korean president Lee Jae Myung and Sanae Takaichi bond over a shared drum session, 13 January.Photograph: Japan’S Cabinet Public Relations Office Handout/EPAAs a woman in my mid-20s, I feel the weight my generation carries – the sense that the milestones our parents reached at this age are now harder to achieve. My peers often complain about everyday prices rising (staples such as rice have doubled in price in one year) and the growing difficulty of starting a family when one income rarely feels sufficient and pregnancy or childcare can still derail a career.This is the context in which Takaichi’s economic messaging lands. She has championed tax relief, including raising the income-tax threshold and expanding deductions aimed at boosting take-home pay. To a younger worker watching monthly deductions rise while real purchasing power falls, the promise of more money is hard to ignore.As Takaichi has called a snap election set to happen on 8 February, her promise hinges on whether she can win a majority. But she may have to tread carefully. Reutersreported that Takaichi’sapproval has slipped as voters grow more sceptical about whether her stimulus package, launched late last year, will actually aid the average voter with rising costs. Concerns that Japan may also need to take on additional debt to fund the measures have not helped.But in the current economic situation, part of her undeniable appeal as leader is that she doesn’t come from a political dynasty. In a system full of men who seem to inherit Diet seats like family property, Takaichi stands out as someone who rose to the top in a political culture that has rarely made it easy for women to do so.Among my peers, her boldness is part of the draw. “Someone who can make things happen” is a sentiment I often hear. Even as a progressive-leaning voter, I cannot deny Takaichi’s charisma and the pull she possesses. There are many things to admire about her such as her confident diplomacy and her modern leadership style.But I’m not convinced she’s the answer. The snap election’s timing is hard to defend when it looks like a cynical attempt to cash in on a polling peak, rather than the best thing for the country. The funding and follow-through of her campaign promise – such as temporary tax breaks on essentials – remain unclear. And the optics are bad when her party willingly re-endorses figures previously linked to aslush-fund scandal, when in 2023 multiple members of the party Takaichi now leads were found to have received undeclared funds totalling almost 600 million yen.Having watched other countries fall for charismatic “outsider” narratives, I’m wary of confusing a compelling image with an ability to govern, especially when the country has so many real problems to solve.Karin Kaneko is a freelance journalist and a former reporter for the Japan TimesExplore more on these topicsJapanOpinionSanae TakaichiAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

We need this, don’t we? We need them. The TV show ended in 1981, yet decades later, memes of Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal et al still circulate. We give their movies Oscars. Their version ofA Christmas Carolis a non-negotiable tradition for anyone with sense. Jim Henson’s furry anarchists bring us together like few things can. As a beady eyed fun-sponge, I can’t help but wonder – why?In an 1810 essay, German poet Heinrich von Kleist argued that puppets demonstrate pure grace: a weightless unself-consciousness that humans long for but never achieve. He was talking about marionettes, suspended from strings. Yet Muppets are hand puppets; extensions of a body. They have weight. As for grace, have you seen how Kermit moves? His arms flap, and he bounces vertically, while moving forwards. It’s hard to imagine a less efficient walk. That frog, he silly.That’s why we love them. Do we not, too, know ourselves to be odd, hapless psychological caricatures? Do our plans not also lead to flaming wreckage? Do we not long to put on a vaudeville-style variety show in a classic theatre?Which brings us to the 2026 Muppet Show (Disney+, from Wednesday 4 February), with executive producerSeth Rogenon board. It’s a one-off, but could lead to a whole new series, the trailer reveals, “depending on how tonight goes”. Happily, it hasn’t been updated so Fozzie is doing bits on TikTok, or Rowlf protesting about streaming royalties. The guys are still trying to put on that variety show, and it’s still all going wrong.Something I love about these geniuses made of rod and felt is their lack of false modesty. They know we love them. Every famous person in the world would kill to be on the Muppets (though what a horrific negotiation). They turn this popularity to farce: producer Kermit replies to every act who expresses interest in appearing, “That sounds like fun!” It’s a polite way of saying no, he confides to stage manager Scooter. “That’s very indirect,” responds Scooter, with misgivings.Naturally, the overstuffed running order runs into crisis, with cuts needing to be made, a disaster for any fragile egos in the vicinity. At least guest starSabrina Carpenteris unflappable. Like Rogen, the former Disney channel child is a perfect fit. She gets in a saucy joke with a straight face, doesn’t upstage the real stars and proves herself game. Or fowl, given her musical number backed up by a bunch of hens.View image in fullscreenUnflappable … Seth Rogen in The Muppet Show.Photograph: Disney+A highlight is when Carpenter meets Miss Piggy, gushing how she has always loved her, and even copied her look. “My attorneys have taken note,” Piggy replies primly. The porcine diva is energetic throughout, trotting backstage to announce to anyone present that she is “on vocal rest”. Protecting her place in the running order, she undertakes a water-based romantic rescue mission, which culminates in a bisexual rug-pull moment. She’s doing a lot.Even the show within the show is good. Expect toe-tapping needle drops old and new. Skits include period-drama parody Pigs in Wigs, and a science segment about screen time, which ends with Beaker losing his eyes. Unlike Sesame Street, where the Muppets also appear, there is no educational agenda. The agenda is electric mayhem.The Muppets have always been subversive. I thrill to the meta winks, comic timing, the sheer weirdness of this world. There’s a throwaway bit in which audience memberMaya Rudolphdies and apparently goes to hell; it’s one of the sweetest things I’ve seen. Given that young people love choreographed K-pop and makeup tutorials, I wonder if nostalgic parents are now the primary audience. The kids may be just an alibi for them to watch.The show’s resident theatre critics, Statler and Waldorf, remain unmoved by the Muppets. (The fact they live in a box, and have never missed a show, suggest a resentful dependence.) They are my spiritual teachers, yet here we must part company. This show isn’t half bad; it’s all great. In 30 minutes, I laughed more than I can count. In the end, it doesn’t matter why we love the Muppets. Joy needn’t be dissected, like a frog on the table. It’s meant to be felt.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He knew that the team had built something special – “but I never thought it would be like this,” he laughs, marvelling at what came next.Mere weeks after its release in June, the animated film – about Korean girl band Huntr/x who battle soul-hungry demons through song – became Netflix’s most-watched title ever. The film’s soundtrack, a fleet of emotionally charged, devilishly catchy hits crafted by real K-pop heavyweights, became a platinum-rated phenomenon all its own.The film made history when four of its tracks hit the US Top 10 simultaneously, and soaring lead single Golden was the world’s most-streamed new song last year. It has already very appropriately won a Golden Globe and is up for best international song at the Brit awards. Not since the Lion King’s Circle of Life has a song from an animated film been nominated for the Academy award for best song and song of the year at theGrammys. This weekend, if the bookies are right and Golden wins both, it will be the first original song from an animation ever to do so.Eisendrath, the film’s executive music producer, credits an unusually collaborative songwriting process – and K-pop’s innate theatricality – with the song’s appeal. “K-pop is larger than life, a whiplash in the best way possible,” he enthuses. “Something can happen, musically, for eight measures, and then you snap to a whole other vibe.”Huntr/x’s sonic battle against demonic boyband Saja Boys demanded thrilling, radio-friendly hits that pushed the story forward with every beat. It also demanded genuine K-pop credibility, provided by Seoul’s taste-making The Black Label (home to Blackpink’s Rosé and her own Grammy-nominated megahit APT.), and a who’s-who of independent hit makers.Danny Chung, an A&R and songwriter with a decade of chart-toppers, co-wrote the Saja Boys’ bubbly, pastel-hued introduction, Soda Pop. He describes working on the film and voicing the husky Baby Saja as a “dream come true” and a “much more engaged” process than he anticipated, due to the challenge of putting character arcs before musical taste or trends.“Soda Pop isn’t exactly The Black Label’s signature sound,” he confesses. “In one of our weekly calls, Ian expressed his concern with where Soda Pop was because it felt ‘too cool’ sonically. One of The Black Label’s head producers said: ‘So make it a bit tacky by design?’ There was an overwhelming ‘Yes!’” Embracing the cheese was a risk to their street cred that paid off: Soda Pop had to be cutesy, to emphasise the boyband’s sinister, soul-reaping second act – and has since been certified platinum.View image in fullscreenEjae … lead vocalist on Golden.Photograph: Ricky Middlesworth/NetflixSaja Boys’ switch-up from sweet to edgy is itself a classic K-pop trope, as Ejae, the lead vocalist on Golden, explains: “[Groups] do a 180 and turn into sexy, cool guys – it’s when interest from fans turns into obsession.” A writer for major Korean girl groups (Twice, Red Velvet, Aespa), Ejae was drawn to the film’s deep celebration of Korean culture – in particular how Huntr/x’s powers are inspired by Korean shamans’ use of bells and voices to ward away, or invite in, spirits – and its nuanced approach to a story of good versus evil.Rumi, Huntr/x’s leader, harbours a secret, and Golden’s victorious lyrics clash with her reality: burnt out, isolated and ashamed. These emotional complexities inspired Ejae to put a lot of herself into the lyrics, drawing on the 10 years she spent training to be a K-pop idol before becoming a songwriter instead, as she explains.View image in fullscreenRumi, Mira and Zoey, who form the girl group Huntr/x.Photograph: Netflix“I always connected with Rumi and [her bandmates] Zoey and Mira. Mira being a black sheep in the family – that’s me. Being from two different places and not knowing your identity, that’s absolutely me as well.” Ejae was born in Seoul and raised in New Jersey before returning toSouth Korea. “And Rumi being really hard-working, but also putting herself through a lot of pressure and perfectionism, that’s exactly me, too.”But when Eisendrath asked her to sing as Rumi for the soundtrack, she needed “a lot” of convincing. “Performing has always been a scary thing,” she admits, “but Ian helped me come out of my little turtle shell!”Recording in the studio was one thing, but embodying Rumi – and nailing Golden’s heart-leaping vocal gymnastics – on live TV, for an audience of millions? Ejae says she never saw it coming. Huntr/x’s firstIRL performance on the US late-night talkshow The Tonight Showunited Ejae with singers Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami, who voice her bandmates, and she describes it as “climbing Mount Everest”. Yet singing with them, and the fans, proved “incredibly spiritual,” she says. “Stage fright is real, but I was able to find the beauty in performing.”View image in fullscreenIRL … Huntr/x’s performance on The Tonight Show, (l-r) Rei Ami, Ejae, and Audrey Nuna.Photograph: NBC/Todd Owyoung/Getty ImagesFor Eisendrath, watching Huntr/x come to life from backstage was deeply emotional: “Life imitating art. It’s incredibly meaningful that Huntr/x are being viewed as artists, as opposed to characters from a film.” They’ve since performed on the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and at Los Angeles’s Jingle Ball, and fans are hungry for more concerts, more songs – but Netflix remains tight-lipped on any further plans for Huntr/x, or the franchise in general. Bloomberg reported that a sequel is slated for 2029, but Netflix would not confirm or deny this to the Guardian.‘Almost collapsed’: behind the Korean film crisis and why K-pop isn’t immuneRead moreIn the meantime, all eyes remain on the real-life talent. Huntr/x’s popularity has supercharged the profiles of Ami and Nuna, who have gained tens of millions of listeners, and the soundtrack’s success is likely to have contributed to The Black Label gaining almost $68m in investment ahead of a rumoured IPO stock launch; label head Teddy Park recently received a commendation from the Korean prime minister in the awards for Overseas Expansion Merit.But for Ejae, KPop Demon Hunters’ success goes deeper than the numbers. With a growing confidence, she is slowly releasing her own solo material, after years of writing for others. “I’m so grateful,” she says, softly. “A dream I had shelved for a very long time, that I never thought I needed to open up again … is open.”Explore more on these topicsMusicKPop Demon HuntersK-popAwards and prizesGrammysOscars 2026Pop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am here to see Amazon’s $75m “documentary” onMelania Trump, which has already beencondemned as a flopahead of its release.When I arrive, I panic for a second that I have the time wrong. There are noMelaniaposters anywhere and the screening is tucked into the back bottom corner of the large movie theatre, like the weird leftover table at a wedding.Eventually, just eight people arrive. The cinema has a capacity of about 150 people. There’s a couple, an elderly lady, a few middle-aged men and me. We all sit in the back for some reason.Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreI wonder if the terrible showing is because it’s a weird time of day to watch a movie. But of the five evening screenings of Melania taking place on its opening day at cinemas across Sydney, none have sold more than 16 tickets. One has sold just six.Earlier viewings that were slated for 11am in Australia were pulled at the last minute due to a miscommunication over Amazon MGM Studios’ worldwide embargo, preventing any screenings from going ahead before 4pm AEST.This means I am one of less than 100 people in the city of Sydney, population 5.5 million people, to see Melania’s debut. Who are my peers? Maga fans willing to pay $26.75, or just journalists forced to endure the 1-hour-and-48-minute running time so the general public doesn’t have to?The film, which documents the 20 days preceding Donald Trump’s return to power in January 2025, was screened at the White House on Saturday and had its official premiere at Washington’s Kennedy Center – which the president has renamed the Trump-Kennedy Centerin a legally disputed move– on Thursday, before its release in 27 countries.The timing for its releasecould’ve been better, coming off the back of the second killing of a civilian by ICE in less than a month, but is there ever good timing with the Trump administration?A spoiler of sorts: I am not a big fan of Melania Trump. I have laughed about herweird, oversized hatsand periodically indulged in conspiracy theories that she hasbeen replaced by a lookalike.As celebrities go, she is extremely far down my list of People I Would Like to See a Documentary About.Of course, liking a famous person isn’t a prerequisite for watching a documentary about them. I enjoyed Tiger King despite not enjoying the man commonly known as Tiger King.Yet Melania has been directed by the disgraced film-maker Brett Ratner, marking his first feature in 12 years after being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women in 2017 (which he has denied).It would be hard to view this as anything other than a propaganda exercise: the president’s Battleship Potemkin.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from Amazon’s $75m documentary Melania.Photograph: AmazonWhen the film begins, I immediately regret not buying popcorn so at least one of my senses would be entertained. In what feels excruciatingly slow, the first 10 minutes are just her using various modes of transport. Getting ushered into a black car. Boarding a plane. Wishing staff “Happy New Year” in monotone.Then there is her first voiceover.“Everyone wants to know, so here it is, 20 days in my life, family, business, philanthropy and becoming first lady of the United States again.”The next segment of the film is Melania trying on outfits. Then she is looking at the menu for the inauguration dinner. Then she is with an interior designer, discussing nightstands and cabinets for the White House.Eggs, hats and unfettered ambition: what we learned about Melania Trump from her documentaryRead moreThis could be the ultimate trad wife film, I ponder, except that Melania doesn’t actually do anything domestic – other people do it for her while she instructs them.Some of the weirdest moments are her interactions with the president. In one scene, she is on the phone to Trump as he excitedly discusses how many electoral college votes he won. “That’s a good one,” she says robotically, then “bye, congrats”.In another scene, they briefly discuss their son, Baron. “I love him, he has an incredible mind,” she says poetically.At this point, I have been to the toilet twice, clutched my face and whispered “oh my God” when I’ve checked the time and it has barely passed.The final half is of the inauguration itself. “That’s the hat,” someone in the cinema remarks when her bizarre outfit is revealed.The most animated she gets is when YMCA comes on at their final ball. There is a look of pure delight on her face. Otherwise she looks either robotic or furious.As I emerge from the cinema, I have the strange feeling that I have not only learned nothing but lost brain cells.“What did you think?” I ask the elderly lady. “I loved it, wow!” she cries.I pin down the only two people who didn’t see the movie alone. The couple tell me they’re a fan of Trump, and of Melania, but they found the experience too much like a “PR vehicle”.“It’s not as insightful as I thought it would be,” one says.“I’ve loved Melania for 15 years … and I feel like it was made to make Trump look better,” the other says.“As much as it was for her, it was for him.”Isn’t everything?Explore more on these topicsMelaniaOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

She talks about a life on the run and finally settling downSat 31 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareHadFatima Bhuttobeen left to her own devices, her devastating forthcoming memoir would have been almost entirely about her relationship with her dog, Coco. “I know it sounds nuts,” she laughs. And it’s true that being dog-crazy doesn’t quite track with the public perception of Bhutto as a writer, journalist, activist and member of Pakistan’s most famous political dynasty. But the pandemic had forced something of a creative unravelling and when Bhutto took stock, she found herself only really able to write about Coco. Her agent politely suggested her memoir might need something more. A second draft was written, then abandoned.“Until I thought, what if I just tell the truth? And then it fell out of me – it didn’t even pour, it fell.” In around three weeks Bhutto had reworked her draft and, in the process, revealed a shocking chapter of her life that she’d kept secret from everyone around her.The resulting book, The Hour of the Wolf, is a raw, vulnerable account of an abusive, decade-long relationship that Bhutto endured, certain in her belief that this was love. It charts the painful realisation that this man (she only refers to him as The Man), who she writes is “unlike anyone that I have ever met: uninhibited, blazingly sure of himself … beautiful, rugged, old-school masculine … a free spirit”, had manipulated her into accepting that flashes of kindness and sporadic adventure were the real deal.The two met in New York in 2011, when Bhutto was on tour with her sensational family memoir,Songs of Blood and Sword. The book caused a major stir in Pakistan and beyond by re-evaluating the Kennedy-esque Bhutto dynasty; Fatima held her aunt, Benazir, partially responsible for her father’s murder. The grief was palpable.The book is a necessary reminder that being ‘strong’, accomplished, widely admired and fiercely clever doesn’t offer a protective shieldFatima embarked on a long-distance relationship with The Man, meeting around once a month over a period of 11 years. It suited her; she was often travelling for journalistic assignments or being invited to speak at literary events and festivals across the world. She wrote novels and essays. She was nominated for the Women’s prize for fiction. None of this was really of interest to The Man, who became controlling. His darker side was full of rage; he would treat her with abuse then silence, contempt and scorn. In Bhutto’s description, he would switch from dazzling to demonic without warning. He isolated her from her friends.Her memoir is a short but astonishing account, articulated in such calm, quiet prose that it makes the burning cruelty of what Bhutto experienced all the more harrowing. Coco still features prominently. But mostly the book is a necessary reminder that being “strong”, accomplished, widely admired and fiercely clever doesn’t offer a protective shield. Frankly, none of these qualities offers a woman immunity from the psychological violence of a coercively controlling man.“I didn’t really want to do it,” she says of writing about her relationship. “Because I felt ashamed, I felt embarrassed, I did feel all those kinds of things. But I also know that if I’d read something like this, it would have helped me.”This is the first time Bhutto has spoken publicly about the book. The relationship ended in 2021 when, after years of her expressing a desire to have a family, to put down roots, even going through fertility preservation in Spain, Bhutto finally realised that The Man would never give her what she needed. She was 39. She left him, met her husband, Graham, in 2022 and had two babies within three years.View image in fullscreenMurtaza Bhutto in 1978.Photograph: Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesWe are meeting in the Chelsea home of the friend, Allegra, who introduced them. Both women are present, along with Bhutto’s husband, their sons Mir and Caspian, and a babysitter, who is in the process of organising coats, boots and a pushchair for an outing to the park.This is a home from home – the family largely live abroad but, for security reasons, Bhutto prefers not to specify where. “My toxic trait is that I think I can get through anything,” she says, when I ask, bluntly, how she put up with some of The Man’s most egregious behaviour. Not only did Bhutto endure it alone, but she recalls the delight he took in belittling her in front of an audience, routinely humiliating her in restaurants, in shops, on holiday. (There is one encounter in an electronics shop that I was willing to be the final straw, but their relationship continued for several more years.)“I have a really high tolerance for stress or discomfort or whatever, and I just, for so long, had told myself this was the same thing.” Irrespective of the highs in their relationship, it’s awful to consider the extent to which Bhutto contorted her feelings or rationalised his. “The only way to survive 11 years of that is to think of it as a love story,” she says, almost with a shrug. “And you think it’s toughening you up for, you know, the great success that awaits you. You think that it’s hardening you up for life. And I did tell myself that. And also, because I didn’t tell anyone else anything, no one turned around to me and said:‘What are you talking about?’”Bhutto has always guarded her privacy – which makes her account all the more difficult and exposing – but that she didn’t tell any of her many friends that she had a boyfriend, let alone what their relationship was like, is hard to reconcile. This, of course, was due to the nature of the “love” The Man had manufactured between them: he insisted they had to remain a secret, they weren’t to indulge in “normal” behaviour such as meeting each other’s friends or family, living in the same city, let alone the same home.“I had read stories and seen things throughout my life about women who’d been put in dangerous situations by men. I just never thought I was one of them because it hadn’t been physical, you know?” (She says this, though in the book she recounts that he once bit her finger so hard, it gave her nerve damage.) “So I just thought that that would never happen to me, that itcouldnever happen. All the while it was happening, and happening, and happening, and I hadn’t connected it. I just thought the cliche was too obvious. You know, that someone wants to break a strong woman?” Bhutto projects poise, even when she’s being wry. “I mean, I was not young enough for this to be excusable.”Was there a part of her, in the years she spent independently travelling and living all over the world, establishing her career, that thought this relationship was all she deserved?“That’s the amazing thing,” she says, trying to reconcile her solid self-esteem against what she was put through. “There was no part of me that thought that. It wasthe opposite. I used to say to him: ‘If I hadn’t had the father I had, you would have damaged me. You know, if I had an absent father, if I had a father that was cruel, or if I had a father that never told me I was clever or smart or strong, you would have done harm to me.’ And he didn’t break me in the end.” On this she is clear. “I felt damaged by him, but I know that the damage he wanted to do was total.”Bhutto’s father, Murtaza Bhutto, was the eldest son of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, founder ofPakistanPeople’s party (PPP) and prime minister of the country in the 1970s. The story of the Bhuttos is in many ways the story of Pakistan. Their family history is the nation’s history, and it is under the weight of immense scrutiny and violence that Fatima has lived her whole life.The fear I had growing up really played into this relationship. The need for secrets? I understood thatHer grandfather Zulfikar was overthrown by a military coup and executed in 1979, in circumstances that sent shockwaves around the world. Three years later his youngest son, Shahnawaz Bhutto, a young radical fighting to overthrow the military dictatorship that killed his father, was found dead in Nice at 26 years old. The family have long believed he was poisoned.Fatima was born in 1982, and spent her early years in her grandfather’s vast Karachi residence. She was close to her father, who retained sole parental custody after divorcing her mother when she was a toddler. After Shahnawaz’s death, the two of them spent the rest of her childhood living together – in exile – in Syria. Plainly, Fatima adored him and wrote Songs of Blood and Sword largely as a righteous biography of her father.“This will sound disjointed,” she begins, “because this is the first time I’m thinking about it out loud. But I don’t think I had properly – to use a word that I findoof– ‘healed’ from my life, really. Not until after this relationship, because so much of what had traumatised me had been part of my life. The fear I had growing up really played in beautifully to this whole thing [with The Man]. The need for secrets? I understood that because I have had to live like that, even until now.” Being a Bhutto comes with significant baggage around security, which may partly explain why Fatima has lived such a peripatetic existence.She recalls being told to pack a bag by her father and being whisked “on an adventure” countless times, upping and leaving with a moment’s notice. Of being really chatty as a young girl on the phone and then being told by her father not to talk to those calling the house. Not to give away any detail of where they were. “I adored my father because he adored me,” she says. “He would make it fun, so it wasn’t like you were holed up in some scary place. But you still understand, something’s not right.”Political activism was a central tenet of family life, with all its associated danger. “The adults in my family never really hid anything from us. They didn’t ever say, ‘leave the room, children, because we have to talk about something’. That’s just how they talked.”“I used to struggle with it because my father sometimes would say things like, ‘You know, when they kill me …’. And when I was much younger, I’d get really upset at these family lunches where they casually talked like that. He would never treat it as …” She pauses. “There was never any ‘Oh no, I’m sorry, darling. I didn’t mean that.’ That’s just how it was.”Fatima and her father returned to Karachi in 1993. By then her aunt Benazir had assumed the role as head of the PPP and, at 35, served as the world’s youngest female prime minister, between 1988 to 1990. Despite a bitter feud with her brother about her right to lead the party, Benazir began her second term in 1993. Murtaza publicly accused his sister and her husband of political corruption and revived a breakaway faction of the PPP. Three years later, Murtaza was dead, killed by Karachi police in a brutal shoot-out outside the family home. Fatima was 14.View image in fullscreenGhinwa Bhutto (right) and Fatima at a press conference after the death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996.Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty ImagesFatima was left with her stepmother Ghinwa and her baby brother, Zulfikar Jr. For a while, the siblings lived secretly in Syria, for their own safety. “Again, they didn’t hide any of the stuff from us,” she says, trying to explain a childhood layered with contradictions, a collision of fear, privilege, violence and grief. “It was: ‘We’re sending you to Damascus on a flight at midnight. Don’t tell anyone that you’re going. Yes, keep the plan to see your friends tomorrow, nothing out of the ordinary, but you’re going to be gone by midnight.’ And so I asked: ‘Why do we have to go to Damascus?’ And I was told: ‘Well, we don’t know if they’re going to kill the children next.’” Bhutto recounts all of this flatly matter of fact. “Whether they intended to or not, they definitely traumatised us in this way.”In 2007, Benazir was assassinated on the campaign trail while fighting to win her third term in office. Fatima bears a striking resemblance to her aunt. Their relationship was complicated, especially given the circumstances of her father’s death, but to this day the Bhutto family’s legacy can be seen in Pakistan; Asif Ali Zardari, Benazir’s widely reviled husband, is sitting his second term as president, and has assumed co-chairmanship of the PPP with his son, Bilawal.Fatima remains deeply politicised. “It’s made me uncomfortable around power though, rather than craving it,” she explains. “I’m very well aware of the dangers of power. I’m not stupid enough to think, ‘Oh, ifIwent into politics, I’d be different’. I know no one is different.”The question of whether she would follow in the family tradition receded a long time ago. But the urge to do something worthwhile still remains.“There are moments when I feel in a rage about the world, that I think maybe there is a duty to be more involved, because maybe you can’t do anything from outside. Maybe you can’t do anything from writing. But there’s no appeal for me. I never think, ‘Oh, what I’d like right now is to surrender what dregs I have of privacy’. No.”A passing glance at her writing and social media accounts for the past two years and more shows Bhutto to have been almost completely dedicated to Gaza, amplifying and giving voice to the horrors inflicted on Palestinians. She has continued this work through two pregnancies, culminating in the blistering book of essays she edited, Gaza: The Story of a Genocide, which was published last October.“I couldn’t help thinking throughout the experience that, you know, when I was in labour, I was in a hospital. I had anaesthesia, I had an epidural, I had doctors, I wasn’t being bombed. I could reliably be left there and no one would have to worry for my safety.”Bhutto has processed so much, in such a short time span, I wonder how she’s managed to stay sane and keep her composure. “You’ve got to, I don’t know, exist in this otherworldly kind of space where this isn’t happening.” “This” being anything from documenting Israeli war crimes to excavating her own personal history, all the while with a baby on her hip, husband and dogs in tow.“I thought I was a fairly compassionate, sensitive person beforehand, but it just kind of rips you open in a new way.”The Hour of the Wolf by Fatima Bhutto is published by Daunt.

They swore they would never work together. “Circus couples are a pain in the arse,” Charlotte tells us on the mic at the start of the show, chatting like an old friend.Inevitably they did end up working together, forming the companyOckham’s Razor,and making warm, insightful and gently joyful circus theatre shows full of humanity and connection. They stepped back from performing into directing after having a daughter. The pair were not quite ready to retire from the stage, however, and Collaborator is one last hurrah. It’s an ode to their performing lives together, from the hopeful anticipation of day one to the challenging days when nothing is in sync, demonstrated through simple but telling games, with props, ropes and some mesmerising pendulums that make waves of energy visible.View image in fullscreenDreamy … Collaborator by Ockham’s Razor.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe theme of waves, and shared energy – and how one person’s energy might amplify or dampen another’s – is woven through the piece. There is a dreaminess about the mellow pace, a contentedness through the ups and downs (#couplegoals) and an effective soundtrack by Holly Khan that you almost don’t notice because it’s so fused with the action and feeling on stage.The heart and soul of Collaborator is when Mooney and Harvey get on the trapeze. In this case it is a square frame that they hang from and slowly, lift, curl, fold, balance and pretzel themselves around each other. This is not Cirque du Soleil pyrotechnics but intimate, up-close, physical conversation. It embodies all the trust and care, the attention and deep listening to each other, the physical attunement, the strength they offer each other (and like any long-term relationship, there’s hard work too, that’s clear).In one moment, Harvey is hanging underneath the bar, the ball of his foot pushing upwards against the metal, and Mooney is crouched on top of it, her toes mirroring his – its a tiny, probably unintended, detail, but a surprisingly tender moment of yin and yang. Earlier in their acrobatics, a toe comically almost goes up someone’s nose, so it’s not all so serene. This short piece is an engaging memento of what’s clearly a beautiful partnership.Atthe Place, London, until 31 January.Then touringExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreCircusMimeDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been visiting the happiest country on Earth every year since I was a baby. At first glance, Finland doesn’t seem like an obvious breeding ground for happiness. In midwinter the sun only appears for two to five hours a day and temperatures can plummet to below -20C. (It would seem a warm-year-round, sunny climate is not a prerequisite to happiness.)The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.TheWorld Happiness Reportis based on a survey in which people rate their satisfaction with life – and the Finns have been happiest with their lot for the last eight years. Not short of marketing savvy, Visit Finland latched on to this with a “Masterclass of Happiness” advertising campaign. And it’s probably no coincidence that Lonely Planet named Finland in its 2026 Best in Travel guide as a country “for finding happiness in wild places”.I’m half-Finnish, and I’m interested to find out what Finns think is the secret to happiness, as well as what visitors can learn from them. I started by asking my friends and family. The answer was unanimous: “It’s because we have low expectations” – a response which speaks volumes about Finns. Direct, to the point and wry.View image in fullscreenA sculpture at the Helsinki Art Museum on Vallisaari island on display during the city’s biennial last year.Photograph: Maija Toivanen/Helsinki BiennaaliOf course, there are societal factors, too, such as relatively high levels of education and equality. But I see another reason, one that visitors can tap into: Finland is all about the peace of mind that comes from simple pleasures, a slower pace of life and connecting with nature.Each summer, I look forward to visiting the woods of birch and pine trees, with moss-covered granite boulders, carpeted with ferns and blueberry and lingonberry bushes. There is the joy of spotting tiny, jewel-like wild strawberries and popping them in your mouth, where the taste explodes. Then blueberry-picking season arrives, another excuse to roam the woods, container in hand – if you don’t pop them into your mouth first. These are not plump supermarket berries; they are smaller, with the concentrated essence of the forest. Finland has a unique right to roam tradition known asJokamiehenoikeudet(Everyman’s Right), so you can follow where the berry trail takes you as long as you respect the privacy of gardens.I love swimming in the cool, soft, deep blue water , then warming up on a sandy beach. On a warm summer’s evening, there is no place I would rather beFinland is gaining popularity as a “coolcation” destination – an alternative to the sweltering summer heat of the Mediterranean – although last summer it experienced a 20-day heatwave of its own, turning the lake beaches riviera-like.The area of Finland I know best is South Karelia, most of which is in Finnish Lakeland. It is dominated by the island-dottedLake Saimaa, the fourth largest in Europe. I love swimming in the cool, soft, deep blue water that stretches to the horizon, then warming up on a sandy beach backed by the ever-present pine and birch trees. On a warm summer’s evening, there is no place I would rather be. That is happiness.The happiness that comes from being in the woods is backed up by science. Research shows that being among pine trees increases our feeling of relaxation and reduces stress, thanks to the compounds found in the scent of trees. It’s a further encouragement to slow down and breathe in the forest air.View image in fullscreenLöyly sauna in HelsinkiMany English-speaking people know only one word of Finnish, but it’s one that is another key to the nation’s happiness:sauna(pronounced by the Finns as sow-na). The rush of endorphins released by a sauna helps Finns get through the long, dark winters. In Helsinki, one of the most popular saunas on the seafront isLöyly(the Finnish word for the steam that rises when water is thrown on the hot stove). In winter, they cut a hole in the sea ice so you can cool off by plunging in. If you visit Finland in winter, embrace the darkness, saunas and twinkling lights, and make the most of the few hours of daylight. It is magical to explore the woods, branches piled high with snow, on foot, snowshoes or cross-country skis. There’s a particular hush and stillness the snow brings. And maybe it is learning to hold the dark and light that leads to a satisfaction among Finns.There is plenty to explore beyond lakes, forests and saunas. Helsinki is a thriving capital that blends nature with culture. TheHelsinki Biennialtakes place inHAM Helsinki Art MuseumonVallisaariisland, a 20-minute ferry ride from the city centre. Wandering around the wooded island is a joy in itself, with the art a bonus. The next biennial is in the summer of 2027.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s favourite Helsinki restaurant is Magu.Photograph: NA/Andrew TaylorLast summer I stayed in the new timber-framedSokos Hotel Pier 4on the harbour. The rooftop garden and bar offers a 360-degree view of the sea and across the city. On a warm July evening, with a DJ playing and the sunset filling the sky well after 10pm, it is a happy place to be. Nearby in the harbour is theAllas sea pool, where you can enjoy a sauna and swim, with a choice of heated and unheated pools, depending on your level of bravery.Maybe a bucket list approach is not in keeping with the Finnish ethos – their happiness comes from getting to know a place intimatelyThe Esplanadi is lined with design shops if you want to take a piece of Finnish style home with you. There are the distinctive floral patterns ofMarimekko, the glassware ofIittala, and the china ofArabia, including Moomin mugs and plates.Restaurants showcasing seasonal and local produce are thriving. My favourite isMagu, which serves a five-course plant-based tasting menu, each dish bursting with creativity. And, of course, there is coffee and cinnamon rolls to keep everyone fuelled (Finns have thehighest per capita coffee consumption in the world).There is so much of Finland I still haven’t seen. I’ve never been to Lapland, to see the autumn colours and northern lights. I’d love to explore the wilds of north Karelia, go canoeing on Lake Saimaa and cycle around the Lakeland area. I have sailed through Baltic archipelagos on the ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki, but I’ve never spent time on the islands themselves. But then maybe a bucket list approach is not in keeping with the Finnish ethos – their happiness comes from familiarity, getting to know a place intimately, which is why so many Finns return to their summer cabins year after year.View image in fullscreenTove Jansson’s Moomin stories are infused with Finnish spirit and cultural traits.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyThe Moomins, the lovable children’s characters created byTove Jansson, are one of Finland’s most famous exports. Moomintroll lived by a simple ethos: “I only want to live in peace, plant potatoes and dream.” Happiness is a choice we can make, and that’s what I’ve learned from the Finns and being in Finland – it’s not the pursuit of happiness that makes you happy, it’s being in the moment, letting go of striving, letting go of expectations. Breathe in the trees. Plunge in cold water. Wake up and smell the coffee. Make a snow angel. Watch the sun setting into the blue expanse of a lake. That is happiness, Finnish-style.OliviaSprinkel’s book,To Hear the Trees Speak, is published by Bedford Square (£18.99).To support the Guardian, buy a copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

Once solely the province of experienced backcountry bushwalkers, the country’s ever-expanding network of hiking trails now offers something for walkers of all abilities.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.According to Ausplay, almost4 million Australians go bushwalking each year, making it the third-most popular form of physical activity in the country, and in 2025 theAllTrailsapp saw an almost 300% year-on-year increase in distance walked by Australian users. The largest growth has been in long-distance hikes, and it’s no surprise the boom in trail construction is continuing across the country, with multiple big-ticket walks slated to break ground this year.Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal parkRead moreTasmania’s Next Iconic walkis set to be a three-day hike through the Tyndall Range on the island state’s rugged west coast, and in Victoria the 76kmGreat Ocean Road coastal trailwill run along the Otway coast from Fairhaven through to Grey River.While you wait for those projects to get under way, here are some of the best new (and soon-to-open) tracks to stretch your legs this year.Map of Australia showing the different hike spotsGidjuum Gulganyi walk (New South Wales)Most visitors to NSW’s northern rivers region stick to the coast, but venture into the hinterland and you’ll discover a magical world where waterfalls cascade through ancient volcano craters and subtropical Gondwana rainforest.View image in fullscreenThe Gidjuum Gulganyi walk is a 42km hike in the NSW northern rivers hinterland.Photograph: D ParsonsLaunched last year, theGidjuum Gulganyi walkfollows the southern rim of the Tweed volcano on a journey deep into this exceptionally biodiverse ecosystem. The 42km, four-day hike also offers awindow into the cultures of the Widjabul Wia-bal and Minjungbal traditional owners, with a cultural experience at the walk’s terminus slated to open later this year.Ngaro track (Queensland)The Whitsunday islands group has long been associated with aquatic activities, but the new 32kmNgaro trackis aiming to turn the region into a hiking hotspot as well.View image in fullscreenThe three-day Ngaro track traverses coast, forest and rocky peaks on Whitsunday Island in Queensland.Photograph: Matt Horspool/Vagay Studio Pty LtdAccessed via boat, the three-day walk begins at Whitehaven beach (recently voted the world’s best) on Whitsunday Islandbefore traversing a mix of coastal landscapes, open forest and rocky peaks that offer panoramic vistas of the island group. Developed in collaboration with the Ngaro traditional owners, the trail incorporates art installations and cultural information and will have space for just 15 walkers a day when it launches in May. Bookings for independent hikers have almost sold out for the inaugural season, but World Expeditions still has availability on itsguided trips.Tidbinbilla Mindjagari track (ACT)“Not for the faint-hearted” is how ACT minister for city and government services, Tara Cheyne, described the 14km of fresh trails added to theTidbinbilla Mindjagari track networkat the end of last year. Rated grade 5 (for experienced, well-equipped bushwalkers only), the new trails unlock a range of new circuits. These include the aptly named Short ‘n’ Brutal loop, one of four routes to the top of the Tidbinbilla Range where walkers can enjoy views out over the Brindabellas and Kosciuszko national park.Adelaide 100 (South Australia)Conceived back in 2012, theAdelaide 100is finally nearing completion. For now, walkers can follow a continuous section of more than 70km that winds through the koala-filled foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, along the gum-lined River Torrens and past the coastal dunes of Adelaide’s western suburbs. Because the trail lies within the Adelaide metropolitan area, most sections can be accessed via public transport, and through-hikers will find toilets, accommodation and food providers along the way.‘It just blew me away’: the new Gidjuum Gulganyi Walk in northern NSW follows ancient trailsRead moreLeeuwin Biddi trail (Western Australia)South-west WA’s Cape to Cape track rightfully ranks highly on many lists of Australia’s top hikes. But if you don’t feel like tackling the entire 123km, the recently openedLeeuwin Biddi trailoffers an easier way to appreciate this beautiful stretch of coastline. The 3km trail is an accessible path designed for all ages and abilities that follows the coast and links with existing trails to connect the Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse (at 39 metres, mainland Australia’s tallest) with Augusta Boat Harbour.Snowies Alpine walk (NSW)Meandering across the rooftop of Australia, this56km, four-day trailis part of NSW’s rapidly expanding collection ofGreat Walks, and lives up to the billing by connecting alpine meadows filled with endemic wildflowers, historic mountain huts and stands of sinuous snow gums that overlook clear glacial lakes.View image in fullscreenHikers at Blue Lake in Kosciuszko national park.Photograph: Andrew Bain/AlamyThe chance to summit Australia’s highest mountain is the cherry on top, with the views from Mount Kosciuszko stretching all the way to the NSW south coast on a clear day. Half of the route is new track, and there are no designated campsites – walkers are encouraged to book transfers or carpool to nearby accommodation options.Twin Bridges track (Queensland)Five years after closing due to cyclone damage, the 18kmTwin Bridges trailreopened last December. Connecting the communities of Wangetti and Mowbray, the dual-use trail takes walkers and cyclists through the lush hinterland of the Wet Tropics world heritage area in Queensland’s far north. While not officially part of the 94kmWangetti trail, it will form an alternate route for walkers and cyclists travelling between Palm Cove and Port Douglas when that project is completed in 2028.Uluru-Kata Tjuta signature walk (Northern Territory)View image in fullscreenThe 54km Uluru-Kata Tjuta signature walk will include five days of guided hiking.Photograph: Michael PetersWhen it launches in April, the newest addition to the Great Walks of Australia luxury guided hike portfolio will allow walkers to stay overnight in Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park for the first time. Connecting the red sandstone domes of Kata Tjuta with Australia’s most recognisable natural landmark, the 54kmUluru-Kata Tjuta signature walkwill include five days of guided hiking through the desert along with cultural workshops and chef-prepared meals.‘It’s become a bit meaningless’: why does Australia have so many new Great Walks?Read moreInternational hikes to watchDongseo trail, South KoreaModelled after theCamino de Santiago, this coast-to-coast trail will stretch almost 850km across the Korean peninsula when it is completed later this year. The finished track promises to connect ancient Buddhist temples, beautiful mountain scenery and 90 village “base camps” where walkers can access food and accommodation.Kawarau Gorge trail, New ZealandScheduled to open in late summer, this32km walking and cycling trackwill link Queenstown and Cromwell via several swing bridges and cantilevered catwalks. It will also connect to a 530km network of trails that stretches from Queenstown to Dunedin in the South Island.The Transcaucasian trailSpread across Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, thisambitious 3,000km trail(split into two sections to account for the fraught diplomatic relationships in the region) is still under construction, but the completed sections take in spectacular alpine scenery, fascinating religious sites and secluded mountain lakes.Explore more on these topicsAustralia holidaysWalkingWalking holidaysAustralian lifestyleQueensland holidaysNew Caledonia holidaysNorthern Territory holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The combination of nuts in a mixed bag matters enormously, too. After all, if your least favourite nut dominates a particular packet, it will be a chore to get through. Also, some nuts are more expensive than others, with macadamia, pecans and cashews fetching a higher price per kilo than the humble peanut (which is actually a legume), say. The formula affects both price and profit, so for today’s test I’ve listed the most prominent nuts in each packet to help you choose one that suits you.Due to their high fat content, nuts are particularly prone to oxidation, so their freshness can deteriorate fast, leading to rancid flavours and bitterness, and that freshness depends on when the product was harvested and how it was packaged. This information isn’t generally available on packets, but the use-by date is, so always pick a bag with the longest possible shelf life – at least six months ideally. To keep your nuts fresh, store them in an airtight container and, if possible, in the fridge.The best supermarket mixed nutsBest overall:Waitrose mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£5 for 250g at Waitrose (£2/100g)★★★★☆Lots of super-crunchy almonds and large walnuts, with a good ratio of brazil nuts, and a scattering of hazelnuts and sweet pecans. A few nuts were crushed from rough transportation, but overall one of the freshest packets I tried. Great quality and well balanced. Packaging recyclable in-store.Best bargain:Natural Days mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£2.15 for 200g at Ocado (£1.08/100g)★★★★☆Beautiful, big walnut halves, crunchy almonds, a sufficient quantity of sweet cashews and a few tasty hazelnuts scattered throughout. A fresh aroma, with the walnuts dominating, and the quality and variety are exceptional for this price point and the types of nuts included. Sadly, though, these have non-recyclable packaging.And the rest …Sainsbury’s So Organic mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£5.50 for 300g at Sainsbury’s (£1.83/100g)★★★★☆A bountiful mix of brazils, walnuts and hazelnuts with a smaller but sufficient ratio of almonds and creamy cashews. Consistently fresh. Good value for an entry-level organic product that doesn’t compromise on quality. Packaging not recyclable.Asda mixed nut selectionView image in fullscreen£2.02 for 190g at Asda (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆Equal quantities of almonds, cashews, pecans and peanuts combine in a more economical bag than most. A sweet aroma, but the peanuts overpower the more delicate nuts. Overall, good freshness and great value for an everyday mix. Nonrecyclable packaging.Fudco deluxe assorted nutsView image in fullscreen£7.40 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (£1.48/100g)★★★☆☆Mostly creamy cashews and sweet almonds, with some disappointing walnuts, and a limited number of delicious pecans and brazil nuts. Good value for a rich and diverse combination, though freshness varied. Packaging recyclable in-store.Sainsbury’s mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£5 for 300g at Sainsbury’s (£1.67/100g)★★★☆☆A pretty even mix of crunchy almonds, walnuts and cashews, plus a scattering of brazil nuts.

A generous mixture with good variety, though the freshness was mixed. Packaging not recyclable.Tesco mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 500g at Tesco (£1.30/100g)★★☆☆☆A high ratio of crunchy but bitter hazelnuts, lovely, amaretto-flavoured almonds and rather less tasty blanched almonds, with a few sweet cashews and delicious walnut halves. Good value, but loses points for its poor ratio and variable quality. Packaging recyclable in-store.Co-op mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£2.40 for 120g at Co-op (£2/100g)★★☆☆☆An even mix of large almonds, creamy cashews, hazelnuts and generous walnut pieces.

Packaging recyclable in-store.Crazy Jack organic mixed nutsView image in fullscreen£3.40 for 175g at Ocado (£1.94/100g)★★☆☆☆A near-even mix of fresh and tasty hazelnuts, shrivelled and poorly flavoured almonds, large and notably delicious walnuts, and juicy brazil nuts and cashews. The organic certification is added value, but these are ultimately let down by the sub-par almonds (hopefully a one-off with my packet).

Sometimes, my answer is a Sri Lankan potato curry, ora Gujarati one. Perhaps a slow-cooked Spanish omelette if it’s a date night with Hugh at the kitchen island (like this Friday) but today, the solution is Greek.Yahniis the Greek word for a style of cooking: vegetables braised in plenty of olive oil and tomatoes, until tender. It’s a way of being, a vote for the simple and the slow and the good (but it is also dinner, if you wish).Patates yahniServe with crusty bread or Greek flatbreads for a main meal, or with some picky bits on the side or even with a fried egg for breakfast.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4Extra-virgin olive oil1 large red onion, peeled, halved and thinly slicedFine sea salt4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1kgdesiree potatoes, cut into wedges 2½cm at the widest point2 tsp dried oregano, plus extra to finish2 tbsp tomato puree2400g tins finely chopped tomatoes– I likeMutti150g feta75g Greek yoghurt1 lemonfinely zested, plus 1 tbsp juice80g kalamata olives, pittedPut five tablespoons of oil in a wide, deep-sided pan for which you have a lid and set it on a medium to high heat.

In the 1970s the region leaned towards white, but by the 2000s was famed for powerful oak-aged reds.Now it’s turning to a much older form of red with a name familiar to anglophones: claret. With origins in the 12th century, when it was first shipped to Britain, claret was soon our favoured wine, an unofficial byword for bordeaux red, which in recent decades has become increasingly full-bodied.The Bordeaux protected designation of origin has now formally validated bordeaux claret, linking it to the existing Bordeaux appellation. Yet the bottles, available from the 2025 vintage, will differ from what many in Britain consider claret – lighter, less tannic and lower in alcohol.French winemakers ‘battle for survival’ as minister prepares for crisis talksRead moreBordeaux has been greatly affected by climate breakdown. Some impacts have been a “positive challenge”, said Stéphanie Sinoquet, the managing director of the Bordeaux growers’ association, with producers turning to untraditional, heat-resistant grape varieties. Warmer conditions were allowing grapes to reach a “better and more consistent ripeness”.Consequently, ever-rising alcohol levels were of concern – 15% is now common. For Jean-Raymond Clarenc, the director of the Bordeaux branch of the Grands Chais deFrance, the new classification is a “strategic response to these environmental shifts. By opting for shorter macerations and a profile that values freshness over power, we can produce balanced, elegant wines even in warmer vintages. It’s a way of turning a climatic challenge into an oenological opportunity.”Wine consumption habits are changing for several reasons. Warmer weather means drinkers are seeking lighter, fruitier bottles – in France as well as Britain, consumption of red wine is falling. Lighter, chillable reds have become de rigueur – bordeaux claret is designed to be consumed at 8-12C, experts told the Guardian. “Fresher and fruitier styles are perceived as more relaxed and inclusive,” said Sinoquet, adding they were more versatile and easier to drink outside meals.While lighter claret (and the even lighter clairet, a dark rosé) never fully disappeared, Bordeaux producers turned to powerful reds that earned international acclaim and appealed to wealthy collectors, and their prices soared. “Classic bordeaux reds will continue to offer the structured, age-worthy styles,” said Sinoquet.Many cited bordeaux’s spiralling prices as a reason for its struggles. “A 50-year boom is over, vineyards are being abandoned, we’ve even ripped out a few plots ourselves,” said Tony Laithwaite, the founder of the wine retailer Laithwaites. He cited collapsing demand in key markets including China, sales in France dropping and a swing towards white wine. “Bordeaux’s posh and pricey image just doesn’t fit any more, in these times of straitened circumstances for everyone.”For Jonathan Kleeman, a sommelier and wine consultant, millennials are less likely to collect expensive wines than previous generations, preferring wines that are ready to drink. “The new category is going to be interesting,” Kleeman said. “It actually harks back to the old days. Bordeaux didn’t used to be the big wines they are today. It’s actually bringing an old English term back.”Could it confuse drinkers? “Not really, these wines are aimed at younger generations who don’t really use the word ‘claret’,” he said. Kleeman cited other old wines now fashionable again, frompétillant naturelor “pet-nat”, a traditional form of sparkling wine, to the use of amphorae, ceramic storing vessels popular with natural wine producers. “It could be a very good move, and people ‘in the know’ might like the irony of calling it ‘claret’.”Today, Burgundy is widely considered the world’s most expensive wine region. Will claret be more in line with its pinot noir reds? “I don’t think so,” said sommelier Tom Claxton. “I think the similarities will be a lighter body, but I’d expect these to be more playful or ‘fun’ wines.”Explore more on these topicsWineFoodFranceEuropeFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"
