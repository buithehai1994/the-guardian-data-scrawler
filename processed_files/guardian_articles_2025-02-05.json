The crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has ruled out normalising ties without the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, the foreign ministry said in a statement.Jordan’s King Abdullah, who faces a difficult face-to-face meeting with Trump in Washington next week, also rejected “any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians”.It was not the first time he had made Jordan’s position clear. The country already hosts more than 2.7 million Palestinian refugees and accepting people from Gaza under duress would have a destabilising effect.Egypt’s foreign ministry said reconstruction needed to happen “without Palestinians leaving the territory”. It has previously warned any attempt to transfer people out of Gaza to the Sinai would threaten the peace deal.Late on Wednesday Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, said any “forced displacement” of Gaza’s population would be “unacceptable”.“It would be a serious violation of international law, an obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilising force for Egypt and Jordan,” the two leaders said, according to a statement from the French presidency.The US president had anticipated and shrugged off these refusals in advance, perhaps confident that both countries are vulnerable because of their reliance on American money and weapons.“The king in Jordan and the general in Egypt will open their hearts and give us the kind of land we need to get this done,” Trump said at the press conference, after laying out plans for the US takeover.But the political and security implications of taking in large numbers of people from Gaza under duress will be a powerful counterbalance to even the most aggressive threats from the White House.Trump’s comments came at the start of negotiations for a second stage of the ceasefire deal in Gaza, and sparked fears that they could threaten talks, although the framework deal defers any long-term planning for Gaza’s future to a third stage.A spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, a host and key mediator in the last round of talks, said they were focusing on extending the current agreement, due to expire at the end of the month.“I don’t think it’s a time now to start commenting on specific ideas,” spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told Fox News. “It’s too early to talk about this, because we don’t know how this war will end.”Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, embraced Trump’s comments as vindication of his decision to stay in Netanyahu’s government, despite his fierce opposition to the ceasefire and hostage release deal.The US plan would “finally bury, with God’s help, the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state”, he said in a triumphant statement, celebrating the prospect of US power deployed to force Palestinians out of Gaza. “Believe me, this is just the beginning.”Rival far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir suggested Trump’s proposal would effectively negate the need for ceasefire talks, which have been overshadowed from the start by lack of any Israeli plans for post-conflict Gaza.“The only solution to Gaza is to encourage the migration of Gazans … this is the strategy for the ‘day after’,” Ben-Gvir said.“I call on the prime minister to announce the adoption of the plan as soon as possible and to begin immediate practical progress.”One of Netanyahu’s biggest political rivals, Benny Gantz, also backed Trump’s plans to resettle Palestinians outside Gaza as “admirable”, and said Israel has “nothing to lose from it, only something to gain”.Only politicians from Israel’s relatively small leftwing parties openly opposed Trump’s proposals, with Gilad Kariv from the Democrats party describing it as “a nightmare for Israel” and Ayman Odeh from the Joint List warning that “a transfer will not happen and will not bring security”.Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau in Gaza, said Palestinians there had shown their “steadfastness” over 15 months of intense attacks, and any US troops sent to the territory would face the same opposition as the Israeli military.“What the occupation has failed to do, no American administration or power in the world will succeed in implementing,” he said.Quique Kierszenbaumcontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Previously, it said there would be no changes to the site before the eighth anniversary of the disaster, which claimed 72 lives in June 2017.Concerns have been raised over how many loved ones were spoken to before the new decision was taken. Many families have said that the structure should remain in place until there are criminal prosecutions over the failings that led to the fire. The near decade-long wait for justice has been described as “unbearable” by some.Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and bereaved families of the disaster, said on Wednesday evening that the voices of the bereaved were being ignored.“We’ve said this to every secretary of state for housing since the very beginning: consult the bereaved and survivors meaningfully before reaching a decision on the tower,” the group said.“Angela Rayner could not give a reason for her decision to demolish the tower.”What remains of the tower has stood in place since 2017, with a covering on the building featuring a large green heart accompanied by the words “forever in our hearts”.A government spokesperson said: “The priority for the deputy prime minister is to meet with and write to the bereaved, survivors and the immediate community to let them know her decision on the future of the Grenfell Tower.“This is a deeply personal matter for all those affected, and the deputy prime minister is committed to keeping their voice at the heart of this.”The final report of theGrenfell Tower inquiry, published in September, concluded the disaster was the result of “decades of failure” by the government and the construction industry to act on the dangers of flammable materials on high-rise buildings.The westLondontower block was covered in combustible products because of the “systematic dishonesty” of firms that made and sold the cladding and insulation, the inquiry chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said.The “simple truth” was that all the deaths were avoidable and that those who lived in the tower were “badly failed” by authorities, Moore-Bick said. “In most cases through incompetence but, in some cases, through dishonesty and greed,” he added.In May 2024, prosecutors and police said investigators would need until the end of 2025 to complete their inquiry, with final decisions on potential criminal charges by the end of 2026.Separately to the inquiry, the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been consulting on plans for a permanent memorial in the area of the tower. It set out recommendations for a “sacred space”, designed to be a “peaceful place for remembering and reflecting”, in a 2023 report.The commission said it expects the memorial design to be sufficiently developed to enable a planning application to be submitted in late 2026, with a shortlist of five potential designs for it being drawn last month.Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireGrenfell Tower inquiryAngela RaynerLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The email was first reported by the Daily Telegraph.“Some of you may be aware of an article that was published by the Guardian yesterday,” staff were told.“We are naturally appalled by any allegation of conduct that is so at odds with the culture we strive to foster within the group, even if it was several decades ago. No colleague should be subjected to inappropriate sexual behaviour.“Before this article was published, the Guardian contacted us requesting information on some unspecific claims from the 1990s. We repeatedly tried to engage with them to establish the facts.“Despite the difficulties in investigating claims which are alleged to have taken place almost 30 years ago, we made extensive inquiries and conducted a thorough search of our internal records and found nothing that would support the allegations from this period.“We discovered a single complaint of sexual misconduct in late 2003. This case was investigated immediately, dealt with appropriately, with full support for the colleague concerned, and led to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild leaving the group in March 2004.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A scion of one of the most famous dynasties in global banking, he spent 44 years working within Rothschild family businesses.According to sources who spoke to the Guardian, he used his office within NM Rothschild, a stone’s throw from the Bank of England in the City of London,to force himself upon women over several years.The claims include serious sexual assaults. One included a violent assault of a member of staff when she was a young woman working for him. Another allegation is that he put his hands down a different woman’s top and under her underwear to grope her. And a third woman claimed she was forced to perform a sex act on him while he sat on his desk.Rothschild & Co did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsRothschild & CoBankingFinancial sectorSexual harassmentnewsShareReuse this content"

So far it has won 11 of them and lost only one, and there are two others ongoing, the BMJ reported.Its victories have led to it being allowed to open some branches for 24 hours a day and to display advertising signs featuring its golden arches logo next to roads.In one case, it told the planning appeals body that customers at a proposed new drive-through McDonald’s in Norwich would be able to order coffee, salad and meals containing fewer than 400 calories. A “notable amount of custom will be on foot or by cycle”, it insisted, despite the outlet being next to a busy ring road.It also highlighted that its provision of a climbing frame would encourage “physical activity” and “healthier lifestyles”.Despite Norwich city council’s objections, the inspectorate upheld McDonald’s appeal and the restaurant – its 10th in the city – will open in the middle of the year.The company has used statements provided on its behalf by Dr Matthew Capehorn, a GP who set up a private weight management clinic in Rotherham, to win appeals against local authorities’ attempts to stop it opening new branches in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, and Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.Capehorn, who has previously worked as a paid medical adviser to McDonald’s, told the inspectorate that its food was “healthy and nutritious”. In addition, he said “over 100” factors contributed to the development of obesity, not just unhealthy food.In submissions to the inspectorate, McDonald’s sought to allay Mansfield district council’s concerns about a planned outlet that would be near three primary schools.“Children are likely to visit the restaurant with a supervising adult who can support the child to make responsible food choices,” it said. Its appeal was again upheld.The investigation, by the health journalist Sophie Borland, identified five cases since 2020 in which a council rejected McDonald’s application to open a new branch but the firm successfully appealed by claiming it would promote healthy living.In several cases, McDonald’s threatened to sue local councils for repayment of its legal costs because they had acted “unreasonably” in refusing their applications.McDonald’s posts biggest decline in global sales in four yearsRead moreAlice Wiseman, the director of public health in Gateshead, told the BMJ that McDonald’s tactics made it hard for councils to refuse fast-food outlets permission to open on health grounds.“It’s very undermining in the role of local government in being able to shape a healthy environment. We haven’t got the resources that the likes of McDonald’s have got to be able to get into any legal battles with this. It’s David and Goliath.”Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and the head of research and impact at the campaign groupAction on Sugar, said: “It is outrageous that a major fast-food outlet is using its vast financial and legal resources to override local councils’ efforts to protect public health.“It is no more enough to just offer some salad options than to claim that a company promotes ‘healthier lifestyle’. Clear transparency on sales of healthier options is now needed, with evidence of improvement over time.”Katharine Jenner, the director of theObesity Health Alliance, said McDonald’s claims were “pure corporate spin”.Poorer areas now have twice as many fast-food outlets as rich ones, she said. “This flood of takeaways is fuelling obesity rates, with diet-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, musculoskeletal conditions and poor mental health forcing thousands out of the workforce and piling pressure on the NHS.”A Department ofHealthspokesperson said: “Fast-food giants are cruelly targeting children by setting up near schools and prioritising their profits over our kids’ health.“This government is tackling the obesity crisis head-on by giving councils stronger powers to block new fast-food outlets near schools and further measures to crack down on junk food advertising targeting children.”McDonald’s told the BMJ: “We pride ourselves on being a positive presence in the communities within which we operate.“Local decision-making is a critical part of the planning application process and we always want to work in partnership with local councils to ensure our plans are right for the community.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMcDonald'sLocal governmentPlanning policyObesityFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

I’m glad it was made | Gareth BenestRead moreBadenoch said: “Our country is not a dormitory, it’s our home. The right to citizenship and permanent residency should only go to those who have demonstrated a real commitment to the UK.“That’s why we should double the length of time before people can qualify for indefinite leave to remain from five to 10 years.”She added: “The Conservative party is under new leadership. We’re going to tell the hard truths about immigration.“The pace of immigration has been too quick and the numbers coming too high for meaningful integration. We need to slow down the track for citizenship.”Under current rules, workers and refugees who have been in the UK for five years can apply for indefinite leave to remain, which allows them to stay in the country but does not grant full citizenship. This indefinite leave to remain allows people to claim benefits for the first time, though they must wait a further year before applying for citizenship.The Tories are proposing extending that period to 10 years, and disqualifying anyone who has claimed benefits or lived in social housing during that period. They will also have to contribute more in taxes than they and their dependents collectively receive in public services or welfare.Once a person has been granted settled status, they will then be made to wait for a further five years before being allowed to apply for full citizenship.People entering illegally – which includes those seeking asylum from almost everywhere in the world – would be barred from ever claiming settled status.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s why we will introduce a binding annual cap on visa numbers, at far lower levels.”The Tories oversaw record levels of net migration while in office, something many senior members of the party believe was largely responsible for their election loss last year.Badenoch saidin a speech last year: “During the last Conservative administration, we promised to bring numbers down. We did not deliver that promise. We ended free movement but the system that replaced it is not working.”Since coming to power, Labour has scrapped the previous government’s plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Labour has introduced its own borders and immigration bill, which would give police forces greater power to take action against gangs of people smugglers.Both Labour and the Torieshave been alarmedby the recent rise in support for the anti-immigration Reform UK.

She is still considered by the state to be among the worst serial killers in British history and isserving 15 whole-life termsin Bronzefield prison. Her convictions remain for the murder of seven babies and attempted murder of another seven while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester hospital.Letby has already lost two attempts to appeal against her convictions. In May last year the court of appeal dismissed Letby’s case on all grounds and rejected her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.Unless and until the CCRC decides that the latest evidence is enough to persuade the court of appeal to rethink, she will remain in prison.How quickly will a decision be made?It depends who you ask. A source at the CCRC said it was “fanciful” that Letby’s case would be referred back to the appeal court even within a year, but her representatives say they see no reason why it could not be imminent.Letby’s new barrister, Mark McDonald, told the Guardian that “the case is now so strong that I could not see any reason why the CCRC shouldn’t be immediately referring this back to the court of appeal”. He believes that Letby’s convictions should be referred by the summer at the latest, but the CCRC is likely to take a much more cautious approach.The CCRC source said: “It’s incredibly complicated. It won’t be quick. It’s going to be years, not months, because you’ve got to go back and read all of what was presented at trial.“You’ve got to do a full and detailed review and unfortunately they take a long time. That’s the nature of complexity of this type of case.”The CCRC will be aware of the publicity around the case and will want to be seen to have handled it efficiently, especially after the criticism it received overfailures in the Andrew Malkinson case. But the first Letby trial took eight months and the volume of material will be immense.Even before the application came in, the CCRC has had at least three staff familiarising themselves with the case over recent months in anticipation. They are understood to have been handpicked for their expertise on legally and medically complex cases.The CCRC was sent the 31-page summary report on Monday night, just before the press conference. It is understood it will receive the full dossier within weeks.A CCRC spokesperson was careful not to put a timeline on it: “At this stage it is not possible to determine how long it will take to review this application. A significant volume of complicated evidence was presented to the court in Ms Letby’s trials.”They added that they were anticipating “further submissions from Ms Letby’s representatives”.How strong is the new evidence?Letby’s convictions for murdering and harming babies by injecting air into their bloodstreams and poisoning them with insulin rested largely on evidence presented by one retired consultant paediatrician. Now a 14-strong panel of eminent neonatologists and paediatricians from around the world is unequivocal in its conclusions that no scientific proof of this exists.The panel found “no medical evidence supporting malfeasance causing death or injury” in any of the babies whose cases they examined.McDonald said: “You do not get any better than the expert neonatologists that have written these reports and it’s completely demolished the medical evidence that was presented to the jury.”So is a referral back to the appeal court a certainty?While those watching the press conference on Tuesday may assume so, others believe it is far from guaranteed.A source at the CCRC said that despite the “huge groundswell of public opinion” on the case, that did not mean it would persuade appeal court judges. They said: “The court of appeal don’t like expert shopping, as they call it. They just say, you can keep going around until you find the right expert that will agree with you, but that’s not what it’s about.”McDonald argues the case is not as complicated as it first appears. “This is not a complicated case. People want to make it a complicated case because it’s so long,” he said. “But actually, when you analyse it, it’s not that overly complicated, because the starting point is looking at the credibility of the evidence that went before the jury from one, maybe two or three expert witnesses on their precise hypothesis of what they say took place.”Could Letby be granted bail?Even if the CCRC decided the new evidence presented a real possibility that the court of appeal would overturn Letby’s conviction, her release from prison is far from guaranteed. The Crown Prosecution Service has already indicated it would fight any appeal and is unlikely to support a bail application.A CPS spokesperson said: “Two juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby. She has been convicted on 15 separate counts following two separate jury trials.”Might anything else hold up the consideration of her case?The police are still considering bringing further charges against Letby in relation to other baby deaths, including at a second hospital, Liverpool Women’s hospital. She wasquestioned under police cautionin prison late last year and if any charges are brought this could delay the CCRC process.The Thirlwall inquiryinto the deaths of babies, which proceeded on the basis they were murders, is coming to a conclusion and closing submissions will be heard in Liverpool later next month. The CCRC is likely to be watching this closely.What can other cases tell us about Letby’s likely fate?Ben Geen, a nurse who was jailed for life 19 years agoafter he was convicted of murdering two of his patients and poisoning 15 others, has been trying to convince the CCRC of his innocence for more than a decade. He is also represented by McDonald, the barrister now working for Letby.Geen’s conviction rested largely on the basis that he had been on shift at the time of an “unusual” number of cases of respiratory arrest. Attempts to persuade the CCRC to send this conviction for appeal with the evidence of eminent statisticians have repeatedly failed, with applications in 2013 and 2015 denied. McDonald obtained a successful judicial review of the 2015 rejection, arguing the evidence had not been properly considered. But after a more thorough assessment, the CCRC again turned him down.However, there is another case that offers more hope for Letby. Colin Norris, a nurse known as the “angel of death” who was convicted of killing four patients by injecting them with insulin, will have his case considered by the court of appeal in April. It was referred by the CCRC on the basis that the prosecution wrongly asserted that spontaneous hypoglycaemia was extremely rare. Letby’s lawyers will be watching closely.Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Roughly 20 Doge employees are now working out of the Department of Education, theWashington Post has reported, and have gained access to sensitive internal systems there too. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported they had infiltrated the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and accessed key systems as well.The young engineers, whose identities have been confirmed to the Guardian, wanted the same atUSAid. One of them, Gavin Kliger, was a 25-year-old techie who has defended the failed attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz as avictim of the “deep state”and claimed he had left behind a seven-figure salary to join Doge and “save America”. Another, Luke Farritor, 23, was a former SpaceX intern who had been given top-level clearances to USAid systems and had requested similar to Medicare and Medicaid. A third, Jeremy Lewin, was an AI specialist also reportedly assigned to the General Services Administration. A superior planned to lobby the CIA for a clearance for him after he failed to gain access to a secure area.What is USAid and why does Trump dislike it so much?Read moreSome US officials had begun calling the young engineers the “Muskovites” for their aggressive loyalty to the SpaceX owner. But someUSAidstaff used another word: the “incels”.The Guardian has identified three calls by Musk to USAid’s political leadership and security officers in which he demanded the suspensions of dozens of the agency’s leading officials, and cajoled and threatened senior USAid officials to give his acolytes private data and access to restricted areas. At one point, he threatened to call in the US Marshals Service.One USAid employee said that the calls by Musk, two of which have not been previously reported, showed he had effectively usurped power at the agency even from theTrump administration’s political leadership. “Who is in control of our government?” the person said. “[Doge] basically showed up and took over.”In the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, USAid had been presented as a pilot test for a large-scale overhaul of the federal government that would downsize agencies and arbitrarily move federal employees to looser contracts that made them easier to fire.“If theTrump administrationis successful here, they’re going to try this everywhere else,” said Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey, a former USAid employee who came to protest alongside fired and furloughed workers outside the agency’s headquarters on Monday. “This is just the beginning.”View image in fullscreenA building security officer stands at a checkpoint in the lobby of the USAid office in Washington. Staffers have been instructed via an email to stay out of the agency’s headquarters.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPABut it has also been a primer on how Doge operatives have inserted themselves into federal agencies and cajoled and bullied their way to access their most sensitive systems. This account of Doge’s infiltration of USAid is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former USAid, state department and other officials briefed on the events of the last week.Security staff initially rebuffed the engineers’ efforts to talk their way into the secure rooms, called sensitive compartmented information facilities (Scifs), because they didn’t have the necessary security clearances. But that evening, Musk phoned a senior official at USAid to demand access for his subordinates, the first of numerous calls to officials and employees of Doge at USAid that have continued into this week.Inside the building, chaos reigned. Areas that were once declared restricted, with limitations on electronics such as phones and watches, suddenly loosened their security protocols to allow in uncredentialed outsiders. Doge employees were said to obscure their identities to prevent online harassment, a tactic that was repeated at other agencies. AndPeter Marocco, thecontroversial new director of foreign assistanceat the state department, was stalking the halls and meeting in private with the Doge employees.By Friday, things had gone further downhill. After a tense all-hands meeting with senior staff, and outsiders in the sixth-floor conference room, the young engineers rushed around the offices with their laptops, plugging cords into computers and other electronics as they gathered data from the agency.After the meeting, Matt Hopson, a Trump appointee for USAid chief of staff, abruptly resigned. Jason Gray, the acting administrator, was removed from his position. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was soon to announce that he was the new administrator of USAid and appoint Marocco as his deputy. Musk was closing in on his goal.The Doge employees had open access to rooms throughout the sixth floor, including the offices of the administrator’s suite. But the Scifs were still off limits.At USAid, a newly installed leadership was formally in charge. But the real power lay withMaroccoand Doge, which was plotting how to wind down the agency, a plan that Trump endorsed on Tuesday afternoon as he confirmed that teams were backed by the White House. That evening, USAid announced it would put all its direct-hire personnel around the world on administrative leave, a decision that would affect thousands of employees and their families.Inside of USAid, the operation to shut down the decades-old operation was being run by Marocco, four engineers in their early 20s and the Doge leadership that contacted them by phone.“It’s all being driven through Doge right now,” said a current USAid official, adding that Doge engineers in USAid headquarters continued to field calls from Musk and Marocco on Monday. “The folks in the building are turning the system off for [USAid employees], they’ve kept a small number of people from the different bureaus to help understand what programs will be kept and not kept, what the footprint will look like.”View image in fullscreenSignage for USAid is seen on a cargo container behind people sorting through salvageable items to be sold to junk shops in Manila, Philippines, on Monday.Photograph: Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe tension at USAid headquarters came to a head on Saturday evening, when Doge employees demanded access to the Scif on the agency’s sixth floor. They were stopped by the agency’s top security officer, John Voorhees.Among those present was Steve Davis, according to one current and one former USAid official. Davis, a Musk deputy, has worked with the billionaire for more than 20 years at SpaceX and the Boring Company. He reportedly sometimes slept in the Twitter offices to help Musk slash costs there after he acquired it in 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe argument over access to the Scif had grown verbally heated and senior Doge staff threatened to call in US marshals to gain access to it. During that standoff, according to one account made to the Guardian, a call was again made to Musk, who, as Bloomberg first reported, repeated the threat to involve the US Marshals Service.Shortly after, Voorhees was placed on administrative leave and the Doge staffers entered the Scif. They took over the access control system and employee records. Within hours,the USAid website went down. Hundreds of employees were locked out of the system that weekend, and many still don’t know their status. (The Guardian has seen emails in which USAid administrators admit they do not know the employment states of current USAid officials.)“I’ve been furloughed, I guess?” said one contractor with 15 years of experience for the bureau for humanitarian assistance, where she had helped coordinate urgent responses in Ukraine, Gaza, Somalia and Latin America. “I don’t know what my status is but I don’t think I work here right now.”By Monday, Kliger wrote an email to all staff at 12.42am to tell them not to bother coming into the building that day.The incident has illustrated how Doge employees with Musk’s backing were able to override USAid leadership and bypass government procedures for accessing restricted areas with classified materials, fueling criticism that his agency is a national security risk.“Did Secretary Rubio allow this kind of access by Musk’s employees?” asked Kim. “It worries me about USAid but if it’s happening here, I’m guessing it’s probably happening at all these other national security agencies.”Formally, Rubio has delegated responsibility to Marocco, who has been pressed by congressional staffers to give details of the changes affecting USAid and the $40bn in foreign aid it manages each year.Trump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: ‘He’s a destroyer’Read more“The question at hand is: who’s in charge of the state department?” Senator Brian Schatz told the Guardian. “So far the answer has been Pete Marocco.”Doge did not respond to questions about what security clearances, if any, the engineers held. “No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” wrote Katie Miller, a Doge spokesperson, on social media.But Scifs are regulated by a strict protocol and it is unclear who could have verified the Doge employees’ credentials and filed the necessary paperwork to allow them to enter.Inside the building, staffers said that Doge cultivated a culture of fear.“It’s an extreme version of ‘who do you trust, when and how?’” said Kristina Drye, a speechwriter at the agency, who watched dozens of senior colleagues escorted out of the building by security. “It felt like the Soviet stories that one day someone is beside you and the next day they’re not.”People started meeting for coffee blocks away because “they didn’t feel safe in the coffee shops here to even talk about what’s going on”, she added.“I was in the elevator one morning and there was an older lady standing beside me and she had glasses on and I could see tears coming down under her glasses and before she got off her elevator she took her glasses off, wiped her eyes, and walked out,” she said. “Because if they see you crying, they know where you stand.”Explore more on these topicsUSAidTrump administrationElon MuskDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anger, he says, “only serves the enemy”.Larson’s ancient-but-modern avenger Elektra, not an intergalactic warrior but a punk rock rebel, is nothing if not angry over the murder of her father, Agamemnon, at the hands of her mother, Clytemnestra. Emotion burns off her but serves her vengeance well enough. She looks androgynous and off-kilter with a buzz cut and a Bikini Kill T-shirt.Directed by Daniel Fish, who radically adaptedOklahoma!at the Young Vic in 2022, this arresting production is similarly overhauled. Part spoken, part sung through in recitative and partly shouted in fury, this is a lyrical, avant garde creation, like a long lamentation, bare in its staging and emotions.Elektra speaks into a handheld mic and her lines turn into sudden song, harsh or tender (Larson was briefly a singer herself and once released an album). Notes slide up the scale then career back down into spoken word. Sometimes she uses a voice distortion machine, like a death metal singer, to mimic her mother or express loathing (“howling bitch”). The anger is never shrill or flatly pitched – her delivery captures not only anger but also grief, resembling Hamlet when at her most melancholy. It is a magnetic performance, fearless for aWest Enddebut.View image in fullscreenLike a bored Upper East Side mother … Stockard Channing, centre, as Clytemnestra in Elektra.Sound is key to this version of the ancient Greek revenge drama by Sophokles (the production restores the “k” for both the protagonist and writer). Translated by Canadian poet Anne Carson, with crystalline verse, it is filled with ritual stomps, bangs and funereal keening. Sound is Elektra’s weapon too, assaulting the ears. Told she is the weaker sex, her voice is mobilised in protest: “No” is an elongated, rising note she returns to in her dissonant assertion of power.But words are also harmonious in the mouths of the all-female, six-strong chorus (are they band members?). Musicality predominates, accentuating the sense of a sung-through ancient Greek chorus, the text set to composer Ted Hearne’s music. Jeremy Herbert’s set design is a plain arrangement of shadows and sound equipment, some of it overhead, with the stage forever in revolve. It has the effect of a gig gone awry.Elektra’s family clashes are fuelled by a complex dynamic in which no character comes off as plainly villainous or virtuous. Stockard Channing is imperious and desultory as Clytemnestra, like a bored Upper East Side mother. But she defends herself against her daughter’s accusations with reasoned argument, reminding her of Agamemnon’s sacrifice of Iphigenia, and momentarily making Larson look like a brattish high-schooler.View image in fullscreenPassing humour … Patrick Vaill plays Orestes.Photograph: Helen MurrayA fight with Elektra’s sister, Chrysothemis (Marième Diouf), whom she charges with cowardice, is overlain with the strains of Beyoncé’sDaddy Lessons, which gets louder until the dialogue is drowned out – as if taking place in an angry teenager’s bedroom.Violence remains off stage but is insinuated with a device in which a modern-day massacre is described through reportage. This works, but there are some more mystifying or achingly cool elements: a blimp dangling over the stage, out of keeping with the rest of the imagery; a smoke machine that exhales swirling plumes as Elektra’s returning brother, Orestes (Patrick Vaill), prepares to kill his mother.Electra-fying! Captain Marvel’s Brie Larson brings back an ancient avengerRead moreSo much good eclipses the oddities, though, and there is passing humour, too, including wry asides from Larson and the sight of Orestes, in disguise, speaking of the doomed chariot race dressed in a Formula One boiler suit. His role seems deliberately abbreviated, as if to underline the fact that this is a play about women, power and patriarchy.In that there is an oblique lesson for our times on individual responsibility in a time of corruption. Do you bend to toxic power, like Chrysothemis, or enact violence against violence? If the latter, what is the personal cost of this? The lights go down with this question hovering.It is a penetrating production, lean, charged and fresh with a concentrated central performance: celebrity casting, for a change, more than pays off. Larson shines, dangerously.AtDuke of York’s theatre, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreBrie LarsonWest EndSophoclesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s good to be back in hellChitra RamaswamyWed 5 Feb 2025 16.30 ESTShareAmandaland begins, in time-honoured Motherland fashion, under pressure on the school run. Except we’re not in Chiswick – we’re now in south Harlesden, Amanda is driving a Tesla for ever on the brink of running out of battery, and Georgie and Manus, who aren’t so little any more, have been forced to move school after the collapse of Mummy’s ruthlessly Hygge-Tygge’d life. Cue a pep talk by the worst, by which I mean the best, Motherland mother of all. “I’m a people person,” says Amanda. “And historically our people are people people. So get out there and find your people!”Ah, it’s good to be back in hell. Spin-offs are always a risk, but Lucy Punch’s Amanda was a sure bet. Sorry, team Liz, but she was the best character in Motherland: the ideal Sharon-Horgan-sharpened instrument for impaling the worstexcesses, blind spots and hypocrisies of the posh, white, west London middle classes. By the end of the third and last series, Amanda had perversely become the cruel heart of the show. I felt actual compassion for her when she did that dance at the PTA fundraiser that got 400 TikTok likes. Weird, I know, but that’s what satire at its most skewering can do. It makes you care.Amandaland is created and written by the Motherland team Holly Walsh, Helen Serafinowicz and Barunka O’Shaughnessy, with Horgan credited as creator. More of the same, then, which is a compliment, because it’s not as though the schedules are teeming with laser-sharp satirical sitcoms about vaginal mesh. Thus from the ashes of W4 Amanda rises to become the “queen of SoHa”. Because, according to Amanda, that’s what property experts are calling south Harlesden. “You mean that area around Wormwood prison?” asks Anne (Philippa Dunne). There’s lots to love, she prattles on, about the new school … the Stem hub, rock choir; they say the torture scene from A Clockwork Orange was filmed in the playground. Amanda: “I’m actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They’ve got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.” When the writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.So no Julia, Liz or Kevin, then – at least not in the first four episodes – but Anne, happily, features heavily. The relationship between her and Amanda is toxic and codependent, but also, you have to concede, kind of sweet. The same goes for the narcissism-powered dynamic between Amanda and her mother, Felicity, played with Ab Fab levels of relish by Joanna Lumley. In episode one, she arrives with a tuck parcel from Waitrose, “now that you’ve only got a Tesco Metro”. There’s white wine, Earl Grey chocolates for the children and goji berries for Amanda. “That actually will be really nice for my bircher muesli,” Amanda says. “Still doing breakfast?” Felicity bats back with a sneer.There are lots of new characters, some more successful than others. More men reside in Amandaland (in Motherland, they were mostly noticeable by their absence), but they are less convincingly drawn than the women. Where it’s best is in setting up bog-standard, thoroughly British, inherently absurd scenarios – the car boot sale! The parents’ evening! – in which to carefully insert the characters so everyone reveals their worst side.Take episode one, when Amanda tries to befriend SoHa lesbian power couple Della (Siobhán McSweeney, in fine brusque fettle) and Fi (Rochenda Sandall) at their house party. Della is the head chef at Shin, the small-plates restaurant beside the megachurch that used to be Debenhams; Fi is worryingly into wicker basketry. Together, they possess an alarmingly relaxed approach to parenting. “I trained in France,” says Della, right before the teenagers get hammered on armagnac and the grownups eat artisan chocolates laced with magic mushrooms in the hot tub. “Oh, I love the whole ‘du pain, du vin, du Boursin’ thang,” Amanda replies.The gags – about Gloria Hunniford, the Just Seventeen problem page and Sinn Féin – are very British and aimed at a very particular audience, namely strung out middle-aged mums longing to laugh until they wee a bit at jokes about wellness supplements. Too rarely do we get the chance.Ultimately, though, this is Amanda’s show. Her descent from alpha west London mummy to single mother carrying a mood board on a bike (the Tesla doesn’t make it) to sell waste disposal units is uproarious, but also unexpectedly moving.This is largely due to Punch’s comic timing and earnest delivery of killer lines such as: “I’m actually reclaiming the word ‘simpleton’.” But it’s also down to the unforgiving terrain of Amandaland, which is to sayourland. Amanda may be a narcissistic vortex who has had to invent a new word – “senuous” – to capture her essence, but she is also a mother, who is alone, unmothered, unravelling and yet refusing to loosen her grip on a world designed to break her. And that, tragically and comically, will always be relatable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With 12 months to go until the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson are winning medals and turning heads in the sport of ice dancing. They have skill and charisma that carries echoes ofTorvill and Dean, but their soundtrack is less Boléro, more Beyoncé.Just off the back of a bronze medal at the European championships, Fear and Gibson closed out their routine with a free dance to a medley of Beyoncé hits. Including a section that Fear has previously described as involving some twerking, the couple are doing things differently to generations that have gone before and building a connection with a new generation of fans.Lindsey Vonn’s ‘impossible’ comeback roars on with 2026 Olympics in frameRead more“Connecting with the crowd is something that brings us so much joy and is a huge focus of our training and our performance,” says Fear, who was born in Canada but moved to the UK at the age of two. “[We choose] music that is entertaining and gets people on their feet because we get so much energy from the crowd and we hope to give them energy and a nice escape, too. I think that it’s something that we really prioritise in our craft.”For Gibson, who is from Prestwick, embedding effervescence and emotion into their dancing is instinctive. “I think for us it’s a natural way of performing in the sport and we choose music because we love that music and it lights us up and so in turn our performance is more energetic and real,” he says.“I think it’s great for the sport. You buy tickets to watch a competitive sport, but you’re also getting a show at the same time. And if you can get the crowd going and get them feeling something and just really lighting them up, I can’t think of anything better than that.”As for Queen Bey herself, Fear says it is the singer’s confidence that inspires. “She just … embodies confidence and empowerment. It’s the sheer expression of who she is and her inner power. And it’s just something that I think as performers, we really strive to have ourselves. So to be able to play that character and draw upon that within ourselves is something that has been very rewarding this season of just finding more confidence as who we are as people, what we want to promote as our personalities and our expression. And it’s just been an amazing vehicle for us.”View image in fullscreenGibson and Fear working on a routine at the Lee Valley Ice Centre in London.Photograph: John Walton/PAThen there’s the small matter of two other iconic figures. Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean’sflawless gold medal performanceat the Sarajevo Games in 1984 remains both the pinnacle of British ice dancing and the last moment the sport truly cut through with the public (the Boléro dance reached an estimated TV audience of 24 million people). For Fear and Gibson the pair are both models and inspiration.“I wouldn’t be skating if it wasn’t for them creating their show,” Gibson says. “And, of course, their legacy is massive in the UK. Everyone knows them, what they’ve achieved and created over the years, the way they have taken the sport and changed it is an inspiration. Their creativity is something we both admire so much and try to foster in our own careers as well.

A diverting sideshow at best. After Donald Trump’s overnight announcement that he wanted the US to own Gaza, to displace 1.8 million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan, who have already said they don’t want them, and to turn the territory into a new Riviera, Wednesday was such a day. A moment when you have to ask yourself: what the hell just happened?And no doubt we can expect many more such days in the next four years if the US president maintains his Maga “speak first, think later” persona. That’s assuming that thinking will make any difference. It’s possible The Donald is delusional enough to believe all this stuff. That when he collides with reality, it is reality that has to change. He makes Boris Johnson look like Winston Churchill.You can tell we have slipped through the looking-glass when even Priti Patel agrees with the Labour government. But that was where we were on Wednesday morning, with Patel and David Lammy saying the Palestinians had a right to remain and that the only acceptable long-term answer was a two-state solution.It was the same response from almost every party, though John Swinney, the SNP leader, was the only one to use the words “ethnic cleansing”. We have yet to hear from Nigel Farage. Nige likes to think he is the man of the people who is not afraid to say what he thinks, but he tends to come over all coy when the president he would like to count as his friend goes too far. Or maybe he’s thinking he would like to buy shares in the new casinos and golf courses along the new Riviera.What was missing from the government’s response was any criticism of The Donald.Keir Starmerhas clearly decided the best way to treat the orange man-child who happens to be the most powerful man in the western world is to act like an over-indulgent parent. To shower him with praise before gently suggesting possible alternatives. Hope that he doesn’t actually realise he has been criticised. Anything to avoid a temper tantrum resulting in tariffs. Parenting with the lightest of touches. Baby wrangling.So the government began its response to the fresh Trumpian hell by praising The Donald. He had been so right to say Gaza was just a pile of rubble. This was an insight that had escaped every other western leader. Starmer himself had believed that most buildings were still standing and couldn’t understand why so many Palestinians had not gone home. So the world owed the president a huge debt of gratitude.But – mumble, mumble – he might care to have another think about the US moving in and kicking out the Palestinians. No pressure. No hurry. If The Donald were to go ahead, Keir was sure it would be a great success. But maybe it would be an even more bigly success were the US to be not so actively involved.So no wonder Trump barely got a mention in prime minister’s questions: Ed Davey was the only person to bring him up, and even then at arm’s length. Everyone knows what’s right but is terrified of the consequences of standing up to the president. Just hope to survive unnoticed. The Tory benches were unnaturally quiet.For the most part, though, PMQs continue to be Starmer’s comfort zone. His relaxing half-hour where he gets to zone out. A bit like a yoga lesson. Not because everything is going so well for Labour – far from it – but becauseKemi Badenochis so ineffective as a leader of the opposition. To be fair, she is trying to get better. She now wakes up every morning and tries not to believe every mad conspiracy theory she reads on X, but she has no extended attention span. At heart she is too lazy. She isn’t prepared to do the work. She is riddled with levitas. An unserious politician.Kemi began by saying that when Labour negotiates, the UK loses. Hmm. We’re all thrilled that the Tories’ Brexit negotiations left us so much better off, of course. But, moving on, she cited the Chagos Islands deal as a massive failure. Even though she didn’t know exactly what it was. Starmer spelled things out for her. It was a matter of national security. That’s why the Conservatives had conducted 11 rounds of negotiations while they were in office. Labour had offered to brief Badenoch on privy council terms but she had declined. Too busy fighting culture wars on social media. Now, it is possible there was no issue of national security. It is possible the Chagos deal really is terrible. But the leader of the opposition couldn’t be bothered to find out.There was no comeback from this. Kemi had yet again shown herself to be out of her depth. Many Tories looked on in despair. They are having buyers’ remorse. Imagining a new life under Robert Jenrick. They are that desperate. Badenoch did not fare any better with her next five questions. All of which were a defence of drilling for more oil in the North Sea. Yet again she seemed to have missed the point. Starmer is minded to go ahead but it was her government that had given a consent that the courts found to be unlawful. Badenoch is her own worst enemy.A few Tories were disappointed that Kemi had not raised the issue of Starmer’s voice coach, as they have managed to convince themselves that Keir had broken lockdown rules. Not doing this turned out to be one of the few things Badenoch got right in the past week. When the Tory MP Gagan Mohindra voiced his concerns, he was brutally slapped down. He had been working on a response to the Brexit deal, Keir said. The coach was part of his core team. This was a tough one for the Tories to understand. Because while he had been doing his job, the Tories had been throwing up over the walls and having sex in cupboards during lockdown. It was their category error to assume everyone else had been doing the same.We did at least endPMQson a lighter note when Farage tried to ask a question. I say tried as it took him three goes to get to the end as MPs on all sides were laughing at him. Nige doesn’t recognise the difference between being laughed at and laughed with. Like all narcissists, he only registers the attention. What was provoking the laughter was Nige demanding an answer to what he should say to his 25,000 constituents in Clacton.“Sorry,” suggested dozens of MPs. “Where the hell am I?”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchKemi BadenochPMQsHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

Then came a social media scandal and a serious backlashSteve RoseWed 5 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 05.58 ESTShareYou can generally tell when awards season is going well for a movie because its stars are everywhere, attending galas, treading red carpets, doing as many interviews as they can, and repeating the same bland sentiments about how special this movie is and everyone was a dream to work with. Conversely, you can tell things aren’t so rosy when your lead star is cancelling all their US appearances, being discreetly airbrushed out of the campaign and issuing statements such as: “I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain.”This is where Emilia Pérez and its lead, Karla Sofía Gascón, find themselves. Less than two weeks ago the movie was riding high, with a remarkable13 Oscar nominations, including best actress for Gascón – the most for any movie this year and one short of the all-time record. Now, though, it is looking as if the wheels have come off for Emilia Pérez’s awards campaign, or at least for Gascón herself. Many are wondering how this could have happened so quickly; was it a spectacular act of self-sabotage, or are there darker arts at work?At least part of this debacle has been self-inflicted. When Gascón won joint best actress at Cannes last May, the first transgender performer to have done so, she tearfully dedicated the award to all trans people “who suffer” and anticipated the online hate that was sure to follow: “Tomorrow, there will be plenty of comments from terrible people saying the same things about all of us trans people,” she said. “But I want to end with a message of hope … We all have the opportunity to change for the better, to become better people.”But it turns out Gascón herself has been dishing out the online hate too. Arecent excavationof the Spanish actor’s X/Twitter posts since 2016 unearthed many deeply problematic and offensive comments: about Muslims (“Islam is becoming a hotbed of infection for humanity”); about the victim of police brutality, George Floyd (“a drug addict swindler”); China (“The Chinese vaccine, apart from the mandatory chip, comes with two spring rolls …”); and even about the Oscars themselves. Commenting on the 2021 awards, where nominees included Nomadland, Minari, Judas and the Black Messiah and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Gascón wrote: “More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films. I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M [international women’s strike].” So much for becoming better people.View image in fullscreen‘Every time she had a scene we said: “Wow, what is this?”’ ... Selena Gomez in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Page 114/Why not Productions/Pathé Films/France 2 CinémaIronically, this year’s Academy Awards are shaping up to be another ceremony for what some might call “independent and protest films”. This is the firstOscarsof the second Donald Trump regime, with liberal Hollywood having failed to tip the balance in Kamala Harris’s favour, and there are nominations for stories about the young Donald Trump (The Apprentice), institutional racism (Nickel Boys), Catholic corruption (Conclave), conflicted women (Anora, The Substance), and bleeding-heart socialist hippy folk singers (A Complete Unknown).And leading the charge is Emilia Pérez; a Netflix musical about a Mexican gangster (Gascón) who begins a new life by faking their death, transitioning and starting a charity dedicated to finding the remains of victims of Mexico’s cartel-related violence. Given the Trump administration’s vicious assault on transgender rights, this movie ought to be a rallying point for the culture war resistance. But when your star actor is championing one marginalised group while also demonising several others, it’s not a great look.In response to the social media revelations, Gascón may have dug herself even deeper. In a subsequent interview – reportedly conducted without the oversight of Netflix – and an Instagram post, she alluded to unidentified adversaries who “have achieved their objective, to stain my existence with lies or things taken out of context”. She also denied she was a racist, claiming: “I feel and very much identify with the people who were thrown off buses for the colour of their skin.”The traditional sentiment at this stage should be, “And it was all going so well”, except it wasn’t really. From the outset, Emilia Pérez has been battered by such a barrage of criticism and mockery, it’s a mystery to many how it got nominated for anything at all. The movie has its fans, despite or perhaps because of its wildly implausible plot and agreeably bizarre moments, such as a musical number set in a cosmetic surgery clinic (the lyric “Man to woman / From penis to vagina”has gone viralall on its own). But it has anaudience score of just 18%on Rotten Tomatoes and a Letterboxd score of 2.2 out of five – the lowest scores for any best picture contender in history.Jacques Audiard, Emilia Pérez’s writer and director, is no stranger to awards. Three of his previous films (Dheepan, A Prophet and A Self-Made Hero) also won major prizes at Cannes and went on to achieve great acclaim. Perhaps he just got bored of winning so easily. Emilia Pérez is certainly a departure for this straight, white, cis, French, 72-year-old director – a musical, in Spanish, set in Mexico, about trans identity. But in other ways it is not a departure at all, because Audiarddidn’t even go to Mexico: he made the movie in a studio just outside Paris, with a principally non-Mexican cast and crew, led by Spain-born Gascón, Zoe Saldaña (who is an American of Dominican Republic and Puerto Rican descent) and US born-and-raised Selena Gomez.View image in fullscreenWildly implausible plot ... Gascón and Adriana Paz in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/Netflix via APMexican audiences and critics have not known whether to laugh or cry at Emilia Pérez’s depiction of their country and culture. On the one hand, there is the cast’s accents. Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez said of watching Gomez: “Every time she had a scene, we looked at each other to say, ‘Wow, what is this?’” Gomez responded to him on TikTok: “I’m sorry, I did the best I could with the time I was given.” Again, not exactly an awards-season quote for the ages.Mexicans have also taken issue with the way Emilia Pérez stereotypes their country as a landscape of death, drug cartels and gangsters, then uses the real-life plight of hundreds of thousands of missing persons as a backdrop for a song and dance. One Mexican screenwriter Héctor Guillénsummed it up with a post on X that read: “This is a message to the Academy: Mexico hates Emilia Pérez” and described the film as a “racist Eurocentrist mockery”.Camila Aurora, a trans Mexican film-maker, even returned the favour with her ownparody film, Johanne Sacreblu, “a tribute to Emilia Pérez”, depicting stereotypically “French” people in striped shirts, berets and painted-on moustaches, dancing in the streets of “Paris” (but filmed in Mexico).Audiard, who does not speak Spanish, was pretty blithe about all this initially. “I didn’t study [Mexico] much,” he said. “What I needed to know I already knew a little bit.” But when confronted ata press conference in Mexico, he backtracked. “If it seems to you that I do it too lightly, I apologise,” he said.Despite Gascón’s heartfelt Cannes speech, many LGBTQ+ viewers have also found the film’s portrayal of trans people riddled with damaging stereotypes. The way Gascón’s character abandons her wife and children to transition, for example, or the way she sings about being “half him, half her … half kingpin, half queen”. Or how, during a scene when she turns violent and threatening, her voice reverts to the low, growly register of her “male” self, as if to suggest she’s “really still a man underneath”. Hence headlines from trans critics such as: “Emilia Pérez Isthe Most Unique Cis Nonsense You’ll Ever See”. LGBTQ+ rights group Glaad called it a “profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman”.View image in fullscreenParody ... Johanne Sacreblu.Photograph: Camila D Aurora (Camiileo)It doesn’t stop there. It has emerged that Gascón’s singing voice in Emilia Pérez wasAI-enhanced to increase her vocal range, which is likely a turn off for Academy voters. Another frontrunner in this year’s race, The Brutalist, has also had to defend itself over use of AI – to fine-tune the actors’ Hungarian accents.But what of Gascón’s allusions to people out to “stain her existence”? Is it coincidence that these years-old tweets are coming out now, the week before the final round of Academy voting begins? Apparently so, according toSarah Hagi, the freelance journalist who found them. Hagi denies she is a “studio plant”; after being alerted by Gascón’s use of the term “Islamist” in a post, she decided to dig deeper and was appalled by what she found. What’s more surprising is that all these comments were widely available online and nobody thought to check, including Netflix, which might not be in this situation had it thought to do some due diligence.That doesn’t mean dark artsaren’tbeing deployed. In another unguarded moment last week, Gascón railed against rival “social media teams … trying to diminish our work”. In particular, she pointed the finger at the Brazilian movie I’m Still Here, whose lead Fernanda Torres is also up for best actress this year (and recently won the Golden Globe). “There are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down,”Gascón statedin a Brazilian newspaper interview (though she later stressed she was not accusing Torres or her team directly). Torres’ only response has beenan Instagram postsaying how kind Gascón had been to her in person.Days later it was Torres issuing the apologies, after footage resurfaced of herperforming in blackface, in a comedy sketch on Brazilian television, 17 years ago. Unlike Gascón, Torres dealt with the issue swiftly and sincerely. “I am very sorry for this,” she said. “At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organisations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn’t yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil.” If it carries on at this rate, we’ll have to start a new Oscar category for best apology.View image in fullscreenAdriana Paz, Selena Gomez, Karla Sofía Gascón and Zoe Saldaña at the Golden Globe awards in January.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersDespite the grandstanding speeches and appeals to higher values, awards season can still be ruthlessly aggressive. “It is deeply, deeply competitive, and ‘dark arts’, let’s not be naive, are definitely looked at,” says one veteran. Another commented: “It’s so Harvey Weinstein, isn’t it?” As head of Miramax, the disgraced producer was notorious for aggressively promoting his own films and trashing their rivals. In 1998, for example, he reportedly began a whispering campaign that Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan “tailed off” after its epic opening battle scene. Ultimately, Miramax’s Shakespeare in Love won best picture at the Oscars.‘My most sincere apologies to all the people who may have been offended’: when Oscar campaigns implodeRead moreThese days, though, you don’t even need a Weinstein-like figure pulling the strings. Amateur fans, or enemies, will happily do the work themselves on social media. “There’s now a willing cadre of people ready to jump on these things,” one publicist said. “There could be someone in the background orchestrating things, but I don’t know if that’s entirely necessary for something like this to happen.”Perhaps this is not just an Emilia Pérez problem, then, but an awards season one. In recent years they have successfully cleaned up their acts. In 2021, the Golden Globes announced a “roadmap for change” in response to allegations of racism, corruption, favouritism andeven sexual assault. The Academy has also undergone a decade-long overhaul in response to the #OscarsSoWhite backlash in 2015, inviting new members from a broader pool in order to dispel its “old white guy” dominance. It is this more modern, diverse, global academy that has elevated films such as Emilia Pérez – but if the goal was to champion diversity and highlight trans identity, it now seems to have backfired, erasing the trans actor who was supposed to be the hero of the year, and handing a victory to the anti-trans, anti-“woke” lobby the film was supposed to be standing against.When artistic merit is increasingly overshadowed by mudslinging, dirt-digging, counter-recriminations and grudging apologies, it’s hard to see the awards season exercise as a pure “celebration of cinema”. Maybe it never was, but maybe it should be, and could be, with a little more compassion and better background checks. In the words of Gascón herself: “We all have the opportunity to change for the better, to become better people.”Explore more on these topicsEmilia PérezOscarsAwards and prizesJacques AudiardSelena GomezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fitzgerald was then forced into another car and driven around the local area before being left at the roadside having been supplied with a code-word that the kidnappers intended to use in negotiations.The days that followed were the opening chapters of a mystery that remains unresolved more than 40 years later. A police investigation of the kidnapping swiftly descended into the realms of farce, including an attempt to use a clairvoyant to divine Shergar’s whereabouts.Negotiations also began between the kidnappers and the stallion’s group of owners – the Aga Khan, by this point, had only a minority stake as Shergar had been syndicated into 40 shares – but broke off after four days when the owners did not accept an attempt by the kidnappers to prove that Shergar was still alive.Shergar was never seen again and his final resting place too remains unknown, although in the aftermath of the Troubles, a number of second-hand accounts by former IRA members emerged which seem to outline a plot that was ill-conceived from the start.In particular, the gang members sent to steal the five-year-old had no experience with handling a highly strung, full-grown thoroughbred stallion, and one account suggests that Shergar was shot only a few hours after his abduction after he became panicked and out of control, before being buried in remote mountains near the border with Northern Ireland.The loss of one of the greatest of all Derby winners from the Aga Khan’s breeding operation after siring just 35 foals was a significant setback for an owner-breeder who inherited an extensive bloodstock operation from his father, in 1960. But his lifelong passion for breeding and racing thoroughbreds ensured that many more outstanding champions raced in his colours.The Aga Khan owned five Derby winners in all – Shahrastani (1986), Kahyasi (1988), Sinndar (2000) and Harzand (2016) were the others – and four winners of the Prix de l’Arc De Triomphe, including the brilliant, unbeatenfilly Zarkava in 2008.View image in fullscreenChristophe Soumillon and Zarkava after their triumph in the 2008 Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.Photograph: Lucas Dolega/EPAThere were other moments of controversy too, not least after the victory of Aliysa in the Oaks in 1989, the Aga Khan’s first in the Epsom fillies’ Classic. The three-year-old was an easy and impressive three-length winner, but a month later the Jockey Club, the sport’s regulator at the time, announced that Aliysa’s post-race urine test had been positive for camphor, a banned substance.The rules of racing were clear that Aliysa had to be disqualified, and while her owner mounted a sustained legal challenge to the Jockey Club’s testing procedures, the decision to award the race to Snow Bride, the runner-up, was finally confirmed in December 1990, 18 months after the Oaks.The Aga Khan immediately removed all 90 of his horses in training in Britain, most of which were stabled with Michael Stoute and Luca Cumani in Newmarket, and his colours were absent from British racecourses for several years.Instead, he turned his focus to expanding his racing and breeding operations in France, where his outstanding Arc winners, Dalakhani and Zarkava, were both trained, and also in Ireland, where Dermot Weld – the trainer of Harzand – and John Oxx had significant strings of horses in his colours.The late Aga Khan built on the legacy of both his father – who owned the brilliant racemare, Petite Etoile – and his grandfather, who also owned five Derby winners between 1930 and 1952, including Mahmoud (1936), for many years the holder of the record time for a Derby winner, and Tulyar (1952).Aga Khan IV’s daughter, Princess Zahra Aga Khan, is also an enthusiastic owner and breeder whose winners to date include Mandesha, the 2006 Prix Vermeille winner. Her colours – green with brown epaulettes – blend her father’s silks with those of his predecessors as Aga Khan – green and chocolate hoops – and seem likely to extend the family’s bloodstock operation into a fourth generation.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Are we prepared to put the work in?Elle HuntWed 5 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 12.03 ESTShareIn the year since I moved into my flat, I’ve received a few notes under the door.Some were warm welcomes – most notably, a Swiftie-style friendship bracelet from my downstairs neighbour, who’d heard me (“very faintly!”) listening to the new album. Others were Christmas cards, or courtesy notes warning of forthcoming maintenance or outages.Then, there were the requests – to turn the volume down or make some other small accommodation that’s necessary when living among others.The other day, I returned from running errands and glimpsed a scrap of cardboard on the mat. Somehow I knew it belonged to the latter category.Could I “PLEASE” break down large cardboard boxes and put them inside the recycling bin instead of sliding them in between, read the anonymous note, adding: “It makes the area look like a rubbish dump!”I felt a flush of irritation. Was twice-underlining the “PLEASE” really necessary, on top of the caps? Would it have not been friendlier to sign their name?Then, the fit of pique passed. The request was completely reasonable, and my quibbles didn’t make me any less wrong.This minor run-in made me think about community – what we mean by it, and what it asks of us.The word is used freely, to describe all kinds of aggregates. It can encompass people whose daily lives are closely intertwined through their jobs, home life or hobbies and those who simply follow the same Instagram influencer or like the same brands.When it’s real, present and felt, community can be a source of social connection, belonging, shared purpose and meaning. More often – and increasingly, in the absence of other social safety nets – it’s invoked in the abstract as something we desire, or should be working toward.The benefits of strong relationships and social support arewell-documented and indisputable.Earlier this month, the outgoing US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, prescribed community as a balm for the “pain, disconnection and division” of the contemporary status quo.The word “community” has warm, fuzzy connotations. But a siloed, individualistic culture also makes it harder to establish and maintain community; creating a shared identity and spirit of reciprocity takes effort and is not always comfortable.We may say community is the future, the cure for what’s ailing us about modern life and, as Murthy put it, “the irreplaceable foundation for our well-being” – but are we prepared for the challenges of creating it?In August 2016, when Charles Vogl’s book The Art of Community was first published, people heard the title “and thought I was talking about singing Kumbaya around the campfire”, he says.Vogl outlined “seven principles for belonging” in his book, developed during his time volunteering at a homeless shelter in Santa Ana, California, and in the Peace Corps in Zambia; labour organising in New York; and studying faith traditions at Yale University, among other roles at other organisations. Today, Vogl advises tech companies and organisations on how to build community.As Murthy and others have emphasised, social isolation is a public health issue, associated with an elevated risk of anxiety, depression, heart disease, dementia, stroke and premature death. But inflation and the high cost of living are eating into individuals’ leisure time, depleting their availability and energy for socialising. “People work so hard, they don’t have time to go to potlucks,” Vogl says.Because people increasingly socialise online, there also has been an “actual erosion in social skills”. For younger people in particular, the loss of experience and opportunities throughout the pandemic has resulted in a lower appetite for social risk, he says: “They’re more comfortable texting than they are talking.”Factor in lower religious affiliation, falling social trust and thetime-honoured(thoughpossibly declining) trend of moving every few years, and community is indeed in danger of becoming a fabled good, Vogl says.Community can also – knowingly or otherwise – be mis-sold. A group of artists or athletes, for instance, can’t really be considered a community if the prevailing feeling is of competitiveness or resentment, Vogl points out. Even events that explicitly set out to foster community can fall short by being too large, loud or impersonal – what Vogl calls “an arena experience”. Sometimes that is a failure of planning, but it can also indicate the organiser’s shallow investment or transactional intent.“A lot of people say they want to build community, but their No 1, often only, goal is to extract time, attention and money,” he warns. “There’s a constant calculation of value exchange going on, and at some point that’s going to go south.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s the difference between someone you feel you could call on for help in the event of a 3am plumbing emergency, versus “someone you technically ate pizza with” once.Key to that, Vogl continues, is commitment with no expectation of return. “For this to really work, and to fill the emotional – I would even say spiritual – hole, there has to be generosity,” he says.Generosity has been so neglected in the conversation about community that, in Vogl’s revision of The Art of Community, forthcoming in March, he has added it as a criterion.That’s not to say community is an open invite or one-way exchange. Boundaries are important, Vogl says, not necessarily for keeping people out, but “to make the inside safe”.Why middle-aged people have a duty to be self-centeredRead moreStill, he adds, the need for us all to try to foster community is greater than many of the potential negative consequences. Merely extending an invitation – to come over for a cup of tea or accompany you on a trip you’re already making – signals your willingness to connect, Vogl says: “Whether the invitee accepts or not, they believe they know somebody who has the power to bring people together.”With time, such small steps can lead to something bigger, more deeply rooted and sustaining. Stopping to chat with your neighbor, instead of nodding a quick hello on your way out, paves the way for a more familiar relationship and the “mutual concern” that Vogl says defines community.It doesn’t need to be intimidating, but it does require consistency and commitment, without any expectation of return. There may be an element of social discomfort – of putting ourselves out there or risking rejection. But, Vogl adds, “isn’t that true about everything good in life?”I want to feel part of a community, to know my neighbours, and be known as a “local” or a “regular”. That takes time – but I’ve been glossing over the associated effort, as my half-hearted recycling goes to show.My neighbour was right to call me out. I may have saved myself a few extra minutes by not breaking down my boxes – but I could gain something far greater, by taking the extra care.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthMental healthFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s gross.But isn’t that sort of the point of laundry?Well, yes, if you’re going to be pedantic about it, then sure. But you know what I’m getting at.Hand on heart, I do not.You’re putting your clothes through the laundry too often.Am I?Almost certainly. Answer me this: how many times do you wear a pair of trousers before putting them in the washing machine?OK, let me think …Let’s speed this up. Is the number less than 30?Yes, of course!Then that’s laundering them too much. And I have science on my side to prove it.I’m interested in hearing this.Well, OK, not science. But it’s what the French government’s ecology department says. Right, new question. How many times do you wear a T-shirt before washing it?Once, usually.Disgusting! The French say you should wear it five times. Gym clothes?They’re drenched with sweat afterwards, so obviously once.Wrong! The answer is three. You must wear your dirty gym clothes three times before washing them.But why?There is a solid argument for all this. More laundry means more energy use, more water pollution and clothes that wear out faster. Washing your clothes a little bit less is a sustainable and conscientious way to live your life.Well, good for the French.Wait a minute, I didn’t say the French liked this. In fact, the government diktat has caused something of an uproar, with conservative commentators saying that the department employs too many people and costs too much money. And besides, who should decide how often you wash your clothes: the pampered elite or the people themselves?Wow, they’re very touchy about this.Of course. There’s a false and nasty centuries-old stereotype about the French not being particularly hygienic, which means this has hit something of a national nerve. It’d be the same if the UK government told its citizens to stop brushing their horrible teeth.This is an outrage! Leavemy manky teeth alone!See? And this is the fix the French find themselves in. On one hand, it’s a good thing to care about the environment, and rewearing clothes before washing is a sensible way to go about doing this.

Did he mean it? For now, that doesn’t matterMartin KettleThe president’s appalling threat to seize Gaza and drive out its people imperils global stability, even if he never deploys a single US soldierWed 5 Feb 2025 07.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 08.07 ESTShareThe comments were brazen, swaggering, jaw-dropping, audacious, and, to many, simply outrageous. “Stupéfaction mondiale” was how the French paper Libération responded on Wednesday morning. The sober-sided New York Times contented itself with “improbable”. A US senator gave voice to what will surely become a drumbeat charge across the Middle East and beyond in the hours and days to come, thatwhat Donald Trump had said about Gazaamounted to “ethnic cleansing by another name”.On Tuesday, at the end of his White House meeting with Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump declared that the US should seize control of the Gaza Strip and permanently remove its 2.2 million Palestinian inhabitants to resettlement in places such as Egypt and Jordan. The US would “own it and be responsible”, said Trump. “We’ll take it over and develop it,” he added. There would be “unlimited numbers of jobs and housing” for “the people of the area” – though which people they would be was not specified. Gaza would be turned into “the Riviera of the Middle East”.It was, potentially at least, another wrecking ball move for a region that has suffered carnage and destruction since Hamas’s terrible attack onIsraelin October 2023, triggering 16 months of Israeli assaults on Gaza. Unsurprisingly, it was immediately countered by one of the key players in any search for solutions. Within hours, Saudi Arabia rejected the Palestinian displacement plan, reasserting that it would not establish diplomatic relations with Israel – until now one of Trump’s pivotal Middle East policy goals – without the establishment of a Palestinian state.Where this leaves the fragile ceasefire process currently under way betweenHamasand Israel is hard to compute. Negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire agreement are about to begin next week, involving the US, Israel, Hamas, Egypt and Qatar. Their stated aim is to agree further hostage and prisoner exchanges, an indefinite extension of the current time-limited truce and a deal on who will govern Gaza.Trump’s statements throw this last part of the phase two negotiations up in the air. They also disrupt the rest of the process. But the stakes are very high. The Israel-Hamas war could resume within weeks if an agreement is not reached. This is the outcome that Netanyahu, the undisputed beneficiary of Trump’s freewheeling, would probably favour, since it would hold his fractious government together. Israel’s most rightwing parties, some of which regardGazaas part of Israel anyway, will see Trump’s remarks as a turning point in their favour, with implications for the West Bank, too. Palestinians willsee it as betrayal.View image in fullscreenCollapsed buildings along Saftawi Street in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, 5 February 2025.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump’s remarks have caught the US and the world on the hop. But they did not come entirely out of the blue. Before his return to the White House, Trump had occasionally made similar comments. Gaza was a “massive demolition site”, he said, immediately after his inauguration in January. “It’s a phenomenal location on the sea – best weather. You know, everything’s good. It’s like, some beautiful things could be done with it.”That seemed at the time like the voice of US property tycoon Trump rather than of US president Trump. The same was true of his comments on Tuesday. Yet Trump always blurs the personal and the political. It would be a mistake to think he is not, on some level, serious. Only last week, Trump sent his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, himself a billionaire real estate developer, to make the first visit to Gaza by a US official since the start of the war.No one should underestimate the importance of bluff and distraction in Trump’s current blizzard of shock-and-awe announcements on multiple topics in addition to the Middle East. Nevertheless, for a president who came to office in 2017, and who has now done so again eight years later, and pledged on both occasions to put the US first, Tuesday’s remarks are a spectacular about-face with immense consequences if they were ever to become serious policy.Ever since the invasion of Iraq in 2003,US foreign policyhas hesitated to intervene, engage and occupy, especially in the Middle East itself. In that time, US troops have occasionally played key roles, often under the radar or simply from the sky, in conflicts ranging from Libya to Syria, as well as in Afghanistan. But Trump’s default international stance has always been to bring US troops out of the line of fire, while demanding that others – as with Europe in Ukraine – step up their own commitments.On Tuesday, though, Trump appeared open to the idea that US troops would be deployed to enforce his Gaza occupation idea. Presumably, US troops could take charge of attempts to forcibly remove the Palestinians, too. It defies belief to imagine that such an operation, unashamedly defiant of international law, and necessarily involving tens of thousands of military personnel, would not involve US forces in confrontations, casualties, and, if Iraq is any guide, accusations of human rights violations against local people.Exactly the sort of overseas engagement, in other words, that Trump has always said he opposes.Yet Trump’s second term is already different. Very strikingly, and with the Gaza remarks the latest example, he has begun to talk the language of imperialism. He has threatened to take over Greenland, to reclaim the Panama canal, to annex Canada, to rename the Gulf of Mexico and, now, to take over Gaza. Maybe he will decide next week to relocate Palestinians to Newfoundland.Trump’s declaration US will ‘take over’ Gaza Strip sparks global condemnation – liveRead moreThe critical question is whether any of this is meant seriously. “This was not a decision made lightly,” Trump said on Tuesday. Yet it is so lacking in detail and so inherently incomprehensible as an actual policy, that probably not even the president himself can say for certain that a single US soldier will ever serve in Gaza or a single US dollar be invested in seafront development there either.Moreover, seriousness can come in different forms, as Trump’s second presidency is showing. Trump may not really want to occupy Gaza at all; but the fact that he has said that he might is itself a fact that reshapes other realities, in the Middle East and in domestic US politics.In the less than three weeks since he was sworn in again, Trump is proving himself to be a far more brilliant politician than he was in the often chaotic circumstances of his first term. The performative autocracy of his presidential decrees may really be changing the US, or it may simply distract the public into thinking that they are changing it. The difference may matter less than we suppose.In a political culture dominated by social media rather than by legislative and legal process, the giving of an impression, even in an improbable case like Gaza, is actually more potent and more instantly deliverable than the kind of careful policymaking that governments like Keir Starmer’s prefer. Trump may not deliver much materially for the millions who voted for him, but his ability to persuade them that he is doing so shines an unsettling light into the politics of the future.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Starmer’s ratings are nowworse than Rishi Sunak’s at his nadir, and Nigel Farage’s Reform – a party with just five MPs –appears to be edgingahead of the party of government in the polls. So far, this government has spent its timeclobbering pensioners, being showered with freebies by well-heeled donors and damaging economic confidence with ill-judged post-election doom and gloom, followed by a panicked “growth above all else” reverse ferret. Just months after securing power, the prime minister’s own staffbriefed two Times journaliststhat they had no idea what he really believed, and that he wasn’t really running the country – that he’d been deceived into thinking he was “driving the train”, when he’s really been sat at the front of the driverless Docklands Light Railway.It’s almost enough to make you pity Starmer – imagine publicly humiliating the prime minister you are paid to work for just months after winning power? – until you remember that he appointed this backstabbing rabble in the first place. The published excerpts from Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund’s new book, Get In: The Inside Story ofLabourUnder Starmer, lay out the strategy of this rightwing faction. “Occasionally they even spoke of their leader as if he were a useful idiot,” they write. “Keir acts like an HR manager, not a leader,” his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is quoted as saying.They saw Starmer as a convenient empty vessel, whom they could deceive a Corbynite Labour membership into voting for, then use their yes-man to permanently bury the left before replacing him with a true believer, the ultra-Blairite Wes Streeting. Alas, the Tories managed to implode and the man they see as a useful idiot sits in No 10, pretending to drive a train.Let me mount a defence of Starmer, the scapegoat of these rightwing factionalists, who are ridiculing him for doing literally everything they asked him to do. To be successful, a government needs purpose. Purpose gives it coherence, provides backbone to survive crises, prevents it from being buffeted by events, leaves ministers understanding what goals they’re working towards, and allows voters to understand what their rulers are trying to do. Whatever you thought of them, the Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair governments had purpose, and succeeded, but the administrations of Gordon Brown and Rishi Sunak did not, and collapsed.Think Trumpism couldn’t take root and flourish in Britain? Think again | John HarrisRead morePurpose does not deliver inevitable success – no one can accuse Liz Truss of lacking vision, yet she was famously outlasted by a lettuce – but it is a precondition. The political project of Starmer’s aides is a crude replication of late-stage Blairism, lacking that crucial ingredient of purpose. Whatever I may think about New Labour, it wasn’t a cheap rip-off, and the party’s current masters are political and intellectual minnows by comparison. New Labour’s project was straightforward: accept the Thatcherite settlement, but humanise it using the tax revenues flowing from an unsustainable economic model centred on the City of London. That model went bust in 2008, never to recover, and the Labour establishment couldn’t think up anything new. Their cupboard was empty, which is why Corbynism – which offered a clear alternative narrative – usurped them in 2015. The problem isn’t Starmer per se: it’s a faction with no answers to the crisis-afflicted Britain of 2025.That Starmer has many personal traits that make him unsuitable as leader is undeniable. The new book notes that he used to text me rather peculiar reprimands when I criticised him in this column or on Twitter (now X). For example, when Iwrote a columncriticising Starmer for ordering Labour MPs to abstain on a Tory bill that allowed MI5 agents and police officers to commit crimes if it prevented a more serious crime or threat to national security, he texted me to say I was better than that, like a disappointed schoolteacher. You might wonder whether he had better things to do. I would agree. The point is: he is thin-skinned, and the faction around him weaponised that to crush the left. That emphasises why this is a caricature of New Labour. Blair used to telephone leftwing firebrand Dennis Skinner for advice,and invite him for tea. Starmer would probably have purged him.The problem is that Starmer’s team always knew what they opposed – those ghastly lefties! – but not what they stood for. In opposition,Starmer assailed the Toriesfor their mantra of “cut the green crap”; his flailing government now has a growth strategy dependenton expanding Heathrow, to the distaste of even a parliamentary Labour party largely handpicked for blind loyalty. The suggestion that this government is in thrall to vested interests is underscored bythe book’s claimsthat wealthy donor Waheed Alli, who showered Starmer with clothes and spectacles, blocked proposals to ban foreign political donations, opening the way for Elon Musk to try to help bankroll Farage into Downing Street.Here’s the problem. Our economic model has stopped offering sustained rises in living standards and improvements to the public realm. Two possible outcomes flow from this. Either voters are offered an alternative, which means challenging the concentration of wealth and power in the bank accounts of a few. Or voters may simply conclude that democracy no longer delivers, and be susceptible to messages that blame migrants and other stigmatised minorities for decline. The latter is now on the ascendant across the west, because the former is missing in action.That’s where the left comes in. As well as a need for thetimid Greensto find their voice, the Labour left should stop being the punch bags of the soulless hacks using Starmer as their hapless puppet.Seven of those MPswere suspended for voting against keeping Tory benefit cuts that drive children into poverty. Some may never be let back in; others only if they pledge slavish obedience – and then what’s the point of being there anyway? Call the bluff of your assailants: leave, and form an alliancewith the Green and leftwing independent MPs. There are other leftwing Labour MPs who haven’t been booted out – such as Clive Lewis – who would be a good fit. Such an alliance, with the right strategy, could suddenly put formidable pressure on Labour from the left, and force a conversation about redistributing wealth and power that would force Labour, Tory and Reform UK alike on to the defensive.Alas, these MPs have an ingrained loyalty to Labour, one that is not reciprocatedby the leadership. But if they don’t make a difficult but courageous jump, what beckons? They will be condemned to irrelevance. If and when Starmer eventually goes, the vultures circling him – that is, his aides – will replace him with someone who does the same thing, but with more gusto. Farage will dictate the terms of our national conversation, until he plausibly secures power. This is not inevitable: the appetite for an alternative exists, but lacks direction and leadership. If it remains untapped, whoever is driving this train, it will plunge into the abyss, taking all its passengers with it.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

I found it most unsettling. They bully it rather tentatively, without great violence. They find it amusing, until it falls over, at which point it’s the price of the thing that seems to be the worry. This AI humanoid apparently cost $70,000 (£55,800). It’s in the care of one Kai Cenat, an internet-type person – streamer, YouTuber, influencer – you know the kind of thing. Doing the bullying were Cenat and two other gentlemen by the names of Agent and Fanum. I take it they’re in a similar line of business. The incident shown took place in the AMP house. According to Google this is either an office building in east Croydon, or the home of a group of internet celebrities living together in a house in Atlanta, Georgia. I’m plumping for the latter.I wonder why I find myself caring about this machine. Surely it’s as daft as feeling sorry for the red Austin 1100Basil Fawlty beat with a bit of tree, which I never did. In fact, on reflection, I might also have felt sorry for the tree, but didn’t. That said, I do have a capacity for strong feelings about inanimate objects. On more than one occasion I upset the children by choosing the most pitiable-looking Christmas tree in the shop. I just couldn’t bear the thought of it lying there on Christmas Eve, cold, unbought, unloved, undecorated, bauble-less. A waste of a life. I’ve had similar feelings for kitchen implements and even an easily replaceable Oyster travelcard which I’d managed not to lose for a long time – until I lost it.And this poor robot, as a humanoid, isn’t inanimate. It’s smaller than its assailants and has a kind of sagging posture which I assume is something to do with the designers finding a way of keeping this biped balanced, but it adds to the impression of meekness, helplessness. The more I look at it being shoved around the room, the more troubled I get. It seems to sag all the more. At one point it seems to make a run for the door. Ultimately it just kind of looks disappointed with its lot in, er, life. This might even be the most human-like thing about it.‘A fork in the road’: laundry-sorting robot spurs AI hopes and fears at Europe’s biggest tech eventRead moreIt doesn’t lash out in retaliation for some reason, which may or may not be a sign of its intelligence. Oddly, I don’t find myself wishing it to turn out to be a lethal martial arts practitioner and give those cruel men a good kicking. This, or some version of it, is what would happen in films, quite possibly leading to a takeover of humankind. It’s also the worry expressed at some stage in every discussion about the darker possibilities of AI. But perhaps it’s more disturbing than that. Perhaps humankind hasn’t created humanoid monsters to take us over, so much as pitiful creatures we can treat with contempt.This might even be a good thing. Given our unpleasant habit of dehumanising groups of people in the interests of visiting all manner of atrocities upon them, there might be some benefit in doing it the other way round – taking something not human and animating it in order for us to exercise our worst inclinations.I can’t, as you can see, make head or tail of any of it. This isn’t because I’ve watched too many sci-fi films; rather, that I haven’t seen enough. I’m quite sure these themes have been widely explored. But for my part, every human instinct I have is to march into that AMP house, be it in east Croydon or Atlanta, take the poor thing by the hand, and lead it to a better life. I could take it to see West Brom play on Saturday, although that might have it running back to the AMP house at the greatest speed it could muster.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They will not give upYara Hawari is co-director of Al Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy NetworkWed 5 Feb 2025 10.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 10.54 ESTShareDonald Trump’s first few weeks in office have sent a clear message: that he will support Benjamin Netanyahu’s vision for the permanent expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.This was evident even before his incoherent press conference on Tuesday with the Israeli prime minister, the first foreign leader to visit the US since the president’s inauguration. As usual, Trump began his speech by listing all his so-called achievements in the region – many illegal under international law – of his previous term, including the moving of theUS embassy to Jerusalem, recognition of Israel’s unlawful annexation of the Syrian Golan, and theAbraham Accords. Once he finished bestowing accolades upon himself, he presented his administration’s future plans for Gaza.What followed was a stream of contradictions: he claimed that there would be no rebuilding in Gaza and also claimed that the US would lead the efforts in rebuilding; he claimed that Palestinians would have to leave and then said that the US would create jobs there for all people, not “just a specific group of people” and that Palestinians would continue to live there. The cognitive dissonance was palpable, and there were moments when even Netanyahu seemed confused. Trump also put forward the idea of US “ownership” over Gaza – whether or not that would mean the deployment of US troops was not confirmed. The ambiguity surrounding this statement reflects Trump’s usual incoherent rhetoric, but it also reflects his recently expressed desires to expand US territory, including toCanada and Greenland.Within a week of the inauguration, the Americans wereputting pressure on Egypt and Jordanto take in forcibly displaced Palestinians, in order to “clean out” Gaza. While some commentators and journalists in the mainstream media have expressed outrage at what amounts to a proposal for ethnic cleansing, they are conveniently forgetting that at the beginning of the genocide, the Biden administration was also floating the idea ofexpelling Palestinians to the Egyptian Sinai, in addition to consistently supplying the Israeli regime with weapons that aided the killing ofmore than 60,000 Palestinians. This kind of selective outrage over what Trump says versus what the Biden administration actually did is undoubtedly one we will see on repeat in the coming years.However, crucially, it is essential to understand this not simply as a declaration of ethnic cleansing but also as a desire to continue the genocide the Israeli regime has been committing against Palestinians in Gaza for the past 16 months. It is equally essential to acknowledge how this genocide has expanded in the West Bank, where the Israeli army israzing refugee campsto the ground and displacing thousands of Palestinians. Jenin refugee camp, which has been enduring a weeks-long invasion by the army, has seen all of its residents forcibly expelled, dozens killed including children, and entireneighbourhoods blown up. This assault is clearly an assault on Palestinian life itself, and the aim is quite simple: to rid the land of as many Palestinians as possible.In the face of all of this, Palestinians have not been passive actors – just as they never have been. Over the past 16 months, Palestinians in Gaza have also shown us what resistance to genocide looks like. They have refused to leave their homeland after massive destruction – the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetime. After Trump’s comments, Palestinians in Gaza have defiantly taken to social media to tell the leader of the most powerful country in the world that they will not leave their land. For example, the Gaza-based journalistAbubaker Abed wrote: “How can my future be decided by someone else? … We are here. And we won’t leave.”This is hardly surprising. For more than seven decades, the Palestinian people have endured systematic killing, incarceration and displacement from their ancestral homeland by the Israeli regime. Yet they have fought their erasure tooth and nail. So while Trump’s comments are alarmingly genocidal, it is clear that he underestimates the Palestinian determination to stay on their land.Yara Hawari is co-director of Al Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy NetworkDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The yo-yo pattern has repeated three or four times. Optimism breaks out regularly, but something always turns up to spoil the mood.Lockdown during the Covid pandemic meant patients couldn’t get out for their shingles jabs, a critical product for GSK. When that cloud cleared, an enormous legal wrangle over Zantac, a heartburn drug from the 1990s, appeared.The settlementwas financially tolerable in the end, but last year’s downer was the US regulator’s decision to limit the age range for use of a new vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for older adults, quickly followed bythe appointment of vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedyas the US secretary of health and human services. The shares, having touched £18 in May 2024, were once again at £13 by November.On cue, though, here come a few fresh reasons to be more cheerful. GSK’s shares, up 7.6% at £14.85, were the top riser in the FTSE 100 index on Wednesday becausethe full-year numbers for 2024came with a syringe of crowd-pleasers: a higher dividend, a revenue upgrade and a £2bn share buyback.The last was a surprise because GSK hasn’t been in the buyback business since 2012 and cut its dividend as recently as 2021. But the move underlines how debt has fallen rapidly after the demerger of Haleon, the consumer products business, and how the Zantac settlement drew a line. The reduction in borrowings from £20bn in 2021 to £13bn today shows how the business is still nicely cash-generative.As for the revenue upgrade, it is for 2031 (pharma firms rightly like long-term horizons) but the new number of £40bn-plus, up from £38bn-plus, demonstrates that the extra billions poured into research and developed are yielding results at the other end of the pipeline, which has always been the big worry with GSK. The original target for 2031, introduced four years ago, was £33bn.The latest potential blockbuster should be Blenrep, a blood cancer drug that has demonstrated meaningful life-expectancy benefits in late-stage trials. Meanwhile, sales of HIV medicines, a traditional strength for GSK, rose at a double-digit pace last year.The range of share price targets among the analysts is still enormous, it should be said – £14.50, say Barclays and Jefferies, but £23.55 thinks Bernstein. And it’s not hard to imagine that the market, having seemingly become more relaxed about RFK Jr, could panic again once he starts making decisions. This is the Trump administration, after all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the time ofthe big shake-up in 2021, Walmsley acknowledged the rotten share price and promised to deliver “a step change in performance versus our history”. She has done better than the shares would suggest. One of these years, maybe, GSK will make it to £18 and keep going.

I just had to watch my friend, Nikole Hannah-Jones, articulate a great point that many have missed: Donald Trump is pursuing a racial agenda, not an economic one.This isn’t historically novel. Most progress is met by this kind of backlash – from the “Red Shirts” and Klansmen who used brutal violence against Black citizens following the gains of the Reconstruction era, to thevoting restrictionsthat followed the election of Barack Obama. But this time is different.This time isn’t aboutPete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, and Trump using the recent American Airlines plane crash in Washington DC to envelop themselves in anti-DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) outrage. This isn’t about Maga devotees fighting against anti-discrimination measures,eliminating pronouns, pushinganti-vaccine pseudoscienceor changing the name of theGulf of Mexicoor canceling identity-driven celebrations like the ones duringBlack History Month.It’s about the fact that in spite of all this, many of us have grown numb to this brand of rightwing viciousness and cruelty. As Trump and Elon Musk try to disassemble the greatest nation on earth at its core, Washington Democrats don’t even look like they’re up to the task to stop it. Even as the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, rolls out his“resistance agenda”, questions remain. Where have Democrats been since 5 November? What is our message? What is our voice? Why aren’t we in spaces where this voice can be heard?Meanwhile, Trump continues to use hyperbolic rhetoric invoking race and division, pushing his agenda instead of the economic populist message he ran on. His Ice raids aren’t just targeting immigrants, they’ve also ended in thedetainmentof US citizens, including a veteran.Trump reversed the 60-year-oldexecutive orderthat prohibited federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination, putting countless minority small business owners on the chopping block. He stopped every single Department of Justicecivil rights investigationandpolice reform agreement– that includes the agreements in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, that were reached following the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. These aren’t abstract political principles we’re talking about. This is about real people with real lives on the line.Trump’s attack on civil rights and his agenda rooted in racial division don’t just affect people of color, they reach other citizens as well. Do you know what would have happened if a federal judge hadn’t paused the Trump spending freeze? It means your lead water pipes don’t get replaced. It means doctors working to cure cancer or fight Alzheimer’s have to stop their research. It means your daily commute is even more dangerous because crews stopped fixing the roads and bridges and, if you have one of the more than330,000 clean energy jobscreated by the Inflation Reduction Act, Trump tried to freeze your paycheck.Meanwhile, the price of eggskeeps going up.So I don’t care if Trump wants to buy Greenland or not. I care that he’spardoning white supremacistswho already organized one insurrection. I care that he fired every FBI agent and DoJ official who worked on any of the multiple investigations against him. I care that he got rid of theindependent inspectors generalof at least 12 major federal agencies.What’s more, Trump and Scott Bessent, the newly confirmed treasury secretary, just gave Musk and his “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cronies unfettered access to Americans’ sensitive information. Musk, a billionaire from South Africa who grew up filthy rich because of apartheid, is not a paidgovernment official. He isn’t a presidential appointee. The Senate has never interviewed him, and they sure haven’t confirmed him because Trump’s Doge isn’t a real government agency.But now they have access to your social security number, your address and your work history, and they can stop every dollar you get from the federal government, from your Medicare benefits to your tax return. Remember how mad you were the last time you heard about some huge data breach that might have exposed your personal information? Well, this is the same thing but worse and no one can investigate because Trump fired the inspector general.I’m a Democrat from blood-red South Carolina, so I know that I’m supposed to toe the party line and lay this all at the feet of the Maga extremists. But the silence we’re getting from a lot of Americans, regardless of political party, is deafening.Too many Republicans andDemocratsare doing absolutely nothing to stop Trump, and I can only imagine how their failure to resist thrills the oligarchs in Russia and China who have been praying for this kind of good fortune for generations. It’s one thing to cheer for the madman burning down your house. It’s worse when you know how dangerous it is and have the power to stop him but you don’t. Then, the blood is on your hands, elected officials on both sides of the aisle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

The phrase didn’t just claim that the economic benefit of big-money infrastructure projects would somehow trickle down to workers struggling to pay the rent. It implied that anyone who didn’t do their duty for the labour market – say, people too disabled or ill to work, family carers and jobseekers – should expect very little from Labour.Such sentiments could be dismissed as empty rhetoric, of course, but by all accounts are actually a preview. In the autumn budget,Reeves committed to keepingthe £3bn of disability benefit “savings” the outgoing Conservative government planned. It is now expected that a package of spending cuts will be finalised in the next fortnight, in whatthe Times describesas a “radical overhaul of welfare” that could see hundreds of thousands of disabled and chronically ill people lose their benefits.Under one option reportedly being considered, the universal credit “limited capability for work or work-related activity” category would be abolished, which would require often severely disabled or ill people to make preparations for work. That could see claimants lose about £5,000 a year.At the same time, personal independence payments (Pip) – which pays for some of the extra costs of disability and is unrelated to whether someone is in work – is said to be being lined up for an “overhaul”, with those with conditions such as depression and anxiety,the fastest-growing reasonsfor disability benefits, likely to be targeted. Options being looked at include one-off rather than monthly payments for some, or means testing. Vouchers for specific equipment or aids instead of cash – asplanned by Rishi Sunak last year– have reportedly been ruled out. No change for either benefit has been confirmed.If any of this feels familiar, it’s because it is – and not just that it was only a decade ago that the coalition governmentwas “reforming” the system. Since the election last July, Labour ministers have been dripfeeding rumoured benefit crackdownsto the rightwing press, from specific plans to remove fraudsters’ driving licences tovague pledgesto get hordes of people off out-of-work sickness benefits.A reader with a terminal illness emailed in despair. What she told me should shock us all | Frances RyanRead moreThe point of these constant briefings may seem baffling, but there are two likely explanations: testing the waters before announcing firm policy; and/or communicating a message. For the latter, just look at the seemingly innocuous lines inthe Times story: ministers have told business leaders that changes to Pip eligibility “will be the first priority” in spending cuts in March, as Reeves is “desperate” to reassure City bosses that “welfare savings” will cool the need for a tax-raising emergency budget.It is not simply that such things invite uncomfortable questions about the influence of the rich on governance, but that they signal very clearly who matters to Labour – and who doesn’t. That is not necessarily an accident. Back in January, Reevesweakened changes to non-dom statusafter hearing “concerns” from business leaders. In contrast, concerns from disabled people – as well as multiple thinktanks and charities – about the proposed disability benefit cuts over the past six months have, funnily enough, not had the same effect. Disabled voters are apparently expendable. Wealthy potential donors less so.Politics, at its core, is a matter of priorities: where public money will be spent, where it won’t, and how it will be raised. That aLabourgovernment is seemingly willing to sacrifice poor and disabled people’s benefits in order to protect the wealthy and healthy from paying a bit more tax is the kind of dystopian deal that feels at best perverse and, at worst, a betrayal.None of this is to say that Britain having anincreasingly sick populationis not a crisis that must be addressed. But it is to say that arbitrary cost-cutting is not the same as genuine reform, or that complex public policy should be dictated by the Treasury. I can’t help but wonder how many of those currently crowing to get disabled people “off benefits” will speak out againstfailings in the Access to Work schemethat are causing disabled people to lose their jobs. Wanting to get disabled people off the “welfare bill” is not the same as wanting to help them work.In some ways, austerity under Keir Starmer and Reeves looks different than the last time we were here: unlike under David Cameron and George Osborne, there is no ideological drive to shrink the state nor an explicit nasty impulse to punish “skivers” – more a couple of management execs looking to balance the books. And yet even this bean-counting is flawed.Recent research for anti-poverty charity Z2Kfound the economic value of disability benefits far outweighs the cost: while there is a £28bn annual bill for administering the benefits, they give a potential £42bn economic boost due to how they improve wellbeing.Besides, that Labour ministers’ motivations are (perhaps) distinct from the Tories is hardly much comfort to the disabled people reading yet another story musing how their only income could be taken away. If their disability benefits are cut when Labour wins an election, as well as when the Conservatives do, what exactly is the difference?Much of this goes far beyond whether the red team or the blue team is in office. It is about the systems that normalise impoverishing and isolating disabled people while protecting the assets and power of the privileged. It is about the attitudes towards disability and poverty that make those with the least seem the right group to lose the most, and the dehumanisation that says their suffering doesn’t really matter.As more potential benefit cuts are inevitably briefed in the coming days, it is worth remembering there are human beings behind every speculation. What to politicians and pundits is an abstract game is to others the fear of whether they will be able to eat regular meals or charge their electric wheelchair next year. That’s the thing about leaks. Drip-drip long enough and someone will eventually drown.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org orjo@samaritans.ie.

But the current White House regime despises the old way of doing things and intends to reshape the world so drastically that restoration of a pre-Trumpian order will be impossible.The absurd incoherence ofMr Trump’s proposalthat the US “take over” Gaza doesn’t make it any less sinister. The requirement that 2.2 million Palestinians be forcibly resettled in neighbouring Arab states amounts to unambiguous endorsement of a criminal atrocity – ethnic cleansing.The idea that the land, having been requisitioned by the US government, will then be transformed into a Mediterranean “riviera” is disturbing and grotesque in its detachment from reality. Mr Trump is treating a war zone at the centre of one of the world’s most intractable conflicts as if it were a patch of derelict Manhattan real estate. He is toying with the lives of millions of people in the idiom of a corrupt property developer and with the methods and ethics of a mafia boss.The inevitable consequence of handling complex international issues with cruel and bovine simplicity is to spread fear, uncertainty and instability. It adds gratuitous volatility at precisely the moment when the opposite approach is imperative to preserve thefragile ceasefirein Gaza.Every government in the Middle East, except Benjamin Netanyahu’s ultra-nationalist coalition in Israel, rejects Mr Trump’s intervention as dangerous and counterproductive. That is also the view among the US’s European allies – or the countries that two weeks ago considered themselves free-thinking allies of the US but now see that nosuch concept existsin the president’s mind.He recognises only clients, rivals and enemies. It is possible to move between those categories by deploying flattery and offering favours. But durable alignment based on mutual interest, legally binding treaty obligations and democratic values is a model that no longer has currency in the White House.That is a tremendous boost to the geopolitical ambitions ofRussia and China. It vindicates a vicious might-is-right approach to international relations. It legitimates the kind of imperialistic land grab that Vladimir Putin is pursuing in Ukraine. For Beijing, an age of American unreliability offers lucrative avenues of economic and strategic expansion. China sees a vacancy for itself as the world’s most predictable superpower.There is a common rationalisation that explains his recklessness as opening moves in a negotiation. His most outlandish ideas, like American appropriation of Gaza, are thus sanitised as the freewheeling improvisations of a “transactional” businessman. He is cast as a master of brinkmanship who uses shock and chaos to wrongfoot opponents beforesettling, in the end, for more sober outcomes.That analysis looks increasingly naive, even if it tallies with the president’s self-image. He might think he is just doing “deals”, but others should be clear that the correct terms are coercion and extortion.There are plenty of examples from history of capricious potentates spreading disorder in their own territories and abroad. There is no precedent for that happening to the world’s most powerful democracy, and no playbook to guide that country’s former allies in handling the situation. But one thing is now clear – hoping Mr Trump’s America might be cajoled into following the old rules is not a safe strategy.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But what about the politics of class?’ Keir Starmer visits a factory in Chester on 4 October 2024.Photograph: Darren Staples/ReutersOpinionClass issuesThe Guardian view on class politics: it has faded as culture wars have risenEditorialAs economic inequality deepens, political leaders continue to side-step structural issues while extremists aim to claim the votes of the left behindWed 5 Feb 2025 13.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareEarly in the 2010s, class politics was everywhere. Bankers were bailed out, and the price Europeans apparently had to pay was austerity. Protests erupted from Greece to Wall Street. Thomas Piketty’s book on inequality, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, took theworldby storm, and Britain seemed poised for a shift – first with Ed Miliband’s critique of “predatory capital”, then when Labour members chose to back Jeremy Corbyn’s attack on a rigged economy.A decade later, it might seem that time’s arrow has finally hit its mark. Britain has a Labour government with a whopping majority and, after years in which British prime ministers hopped off the conveyor belt from Eton or Winchester, the country is now led by the son of a toolmaker. Even the leader of the Tories, Kemi Badenoch, claims she“became working class”as a teen, while doing a few shifts at McDonald’s.A working-class background has become the badge politicians try to flaunt. But what about the politics of class? Well, that’s a different matter. The manifesto that propelled Sir Keir Starmer to power last summer mentions“working people”21 times,but“inequality”just once. What does the prime minister mean by “working people”? It was a question that he struggled to answer ahead of last October’s budget, eventually suggesting the term denoted those “who do not always have the means to write a cheque”. The average adult wrotejust two chequesall of last year.Today’s political leaders treat class as a matter of culture rather than economics, about tastes and traditions rather than where you sit in relation to power. With a piquant irony, class war has got bundled up into a culture war.The Labour government hopes to make employment law a little more progressive, but to lift up working-class kids it proposes lessons in oracy, orspeaking skills. As an up-and-coming MP, Rachel Reeves would attack David Cameron for making tax cuts for the wealthy; now she is chancellor, she listens hard to what she calls the“non-dom community”. But she was right first time: Britain stands out for how much wealth goes to those who are already wealthy, while the rest of the country has got by on stagnant real wages. Placating the Davos crowd may make good headlines, but it does nothing for the public finances, let alone your voters.There is a danger to stripping class of its associations with inequality, and its name is Nigel Farage. It is the radical right who pose with increasing confidence as the defenders of the working class. No matter how regressive the actual policies of Reform, on the economics that hits the headlines –Thames Wateror Port Talbot – Mr Farage and Richard Tice will take up positions now discarded by the centre left. It is the same formula that gotDonald Trumpinto power. The richest man ever to be president of the US touts himself at elections as the champion of blue-collar workers; once in power he surrounds himself with tech billionaires. Across Europe, the radical right have studied his example. The centre-left have been somewhat slower on the uptake, but they must urgently learn the lesson that politics abhors a vacuum and that class politics can be taken up by reactionaries as well as progressives. The results of that switch may prove disastrous.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last week it was ancient history, modern languages, music, religion and theology at Cardiff University. Not so long ago, it was subjects including English, history, music and theatre atGoldsmiths, and art history, music, philosophy and religious studies at theUniversity of Kent, to name just two. And with each passing week more arts and humanities courses and departments are cut.The end result – beyond job losses for staff – is an increase incold spotsacross the country for these subjects, with a consequent loss of opportunity, and potential social mobility, for local students. For future employers, there is the loss of a strong pool of graduates with thecritical thinking and problem-solving skillsthat arts and humanities degrees deliver so well and that employers value highly. For society at large, there is the loss of thesocial, culturalandeconomic benefitsthat engagement with these subjects brings. And for universities, there is the danger of reputational damage exacerbating their economic difficulties, potentially leading to the comprehensive loss of one of the nation’s most valuable assets. Now is the time for decisive action by the government.ProfThea Pitman and Prof Emma CayleyCo-chairs, Arts and Humanities AllianceSurely if a university wanted to study the totality of the human experience, as opposed to just being an expensive technical college, it would support the teaching of our past (ancient history), our beliefs (religion and theology), our modern languages, our culture (music), and our health (nursing). It would also not combine Stem subjects into blobs like the “Data Science Academy” (Cardiff University to cut 400 staff and drop subjects including nursing and music, 28 January).For Wales’s flagship university to do this is particularly outrageous. The university will leave unstudied the place of Wales in ancient history, its rich religious heritage, its music, and the place of Welsh among other languages. It will weaken the NHS in the land of its birth. Some subjects may not seem to contribute much on a spreadsheet, but they all contribute to a “university”, as we once understood the word.It is not Cardiff’s fault that the UK government has caused a catastrophic drop in foreign student numbers but, with cash reserves of £188m, the university should ride out the storm. If it has to make cuts, it should do so cautiously and protect learning above all else. It should also probably not pay its vice-chancellor many times the salary of its lecturers, but that’s an issue that goes beyond Cardiff.Dr Ronan McLaverty-HeadMalvern, WorcestershireI also work at a large Russell Group university where there are going to be similar levels of cuts to those at Cardiff. I recently attended a finance seminar explaining these research and staffing cuts: the vice-chancellor was kind enough to join the seminar from his chandelier-lit hotel room in India, so clearly the cuts aren’t affecting everyone.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It helped that Newcastle’s manager took the precaution of breaking a longstanding devotion to operating with a back four.If the ensuing tactical shift to a back five was partly to compensate for the loss of the injured Joelinton’s customary abrasion in midfield, it also had the benefit of averting the need to drop one of Fabian Schär, Sven Botman and Dan Burn, all of whom could make compelling cases for starting.A revamp as much about coping with Arsenal’s threat from set pieces as smart dressing‑room diplomacy swiftly paid dividends with Schär, Botman and Burn all excelling, not to mention taking turns to step out of defence and press any remaining shreds of optimism out of Arteta’s increasingly suffocated ­players. Schär, in particular, shone in a special, quasi‑man‑marking job that nullified Declan Rice.View image in fullscreenJacob Murphy finds himself in the right place to collect a rebound off a post to score Newcastle’s opening goal.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesHowe had sensibly introduced the experienced, thoroughly streetwise Kieran Trippier at right wing‑back in place of Tino Livramento and ­Trippier’s nous frequently informed Arteta’s increasing grimaces.Not that Newcastle supporters were necessarily looking for a cool, measured approach. “Get into them” demanded one giant banner in the Gallowgate End at kick‑off. Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak were happy to oblige with the former’s fine pass prefacing the rapidly acce­lerating Sweden striker taking a steadying touch before lashing a fabulous shot into the back of the net.On that occasion VAR came to Arsenal’s rescue with the identification of a fractional offside that offered Arteta’s team a reprieve they barely deserved after leaving Isak far too much room for manoeuvre.Not that it lasted long. Moments after Martin Ødegaard spurned a decent chance, Isak thundered a 20‑yard left-footed shot against a post and watched in delight as Jacob ­Murphy directed the rebound beyond David Raya on the half-volley. Small ­wonder Arteta is so keen on buying the ­Newcastle centre‑forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Visiting possession stats in excess of 70% were all very well but, bar one save from Martin Dubravka to deny Leandro Trossard and Ødegaard grazing the outside of an upright, they never really looked like scoring potentially gamechanging goals.The need to take risks left William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães badly exposed and ­unusually vulnerable. That defensive duo can rarely have looked so ­discombobulated but then they do not have to contend with Isak and Gordon every week.Moments after missing a ­glorious shooting opportunity the latter slid a low shot past Raya ­following a passage of terrible Arsenal ­defending.It all began with the goalkeeper ill‑advisedly attempting to play out from the back and involved Rice’s ­dispossession by Schär’s tackle before the ball dropped for the ­England winger to spark choruses of: “We’re going to Wemberlee.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 50-over tournament is back after an eight-year absence, the period in between seeing a proliferation in franchise Twenty20 cricket as well asthree men’s T20 World Cups.“I’ve always enjoyed 50-over cricket,” said Buttler. “It’s always been one of my favourite formats. But it’s certainly been pushed a little bit towards the margins in recent years, with the way the scheduling is and the rise of T20 and franchise cricket.India thrash England by record 150-run margin to cap T20 series win in styleRead more“I still think if you talk to guys about winning a World Cup, they’d probably say a 50-over World Cup ahead of a T20 World Cup at the moment. Whether that continues to be the case moving forward, I don’t know. I always think of the 99 World Cup being something I watched as a kid. Maybe [for] the 20-year-olds now it’s all about T20 World Cups.”ODIs have appeared to be low in the list of priorities for English men’s cricket since their 2019 World Cup victory at home. The one-day domestic competition has been relegated in status, operating in the shadows ofthe Hundred during the summer. Internationally, it can be seen through the use of Joe Root: England’s No 3 has been regularly rested in the format, playing just 28 of his side’s 62 ODIs since that super-over win against New Zealand.With a major tournament to prepare for, Root is back in the 50-over mix for the first time in 15 months as England look to settle on a full-strength XI.“If you can pit your best teams against each other and you put your best players out there, I think that’s the way to keep 50-over cricket relevant,” Buttler added.Quick GuideEngland team for first ODI v IndiaShowPhil Salt (wk), Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (capt), Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Saqib MahmoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Root is the only addition to the squad England used in their 4-1 T20 series loss to India, in as the innings controller at one-down. “He’s back with that cheeky smile on his face and really enjoying his cricket,” said Buttler.The batting lineup has extended for the series opener in Nagpur, with Jacob Bethell at seven instead of the all-rounder Jamie Overton. Ultra-aggression remains the method, though the captain has demanded better execution. The longer format does ask for some adjustments.“It’s long enough to test you that you do need to still bat properly in some situations as such or have a good enough technique to do that,” said Buttler. “But obviously you need to be powerful and aggressive and able to score at a certain rate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

High pace alongside Adil Rashid’s leggies remains the way with the ball.View image in fullscreenEngland head coach Brendon McCullum with his players during training.Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/ReutersIndia, on the other hand, are much-changed, perhaps to England’s relief. Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma were exhilarating in the 20-over games, a glimpse into the future, but are not in the one-day squad. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are back and still the frontmen in this format.Both struggled on the tour of Australia that finished in January and runs were not found when they briefly returned to domestic first-class cricket in recent weeks. But they still bring the prestige of 81 ODI hundreds between them and were the leading run-scorers at the World Cup in India less than a year and a half ago. Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and Shubman Gill are other big names present for the assignment.The hosts have made the late decision to add Varun Chakaravarthy to their ODI squad, with the leg-spinner still uncapped in the format. Chakaravarthy took 14 wickets in the T20s, the mayhem he caused too bothersome to ignore for the second half of the tour. England, it should be added, have not won a one-day series in India for 40 years. A relaxing warm-up appears unlikely.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamJos ButtlerCricketTwenty20India cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Both teams have been having difficult seasons but inside the red rose camp there remains a firm belief that, given a little patience, the tide will eventually turn for them.England’s attack coach, Richard Wigglesworth, also happens to be a United fan and sees similarities between the respective situations at Twickenham and Old Trafford. He thinks Amorim will eventually deliver success for United, now 13th in the Premier League, and is also backing England, who have won just two of their past nine Tests, to turn the corner in the not-too-distant future.England’s early promise blown away by Ireland’s second-half stormRead moreWigglesworth is well aware thatFrance will be formidable opponentsthis weekend but he insists signs of recovery are already visible in England’s performances.“We’re going to get there,” Wigglesworth said, pointing to the fact England have scored three tries against both Irelandand the world champions South Africain recent months. “We’re seeing green shoots in this England team; we play fast, we’re aggressive and we score tries.“Against South Africa we scored tries with limited ball and limited possession because we’re looking a little bit more dangerous. When did we last look dangerous with the ball? I think we were the only team to have scored three tries against South Africa in the past couple of years. Against Ireland there were 11 line-breaks against a good defence which doesn’t give up line-breaks. There is stuff coming.”Wigglesworth fully accepts, however, that professional sport is about results and hebelieves that coaches, whether it be Amorim at United or Borthwick with England, need time to revitalise struggling squads. “I’m not avoiding the fact that if you don’t win then people are passionate about it. They want to leave the game happy and leave with that [winning] feeling – as I am with Man United and when I was a fan and not a player or coach of England rugby.“WhenMan United played Arsenal[in the FA Cup last month] I’m seeing players sprint back and I’m thinking as a fan that I have not seen that for a long time. The manager says he wants them to run like wild dogs and I’m seeing that. The little bits [of improvement] that he’s getting in … I am fascinated by him as a coach. With my limited knowledge of football, just from watching him and how he speaks, [I think] he’s the real deal.“I love how he speaks about the team. He comes across as honest and looks as though he values the right things. The club have kept changing and changing and now they’re in their worst moment ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, the whole thing starts again: staffing and the players all change. That is proven not to be the way to do it. You need the right man. To me, he looks incredibly impressive. So given time, resources and a bit of luck that everyone always needs, it would be nice to see him turn it around.”The big difference between the Premier League and international rugby, of course, is that Borthwick has many fewer games per year in which to transform England’s fortunes. Defeat by France would be their eighth consecutive loss against tier one-opposition, the worst run in their history, with a dangerous‑looking Scotland next up.Wigglesworth, though, insists England are not ducking short-term reality. “We want to win but not everyone gets to win all the time, straight away. We are working to make that happen but there is evidence to back up the best way of creating good teams over time. We’re going to get there.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Alongside a solitary silver for the men’s curlers, the total fell below the UK Sport target of three to seven medals for the Games.Now Muirhead believes expectations should be centred on allowing athletes to compete without undue pressure. “Winter sports are very unpredictable,” she said.No transparency please, we’re the IOC: Coe makes his pitch for world sport’s top jobRead more“There are such small margins between winning and losing on the winter stage. But we don’t put numbers on it, I think it would be unfair to put that pressure on the athletes. They will perform the best they can. If they come away with a smile on their face, then that’s good.“You look at Sochi 2014, Pyeongchang [in 2018], it was the best medal returns that we’ve had – five medals at each of those Games. Yes, Beijing, we were at the bottom of the UK Sport’s medal range, but it was held in that Covid environment. It didn’t help preparations. We don’t set medal targets and we never have. It would be unfair to do that. It would be unfair to put that pressure on the athlete.”With a year to go before the Games begin, Muirhead expectsTeam GBto take about 50 athletes to Italy, qualification depending. She is enthused by the prospect of Milan and Cortina’s four geographical “clusters” of activity and remains positive that the rebuilding of the 100-year-old sliding track in Cortina will be completed in time, with Lake Placid in the US acting as a backup venue.“It’s very much an alpine skiing winter feel, they have World Cup events yearly, and I think that is just perfect for a Winter Olympics,” Muirhead said of the location. “For us in Great Britain, we’re only an hour time change away, so I think it will be great for viewing at home and for spectators to get out there. We’ve got a huge opportunity from it being on our doorstep.”Of the sliding, Muirhead said she had recently discussed progress with the Games’ organising committee. “I had a call a couple of weeks ago and they are doing monthly checks on the sliding and all is up to speed and up to date. There is still some work to do on it but they are still very positive come the next check in mid-February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The expanded group stage for the Champions League, with each team playing a minimum of eight games, has hardly helped matters, while 12 European teams are playing in an expanded Fifa Club World Cup in the US this summer.Most of the concessions made to elite sides’ expanding fixture lists have so far come in the form of cuts to domestic competitions, such as the controversial shelving of FA Cup replays in England.Cutting the additional 30 minutes from two-legged ties would go a small way towards alleviating the problems caused by late-season fixture congestion. It could also be popular among clubs that undergo the gruelling regimen of qualifying rounds in July and August.Underdogs who feel the pace of an added period against clubs with better-stocked squads would sense a fairer playing field. There may also be some appeal to broadcasters that would see less risk of an unpredicted dent in their schedules and perhaps relish the opportunity to cut straight to the shorter-form drama of spot-kicks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four ties in the 2023-24 Europa League went the distance, down from six the season before.Uefa’s stance when contacted by the Guardian was that until now the issue has been raised informally, with no definitive proposal tabled. Any change would have to be ratified by Uefa’s executive committee, whose last major change to the substance of club competition ties came when the away goals rule was thrown out in 2021.Some precedent for the abolition of extra time was set when Uefa removed it from Super Cups with effect from 2023.Explore more on these topicsUefaChampions LeagueEuropean club footballFootball politicsShareReuse this content"

You could argue it is the least important of domestic competitions, but the more something eludes a team the more they want it.The chances of West Ham troubling the Women’s Super League leaders were slim. The two sides had met four times in the League Cup (twice at the semi-final stage) before this meeting at a shivering Kingsmeadow, with Chelsea winning all four games by an aggregate score of 19-2.There were five changes to the side that sealed a 1-0 win against Aston Villa in the league on Sunday but such is Chelsea’s depth that it was not a weakened team. Chelsea’s other new acquisition – the USA defender Naomi Girma, who signed fora world‑record fee of £890,000– is not yet ready for the bench having been in the middle of the US off-season. But she was sitting in the stands between the rested Lucy Bronze, and Zecira Musovic, who announced on Monday that she is pregnant.Despite utterly dominating proceedings, it took 20 minutes for the rejigged home team to make a breakthrough against the side they put five past in January. A clearance landed at the feet of Rytting Kaneryd, who swiped it in at the near post. Before the half‑hour Chelsea doubled their lead as Nüsken and Guro Reiten muscled Eva Nyström off the ball on the edge of West Ham’s area before the former rounded the goalkeeper Kinga Szemik and rolled the ball into the net.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Johanna Rytting Kaneryd scores their first goal against West Ham.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersThe hour brought a double change for Chelsea that would put a chill into any team battling to get back into a game, with Aggie Beever-Jones and Lauren James refreshing the home attack.“We were playing home and I think we had a good first half in terms of result and performance,” Bompastor said. “At half‑time we were leading the game 2-0 and I think it was good enough.”It took until the 78th minute for West Ham to muster a shot on target amid the Chelsea onslaught, which they did well to contain. Manuela Paví found Kirsty Smith wide on the right but the angle got too tight and it was easy for Hannah Hampton when the shot did come in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re a bit disappointed with the way that we conceded the goals because we got caught on the ball a little bit and could have avoided that.”Chelsea will play the winner of the game on Thursday night between Arsenal and Manchester City – the final on Saturday 15 March at Pride Park being Bompastor’s chance to lift her first piece of silverware with the London club.Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWest Ham United WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Celtic were unstoppable.Portuguese winger Jota, who recently returned to the champions 18 months after leaving for spells in Saudi Arabia and France, started the game, following hisgoalscoring appearance off the benchagainst Motherwell on Sunday. Right-back Alistair Johnston and Engels were also reinstated with Anthony Ralston, Luke McCowan and Kühn dropping out. Jeffrey Schlupp, the 32-year-old utility player signed on loan from Crystal Palace until the end of the season, was on the bench.Lyall Cameron, who is moving to Rangers in the summer, was absent for Tony Docherty’sDundeeside due to an achilles injury while fellow midfielder Finlay Robertson and defensive duo Antonio Portales and Ethan Ingram were back in the starting lineup.The visitors managed a couple of forays forward, which offered some hope, but that dissipated whenCeltictook the lead. The referee Colin Steven initially awarded a foul to Dundee when Mohamed Sylla tussled with Auston Trusty at a corner but was asked to check his pitchside monitor by the VAR, Alan Muir, and after a long look pointed to the spot. Engels fired low to Trevor Carson’s right for the lead – his sixth penalty in the league this season.Dundee tried valiantly to push forward but their attacks were sporadic, while only poor final touches and decision-making prevented Celtic adding to their lead. However, just before the break, the visitors succumbed again – Carson saved an initial effort from Idah and then parried Jota’s drive. Idah, the former Norwich striker, then fired high into the net from eight yards.Rodgers said of Idah: “I’m so pleased for him, he’s just moving different now and he’s getting a real handful. His goal was very good, makes a good run, gets his shot off, doesn’t lie about the floor, gets up and then he’s able to get the rebound and a really good finish.”The second half was a straightforward drubbing. Jota showed some trickery coming in from the left before his right-footed cross to the back post was headed in by the unmarked Maeda. Then some entertaining play from Reo Hatate and Jota ended with Engels sending Maeda down the right channel and his perfect lob from the edge of the box beat Carson and dipped under the bar.View image in fullscreenDaizen Maeda heads in to make it 3-0 – his second goal of the match was to follow four minutes later.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockThe Northern Irish goalkeeper was beaten again when Engels curled a wonderful shot from 25 yards in off the bar. Rodgers then moved quickly to replace Idah and Greg Taylor with Johnny Kenny and Schlupp.However, it was another Celtic substitute, Kühn – on for Jota – who lifted a shot from the edge of the box into the far corner to complete a fine evening’s work for the rampant league leaders.Of Jota, Rodgers said: “I’d obviously seen him before from the outside looking in and then I’ve seen him train and work but he’s a big player. I can’t wait for him to get up to the level in terms of that football fitness. He’s missed a lot of football, hasn’t played a great deal but he’s a class act … a big talent.”Docherty said: “It was a tough one in the end. We lost poor goals and we addressed that with the group after the game. We take full responsibility and we have to be more resolute defensively, but we need to get back on the horse now.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipCelticDundeematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Its previous target was 12-16GW.It also plans to produce 2.2m barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2030, which is 10% higher than its previous plans. The company hopes to fuel this growth with barrels from Britain’s biggest untapped oilfield at Rosebank in the North Sea – despitea landmark court rulingthat the government’s decision to approve the project was unlawful.The Rosebank project has spurred debate over whether or not the Labour government can successfully pursue its green agenda while delivering economic growth.The party came to power with the promise to end new North Sea oil and gas exploration licences while respecting existing ones. However, climate campaigners have piled pressure on ministers to block the development of Rosebank, which received its licence in 2023, by refusing it a final consent permit to produce oil under a new regime that will be finalised in spring.The uncertainty has laid bare a rift in the government between the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has described the licence issued to Rosebank as “climate vandalism”, and Treasury officials eager to jump start the UK’s economic growth through multibillion pound investments from the private sector.Equinor has claimed that Rosebank will require £8.1bn of total direct investment over the lifetime of the field, of which 78% will flow to UK companies. It is also expected to create 1,600 jobs at the peak of its construction and about 450 UK jobs over its operating life. Equinor will also pay tax to the Treasury for the barrels of oil it sells from the field.Equinor has said it will continue to develop the field while working with the UK government and regulators to move the project forward under a new consent process.The Oslo-based company revealed plans to water down its green investments afterShelland BP signalled to investors that they would backtrack on their green spending plans to exploit volatility in the global oil and gas markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was still the company’s third-highest results on record, according to its chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné.Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, which campaigns against fossil fuels, said it was “no surprise” that Equinor was retreating from its “deeply inadequate global renewables targets”.“Having spent huge amounts on marketing, sponsoring newspapers and events, to try and persuade the British government and public that it is a responsible oil company committed to the transition, Equinor has finally laid bare that it cares more about profits than anything else,” Khan added.Explore more on these topicsOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryNorwayCommoditiesEuropeGreen economynewsShareReuse this content"

Under the terms of the deal, the base would remain under UK control ona 99-year lease.Keir Starmer told MPs on Wednesday that the deal was essential for the Diego Garcia base to continue operating. “Without legal certainty, the base cannot operate in practical terms as it should,” the prime minister told MPs. “That is bad for our national security and it’s a gift for our adversaries.”But two senior sources said that some in Downing Street had reservations about the deal, which is costing considerable political capital and risks jeopardising relations with Donald Trump’s administration.UK stalls Chagos Islands deal until Trump administration can ‘consider detail’Read moreTrump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had criticised the agreement before he was appointed and raised it in his first call with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, earlier this month.Jonathan Powell, who negotiated the agreement before being appointed as the UK’s national security adviser, is due to travel to Washington DC to meet his US counterpart, Mike Waltz, this week, amid concerns that Trump’s administration could seek to overturn the deal.The government has been criticised by opposition MPs. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused ministers of having “botched” the negotiations and questioned why they were making “significant payments toMauritiusupfront at a time when winter fuel payments have been scrapped”.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, called the plan an “immoral surrender”, while Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, told MPs that “when the Americans wake up to the fact that this has been done wholly unnecessarily, I wouldn’t be surprised if we find ourselves together with the European Union in their tariff regime”.The plan is being increasingly criticised inside theLabourparty. Bloomberg reported that two cabinet ministers had concerns about the cost of the deal at a time when public spending cuts were being threatened.One former Labour adviser said the row had the potential to become a totemic issue akin to Gordon Brown selling half the UK’s gold reserves.Another said the Chagos deal “was a catastrophic error … The best way to solve it now and save face is to pull out and say: ‘We tried to be constructive, tried to support the rules-based order, but Mauritius has been completely unreasonable and now it will never be returned.’”A government source said it was the role of Downing Street advisers to robustly test the arguments for all policies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mauritius has maintained the islands are its own, and the international court of justice ruled in an advisory opinion in 2021 that the UK’s administration of the territory was unlawful.Peter Lamb, the Labour MP for Crawley, West Sussex, which is home to about 4,000 Chagos Islanders, criticised the deal and said it did not guarantee the islanders’ right to return to their homeland. “There is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that any of the people who were truly harmed by the UK’s actions will in any way benefit from this deal,” he said.Stephen Doughty, the minister for British overseas territories, said Foreign Office officials were due to meet Chagos Islanders next week.He told the Commons that the deal ensured the Diego Garcia base could continue to operate, including by guaranteeing the UK’s “unrestricted and sole access to the electromagnetic spectrum” above it. If the UK were to lose this exclusivity as a result of a sovereignty dispute, other countries could access radio waves above the base, Doughty said.Navin Ramgoolam, the prime minister of Mauritius, triggered a diplomatic spat aftertelling his MPs on Tuesdaythat he had rewritten the deal to ensure payments from the UK rose in line with inflation. He said that not doing so would have halved the amount handed to Mauritius.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Starmer’s spokesperson said it was “factually inaccurate” that the payment had doubled and there had been “no change” to the cost of the deal or terms of the lease.In response, Ramgoolam’s government issued a statement insisting it had never said the cost of the agreement had doubled.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsMauritiusTrump administrationForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeUS politicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It said: “The supervisor may not have been able to see the previous referral … because the first case record was created under a slightly different spelling.”The review continued: “As the supervisor was unable to find the previous referral … this may have caused the case to be closed quickly on minimal information. This may be due to the second referral being created on a new subject/individual entity due to the misspelling of [Rudakubana’s] surname.”His case was closed despite him showing an interest in the Manchester Arena attack, in which the suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people an Ariana Grande concert in 2017. Rudakubana had also talked about “stabbing people”.Jarvis told MPs that the Prevent programme knew that Rudakubana had been caught carrying a knife in 2019, and searched on the internet for school shootings, London bombings, the IRA and the Israel-Palestine conflict, between December 2019 and April 2021.The minister said: “I can update the house that the perpetrator was referred to Prevent three times between December 2019, when he was aged 13, and April 2021, when he was 14. Those referrals were made by his schools.“The first referral reported concerns about him carrying a knife and searching for school shootings on the internet. The second referral was focused on his online activity relating to Libya and Gaddafi. His third referral was for searching for London bombings, the IRA and the Israel-Palestine conflict.“On each of these occasions, the decision at the time was that the perpetrator should not progress to the Channel multi-agency process.”The Guardian disclosed thatRudakubana was referred to the counter-extremism programme on three occasionsbetween December 2019 and April 2021. It also emerged that counter-terrorism officers closed his case because they believed he had an interest in world news and current affairs but no cause or political belief, and was “not in danger of being radicalised”.After Southport, Westminster is floundering. It should look to Idris Elba | Martin KettleRead moreThe review found there was enough evidence for Prevent officers assessing each of his three referrals to the counter-extremism programme to escalate his case to Channel. Participating with Prevent and Channel programmes is voluntary.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has said she will introducenew terrorism ordersfor young people who refuse to engage with Prevent. The new youth diversion orders will ban children as young as 10 from using the internet or engaging in forums.Under-18s who breach an order will be fined and given a community sentence of up to six months in custody while those aged between 18 and 21 will face up to two years in prison.Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackEnglandUK security and counter-terrorismCrimeKnife crimeHouse of CommonsMerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

A total of 70 watches were stolen from the 247 Kettles shop.Oliver White, a 27-year-old office manager, died by suicide the next day “as a direct result” of the robbery, jurors were previously told.At Woolwich crown court on Wednesday, Kunu said: “This was not a robbery, this was staged.”He claimed he was offered £5,000 to put the watches in a bag. “I knew that I was going to take part in a staged robbery where everyone was consenting,” Kunu said. “I knew that the person in the shop was going to comply. I knew that I was going to put watches in the bag and I had to do nothing else.”Kunu, of Mitcham, south-west London, is accused of entering the shop to carry out the robbery. He told the court he had been recruited to take part in a fake robbery, believing it to be an insurance scam, and had he known it was real he would not have done it.Two other men said to have been involved – Michael Ashman and Kyle Bowrage – escaped and fled abroad shortly after the alleged robbery took place.Kunu said that Bowrage had told him what was going to happen, and that it all went to plan.“He told me that [the manager] Oliver White was going to comply; he complied,” he told jurors. “He told me that police was not going to get called, they didn’t get called. He told me that he [White] wasn’t going to press the panic button or anything and he didn’t.”Jurors previously heard that White was put in a headlock and tied up while the watches were stolen. Kunu said in court that the actions, including using cable ties on White, were part of “the roleplay” to “make the whole thing look real”.He said he was recruited to take part in the alleged robbery by an unnamed man who knew he wanted to make some money. The defendant refused to name the caller, citing concerns over his own safety and that of his family. “I feel like he knew that I was just … I’m naive. He knew that I was naive,” Kunu said.Giving evidence last week, Connor Thornton, the store’s co-owner, denied believing it was an “inside job”.White was found dead the day after the incident. His mother, Amy Keane, described him as a “really hardworking young man” who was “devastated by the robbery”.Woolwich crown court previously heard that White had tried to transfer £14,000 of his own savings to his bosses after the robbery.The prosecution alleges the defendants played different roles in the plot. Pedro, of Cobham, Surrey, did not attend the shop and is accused of planning the alleged robbery.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

His exceptional photograph serves as a powerful reminder that local nature and wildlife, often just outside our homes, can inspire and captivate us.”Wood said winning the award was “truly humbling”, but he also highlighted the “darker side” to the image as he called for an end to badger culling in the UK, which aims to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis.“I live in rural Dorset, where I’m on a rewilding mission to enhance habitats for a huge array of wildlife,” he said. “The badger cull – which is still ongoing – has decimated their numbers and I fear that unless the cull is stopped, we’ll only see badgers in urban settings in several parts ofEngland.“My hope is for this image to raise awareness of the damaging effect of the badger cull and help push for change.”The people’s choice shortlist was selected from nearly 60,000 entries to this year’s wildlife photographer of the year competition.Four other highly commended images also impressed wildlife lovers, including Francisco Negroni’s photo of a double lenticular cloud over the Villarrica volcano in Chile, and Jess Findlay’s action shot of a ghostly barn owl exiting through the hayloft window of a derelict barn.David Northall’s snap of a honey badger returning to finish off a Cape porcupine, and Michel d’Oultremont’s photo of a stoat sitting up to observe its territory across a snowy landscape in Belgium also won over voters.All five images will be displayed online and at the Natural History Museum in London until 29 June.Explore more on these topicsWildlife photographer of the yearBadgersNatural History MuseumPhotographyWildlifeEast SussexEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This would be an expensive and irresponsible waste of taxpayers’ money, and any party calling for these elections to go ahead must explain how this waste would be justifiable.”The announced delay is for only a year, with Rayner’s department pledging that elections for the mayors and the new councils will happen in May 2026. However, the government’s own timetable for setting up the new authorities says many may not be ready until 2027 or later.One council source said the idea of reorganising their area in time for elections in 2026 was “simply impossible, irrespective of any political or ideological view”.If that is the case, some of the promised 2026 elections could be for what are known as a shadow administration, a new set of councillors whose main task is to oversee the revamp process. In such as case, the existing councillors could carry on delivering local services.Kevin Hollinrake, the shadow levelling up secretary, criticised the decision to postpone elections so soon before May.“TheLabourgovernment has massively rushed this whole exercise,” he said. “There has been no attempt to gather consensus within two-tier areas. Local residents have not been consulted.“This whole process should be considered in slower time, with proper and open consultation, and not imposed from Whitehall on your town hall.”The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, whose party hopes to make gains in May, said the plan was “a disgraceful stitch-up between Labour and the Conservatives”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of the affected councils are run by the Conservatives, prompting accusations that the party was seeking to avoid electoral losses.Farage told a Reform UK press conference: “This decision damages us in terms of how we can perform.” He claimed that the cancellations were in areas where Reform was expected to make gains.He added: “Our internal polling shows we are ahead inEssex, with maybe even a chance of winning enough seats to certainly be in a governing or coalition governing position in that county.

Starmer has previously called that summit “very important”.Since entering Downing Street, Starmer has shown a similar interest to his predecessor in AI, but unlike Sunak he has chosen to focus more heavily on the opportunities the technology can bring. Last month the prime ministergave a speechon the technology in which he said: “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers.”Alan Mak, the shadow science and innovation secretary, said: “The Conservatives hosted the first AI safety summit, establishing the UK as a world leader in the sector.“Keir Starmer is threatening that legacy and further damaging Britain’s leadership on the world stage by spurning this important summit.”Next week’s summit is being seen in Paris as a key moment in Macron’s presidency and a test of his clout on the international stage.Franceis keen to use the gathering to talk about how to provide clean power for AI and how to mitigate disruption to the labour market.Macron has put great store by his AI strategy, saying that mastering the technology was an “existential challenge” for France.“The president wants to make it a kind of AI version of Choose France,” an Elysée spokesperson said. “Choose France is the annual summit aimed at proving how attractive the country is to major foreign corporations.”A source close to the president told French reporters recently: “This is going to be the thing for Emmanuel Macron, and he has high expectations of it. The Élysée Palace is working very hard on this.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Keir StarmerEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

The psychiatrist failed to change his treatment four times. They failed to consider public safety in Nottingham.“A system is made out of individuals. If individuals are not held to account, systems will not change in our country.”Grace’s mother, Sinead O’Malley, who is a consultant anaesthetist, said: “If any of those individuals thought that Valdo Calocane was going to go out and share student accommodation with their child, I suspect their choices may have been changed. Accountability on an individual level is essential.”Calocane, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order after killing three people, and attempting to kill three others, in a spate of attacks in Nottingham on 13 June 2023.The families said they were due to meet government ministers next week to discuss a public inquiry into the attacks and Calocane’s treatment, previouslypromised by Keir Starmerbefore the general election last year.They said talks would include deciding the format and scope of the inquiry, as well as the identity of the chair.Emma Webber, Barnaby’s mother, said she wanted to ensure the inquiry was statutory and “has teeth”. “All of the agencies, organisations, institutions and, vitally, individuals must then and will be compelled to attend, give evidence and tell the truth,” she said.“It’s not a witch-hunt – we want accountability, we’re not vengeful. But because people are not being held to account when they don’t do their jobs properly, change isn’t happening. Where’s the incentive?”She added: “The scale of all of this is an unimaginable and an epic level. The public deserve to know the truth. It must be addressed and it must be dealt with properly.”James Coates, Ian Coates’ son, who lives in Nottingham, said he had struggled accessing mental health treatment from the same service responsible for discharging Calocane nine months before the attacks.“There are still individuals out there who are not doing risk assessments, who are not completing the job properly, taking shortcuts,” he said. “There’s a system that failed but they won’t pick out the individuals, the ones that have signed on the dotted line. I just can’t have any faith in the trust.”The independent report said Calocane was not forced to have long-lasting anti-psychotic medication when hospitalised because he did not like needles, although he was known not to take medication when released.The review also found that between 2019 and 2023 there were 15 other incidents of “extremely serious” violence, including three fatalities, perpetrated by patients ofNottinghamshirehealthcare NHS foundation trust, or people recently discharged.The families said they believed Calocane should face a harsher sentence, with solicitor Neil Hudgell, acting on their behalf, saying Calocane “was not treatment resistant, he resisted treatment”.The chief executive of Nottinghamshire healthcareNHSfoundation trust, Ifti Majid, said: “We apologise unreservedly for the opportunities we missed in the care of Valdo Calocane. We are making clear progress with a trust-wide plan, which is already delivering key improvements in areas such as risk assessment and discharge processes.”Explore more on these topicsNottinghamNHSHealthcare industryHealthMental healthNottinghamshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The judge said she would deliver her reasoning in a written judgment at a later date.In a 19-page ruling published on Wednesday, Steyn rejected the claims made by Clarke’s legal team, which revolved around a decision by journalists to delete messages exchanged with one another on Signal, a messaging app.During a hearing intoClarke’s application on 29 January, the court heard how Paul Lewis, the Guardian’s head of investigations and the principal editor supervising the story, asked two reporters, Sirin Kale and Lucy Osborne, to delete Signal threads.His request occurred before the publication of any articles and more than a year before Clarke notified the Guardian of his intention to sue.Clarke’s lawyers sought to argue that the deletion of the messages, and what they claimed were attempts to “fabricate” evidence, amounted to attempts to destroy evidence that was relevant to the current legal proceedings.They argued that Guardian journalists had perverted the course of justice and Clarke was therefore unable to receive a fair trial.However, in her judgment, Steyn dismissed those arguments.She said: “I reject the contention that the defendant has perverted or attempted to pervert the course of justice. There has been no fabrication of evidence. Some documents were deleted prior to the commencement of proceedings, and over a year before a letter, before claim giving notice of the intended claims was sent to the defendant.“But such deletion was not in breach of any duty to preserve documents, and in any event it neither had the tendency to pervert, nor was it intended to pervert the course of justice.“As the allegation of perversion of the course of justice fails, it follows that the strike-out application must inevitably be rejected in its entirety.”The judge said: “Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart [nee Kale] were free to delete these peripheral documents in accordance with their organisation’s data minimisation policy, at a time when the legal department had not instructed them to preserve potentially disclosable documents.”Steyn said Clarke’s application was “entirely vague” about what the Guardian’s journalists were accused of fabricating and she criticised claims Clarke’s lawyers made in oral submissions at last week’s hearing.She said: “The approach taken by the claimant’s representatives is unacceptable: deletion is not fabrication, and such a grave allegation should not have been made and publicly aired without foundation.”Her ruling concluded that Clarke’s application failed both because the Guardian had not perverted the course of justice, or attempted to do so, and because the “limited pre-action deletion” that had occurred did not preclude a fair trial.A Guardian spokesperson said: “We are pleased that Mrs Justice Steyn today rejected the entirely false allegations made by Mr Clarke’s legal team against our journalists.“Our reporting on Noel Clarke in 2021 was based on the accounts of 20 brave women. After we published our first article, more women came forward.“At trial, 32 witnesses are set to testify against Mr Clarke under oath. We look forward to a judge hearing the evidence.”The articles Clarke is suing over were published in 2021 and 2022.The high court ruled in November 2023 that the articles meant there were strong grounds to believe Clarke was a serial abuser of women, who abused his power over 15 years to prey on, harass and sometimes bully female colleagues, and that he engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching and groping women and making sexually inappropriate comments.The articles also meant he took and shared sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.Clarke has denied any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing. He accepted he once made inappropriate comments about one woman, for which he later apologised. He said in November 2023: “I have always disputed the content of the eight Guardian articles.”Steyn’s ruling outlined some of the evidence expected to be heard during the high court trial set to begin on 3 March.It said the Guardian had served 34 witness statements in support of its defence. They included six journalists, who would provide evidence in support of a public interest defence, and 28 witnesses who had provided witness statements in relation to the truth of the allegations published by the Guardian. All but two are scheduled to give evidence at trial. Clarke, the judgment said, had served 15 witness statements.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

British Transport Police said there had been no reported injuries.Reports have speculated that the damage may have been caused by metal ball bearings, or airgun pellets. Damage to a train on Sunday appeared to show the projectile had struck but not penetrated the train windows.A spokesperson for British Transport Police said: “We have been contacted with reports of trains being hit with projectiles near Cambridge North railway station.“Officers have attended the area, and full searches have been conducted, however no one has been identified in connection.“Damage has been caused to trains, however there have been no reported injuries. Enquiries are ongoing.”The Telegraph reported that the incidents had occurred over the past three weekends and had led to drivers refusing to operate trains through the area until whoever was responsible was caught.Nigel Gibson, an organiser for the train drivers’ union Aslef in the east ofEngland, told the Telegraph: “Our members raised very serious concerns for the safety of passengers and train crew after a series of incidents just south of Cambridge North station when projectiles were aimed at – and hit – services on the line.“We are working closely with Greater Anglia and the other operators to resolve this problem as quickly as possible.”The 2.3-mile two-track railway line between Cambridge and Cambridge North stations passes light industrial estates, various residential areas including houses and flats, a lake, a church and about a mile of parkland and common ground.A Greater Anglia spokesperson said: “We are investigating isolated incidents of damage to some train services travelling between Cambridge and Cambridge North stations. We are working with British Transport Police to identify the cause and what, if any, further action is necessary.”A Govia Thameslink Railway spokesperson for Great Northern said: “We can confirm that train services between Cambridge and King’s Lynn were disrupted on Sunday night by an incident near Cambridge North that the police have been investigating.“Trains were delayed or cancelled in the area from around 5.40pm on Sunday. This put our trains out of position for their normal startup on Monday morning so services were disrupted. We’re supporting the British Transport Police with their investigation.”Anyone who can assist is asked to contact British Transport Police by either calling 0800 40 50 40 or texting 61016.

They all lost the party whip for six months last summer, after which their suspensions were due to be reviewed.Begum, McDonnell and Sultana will remain suspended pending a future review, it is understood.Last week, theGuardian confirmed the former shadow minister Rebecca Long-Baileywould be among the first group of suspended MPs to have the whip restored, with sources noting they had been warned that their readmission to the Labour fold would be subject to good behaviour.Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, and Begum, the MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said they had learned of their extended suspensions from a media report. Sultana said on X: “Turns out speaking up for Palestine is still a punishable offence.” Begum added: “Almost half of all children in my borough grow up in poverty. I want to be clear: I will always stand up for the people of Poplar & Limehouse.”McDonnell expressed his concern for his colleagues who remained suspended. He wrote on X: “Pleased my colleagues got [the] whip back but disappointed Zarah & Apsana haven’t yet. Relaxed about my own position as I’ve made clear I don’t expect [the] whip back until we know whether police are to charge me following a recent Palestinian demo after which I was interviewed under caution.”Sources told the Guardian that several of the MPs who were due to have their suspensions reviewed after six months were not expected to have the whip restored at the same time as whips continued to deem them “troublemakers”.One Labour source said that several of those who were suspended had been “making it worse for themselves” in recent weeks.The trickle of Labour whip restorations is understood to be a warning to New Labour backbenchers from the leadership that there were rules to be followed, and if they did not follow them they would be punished.A party source had said Burgon, McDonnell and Sultana were seen as agitators after their suspensions since they had broken their agreement to vote with the government. They had also criticised Labour policy including on arms exports to Israel and scrapping the winter fuel allowance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Where are you?”“This is a dictatorship in the making,” Ed Markey, a senator from Massachusetts, told the crowd. “This is an example” of what theTrump administrationcan do to agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), he said.“We are the moral force of the world,” Markey said. “The only way to take back our government is to take to the streets by the millions to demand justice, not just for our country but for people around the world.”Deaths predicted amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s shutdown of USAidRead moreNearly all of USAid’s work, which includes preventing HIV and famine as well as rebuilding nations after conflict and improving education, was halted unexpectedly on 24 January for a 90-day review.Experts say the erasure of the agency is a test run for the Trump administration, which has also put agencies such as theDepartment of Educationand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in its crosshairs.“This is showing that you can do a slash-and-burn to the American governmental apparatus, including foreign aid,” Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of the non-profit Partners in Health, told the Guardian.While USAid has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, it’s now a target for conservatives. But Mukherjee said that nothing about aid work had changed in Washington.“I think the fidelity to Trump changed,” she said.

The Argentinian was one of three Latin American presidents to attend Trump’s inauguration at the Capitol, alongside El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele and Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa.‘Financial suffocation’: Argentina’s medics fear impact of Milei’s chainsaw cutsRead moreTokatlian cautioned that Milei might be overestimating what Trump has to offer in return. “Argentina has so many vulnerabilities. Does this government think it will solve them by getting closer to Washington? Washington has shown it doesn’t care much whether it’s a friend, an enemy, a partner, or not,” he said.“It’s worth remembering that, in his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on Argentina for steel and aluminium … He doesn’t care if you’re an ally or an opponent. Trump will continue with his style,” said Tokatlian.Since taking office,Milei has implemented a series of austerity measures in state healthcare, the latest of which included 1,400 layoffs at the ministry of health in January – among them, 30% of the vaccine directorate staff, and 40% of the HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis response directorate team.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsArgentinaWorld Health OrganizationTrump administrationAmericasHealthDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He declined to rule out sending US troops to make it happen.“The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative,” the president told a joint press conference with the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House on Tuesday evening. “It’s right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down.”1:44Trump suggests displaced Palestinians in Gaza be 'permanently' resettled somewhere else – videoArguing that Palestinians could live out their lives in “peace and harmony” elsewhere, Trump continued: “The US will take over theGazaStrip and we will do a job with it, too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.“If it’s necessary, we’ll do that, we’re going to take over that piece, we’re going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it’ll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.”Later, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio,wrote in a post on X: “The United States stands ready to lead and Make Gaza Beautiful Again. Our pursuit is one of lasting peace in the region for all people.”The announcement followed a surprise proposal from Trump, a property developer, earlier on Tuesday for thepermanent resettlementin neighbouring countries of the 2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza.mapHe called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians from Gaza, saying they had no alternative but to abandon the coastal strip, which must be rebuilt after nearly 16 months of a devastating war between Israel and Hamas militants.Trump said he would support resettling Palestinians “permanently”, going beyond his previous suggestions that Arab leaders have already steadfastly rejected.But he offered no specifics on how a resettlement process could be implemented. His proposal echoed the wishes of Israel’s far right and contradicted Joe Biden’s commitment against the mass displacement of Palestinians.Welcome to Trumpworld, where the developer-in-chief sees dollar signs in the rubble of GazaRead moreAt the press conference, in which hundreds of journalists crowded into the east room, the president was asked if the plan might involve US military force. “As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary,” he said. “If it’s necessary, we’ll do that.”He did not directly respond to a question of how and under what authority the US could take over the land of Gaza and occupy it in the long term.“I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East,” he went on, claiming that he had spoken to regional leaders and they supported the idea. “Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land,” he said.“I’ve studied this very closely over a lot of months,” Trump added, describing Gaza as a “hellhole” and “symbol of death and destruction”. He said Palestinians there should be housed in “various domains” in other countries and expressed hope that the leaders of Egypt and Jordan would “open their hearts” to the idea over time.Pressed on who would live in a redeveloped Gaza, Trump said it could become a home to “the world’s people”, adding: “I don’t want to be cute, I don’t want to be a wise guy – but the Riviera of the Middle East … This could be something that could be so valuable, this could be so magnificent.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing.There was a chorus of criticism within the US. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American member of Congress, said: “Palestinians aren’t going anywhere. This president can only spew this fanatical bullshit because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing. It’s time for my two-state solution colleagues to speak up.”Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator for Maryland, commented: “Trump’s proposal to push 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza and take ‘ownership’ by force, if necessary, is simply ethnic cleansing by another name.“This declaration will give ammunition to Iran and other adversaries while undermining our Arab partners in the region. It defies decades of bipartisan American support for a two-state solution ... Congress must stand up to this dangerous and reckless scheme.”The Council on American Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group, said in a statement: “Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people, not the United States, and President Trump’s call to expel Palestinians from their land is an absolute non-starter.“If the Palestinian people were ever somehow forcibly expelled from Gaza, this crime against humanity would spark widespread conflict, put the final nail in the coffin of international law, and destroy what remains of our nation’s international image and standing.”Paul O’Brien, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, added: “Removing all Palestinians from Gaza is tantamount to destroying them as a people. Gaza is their home. Gaza’s death and destruction is a result of the government of Israel killing civilians by the thousands, often with US bombs.”The Saudi government stressed its rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians from their land and said it would not establish relations with Israel without establishment of a Palestinian state. The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations said that world leaders and people should respect Palestinians’ desire to remain in Gaza.Hamas condemned Trump’s calls for Palestinians in Gaza to leave as “expulsion from their land”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day.The order, which is likely to face legal challenges, calls for “immediate enforcement” nationwide. It threatens to cut off federal funding for any school that allows trans women or girls to compete in female-designated sporting competitions.The order would affect only a small number of athletes. The president of the National Collegiate Athletics Association told a Senate panel in December he was aware of fewer than 10 trans athletes among the 520,000 competing at 1,100 member schools.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead moreAthlete Ally, a non-profit athletic advocacy group, released astatement in responseto the order, saying: “Our hearts break for the trans youth who will no longer be able to know the joy of playing sports as their full and authentic selves.“We’ve known this day was likely to occur for a long time, as this administration continues to pursue simple solutions to complex issues, often resulting in animus towards the most marginalized communities in our country.”This latest attack on trans rights follows a sequence of controversial mandates by the Trump administration. During his first day in office, Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to define sex as “only male or female”based on reproductive cellsand for it to be reflected on all official documents such as passports.Last week, he signed an executive order prohibiting gender transition for peopleunder the age of 19. It included gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers, the use of hormones such as estrogen or testosterone, and surgical procedures.Trump has also taken aim at Biden’s orders to combat gender discrimination. Last month, Trumpsigned an ordercalled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” that instructs the federal government to remove “all radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following Trump’s orders, several hospitals across the USstopped providing carefor transgender youth.Prisons have likewiseisolated transgender womenin custody, telling them that they will be transferred to men’s prisons after losing access to gender-affirming medical treatments.Olivia Hunt, of the group Advocates for Trans Equality,toldBritain’s Sky News: “For the past two weeks the trans community across the United States has seen unending attacks from this administration on all aspects of our rights and daily lives. And seeing this attack, like the others, knowing it’s going to be very long on hostile rhetoric and inflammatory language and very short on clear, actionable policies, it’s always very concerning … especially when it’s targeted at a relatively small and already marginalized community across the country.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationTransgenderUS sportsDonald TrumpLGBTQ+ rightsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was assassinated in the property in 1975. Hasina later turned the home into a museum.View image in fullscreenThe house is one of several symbols associated with Hasina which have been attacked by her critics.Photograph: Mahmud Hossain Opu/APSince she fled the country, some of her supporters have tried to gather there but have been attacked by Hasina’s critics, who have targeted other symbols of her government and party since the uprising, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.On Wednesday, some protesters threatened to “bulldoze” the building if the former prime minister went ahead with her speech, which marked the start of a month-long protest programme by her Awami League political party. The party is trying to gain support amid allegations of attacks on its members and other Hasina backers.As Hasina began speaking, protesters stormed the house and started dismantling the brick walls, later bringing a crane and an excavator to demolish the building.“They do not have the power to destroy the country’s independence with bulldozers. They may destroy a building, but they won’t be able to erase the history,” Hasina said in response during her speech, even as the demolition continued.She also called on the people of Bangladesh to resist the country’s new leaders and alleged that they took power by “unconstitutional” means.Hasnat Abdullah, a student leader, had warned media outlets against Hasina’s speech and announced on Facebook: “Tonight Bangladesh will be freed from the pilgrimage site of fascism.”Many of the protesters chanted slogans demanding Hasina’s execution for hundreds of deaths during last year’s uprising against her. The uprising was among the country’s worst unrest since independence. Hasina urged a UN investigation into the deaths.They also chanted slogans criticising India. An interim government in Bangladesh led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunushas sought Hasina’s extradition but India has not responded.The country’s leading English-language publication, the Daily Star, reported early on Thursday that a wave of attacks overnight targeted several houses and businesses belonging to Hasina’s Awami League supporters.The interim government, which has been struggling to maintain order and prevent mob justice against Hasina’s supporters, has accused the former prime minister of widespread corruption and human rights abuses during her rule, which began in 2009.Hasina’s Awami League in turn has accused the Yunus-led government of violating human rights and suppressing Bangladesh’s minority groups, which authorities have denied.While New York-based Human Rights Watch has hailed the interim government’s reforms measures, it cited “a disturbing pattern of security force abuses” that has reemerged after Hasina’s ousting, this time targeting Awami League supporters, including journalists.In a report last month, the group said that police are again arbitrarily detaining people and filing mass criminal complaints against unnamed individuals, which allows the police to intimidate and threaten virtually anyone with arrest.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSheikh HasinaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Police did not confirm his identity but said the suspect had no known connection to criminal gangs. There was nothing, they said, to suggest he had acted on ideological grounds.“We still believe that it is a one-man operation. We will return to the exact motives,” said Eid Forest.Lars Bröms, the police’s head of operations for identification work, later said he hoped that all the victims would be identified within 48 hours but that in some cases they were still trying to reach the relatives.1:19'Extremely shocked': Swedish king pays tribute to victims of Örebro shooting – videoThe Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson; his justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer; and King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia visited the site of the school in Örebro on Wednesday afternoon, where they laid flowers, before attending a remembrance service.“It’s horrible. It’s hard to take in the vastness,” he said, urging people not to speculate. “In time, we will get the answers, and then we can also draw conclusions.”Eid Forest said the reason it took so long to inform the public about the death toll was the size of the school premises. “It took a very long time to search and ensure that we didn’t have any more injuries,” he said.1:26Multiple people dead in 'worst mass shooting' in Swedish history – video reportJonas Claesson, the director of health and medical services for the Örebro region, said five of the six people admitted to hospital had initially life-threatening gunshot wounds and were now stable after undergoing surgery. Two of them were being treated in intensive care. A sixth person had minor injuries. Four were women and two, men.Police urged anybody who was at the school on Tuesday or had footage of the attack to come forward. They asked the public to share only confirmed information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everyone stands behind them. This is a terrible experience that Sweden has had to go through.”The queen admitted she was “finding it a little bit difficult to talk”, saying: “I have a big wish for the whole of the Swedish people. Where did the beautiful Sweden go? I really want to ask everyone to help build it up again. To strengthen, I don’t want to say the reputation, but the name. What it means to be Swedish.”Johanna Sollerman, who works in crime strategy in the municipality and is a crisis manager, said it was in the process of setting up centres around the city where victims’ families and members of the community could speak to social workers, members of the Red Cross and representatives of churches and mosques.“We’re going to live with this as a mark for a very long time. However, what we are starting to see is civil society together with the municipality and police really rallying around for citizens of Örebro,” she said.She said Campus Risbergska mostly ran education courses for adults, including for those learning Swedish, training in professions such as nursing, and studying to go to university.Schools in the municipality had been training and practising for how to stop such an incident, she said. “For a few years now we’ve been training on how schools should act to stop a lone actor. We’ve been training in that because we know it can happen.”The municipality had taken a proactive approach to mapping criminals and gangs, she said, but “this kind of situation is very difficult for us to detect”.Pia Rizell, a spokesperson for Sweden’s teachers union Sveriges Lärare and a Örebro resident, said everyone was deeply shocked. “This is the deadliest mass shooting we have had in our history and it’s at a school, where you should be safe as a teacher and as a student,” she said.The shooting is already prompting some headteachers to question security in Swedish schools, which are often on open campuses. Marcus Hedström, the principal of Tunaskolan in Luleå, said he was looking at keeping the school doors permanently locked and installing cameras. “The principal and management have the responsibility to ensure that the school is a safe place. If that means we need to lock the doors, then we will do so,” he told SVT.Kersti Freed-Klermar, a spokesperson for Swedish Peace and Arbitration Association in Örebro, joined crowds outside St Nicolai church. Although polarisation has been on the rise in Sweden, she said she felt a strong sense of unity there. “It created a feeling that we need to care about each other,” she said. “Light is better than hate.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We want peace,” Jacqueline Ngengele, one of those who attended, told AFP.The president of DRC, Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, are due to attend a joint summit of the eight-country East African Community and 16-member Southern African Development Community in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam on Saturday.A day earlier, the UN Human Rights Council will convene a special session on the crisis, at the DRC’s request.Fears the violence could lead to a wider conflict have galvanised regional bodies, mediators such as Angola and Kenya, as well as the UN, EU and other countries in diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution.But the DRC’s top diplomat accused the international community of being all talk and no action on the conflict.“We see a lot of declarations but we don’t see actions,” foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner told journalists in Brussels.Wary of the crisis spilling over,several neighbouring countries have already said they are bolstering their defences.A UN expert report said last year that Rwanda had up to 4,000 troops in the DRC, seeking to profit from its vast mineral wealth, and that Rwanda has “de facto” control over the M23.The eastern DRC has deposits of coltan, a metallic ore that is vital in making phones and laptops, as well as gold and other minerals.Rwanda has never explicitly admitted to military involvement in support of the M23 and alleges that the DRC supports and shelters the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The two groups of families had proposed asettlementthat would guarantee the Texas families a 25% share of Jones’s future payments to the Sandy Hook families, with the Connecticut families taking 75%.Speaking in court on Wednesday, Lopezsaid: “At its core, this is something I can’t approve.”Lopez said the families and Jones’s bankruptcy trustee could resolve the issue in state court or return with another settlement proposal,according toCourthouse News Service.“What this debtor needs, and what these families need, is finality in bankruptcy so they can pursue their remedies in state court, which is where they started,” the outlet reported Lopez as saying.Lopez said he blocked the settlement because the families were asking him to divide up assets of Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Jones’s website Infowars, which was dismissed from bankruptcy last June.In statements prior to Lopez’s order, Jones bankruptcy lawyers, according to theConnecticut Post, said: “The actual goal of this settlement motion is to grab the dividend money before the appellate courts make a decision in the pending appeals, so that if the judgments are reversed there will be no way that Alex Jones may recoup those funds.”Lawyers representing the Sandy Hook familiessaid: “The proposed settlement explicitly does not impair Jones’s right to continue appealing the judgments rendered in the state court … The proposed settlement represents a major breakthrough in this case, resolving the allowed claim amounts of (Jones’) largest creditors – the Sandy Hook families – and paving the way for the trustee to begin making interim distributions.”Lopez’s decision on Wednesday follows his decision last December to block the Onion, a parody news site, from buying Infowars,arguingthat a bankruptcy auction did not result in the best possible bids.Just days prior to Lopez’s ruling over the Onion’s auction in December, a Connecticut state appellate courtuphelda $965m verdict from 2022 against Jones, who filed for personal bankruptcy that same year.Following the 2012 shooting, which killed 20 children and six educators in Newton,Connecticut, Jones repeatedly told his followers that the tragedy was staged by “crisis actors” who were looking to enact stricter gun policies.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS school shootingsNewtown shootingConnecticutTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

The family of one plaintiff saidher life would be threatened if she were moved.The judge said there were only 16 trans women housed in women’s facilities, and the rulingapplies to all of them.On 26 January, a federal judge in Boston issued a restraining order in a separate challenge to the same executive order. That order was limited to one transgender woman in a woman’s prison.John Robinson, an attorney for the justice department, has argued that prison officials have “broad discretion” to decide where to place inmates.Last week, trans women across US prisonsshared accounts of a brutal crackdownfollowing Trump’s order, reporting that they had been placed in solitary confinement awaiting transfers, lost access to healthcare and were harassed and taunted by guards.Staff at Federal Medical Center (FMC) Carswell, a US women’s prison in Texas that houses people with special medical needs, took swift actions within days of the new administration, attorneys said. One resident reported that officers went to trans women’s cells one by one and ordered them out.“The officers yelled at these women: ‘Come right now, leave your things. You don’t have time to pack,’” said the resident, who witnessed the interactions and requested anonymity. “The officials were degrading them and saying disgusting things, like: ‘We don’t have to call you women anymore. Where you’re going, you’re going to be a man.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His remarkson his social media site, Truth Socialrepresent the clearest sign that Trump is willing to hold talks with Iran to try to replace the nuclear deal signed in 2015, but from which Trump pulled the US out in 2018.He said he did not mind whether he rang the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to start the talks or the Iranian leader initiated the process. He also said: “There are many people at the top ranks ofIranthat do not want to have a nuclear weapon.” He also predicted “we will have a big celebration in the Middle East the day the deal is signed”.Trump’s social media posting came after he held talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and also signed a presidential memorandum that instructs the US Treasury and state department to implement a campaign aimed at “driving Iran’s oil exports to zero”.He also pointedly contradicted a reporter, saying he regarded Iran as strong, remarks that undercut Netanyahu’s claim that the parlous state of Iranian defences make it an opportune time to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites. Netanyahu has long argued with successive US presidents that Iran is bent on covertly building a nuclear weapon.Trump’s remarks will provoke bitter divisions within Iran about whether an agreement to constrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions will ever lead to a lifting of sanctions.Pezeshkian responded to the threat of maximum economic sanctions by saying: “With the reserves we have, we can solve the country’s problems. We are a powerful country. Our reserves and resources are exceptional in the world.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, claimed maximum pressure was a failed experiment, and trying it again would lead to another failure.But he added: “If Trump’s main issue is that Iran does not pursue nuclear weapons, that is achievable and there is no problem.”Araghchi said: “Iran’s positions are clear, it is a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, adding there was a leadership fatwa preventing Iran from building nuclear weapons.The foreign ministry has been trying to prepare the domestic ground for opening talks with Trump for weeks, but knows there is a large faction opposed to engaging with the US, even if it means economic sanctions weigh the economy down.Trump portrayed himself as a man that had signed the presidential memorandum against Iran reluctantly, adding he hoped the measures would never need to be used. He said at the signing ceremony: “So this is one that I am torn about. I am signing this, but I am unhappy to do it.” A memorandum has less force in law than an executive order.Iranian officials argued that the US attempt to weaken Iran’s already heavily sanctioned economy would be hard to achieve since the bulk of Iranian revenue comes through the export of oil to China, often via intermediaries.The imposition of extra sanctions was seen as a bargaining chip before negotiations on a nuclear deal akin to the imposition of tariffs on other countries.So far the Iranian foreign ministry has led in the two rounds of talks in Geneva with the three European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal: France, Germany and the UK. Europe has warned that it will move to reapply UN sanctions in September if a new deal is not agreed by then to replace the 2015 deal that expires this year.Nothing in what Trump said gave any clue as to the kind of assurances the US would need to reach a deal, and to be sure Iran has no intent to build a nuclear bomb. He did not indicate the US would be seeking a wider deal with Iran that seeks to constrain its support for proxy forces in the region.Iran has slashed the access UN weapons inspectors have to Iran’s nuclear sites. Both the UN inspectorate, the IAEA and the European countries have said it is possible Iran has acquired irreversible knowledge on how to build nuclear weapons.Ismail Baghaei, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “The claim that Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons is a big lie that has been proven wrong many times, and if someone is looking for certainty about such an issue, it is easily obtainable.”He added that unlike Israel “which is not a member of any international treaty banning weapons of mass destruction and explicitly threatened to use nuclear weapons in the war against the people of Gaza, the Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the non-proliferation treaty and Iran’s nuclear programme is under the full supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with safeguards agreements. Basically, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers weapons of mass destruction to be haram [forbidden] for solid Islamic and humanitarian reasons.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsIran nuclear dealUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think so. If there have been alliances, it’s because of the threat from the far right. We need this united front of a united and popular left,” he said.Bayrou’s travails are not over. He will use article 49.3 to push through two more social security bills in the next week, prompting two more censure motions from LFI.The PS has said it intends to lodge its own no-confidence motion, possibly next week, over Bayrou’s comment – deemed xenophobic by many – that the French were “feeling submerged by immigration”.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronMarine Le PennewsShareReuse this content"

I went to a wedding and could hear bombs and alarms going off’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 5 Feb 2025 10.22 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 10.24 ESTShareIgrew up in Ahvaz, a city inIranthat’s close to the border with Iraq, during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88. I have a memory of going to a wedding party as a child and hearing bombs and alarms – I didn’t fully understand what was happening, or why the bride looked nervous, but there was a paradoxical feeling of still wanting to spend our time in the happiness of that moment.This photograph reconstructs that memory. It was shot at a location used for making movies about the war: a huge place in the desert where they have all the necessary props. Getting permission wasn’t easy but I wanted to tell my story there, sketching normal life events – weddings, birthdays, Iranian new year – into a war zone. The series, from 2008, is titled Today’s Life and War, and it reflects my interest in the relationship between war and everyday life. I often explore themes of displacement, survival and human resilience in my work. Creating this series helped me process the emotions and memories of growing up in wartime. Many people who lived through it told me they connected to these images because they show struggle and survival.While my generation grew up with nonstop images of the war in magazines, newspapers and television, at the same time life continued. The couple appear numb, expressionless – as if they cannot imagine what their future will look like.When you go to the bazaar and ask for tea, they might answer by reciting a poem. Poetry is everywhere in IranTraditional Iranian art makes use of the imagination. Iranian artists believe God already made what exists, so we don’t need to make it again. My photography is a response to that tradition. I want to make something, not take something. But my compositions and references draw on archive documentary photography of the conflict – the images I grew up with – which I return to for inspiration.I mix my story with real life and the poetry that is everywhere in my country. When you go to the bazaar and ask for tea, they don’t say whether they have it or they don’t, but they might instead answer by reciting a Persian poem by Saadi or Hafez. We all have this connection with the poetic and I wanted to bring it into my photography.My most recent work is about the cypress tree: collage works with Polaroids, manipulated with silver and gold leaf, connecting the tree’s symbolism in Iran with the stories of the poetFerdowsi’s 10th-century epic, Shahnameh. The cypress tree is strong; it stands even when it is dead and symbolises freedom and eternity. It encourages us to remain grounded, by drawing upon our heritage as a source of resilience.When I was a student, the artist and film-makerMitra Tabriziangave a talk at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran. She inspired me to tell my story through photography, and to address social issues in my work. When I had a solo exhibition in the Photographers’ Gallery in London two years ago, she came to see it.I chose photography because images can tell powerful stories without words. I hope my photographs make people think, feel and remember important moments in history. The best feedback is when people enjoy my photographs enough to write to me. In my work, I try to show how people continue to live, love and hope even in difficult times.Gohar Dashti’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Ahvaz, Iran, 1980.Trained:Photography at the University of Art, Tehran.Influences:“The nature and landscapes of Iran and the US have deeply inspired my work.

And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It’s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sofía said is inexcusable.”When asked if he has spoken to her since, he responded: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to. She is in a self-destructive approach that I can’t interfere in, and I really don’t understand why she’s continuing.”Since the tweets were discoveredlast week, Gascón has been on the attack with multiple statements and an hour-long interview. While she has admitted to being “deeply sorry” she has also called out a “campaign of hate and misinformation” that has led to her being “harassed”.“She’s really playing the victim,” Audiard said. “She’s talking about herself as a victim, which is surprising. It’s as if she thought that words don’t hurt.”After its Cannes premiere, the crime musicalEmilia Pérezwas picked up by Netflix and since became the most nominated non-English language film of all time at the Oscars, scoring 13 nods including for Gascón as best actress. She became the first out transgender actor to be nominated.View image in fullscreenZoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/APWhileNetflixhas yet to make an official comment, it has been reported that the streamer is trying to push Gascón out of any remaining campaign advertising and event appearances.The Hollywood Reporter’s Scott Feinberg hasclaimedthat “tensions are said to be high” between the actor and Netflix and that she will not be flying to Los Angeles for a long list of events and ceremonies this week anymore.Audiard has said that while he will still participate in events, “there is a sadness” now attached to proceedings.In the same interview, he also spoke again aboutcriticisms from many in Mexicoover the film being viewed as an inauthentic depiction made by foreigners. “What shocked me is that either people haven’t seen the film properly, or they haven’t seen it at all and are acting in bad faith,” he said before later adding: “This is an opera, not a criticism of anything about Mexico.”Gascón’s co-star Zoe Saldaña, who is the favourite to win best supporting actress for her performance, has also sinceaddressedGascón’s tweets. “It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it], and I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group,” she said at an event last week. “I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.”In some of the many tweets that were unearthed, Gascón called Islam “a hotbed for infection for humanity that urgently need to be cured” and spoke of diversity turning theOscarsinto an “ugly” cross between “an Afro-Korean festival” and a “Black Lives Matter demonstration”.The Oscars will take place on 2 March.Explore more on these topicsEmilia PérezJacques AudiardOscarsAwards and prizesNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For months now I have been in the thrall ofPokémon Trading Card Pocket. It’s a devilishly slick blend of card-collecting and pared-down battling that has had me obediently opening the app on my phone at least twice a day since it launched. The virtual cards are beautifully done; the rare art cards especially, with their pastoral scenes of Pokémon in their natural habitats. I have spent many hours on the battles, too, honing decks and chasing win streaks to earn myself victory emblems. I got most of my friends into it, anticipating the day when its makers at DeNa would finally enable trading so I could fill the last couple of holes in my collection.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This week, on the day that the trading went live and an expansion full of pretty new cards was introduced, I quit. I made a couple of trades for the Venosaur Ex and Machamp Ex that had evaded my grasp despite openinghundredsof packs, took a screenshot of the “collection complete” screen, and I haven’t opened it since. I’m done.I didn’t quit in protest at thefiddly, expensive natureof the new trading feature, or because the new cards mostly feature monsters from an era of Pokémon that holds no nostalgic power for me. I’ve just suddenly had enough. I was enjoying every minute I spent with the game … until I wasn’t. Usually, you know you’re done with a game when you’ve finished it, but in this era of the forever game, we have tochoosewhen to quit. Sometimes this happens overnight for me. One day I’m enjoying a game, the next day I’m sick of it.Inconveniently, I realise it about 75% of the way through a game’s campaign. Especially with open-world titles, the best hours are the ones in the middle, where you’ve played enough to understand a game’s unique ideas and systems butnotenough to have totally mastered them; there comes a point where you know you’re nearing the endgame. Suddenly, the friction between me and the game world – the “stickiness”, as game designers refer to it – is gone, and everything feels smooth and easy, and I lose interest. (This is why I loveFromSoftware’s games so much: from Dark Souls to Elden Ring – they never get easy or predictable.)View image in fullscreenEnough is enough … Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.Photograph: Games PressHere is a small selection of games from the past year that I abandoned in this way, not long before the end:Indiana Jones and the Great Circle; Dragon’s Dogma 2; Paper Mario: the Thousand-Year Door; Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom; Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. I could sit down with any of these for a couple of evenings and polish them off – some of them I already have, months after leaving them unfinished – but it always feels like a chore. Meanwhile, I’ve played Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders,Balatroand Hades long past their completion points, because the stickiness is still there.I often get readers writing to ask when it’s OK to quit a game. For me, the answer is “whenever you stop having fun”. I rarely quit because I get stuck; instead I quit when Istopgetting stuck, when I sense I’ve seen everything meaningful that a game has to offer. I think it’s easy to keep playing something that’s lost its appeal out of a sense of obligation.Studies of trophy and achievement stats over the years have found that onlybetween 15-35% of players(pdf) actually complete any given game. I feel for the developers making hours of content that people might never see, but there is just so much entertainment available to everyone that you can hardly blame people for not finding the time for all of it. Some players take pride in finishing every game that they start, but for the rest of us? It’s OK to stop.I felt briefly bereft when I was done withPokémonTrading Card Game, the same feeling I get when I finish a good novel. Part of me also felt relieved to be freed of the daily habit. It’s opened a little space in my day for something new – and something new isalwayswhat I’m looking for when I pick up a video game.What to playView image in fullscreenLife ruiningly compulsive … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesTwo enormous, time-eating historical games are out this week:Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a pitilessly challenging simulation of 16th-century Bohemia that really rubs your face into the horse dung at the start, andCivilization VII, the next in the venerable, life-ruiningly compulsive strategy series that challenges you to rerun human history from the start.

The Idaho law “goes even further than previous laws by removing classic books from public libraries in addition to schools”, said Dan Novack, associate general counsel at Penguin Random House.HB 710’s definition of “harmful” materials is “vague and overbroad”, says the lawsuit. The law allows private citizens to file complaints, putting librarians “in the untenable position of having to guess whether any member of the public might file an objection to a book whose message they disagree with” by claiming the text falls within the law’s definition of harmful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Now under-18s cannot enter the library without their parent or guardian completing a three-part waiver.“Our programming – which includes the only option for after-school care in Donnelly – has been severely impacted, with children unable to step inside the building to use the bathroom or keep warm without a complex waiver,” said the library’s director, Sherry Scheline.Scheline added: “Our circulation has also declined significantly.” There was a 42.8% fall in materials checked out from the library in the six weeks after the introduction of the legislation, compared with the previous year.Since the law took effect, titles moved to adult-only sections or removed from libraries entirely include A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou and Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut.Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingLibrariesnewsShareReuse this content"

It’sBear Gryllsof course, not a real bear. I mention that upfront just in case, like me, your heart leapt in anticipation when the title Celebrity Bear Hunt flashed up on your screen. Exactlywhichminor celebs were envisioned screaming and flailing through undergrowth pursued by an ursine foe hungry for buffed, botoxed flesh will have been different for each of us – but what a vision indeed!No doubt the day will come, and sooner than we think, when such entertainment is a standard part of the TV schedules. Until then, I’ve got to tell you: this is a remarkably full-blooded substitute. Only two episodes were available for review but by the end of them we’ve had, under the broiling Costa Rican jungle sun, boats sinking in crocodile-filled waters, two captures in camouflage nets, ravine crossings, snakes, and earnest discussions about making sure to do your daily poo before the next challenge so you can bomb along with as little hindrance as possible. The 12 celebs are divided into teams and, as soon as one of them splits from their pack, Bear – yes! – leaps out of the undergrowth, rugby-tackles them to the ground, trusses them up and leaves them in the sun to die. No, all right, not the last bit – he goes and collects them later – but the rest is true and excellent. I haven’t had this much fun watching a reality TV competition since the earliest days of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me out of Here!.View image in fullscreen‘Unusually good value’ … Mel B tries not to sink in Celebrity Bear Hunt.Photograph: Tom Dymond/NetflixAnyone who fails a challenge and gets rugby-tackled and tied up by Grylls (of the dozen contestants, only Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen makes the “I usually have to pay extra for this” joke and I admire him and the other 11 participants for it) has to undergo a second challenge, this time in the Bear Pit – an even more croc-filled, snake-stuffed and booby-trapped section of the jungle surrounded by giant palisades that really should have got separate billing. Anyone who fails that challenge is eligible to be thrown out of the game at Bear’s behest. In tones more of sorrow than anger – as befits the Chief Scout who is only there to help you become your best self – he will explain how they were undone by their lack of situational awareness, and that the helicopter is on its way to return them to their shameful little half-lives of ease and comfort.The celebrities are unusually good value. As well as LLB, there’s exuberant, forthright Mel B happily taking menopause advice from the inordinately charming Shirley Ballas. There’s actor Joe Thomas, quiet, anxious (“the biggest thing I’ve ever had to survive is a stressful meeting”) and homesick, whose transformation in the second episode is a rare delight – which is to say it is both unexpected and convincing. There is loudly bonhomous rapper and chef Big Zuu, who loves to lead though without any idea of what the psychological or physical qualities needed to do it well might be. When Grylls suggests that the much-vaunted situational awareness can be likened to moving through the forest like a deer, he protests – loudly, albeit correctly – “I’m not a deer-y man!”View image in fullscreen‘Remarkably full-blooded’ … Big Zuu in Celebrity Bear Hunt.Photograph: Tom Dymond/NetflixLottie Moss (“I’m best known for being Kate Moss’s sister. Or a model”) provides the tearful vulnerability quotient. She was apparently about to re-enter rehab when this opportunity presented itself instead. I’m sure that’s fine. I’m sure that’s absolutely fine. Making up the quieter portion of the signings are journalist and TV host Steph McGovern, retired rugby player Danny Cipriani – a surprisingly soothing presence – plus singer Una Healy, model Leomie Anderson and former Wimbledon champion and more recent jailbird Boris Becker, whose picture should be in every dictionary under the word “phlegmatic”. Yes, he has made mistakes that “cost me dearly”. No, he will not be sharing any stories from his231 days in prison– they were terrible and he has accepted what he did and then you move on. No, he never got stressed before tennis matches because he always had control of his mind. No, he was not shocked to win Wimbledon at 17 because “you are too young to know you are not supposed to do it”. It’s possibly my imagination but the whole jungle appears to still when he speaks. Apart from Big Zuu.Oh, and I nearly forgot –Holly Willoughbyis presenting, but is so extraneous to proceedings that I nearly forgot she was there. Anyway, Netflix has overall done its job well. Celebrity Bear Hunt is fast, the contestants are surprisingly funny and the jeopardy – if the third episode’s trailer and tabloid reports of the injuries and near-misses during filming are anything to go by – is real. Or at least more real than usual. The trap is set and I suspect viewers will take the bait in droves.Celebrity Bear Hunt is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsReality TVTV reviewTelevisionBear GryllsHolly WilloughbyBoris BeckerreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Can a hot clothes horse really change your life, let alone dry your washing as fast as a tumble dryer for a fraction of the cost and with none of the noise? I needed to be convinced, so I put 14 bestsellers through their paces with my soggy washing to find out whether they’re the best thing in laundry since the clothes peg – or destined for the loft.At a glanceWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products from Sky boxes to mattress toppers, and it’s made me professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically solve domestic problems. I also have a solid background in procrastinating by doing laundry, hanging laundry and folding laundry, so I couldn’t resist the Guardian’s offer to pay me to watch clothes dry.View image in fullscreenWe tested the temperature of the heated clothes airers with an infrared thermometer.Photograph: Jane HoskynHow I testedHeated airers all do much the same thing in much the same way. There are small differences in design – some have triangle frames, some are winged, and some have covers – but they’re basically all clothes horses that you plug in. I had to find clear distinctions between them, and this chiefly meant devising fair, quantifiable tests to measure how quickly, evenly and cheaply each airer dried clothes.The key test was a half-hourly laundry weigh-in to measure how quickly each airer dried an identical load. Actually, two identical loads – one small (4kg) and one big (8kg) – 14 times, once for every airer. I removed and weighed the clothes every 30 minutes to see how much moisture had evaporated until the fabric was dry, and this gave me an overall drying time. Room temperature remained at a steady 19-20C throughout. For more behind-the-scenes insights into weighing knickers, check outthe Filter’s newsletter.I took other measurements too, not least to give me something (anything) to do while the laundry dried, such as the dimensions of each airer and the length of its heated bars. I used an infrared thermometer to take the bars’ temperature every 30 seconds to compare heat-up times, and a wattage meter to check power usage. I then used the January 2025 default tariff (24.86p a kWh, but rounded up to 25p here) to work out running costs an hour.Some brands didn’t want the airers I’d tested returned, so those were donated to two organisations that do important work in and around Southampton. The first isScratch, which provides services and furniture for families and individuals experiencing poverty, and the other isStop Domestic Abuse, a charity offering support for survivors of abuse and stalking.Here’s my guide to the 10 best heated clothes airers based on my tests.The best heated clothes airers in2025View image in fullscreen‘The most efficient barred airer I tested’: the Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer.Photograph: Jane HoskynBest overall:Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and coverView image in fullscreenThis airer is for anyone who’s fed up with choosing between the expense of a noisy tumble dryer, the mess of clothes on radiators, and the rank stink of laundry slowly drying on a conventional clothes horse. With its ventilated heat-retaining cover in place, it’s the most efficient barred airer I tested.Why we love itLakeland’s Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer arrives ready to use. It took me only two minutes to unfold the tiers, position the cover, plug in the cable and switch it on. The airer is a handsome chrome rack on its own, but the light grey embroidered cover makes the whole thing look rather gorgeous.The bars warmed up faster than most of its rivals, reaching 27C within 30 seconds before maxing out at 50C. When I laid a 4kg load of damp T-shirts across them and closed the cover, the lot was dry in two hours. That’s no faster than a tumble dryer, but it’s much more energy-efficient, costing about 8p an hour compared with 50p for my tumble dryer.The Dry:Soon Deluxe has some excellent user-friendly details. In particular, a timer lets you set it to switch off in hourly increments up to 12 hours ahead, which is handy for leaving it on overnight without the risk of forgetting it in the morning. All Lakeland’s airers come with a three-year warranty compared with the basic statutory guarantees for most heated airers.It’s a shame that …this airer costs almost as much as a tumble dryer. Deluxe by name, deluxe by price. But it’s many times cheaper to run, and withenergy costs recently rising, £200+ may be worth spending to keep your bills down.Suitable for:families who want to give up their expensive tumble dryer habitAvailable drying space:21m (up to 36 hanging T-shirts)Dimensions (open):73 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)Dimensions (folded):10 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)Max capacity:15kgTime to dry small load:2 hoursRunning cost:8p/hour£244.98 at Lakeland£199.99 without cover at AmazonBest budget:Black+Decker heated winged clothes airerView image in fullscreenThe Black+Decker doesn’t get particularly hot, which helps if you have curious toddlers and delicate clothes. It still managed to dry my small load of T-shirts in an afternoon, and at £46.99 with a 6p-an-hour running cost, it’s a decent budget buy. It’s also one of the easiest airers to fold down and slip under the sofa when not in use.Why we love itThe Black+Decker winged airer has the smallest footprint in my test, taking up about 50 x 50cm on its beam supports, yet it boasts a capacity of 10kg when unfolded, thanks to its ironing board-style shape. It warmed up to 33C in its hottest spots and dried my small load of T-shirts in just over four hours, with a little help from me flipping them and moving them around.I also like that the wings fold inwards to double up the heat when drying thicker garments, albeit not very large ones, and the dryer is so light (about 3.5kg) that I could move it around using one hand.It’s a shame that …it warmed up slowly and failed to get hotter than 33C even after three hours. That’s great for delicates and damp towels, but not hot enough to dry thick fabrics.Suitable for:drying light fabrics and warming up towelsAvailable drying space:11m (up to 20 hanging T-shirts)Dimensions (open):54 x 148 x 93cm (DWH)Dimensions (folded):approx 54 x 100 x 20cm (DWH)Max capacity:10kgTime to dry small load:4 hours 15 minutesRunning cost:6p/hour£46.99 at Amazon£55 at CurrysBest for fast drying:Minky SureDri heat pod drying systemView image in fullscreenHeat pods turn your old unheated airer into a heated version. This one has a waterproof cover that fits a standard three-tier clothes horse, plus an electric heater that sits underneath to fill the space with hot air.Why we love itMinky’s pod system is a damp-blitzing machine. Even on its lowest 360W setting, it was one of the fastest dryers in my tests, because the heater and cover combo kept in the hot air. I measured the highest setting as using 915W, which cost 23p an hour, and it dried a large 8kg load within three hours. That’s as fast as a tumble dryer, but with less damage to your electric bill, or indeed to your clothes.At £90 the Minky isn’t quite a bargain buy, but I love that it brings hot new life to your existing clothes horse. If the cover doesn’t fit yours, you can use a sheet with the Minky heater unit to much the same effect.It’s a shame that …drying clothes with the Minky is more of a faff than with barred heated airers. First, you have to set up the pod, then you have to put up with the noise. The cover also makes it fiddly to check your clothes while they’re drying.Suitable for:work clothes and school uniforms that need a fast laundry turnaroundAvailable drying space:about 18m, depending on your clothes horseDimensions (heat pod unit):28 x 17 x 33cm (DWH)Max capacity:about 10kgTime to dry small load:1 hour 40 minutes (setting 1); 45mins (setting 3)Running cost:9p/hour (setting 1); 23p/hour (setting 3)£90 at Amazon£90 at ArgosThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Ten T-shirts dried in two hours’: the Dunelm XL 3-tier square heated airer.Photograph: Jane HoskynDunelm XL 3-tier square heated airerView image in fullscreenBest for:a never-ending cycle of laundry that needs constant accessThis huge, uncovered airer lets you get at your washing as it dries, so you can check, rearrange and replace items easily.

After waiting for a re-stock, I finally tested this bargain airer on the coldest days of January, and it performed almost as well as the more widely available Black+Decker winged airer. With the free cover in place and a bit of rearranging halfway through, it dried my small load in just over four hours. It’s a smart pick if you’re short on space because it folds down easily to merely 6cm high for slipping under a bed or chest of drawers when not in use.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not powerful enough to dry a full load on a cold day without resulting in stinky slow-dried clothes, as with the Black+Decker and Argos 3-tier models here.

You can attach peg hangers to dangle your smalls in the heat, but they don’t allow much dangle room. As with all the airers I tested, you get a much quicker dry if you lay items across the bars.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t dry clothes quite as fast as the Dry:Soon Deluxe, and it’s a right old jigsaw to put together the first time you use it.

They’re wildly popular, too: I waited four months to testAldi’s winged heated airerbecause there were none left in the warehouse within days of it going on sale last September. But do they deserve the hype – and how can you get the best out of yours?How much do heated airers cost to run?Minimal running cost is the biggest selling point of heated airers. Their packaging bears promises that they’ll dry your clothes for as little as 6p an hour, dramatically undercutting all rival methods other than blazing sunshine. Really? Yes, in some cases, at least until recent jumps in energy prices piled on the pennies.The latest rise in theenergy price capcame into force on 1 January 2025, hard on the heels of a 10% increase in October. Both price hikes happened after I tested most of the airers – and even then, 6p an hour was a little optimistic. Standard barred airers, running at about 320W, worked out at 7p an hour in September 2024 and 8p an hour now.Most heated airers take a full afternoon or more to dry a load of washing, and those 8p hours will add up. Airers that dry clothes faster, such as the fan-heater-based Minky SureDri and JML DriBuddi, cost more to run. At 1,200W, the DriBuddi now costs about 30p an hour, adding up to more than 60p to dry a load.That’s still significantly cheaper than running a tumble dryer or, indeed, a washing machine. Under January 2025 energy prices, a tumble dryer running at 3kW costs 75p an hour to run, and it can cost even more to switch on the central heating.Can you leave them on all night?An hour or two on a heated airer won’t make a dent in the dampness of your jumpers or thick towels. Overnight would do it – but is it safe? The good news is that a 300W airer uses about the same amount of electricity as a fridge freezer, so yes, you can leave your clothes to dry while you snooze. Gentle warmth in the room is a lovely bonus.But while barred airers are safe to leave on overnight, as confirmed by brands including John Lewis, Lakeland and retailer Direct365, be more cautious with the fan heater type. The 1,200W JML packs about half the wattage (and noise) of a tumble dryer, and I certainly wouldn’t leave one of those on overnight or while I’m out.How can you make clothes dry faster?There are ways you can speed up the drying process. My best tip is to ignore the marketing photos that show airers draped like Christmas trees, with clothes hung from every bar. As I discovered while running this test, your clothes simply won’t dry that way unless it’s a warm day, which rather defeats the point.Covered airers cut drying times by almost half, but you can achieve a similar result by throwing a fitted sheet over the top, as long as there’s a gap for moist air to escape. Whatever cover you use, I’d recommend removing it as soon as your clothes are dry. Covers are vented to avoid condensation, but I found that some moisture crept back in if I left my clothes inside.However powerful your airer, always spin your clothes to remove as much water as possible before laying them on it. Wet clothes won’t dry, and water and electricity are not a happy combination.On that note, don’t use a heated airer in the bathroom. Electric peril aside, bathroom air is notoriously damp. I had the best results when using my test airers in the bedroom with the window ajar – and the faint fabric softener scent was a sweet bedtime bonus.Jane Hoskyn is a freelance consumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decadesof experiencein rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

After experiencing displacement, my parents instilled in me the idea that trust had to be earned; they had seen the risks that come with being vulnerable in a new environment. Being wary of the unfamiliar was their way of ensuring we stayed safe in a world that wasn’t always welcoming.As I got older, their anxieties became my own. I would automatically assume, for example, that someone asking for directions might run off with my phone, or that someone asking for money might scam me.So when a couple approached my friend Esme and I one afternoon, asking if we could witness their wedding, the part of me raised on suspicion flickered into life. But another part – the one I’ve been learning to nurture, that leans into trust and curiosity – told me to say yes.Last year, I took my first trip to Sheffield, where Esme lived. It was sunny and frosty, and from the moment we stepped off the train, strangers spoke to us – making small talk with an openness and warmth I hadn’t expected. But when we were approached by a couple wearing formal clothes as we queued for lunch, it didn’t feel like just another random encounter – it felt like a story waiting to happen.It was just the six of us: two lovers, two friends and two registrars – pairs connected in different waysThe pair seemed frazzled. They explained that they were supposed to be getting married – a low-key, fuss-free wedding, just the two of them – but had missed their first slot at the register office because of delayed trains. They had been able to reschedule, but had no witnesses for the ceremony. Desperately, they asked us if we would like to step in. Caution lingered in the back of my mind, yet the magic of the moment made me forget my training in suspicion.We deliberated. Esme and I were on the same course, but we had only met a couple of months earlier; this was a new level of spontaneity for us. Yet there was something charming about the couple’s sincerity, so we abandoned our plans to spend the afternoon at the cinema and agreed.We arrived at the register office with seconds to spare. The room was simple but warm, with soft lighting and neatly arranged chairs. A small table was adorned with official papers and a bouquet of flowers. It was just the six of us: two lovers, two friends and two registrars – pairs connected in different ways, yet all sharing in the quiet magic of the moment. Even the silence in the room seemed expectant, a kind of reverent pause before the ceremony began. It felt surreal that my friend and I were about to witness something deeply personal and beautiful.View image in fullscreen‘The bride insisted we take her bouquet, but we just took one rose to press.’Photograph: courtesy of Sundus AbdiThe ceremony was quick and intimate, and to my surprise, I teared up on several occasions. The simplicity of it felt profound. As the couple exchanged vows, I quietly reconsidered my tightly held instincts to stay guarded. To me, their wedding symbolised an act of bravery. Trusting complete strangers to witness one of the most significant moments of their lives seemed no small feat – they had no guarantees, just a belief in human kindness, and somehow, that faith had been rewarded.Saying yes was exhilarating. After the ceremony, the bride insisted we take her bouquet, but we felt we couldn’t accept; instead we accepted just one rose to press and keep as a memento.The day also proved to be a pivotal moment in my budding friendship with Esme. I had felt isolated after moving away from my home in Birmingham to study in Leeds, but our impromptu afternoon connected us in a way I hadn’t anticipated.Looking back, I can’t help but think of how my parents might have reacted if I’d told them I was going to be witnessing a couple’s wedding in a town I’d never been to before, with someone I had only recently met. But, ever since, I’ve tried to say yes more often – I haven’t been reckless, but I have made a conscious effort to acknowledge life’s uncertainties and embrace them where possible. I’m less wary of speaking to strangers and making small connections that add a little warmth to the day. I recently befriended someone I met at a comedy show, for instance – striking up a conversation about photography and footwear.It’s easy to live life with a protective layer, but it can lead to solitude. Moments of connection are precious, and I’m learning that sometimes it’s worth taking a risk. You might end up with an interesting anecdote, a cemented friendship – or a pressed rose.Some details have been changedDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In truth, however, it is both: soothingly starchy and deliciously savoury. My take on this classic dish makes no claim to be the one true Carcassone, Castelnaudary or Toulouse cassoulet, but it is worth your time.Soak8 hr+Prep15 minCook4 hr 15 minServes6-8800g dried haricot beans1 onion, peeled and halved1 head of garlic, left whole and unpeeled, plus 4 peeled garlic cloves, roughly chopped2 fresh thyme sprigs1 bay leaf1kg bone-in pork belly, or lamb breast2 confit duck legs, plus their fat4 garlicky Toulouse sausagesSalt and black pepper300ml white wine120g dried breadcrumbs1 Soak the dried beansView image in fullscreenHaricot are preferable here, and you can get some lovely heirloom French varieties online, but if need be dried cannellini or other white beans will do. Put the beans in a large, ovenproof pot, cover with cold water and soak for at least eight hours; I’m afraid this is one recipe where tinned shortcuts just won’t cut the mustard.2 A note on the meatIf you don’t eat pork, then substitute lamb breast for the pork belly and sausages as appropriate; ideally, though, use something that’s relatively fatty and mildly spiced (there’s a decent-looking quickvegetarian recipeon the Gourmet magazine website to which you could add meat-free sausages, for example). Toulouse sausages and confit duck are both easily found in large supermarkets, delis and online; Pipers Farm sellsfree-range confit duck.3 Cook the soaked beans and meatView image in fullscreenDrain the soaked beans and return them to the pot. Pour in cold water to cover by about 3cm, then add the halved onion, garlic head, herbs and pork belly. Bring to a boil (you may at this stage need to remove some water, but top it up during cooking). Cover and simmer for about two hours, until the beans are just tender.4 Fry the duck and sausagesView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, melt some of the fat from the duck confit in a frying pan on a medium-high heat, then fry the duck and sausages separately until the duck skin is crisp and both are golden all over.Transfer the duck and sausages to a plate and set aside the frying pan and the rest of the duck fat, both of which will be used to make the topping later. Once cooled, cut the sausages into large chunks and strip generous pieces of the meat off the duck legs.5 Drain the beansView image in fullscreenOnce the beans are cooked through, but still firm and holding their shape, scoop out the pork belly and cut it into bite-size pieces; discard any bones, as well as the onion halves and herbs, but not the garlic.Drain the beans into a heatproof bowl, retaining the liquid separately; keep the pot they were cooked in.6 Mash the garlic and duck fatView image in fullscreenSqueeze the cooked garlic cloves out of their skins and into a bowl, add four tablespoons of the reserved duck fat and the remaining four peeled and chopped garlic cloves, and mash to a paste.Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3 (you can cook this on a low heat on the hob, if you prefer, but it’ll brown better and be easier to look after in the oven).7 Build the cassouletView image in fullscreenGrease the base of the pot with a little of the garlicky duck fat mix, then tip in the beans, meats and all but a tablespoon of the remaining garlicky duck fat mix, plus any jelly from the confit jar or tin.Lightly season and mix well, then pour in the reserved bean cooking liquid and the wine; if there’s not enough liquid to cover the beans, top up with a little water.View image in fullscreen8 Top with breadcrumbs, then bakeView image in fullscreenFry the breadcrumbs briefly in the reserved tablespoon of duck fat, just to coat, then scatter a thin layer over the top of the cassoulet (don’t use them all).Bake uncovered for about two hours, keeping a beady eye on the pot: once a crust has formed, stir this into the bean mix, top with more fried breadcrumbs, and bake until you end up with a thick, golden topping.9 Cool a little, then serveView image in fullscreenLeave to cool to warm before serving, preferably with a green salad to follow (or even, though very untraditionally, alongside). Note that you can make the cassoulet a couple of days ahead of time and reheat it in a low oven, topping up the liquid, if required. It also freezes well, so it’s worth making it in this quantity, even if you’re serving a smaller number of people.Explore more on these topicsFrench food and drinkFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodWinter food and drinkStewPorkDuckSausagesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What they often have in common, however, is that they will try to get you to act quickly.For example, a scammer may phone up claiming to be from your bank’s fraud team and say your account has been compromised and you need to urgently move your money to a “safe” account, which actually belongs to the fraudster.According to one website security company,one of the most commonly used wordsin phishing emails is “urgent”.The banking trade body UK Finance runs an anti-fraud campaign calledTake Five, which advises consumers to “take a moment to stop and think” before handing over any money or personal details. It says that “only criminals will try to rush or panic you … Ask yourself – could it be fake? Ask someone you trust for a second opinion.”Beware onlineBarclays recently revealed that across all the different scam types reported by its customers, 75% started on social media and tech platforms.Online shoppers need to be particularly careful, says Lloyds bank: “Most online shopping scam reports we receive relate to things bought through Facebook or Instagram. If the seller is offering expensive goods at cut-down prices or has items that are otherwise unavailable, it’s a major red flag.”View image in fullscreenAn article about fraudulent Facebook ads in the US.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesThere has also been a surge in recent years in so-called “Hi Mum” scams, wherefraudsters pose as loved oneson services such as WhatsApp. Someone might get in touch pretending to be a family member and saying they need cash quickly to pay a bill because they have been locked out of their online banking after getting a new phone.Again, try not to let the fraudsters panic you into action. Check whether the message is genuine by taking time to contact the family member using the number you have for them or via another channel. You could also test the person on the other end of the message by asking a question that only the person they claim to be would know how to answer.Look closelyA fraudulent email may appear authentic at first glance, but on closer inspection the email address is slightly different from that of the legitimate person or company. Perhaps one letter, number or symbol has been changed.An email or text from a scammer may also include spelling mistakes or poor grammar, because English is often not their first language.Also be careful about clicking on a link or attachment in an email or text until you are absolutely sure it is legitimate. It could take you to a fake website or contain malware designed to steal your personal information.View image in fullscreenA fraudulent email purporting to be from HMRC.Photograph: Josie Elias/AlamyHang upLots of scams start with a call to your landline or mobile phone. It might be someone pretending to be from your bank or an official body, or someone trying to get you to buy or invest in something.If you were not expecting a call and cannot be 100% sure who you are speaking to, hang up immediately and find the official phone number to call back the company or organisation if you want to speak to them.The charity Age UK also cautions: “Be aware that scammers can keep your phone line open even after you’ve hung up. Use a different phone, call someone you know first to check the line is free, or wait at least 10 to 15 minutes between calls to make sure any scammers have hung up.”Many phone handsets let you see the number of the person calling before you answer, but scammers can disguise their identity by mimicking an official phone number. This is known as “number spoofing”, and it can also be used to make a fake message appear in a chain of genuine text messages from a company or organisation.However, there was some good news last week: the telecoms regulator Ofcom says phone providers must now block all calls from abroad that falsely display a UK landline number.Screen and blockWhen it comes to landlines, the consumer group Which? hascompiled a list of servicesyou can use to block numbers that might be scammers or nuisance calls.One is BT’sCall Protect, which automatically diverts calls the company believes to be problematic to customers’ junk voicemail boxes. It also lets you compile a personal list of numbers you wish to block, and you can choose to send all calls from three types of numbers – international, withheld and unrecognised – to your junk voicemail.View image in fullscreenA woman gives out her bank card details over the phone.Photograph: Daisy-Daisy/AlamyCall Protect is included with home phone packages at no extra cost, and Which? reckons it is much better than some BT paid-for services such as Choose to Refuse and Anonymous Call Reject, which cost £6.86 and £8.09 a month respectively.Sky customers can useSky Talk Shield, its personalised call screening and blocking service which is free for Sky Broadband and Sky Talk customers. TalkTalk has a similar service calledCallSafethat is also free.For mobile phones, many Android devices have built-in caller ID and spam call and text message protection. Make sure it is turned on in your phone’s settings and for any messaging apps you use, and do not answer, call back or reply to unknown numbers. Legitimate callers will leave a voicemail.On iPhones, turn on“silence unknown callers” in your phone’s settingsto stop people who are not saved in your contacts from ringing you, and turn on“filter unknown senders” in messages settingsto remove texts from people you don’t know into a separate folder and stop links in their messages from working.Also consider signing up for theTelephone Preference Service, “the UK’s only official ‘do not call’ register for landlines and mobile numbers”, although some argue ithas its limitations.Protect your computerMake sure your desktop or laptop is properly protected.“Generally, it’s about keeping things up to date and ensuring whatever device you use is still getting software and security updates,” says Samuel Gibbs, the Guardian’s consumer technology editor. “As long as you keep a modern device up to date, don’t install things from outside the various app stores, keep your browser up to date and avoid dodgy sites, it will be hard to hack.”For Windows 11 PCs, keep your software up to date by regularly using Windows Update and visiting the Microsoft Store for the latest versions of apps. Also use the update service in browsers such as Chrome. Ensure the built-inWindows Securityis turned on for protection against viruses. To open the app, search for it in the start menu.For Apple devices, keep macOS up to date using Software Update and the App Store for your apps. MacOS has variousbuilt-in security systemsthat run in the background.In all cases make sure you have strong passwords, and do not use the same one on more than one account.Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security. You should turn it on for every service that offers it.Explore more on these topicsScamsMoney hacksConsumer affairsCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The OnePlus 13 is the latest in the Oppo sub-brand’s series of keenly priced phones. Despitebecoming more expensive every year, the £899 (€1,049/$899) new model still costs a little less than its £1,000-plus Google and Samsung rivals.The OnePlus comes in a choice of colours, including a particularly attractive blue microfibre back version as pictured, which feels great and stands out in the sea of glass and metal slabs modern phones have become.View image in fullscreenThe expansive screen has thin bezels and curved edges.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 6.8-in screen is bright, sharp, smooth and colourful, putting it on par with some of the best. The bevelled metal sides are almost retro, reminiscent of theOnePlus X from 2015, but make the 13 fairly easy to handle. Though it is still a big phone requiring two hands to wield most of the time. The handset is well-built with IP68 water resistance against immersion, similar to most competitors, and an unusual IP69 rating against 80C water jets, should it end up in the dishwasher by accident.Rapid in use with the fastest new chipThe OnePlus is one of the first handsets to use Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which will no doubt find its way into most high-end Androids in 2025. In tests, the chip is about 40% faster than its predecessor and makes short work of games and other intensive tasks. But the OnePlus feels even faster in day-to-day use than the numbers suggest as the software has been tuned for speed, rapidly responding to app launches, taps, swipes and other interactions. Even the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in the screen is super fast at unlocking the phone.View image in fullscreenIt still has OnePlus’s signature alert slider for quickly switching between ring, vibrate and silent modes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianPleasingly, the 13’s top performance does not come at the expense of battery life. The phone lasts a consistent 50 hours on a full charge when used on a mix of 5G and wifi with the screen actively used for about six hours. That means charging it every other day, or nightly on very heavy usage days, which is roughly on par with top competitors.A full charge using a standard 45W USB-C charger (not included) hits 50% in under half an hour and completes in 68 minutes, or as little as 37 minutes if you buy a special 100W SuperVooc charger. The phone has up to 50W wireless charging too.SpecificationsScreen:6.82in, 120Hz QHD+ OLED (510ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteRAM:12 or 16GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:OxygenOS 15 (Android 15)Camera:50M + 50MP ultrawide + 50MP 3x; 32MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68/69 (1.5-metre depth for 30mins/80C water jets for 30 seconds)Dimensions:162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5mmWeight:210gSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe OnePlus 13 is solidly built but does not include recycled materials.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery is rated to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,600 full charge cycles and can be replaced for £80.The phone does not contain recycled materials but isgenerally repairable, with screen replacements costing £280. The company does not publish product environmental impact reports, but is included in parent-company Oppo’syearly sustainability reports.Oxygen OS 15 with some AIView image in fullscreenOnePlus displays media, timers and other activities around the selfie camera at the top of the screen, left. The AI tools have their own slide-out dock, centre.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 13 runs Oxygen OS 15, which is the firm’s customised version of Android 15. It behaves like most western versions of Android and is truly rapid in operation. It has a few rough edges, such as text descriptions of features displayed only in Chinese, but also a good amount of customisation options for those that like to tinker.A few new AI tools have been added that werelacking from previous versionsas it tries to play catch up with rivals. It has a few of Google’s AI features including its Gemini voice assistant, Circle to Search, and writing tools in Gmail and Messages. The OnePlus photos app now has a few AI editing tools, too, one of which is able to erase reflections from pictures shot through windows with impressive results.OnePlus has some AI summary, writing and proofing tools of its own, but they are confined to its Notes app and an odd pop-out dock at the side of the screen. They are hit and miss and feel tacked on rather than being part of the system like better rivals.OnePlus will provide only four years of Android updates with six years of security patches,ending on 7 January 2031. That falls far short of the seven-plus years of full software and security support provided by Apple,GoogleandSamsung.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app has most of the tools you need to take a good photo and plenty of modes with which to experiment.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 13 has three 50-megapixel cameras on the back, including a 0.6x ultrawide, 1x wide and 3x telephoto that can reach 6x magnification before requiring digital zoom, plus a 32MP selfie camera on the front.The triple rear camera is a marked improvement over thephone’s predecessor, shooting detailed and well-balanced images across a range of lighting conditions. Images from the ultrawide can look a little soft, but the telephoto camera is one of the best at 3x zoom. The phone also does a good job of capturing motion and handles low-light conditions very well. OnePlus has a tendency to overbrighten and over-sharpen images more than rivals, but otherwise the 13 is the closest yet to the best in the business. Most people will be very happy with the results.The camera app also has a solid set of features including a “master” mode for manual control, fun macrophotography, slow-mo, tilt-shift and time-lapse modes, and a setting to shoot photos at the full 50MP resolution of the sensors.PriceThe OnePlus 13 costs from£899(€1,049/$899).For comparison, theGoogle Pixel 9 Procosts from£999, the Samsung Galaxy S25+ costs£999and theiPhone 16 Procosts£999.VerdictThe OnePlus 13 is the most expensive non-folding smartphone the company has made, but the money has mostly been spent wisely to create a top-tier phone that rivals the best in the business on many, if not all fronts.It sets a new speed benchmark as one of the first phones of 2025 with the new top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip from Qualcomm, which is expected to be used in most high-end Androids this year. The camera is improved on predecessors and the closest OnePlus has come to the best in the business from Google, Samsung and Apple. The screen is great, the two-day battery life is good and the phone looks particularly special in the blue microfibre version.The Oxygen OS Android software is rapid, making the phone feel very fast indeed, but has a few rough edges. It has a couple of good AI tools from Google, but many of OnePlus’s own AI features are poorly integrated and not quite up to scratch. OnePlus also lags Google and Samsung on software updates, which is a shame.At just shy of £900 the OnePlus is certainly not a budget option. But it undercuts big-screen rivals by about 10% and is well worth considering alongside the top Androids this year.Pros:Slick, attractive design, good screen, long battery life, rapid performance and top Android chip, good camera, water resistance, Google Gemini and other AI tools.Cons:Oxygen OS has rough edges and poor AI integration, fewer AI tools than rivals, software support short of best, more expensive than predecessor.Explore more on these topicsAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Food styling assistant: Áine Pretty-McGrath.Eastern European food and drinkPaprikash fish and leek and olive stew: Irina Georgescu’s recipes from the DanubeTwo traditional and homely dishes from RomaniaIrina GeorgescuWed 5 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTShareThe way we Romanians cook at home is more varied and regional than what you get in the country’s restaurants, which generally serve a pretty standard menu across the country. We have oldtraditionsof preserving and of cooking with seasonal fruit and vegetables, influenced by observing 180 days of fasting annually (fortunately not all in a row). Even when we do cook with meat or fish, our dishes often feature spring onions, leeks, chard, spinach, courgettes, aubergines and tomatoes, and there are constant culinary nods to the Roman empire, too: leeks, so loved by the Romans, are the culinary symbol of Oltenia in the south of the country; we still bake ash bread under a dome-shaped earthenware lid called atestum, known locally as ațest, much as they did in Pompeii; we add vinegar, a Roman favourite, to our soups; and we uselotsof lovage and parsley, which flavoured many ancient Roman dishes. But the similarities stop at garlic, which Romans hated, and which we love.Mâncare de praz cu mӑsline(leek stew with olives – pictured top)Dishes with leeks have dual nationality in my family. My grandfather, Gheorghe, was from Oltenia, where leeks are considered a culinary symbol, and I now live in Wales, where they play a similar role. What a coincidence! This stew is very popular, especially during Lent (during which event we skip the wine), and I love it for its sweet-tangy notes. It’s usually served with bread, butburghul wheatand rice are also common south of the Danube.Prep10 minCook50 minServes4Sunflower oil, for frying2 large leeks, washed and cut into rounds, green tops includedSalt andblack pepper1 tsp coriander seeds50ml white wine200mlvegetable stock2400g tins chopped tomatoes250gmixed olives, plain or marinatedZest and juice of 2 lemonsCover the base of a large frying pan with a thin layer of oil and heat well.

Add the stock and chopped tomatoes, turn down the heat to medium-low and carry on cooking for 15 minutes; if you like, cover the pan, in which case reduce the heat even more so it cooks at a very gentle bubble.Stir in the olives, lemon zest and juice, cook for five minutes more, then adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve with bread, burghul wheat or rice.Papricaș de pește(fish paprikash with egg dumplings)View image in fullscreenIrina Georgescu’spapricaș de pește– fish paprikash with egg dumplings.When people hear the wordpapricaș, they immediately think of the famous Hungarian chicken dish with tomatoes and paprika, yet you find carp or catfish paprikash in many traditional restaurants in Budapest, the country’s majestic capital city. It is usually served withnokeldi, a German term popular in central and eastern Europe to describe any type of dumpling.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4Sunflower oil, for frying2 medium brown onions, peeled and thinly slicedSalt and black pepper2tsp smoked or sweet paprika300mlfish stock, or vegetable stock400g tinned finely chopped tomatoes, or passata if you prefer a smoother sauce100gcreme fraiche1 green bell pepper, or Turkish pepper, pith and seeds removed, flesh sliced, to finish (optional)For the dumplings250gplainflour2 large eggs1tsp salt, plus extra for cookingFor the fishSunflower oil, for frying4 medium sustainably sourced cod loins, or similar white fishPut a thin layer of oil in a saute pan or casserole dish for which you have a lid, and set it over a medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Quickly stir in the paprika, so it doesn’t catch and burn, then pour in the stock and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat to low, and adjust the seasoning to taste.Combine all the dumpling ingredients in a medium bowl, then mix in 100ml cold water. Bring a large pan of well-salted water to a boil, then dip a teaspoon into the hot water and use it to start scooping up small amounts of the dumpling mix and dropping them into the hot water – half a teaspoon is usually a good size, but don’t worry if you make them larger. Put as many dumplings as possible in the pan of water so that they drop to the base of the pan in a single layer, then boil for about three or four minutes, until they pop up to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked dumplings to the pot of paprikash sauce, stir to coat in the sauce, then repeat with the remaining dumpling mixture. Stir the creme fraiche into the sauce and keep warm on a low heat.Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan large enough to accommodate all the fish, then pat the fish dry and fry for a couple of minutes on each side, until just cooked through. Break the fish into large flakes, then tuck these in among the dumplings. Serve with the sliced green pepper, if using, on top.These recipes are edited extracts from Danube: Recipes and Stories from Eastern Europe, by Irina Georgescu, published by Hardie Grant at £28.

We weren’t in the Arctic on a cruise ship but steering a narrowboat in northern England, almost the farthest north you can reach on the inland waterways. There was snow on the hills. The Leeds & Liverpool Canal, which climbs to 148 metres above sea level as it crosses the Pennines between the east and west coasts, had only recently thawed after a cold snap.Canal mapA canal holiday is usually thought of as a summer pastime: standing at the tiller in T-shirt and shorts, followed by evenings in canalside beer gardens. But the canals are quieter in the off season (from October to May), and it is unlikely you will find queues at locks or water points. The sparsity of boat traffic is also easier on the nerves if you’re new to steering a 30-tonne steel battering ram round bends, through narrow bridges and beside expensive moored boats. For the first time ever, I would be at the tiller of a wide-beam (11ft 5in-wide) boat.View image in fullscreenThe cosy interior of Paul Miles’s hired boat.Photograph: Paul MilesThe 127-mile-long Leeds & Liverpool canal was completed in 1816 and has 14ft-wide locks. Significant amounts of cargo, such as coal and limestone, could be carried by each vessel, which meant the canal remained financially viable until the early 1970s. Now those spacious lock dimensions accommodate larger-than-average holiday boats. Our main cabin was big enough to host a small country dance. We had a spacious open-plan kitchen-living room-diner with a two-seater sofa and huge armchair in front of the wood burner. There were two en suite bedrooms plus the sofa bed. Being able to offer such relative luxury (did I mention central heating?) had sealed the deal with three friends who joined me.Heading west from the hire boat base at Silsden, it would be 11 miles before we reached our first lock, but this didn’t mean the crew could relax: there were 14 swing bridges to operate, three of them carrying roads. Pedestrians waited patiently, children smiling and waving. “We don’t see many boats on the move in winter,” said one parent in the pretty canalside village of Kildwick.View image in fullscreenAfter mooring, Paul Miles and his friends hiked some of the nearby Yorkshire Dales.Photograph: Paul MilesOur plan was to cruise to the summit level of the canal, near Barnoldswick (pronounced Barlick by the locals). The Nicholson Waterways Guide describes this stretch as “one of the more remote stretches and probably the most scenic”. It was a journey of just 20 miles and 15 locks one way. The websitecanalplan.ukestimates a journey time of 11.5 hours. There and back in a week would be a nice leisurely trip, cruising about three hours a day. But it was not to be.Our plan was to cruise to the summit level of the canal, near Barnoldswick, one of the more remote stretches and probably the most scenicOn day three, we took more than an hour to cruise through two locks. They leaked badly. Several paddles were broken. It took the might of three of us – plus the boat in forward gear – to open the heavy gates. I phoned theCanal & River Trust(CRT) to report the problems. At this rate, ascending the next nine locks to a hoped-for picturesque rural mooring near the village of Bank Newton was looking overambitious for the day. When walkers on the towpath warned us that the pound (the stretch between locks) above the next lock was very low, it confirmed our change of plan. We would moor for the night here in Gargrave instead. With our newly free afternoon, we could hike some of the Pennine Way that crosses the canal and visit a local pub.That evening, over pheasant curry and pints of Timothy Taylor in the Masons Arms, we learned that we were not the only ones to find the locks on this canal especially tricky. “It took me an hour to go through one on my way up from Leeds,” said fellow boater Anita Weedy, who lives on board her (solar-electric) narrowboat. “I had to ask passersby to help.”View image in fullscreenThe poor maintenance of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal hit the headlines last year.Photograph: Rachel HaynesThe poor maintenance of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal, specifically the reservoirs that keep it topped up,made headlineslast year. One hire boat company,Pennine Cruisers, in operation for 60 years, has ceased its holiday hire business, blaming the CRT’s poor maintenance. “Customers were having to cut short their holidays when they got stuck because the CRT had padlocked locks due to water supply issues,” said director Zoe Venn. “The decision to stop hiring holiday boats isn’t one we’ve taken lightly, but we were having to give refunds all the time. We can’t get insurance to cover that.” The CRT says it is “raising funds to invest significant sums in the Leeds & Liverpool Canal … to ensure our canals get the care and maintenance they need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This hadn’t just been a holiday but a waterways protest of sortsAs for our fortunes, we now had more woes. A storm was forecast. We would lose at least a day’s cruising. Advice that Zoe had given came to mind: “Choose a direction, not a destination.” We had gone westwards, perhaps that was enough of an achievement? We abandoned plans to reach the summit level and turned round to slowly mosey back. Skipton had looked charming when we cruised through. We could spend time there. Descending locks was far quicker; under 10 minutes each. We meandered along the side of the Aire valley. Fields threaded with dry-stone walls rose up into a swirling mist. Soggy sheep grazed and stared as we passed. Hills like bruise-coloured waves rolled towards us through low cloud. There was none of the forecast winter sun but it was all still magical in its own way.View image in fullscreenIcebreaker … Skipton proved a good place for mooring up and enjoying walks, cafes and pubs.Photograph: Andrew Hopkins/AlamyBy cruising the canal, using locks and bridges, even if only a few, we were also doing a good deed. “Use it or lose it” has long been the ethos of the inland waterways. Decades ago, the pioneering author and co-founder of the Inland Waterways Association Tom Rolt cruised the canals with his colleagues to draw attention to their state of decay. Rolt cruised the length of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal in 1948 in one of the first holiday hire boats, a former wooden cargo boat named Ailsa Craig. In his autobiography, he mentions the “sensational” Bingley five-rise locks and “the long winding 17 miles through the Yorkshire countryside and the market town of Skipton to Gargrave bottom lock.” In our own small way, following in his wake, we liked to think we were continuing this tradition of “use it or lose it”. This hadn’t just been a holiday but a waterways protest of sorts.We moored in Skipton for three nights to enjoy cafes, hikes in woods and dales and canalside pubs with real ale and folk music. It turns out that a wide-beam boat with a wood-burning stove makes for a unique holiday base. On our voyage back to Silsden, the winter sun did indeed shine brightly. By the time we moored up, we had cruised 23 miles and negotiated 28 movable swing-bridges and six locks in a week. The holiday was the journey, not the destination.Paul Miles was a guest ofsilsdenboats.co.uk, one of few companies that hires boats year-round. A week for four on a wide beam in February costs from£1,300. The Canal & River Trust carries out scheduled maintenance in winter.

Weeks later,Belize removed Queen Elizabeth II’s images from banknotes. These moves are only the latest in a growing trend:Barbados became a republic in 2022, and several other countries are signalling their intentions to follow suit. As Natricia says, these countries are seeking to “shrug off the vestiges of colonialism and establish their own identity as a nation – in terms of culture and history, while addressing the colonial overlays that remain in society”. The footprint of colonialism is evident in the region – including in “our money, the names of roads and some of the laws incorporated from the British legal system at the time”.Belize not only removed images of the late monarch from its paper currency but it replaced them with pictures of national icons, specifically those who played a role in decolonisation. “Belizeans thought it was important in celebrating their history,” Natricia says. “The heroes they chose led independence from British rule.” There are broader cultural and linguistic shifts, too. Trinidad and Tobago announced a plan toremove a depiction of three shipsused by Christopher Columbus from its coat of arms. And there is a push in Jamaica to makepatois its official language instead of English, while St Lucia and Dominica have started tointegrate Indigenous languagesby adding them to the school curriculum.‘We want to be seen as equals, not ex-colonies’View image in fullscreenA Belizean $10 banknote featuring an image of a young Queen Elizabeth II.Photograph: Aurore Shirley/AlamyFourteen Commonwealth countries, eight of them members of theCaribbean Community (Caricom), still have the British monarch as the ceremonial head of state. The removal of the British sovereign in that role is the most symbolic act of independence. For some countries, having their own head of state says something about who they are and their autonomy, Natricia says. “But I don’t think they want to sever ties with the UK. They still very much value those political and economic ties but they want to be seen as equals, not ex-colonies.”I wondered if the diminished diplomatic role and death of Queen Elizabeth, a grand and unifying figure, had played a part in accelerating republicanism. King Charles isless popular than his mother at home and abroad, and the new generation of royals who began taking on duties from the queen in her advanced years was not fully embraced. A tour of the Caribbean by the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine and William, in 2022 produced someshockingly misjudged optics, and was met with protests and a storm of demands for apologies and reparations for Britain’s role in the transatlantic slave trade. At last year’s biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting,a debate loomed overa fractious summit about whether it was time, with the passing of the crown to Charles, to remove the British monarch as head of state.The decolonisation drive predates the death of the queen, Natricia says. The first wave of independence in the region dates as far back as the 1960s, with the first successful overthrow of colonial rule 150 years earlier via theHaitian revolutionagainst French colonial rule. “I think about my country, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and the feeling is that the British did not leave much behind when SVG became fully independent in 1979. The education and health systems, the infrastructure and institutions required to build a strong economy and ensure a fledgling democracy could get on its feet, were not there, and that made it really difficult.”The continued economic reliance on Britain after independence has been calamitous. For example, Britain agreed a quota of tariff-free bananas to be imported from the country, creating an industry that at one timeemployed approximately 70%of the country’s workforce and became the pillar of the economy. “When those protected market arrangements for former colonies began to fall through, it was disastrous. Over time, I think a view has developed that tethering ourselves to that identity of being a former colony – alongside the narratives and economic architecture that come with that identity – was doing more bad than good,” Natricia says. Distant royal figures then start to seem like not only an irrelevance but an insulting anachronism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People feel that if King Charles is our head and we have this connection through the Commonwealth, there should be some sort of free movement. They think: ‘I can’t even get a visa to go there.’ I don’t know to what extent the scandal caused a change in perspective for the average person in the Caribbean. But it did have an impact on public perception.”And there is, Natricia says, the reparations movement – the global call for repair from former enslaving countries to the descendants of those they victimised. That discourse triggered a realisation among some Caribbean states that “one of the reasons why they are struggling is because of their colonial past, and there should be some redress for that. That opened a conversation about our identity and where we should be today. Reparations are about repair and restoration for the damage that was done during enslavement.” People are becoming aware that some of the inequities and challenges they are experiencing are the result of the fact that they are descended from enslaved people who “lost everything, their homes, their language, their cultural identity”.Reclaiming cultural identitiesView image in fullscreenA march for reparations on Afrikan Emancipation Day in London, England.Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty ImagesIt’s hard to gauge how much of a groundswell there is in favour of this reassertion of identity. “At the governmental level, it’s very strong and, in most cases, across parties,” Natricia says. There are Indigenous groups, such asthe Garifuna people, and others, such as Rastafarians, who are passionate about the cause. “There are cross-sections of the population, especially those who are marginalised, who really connect with this idea of reclaiming our cultural identity, correcting narratives and falsehoods in our history.”Otherwise, she says, the picture is mixed. “In the Caribbean, there have been referendums in which people have voted ‘no’ to the question of removing the monarch as head of state. More recently, a poll in Jamaica showed thatonly 56%of participants were in favour of republicanism. So, I think decolonisation is important but still some way down on the list of priorities for Caribbean populations.” But aspects of decolonisation that have a material impact, such as removing the UK’s privy council as the highest court, “are things people appear to be more passionate about because they have an impact on justice. There is a lot of concern about the fact that we have theCaribbean court of justice, but for a lot of countries, they go to the privy council for the final decision.”I say to Natricia that what she is describing sounds essentially like the birth of a Caribbean-wide consciousness. “Absolutely. Yes,” she says. The next step, she says, is to raise awareness among populations struggling with the cost of living and other more immediate and tangible concerns.“What I have observed is that there needs to be a strong and well thought through education programme that tells people about our past. There are moves to do this now by integrating information into the curriculum,” Natricia says. “There isan international debating competition, created by theCentre for Reparation Research, to which schools in the Caribbean and UK have been invited.” With Britain experiencing its owngrowing painsin coming to terms with its colonial past and role in enslavement, a process the Guardian has initiated regarding its own history, that momentum behind this movement in the Caribbean could spread to its former coloniser. The key lies in helping people to understand their past, Natricia says. “In doing so, people in the UK and the Caribbean can take that journey to understanding why we are where we are.”To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsRaceThe Long WaveBlack British cultureJamaicaBelizeCommonwealth of NationsMonarchyKing Charles IIInewslettersShareReuse this content"

Trump actively courted those groups andpolls indicatehe made significant gains.Protests against the Biden administration’s stance led to more than700,000“uncommitted” votes in the Democratic primaries, an attempt to pressure Joe Biden to shift course.Layla Elabed, the co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement responded to Trump’s remarks andsaidthat she felt “sad, angry, and scared for our communities”.The Uncommitted movement opposed a Trump presidency, but ultimately declined toendorse Kamala Harris, citing her “unwillingness to shift” on Biden’s policies.View image in fullscreenLayla Elabed, co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement speaks in a press conference the day after the Michigan presidential primary in Dearborn in February 2024.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“For months, we warned about the dangers of Trump at home and abroad but our calls largely went unheard,” Elabed wrote. Harris, she said, “left a vacuum by not visiting Michigan families impacted by US-supplied bombs to help create a permission structure for their trust while Trump visited Dearborn and filled a community in despair with lies”.She continued: “Trump’s illegal calls for ethnic cleansing are horrific but as on so many other issues, Democrats had a chance to persuade voters they were the better alternative and they blew it.”James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, which conducted an October poll of Arab American voters,noted at the timethat in the institute’s 30 years of polling, it had not “witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior”. Anotherrecent pollfound that 29% of 2020 Biden voters who opted for a different candidate than Harris in 2024 cited “ending Israel’s violence in Gaza” as their top issue.On Wednesday, Zogby described Trump’s comments about the US taking Gaza in an interview as “dangerous, provocative, illegal and callously insensitive to Palestinian needs”.“Anyone who knows the region knows Palestinians are not going to leave,” he said. “And if they want to go anywhere, it’s back to their villages inIsraelthey were expelled from in 1948.”Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan whose family is of Palestinian origin, compared Trump’s proposal on Tuesday to ethnic cleansing.“If the United States deploys troops to forcibly remove Muslims and Christians – like my cousins – from Gaza, then not only will the US be mired in another reckless occupation but it will also be guilty of the crime of ethnic cleansing,”he said. “No American of good conscience should stand for this.Wa’el Alzayat, the chief executive officer of EmgageUSA, a Muslim American advocacy organization, said that “evicting people from their land is a violation of international law” and that sending US troops to Gaza was not only “deeply problematic” but also, he imagined, “politically very unpopular”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She ultimately endorsed Harris.“Everyone failed,” she said. “Everyone is responsible for the moment that we are in today. The idea that voters do not carry any responsibility is untenable and absurd. The idea that candidates don’t carry any responsibility is untenable and absurd.”Romman added: “No fascist here or abroad will ever be able to erase Palestinians,” adding that the “harder they try the deeper our roots will grow”.Hudhayfah Ahmad, the director of media relations for the Abandon Harris campaign, which supported Jill Stein, said in a statement: “The Biden-Harris administration’s full, unobstructed support for Israel’s campaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing has failed to remove the Palestinians of Gaza from their land.”“It is not Trump – just as it was not Biden or Harris – who decides what the Palestinians can or cannot do; that decision belongs solely to the people of Palestine,” Ahmad said.In response to finger-pointing at voters who turned on Harris, Waleed Shahid, a former organizer for the Uncommitted movement and a Democratic strategist, called for introspection.“Democratic party elites find it easier to punch down on grieving Palestinian families in Michigan desperate for a basic shift in their party’s policy than to challenge decisions made by Biden and Harris,” Shahidwrote. “But this is why Democrats lose – they don’t listen to voters; they sneer at them.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Kennedy then referenced a “series of studies” showing that “to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction”.The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official. Dr Richard Kennedy –an author of the studyreferenced at the hearing, who is not related to Kennedy – toldNPRthat while it’s true the immune response to vaccination can vary by race, sex and “potentially dozens of other factors”, the data does not support a change in vaccine schedule based on race.Alsobrooks went on to characterize the nominee’s incorrect interpretation of medical research as “dangerous”, noting the potential for the misinformation to have far-reaching and tangible effects on people’s lives. Shannon Cavanagh, the department chair of sociology at University of Texas, Austin, agreed with this sentiment, telling the Guardian that ideas like Kennedy’s could be used to rationalize the lack of care for an under-served population. She noted that even though false claims that Black people possess a stronger immune system or higher pain tolerance persist, the demographic actually suffers from higher maternal mortality rates and lower life expectancy than other groups.“That’s the problem,” she said. “These claims are made to seem positive, but they calcify the reality that there is disparate access to healthcare and that has real implications for health and wellbeing.”Support letter for RFK Jr’s confirmation includes signatures of doctors with suspended or revoked licensesRead moreSince his nomination, Kennedy has facedsignificant criticismfrom several members of the scientific community for making various false claims about vaccines. In this case: “He made an assumption that is so far removed from even what the paper itself would be possibly indicating and presented it as a valid national policy”, Dr Devlin Cole, a preventive medicine physician in Madison, Wisconsin, said of the claims made at the hearing. As a practicing physician, Cole said she fears rhetoric like Kennedy’s could lead to negative health outcomes for an already underserved demographic: “It instills distrust in communities that have already had reason to distrust the system.”No genetic basis for raceAfrican Americans have a long history of mistrust in the medical system, rooted in legacies of abuse and mistreatment, including unethical experiments on Black people. Examples include the Tuskegee syphilis study, the gynecology malpractice of J Marion Sims on enslaved Black women and the exploitation of Henrietta Lacks for cancer treatment, all which violated the principles of research ethics. The basis of these events stemmed from exploitation upheld by the idea that race is biological. In 2003,the Human Genome Projectfound that there is no genetic basis for race and that the term “race” is not biologically meaningful, meaning statements like Kennedy’s are not only outdated, but also false.Throughout history, two enduring physiological myths – that Black people have a higher pain tolerance and weak lungs that could be strengthened through hard labor – have circulated within the medical community and continue to influence modern medical education and practice. Research has shown that many American physicians, medical students and residents hold incorrect beliefs about biological differences between races, which contribute to racial bias and disparities in pain perception and treatment recommendations. A2016 surveyrevealed that of 222 white American medical students and residents, nearly 60% thought Black people’s skin is thicker than white peoples, and 12% thought Black people’s nerve endings were less sensitive than those of white people. Neither is true.“Spreading false rhetoric that Black people have stronger immune systems recalls this notion of a super-humanization bias, which claims that Black people’s bodies function and endure pain differently,” said Zoé Samudzi, a visiting assistant professor at Clark University. Samudzi, who holds a PhD in medical sociology, fears the rise in misinformation will roll back recent progress across health fields. “Race-based medicine should not be the means of addressing the disparities in health outcomes that fall on the lines of race,” she said.Kennedy’s claims about different vaccine schedules isn’t the first time he has misinterpreted a study and tied it to unsupported racial differences. In 2021, he produceda filmthat references a study to suggest that vaccines could be disproportionately harming Black Americans. The author of the study, Dr Gregory Poland, toldNPRthat “no evidence of increased vaccine side effects” was found and that any claim of “increased vulnerability” among Black Americans who receive the rubella vaccine is “simply not supported by either this study or the science”.The potential directives that could come into play under Kennedy’s appointment pose a huge threat: Cole worries it could confuse and misinform medical professionals. “If a person that is so scientifically unqualified is going to be in a position of trust, you definitely run the risk of people all the way down to the ground to – nurses, pharmacists that are giving you your vaccines – having misinformation that in some ways was not their fault to have passively consumed.”Samudzi is concerned that a Kennedy appointment could result in policies that halt research and dismantle demonstrably proven health interventions. “I worry that the epidemiological and public health research on marginalized communities would also be inaccessible for the other people who want to do it,” she said. “His vision is completely unscientific and terrifying.”On Tuesday, Republicans on key Senate committees voted to advance Kennedy’s nomination to lead the Department ofHealthand Human Services. “This is an important time for people to band together as a community, as a nation,” said Cole. “As much as possible, avoid getting pulled into panic. And trust that the scientific community is still active.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrUS SenateVaccines and immunisationHealthDemocratsRaceanalysisShareReuse this content"

A billionaire is taking over a government,” Amy said. “The executive orders against the federal workforce feel designed to create chaos and fear. Musk calls us lazy and described workers at theUS Agency for International Development(USAid) as a‘ball of worms’. They’re trying to dehumanise us to make these changes more palatable, and are trying to rattle enough of us so that a majority of federal employees leave.”Everyone is digging their heels inAmy was among scores of civil servants from across America who shared with the Guardian what they intend to do with theTrump administration’s“fork in the road” buyout offer, designed to dramatically reduce the ranks of left-leaning federal workers.“While many may think federal employees should take the offer and run, I haven’t spoken to a single person jumping at it,” she said. “Everyone is still digging their heels in and is intent on not taking it. We’re also feeling petty as hell.”Although her department does not qualify for voluntary redundancies, Amy is affected by theblanket return to the officeorder that was issued.“I was hired for a fully remote position,” she said. “I spend six to eight months every year overseas helping refugees who are trying to enter the US. So many of us are trying to continue focusing on our work while being told to immediately return to the office, but also to not return to the office yet because there is not space for all of us nor the resources to relocate everyone.“The refugee program has been suspended, so we don’t know the future of it, but I feel really determined to stick it out so that the budget for me cannot be used for somebody else who doesn’t care about refugees and [will] infiltrate this line of work to do harm or to prevent good from being done.”I don’t want to work for Trump or MuskAmy’s remarks reflected those of scores of other federal government workers who presented themselves as a united front in defiance of Musk and Trump, but there were some who felt it was possibly time to resign from their careers.For Riordan, a trans, autistic, disabled veteran who has worked for nearly 20 years for the government, the last few weeks have been stressful and “too much” for their mental health. Feeling “tired”, Riordan wants to hold on until they can retire early.“It’s upsetting. The stereotype of the lazy government worker has persisted for a long time but the majority of us have been working our asses off to serve our populations.”Federal workers have been told that those eligible for voluntary early retirement (Vera) cancombine it with their deferred resignation, but Riordan is cautious.“I’m not going to take the chance right now. We’re not even sure what is being offered is legal. [If I’ll be eligible for Vera] I will take it in a second because I’m ready to get out of here. I don’t want to work for Trump and I don’t want to work for Musk. I’ll sell the house and move to a blue state where I can be with my family. For now, I’m just going to delete the emails and ignore them.”A long-term government employee at USAid from the east coast who had been working on programs in the developing world shared her disbelief at howher agency has begun being dismantled.All of the communication we have received expresses lack of trust in us and our judgment“After going dark for several days, theUSAidwebsite was relaunched to tell the world that the entire workforce is being put on administrative leave,” she said. “Every message to my agency’s workforce has been hostile and intimidating with threats of disciplinary action and no space for disagreement with orders from the White House. All of the communication we have received expresses lack of trust in us and our judgment.Deaths predicted amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s shutdown of USAidRead more“As a result of the stop-work order that has affected most of the work USAid funds, our workforce is glued to our computers with nothing to do. The American public is not benefiting from this in any way.”Deaths and illness around the world could result from the halt of USAid assistance that contributes to global security, she warned, adding that despite everything she had decided to stay.“For a second, the [buyout offer] sounded kind of appealing, but I quickly heard voices I trust – employee unions, lawyers, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia – who raised questions and told people to be very cautious. There’s no funding for this [buyout programme], there’s no guarantee, so I’m not going to take it.

The phenomenon is neither Republican- nor Trump-specific, and it’s being construed as a sort of Trump-related dysfunction, which I think is not accurate.“I did not vote for Trump, I voted for Jill Stein, and although he does things that are problematic, I think he needs to be given a chance.”Elizabeth, a federal immigration enforcement attorney from the west coast, learned a few days ago that her department would be exempt from the buyout, but that she would have to return to the officedespite her flexible hybrid union contract.“I’m a single mother, and the flexibility of this job is what is keeping me sane,” she said. “I have so many court appointments, I just don’t know whether I could handle having to come into the office all the time in between for the next four years.“I currently have no plans of quitting, but I’d have to strongly consider other job options, depending on how draconian they want to be on this.”Elizabeth, who is Black, added that the administration’s decision to suspend DEI practices and departments across the federal government was also “extremely upsetting”. “I’ve been having problems concentrating all week. A handful of people in my office support Trump, but others are very liberal. Politically like-minded people and I are concerned. Power is being given toElon Musk.”I’m not taking a loyalty test for any presidentAnother major worry, Elizabeth said, was the prospect of being subjected to loyalty tests as part of future workplace evaluations, while she insisted that her political dislike of theTrump administrationwould not undermine her professionalism.“I’m not taking a loyalty test for any president. We all take an oath, our job is to uphold the laws of the United States. It is not to pledge loyalty to anyone. I can have my views about any politician but still be able to do my job.”An older remote worker for the Department of Veterans Affairs said her office had been “swamped with calls from stressed-out employees considering the deferred resignation but without sufficient information to make a decision within the very limited timeframe”.“If they don’t take the deferred resignation,” she said, “will they need to return to the office even though there is no identified office space? Will they have to relocate in order to keep working? Will their jobs be eliminated? Exactly how does this affect their retirement benefits?”She described emails coming from the administration as “callous” and “staggering”.“Even though we try to refrain from any overtly political comments,” she said, “it was clear that most people I spoke to viewed the ‘[fork in the road]’ email as craven and hypocritical. ‘Enhanced standards of conduct’ – from an administration headed by a felon, a sexual predator, a pathological liar with no respect for the rule of law? What a joke.”A probationary Department of Homeland Security employee from the midwest who wanted to stay anonymous said she would be taking the deferred resignation offer.“I do believe [this offer] is likely illegal and the administration will stiff me, but it doesn’t really matter in my case,” she said. “I only signed on to the federal government for the remote and telework benefits, and now that’s gone, I can cut ties and return to my old job, where I made more money, worked fewer days and hours, and had a shorter commute.”A combat veteran federal government worker from the north-west expressed a steely resolve to resist.“We laugh at [Trump] during meetings, trying to make sense of the nonsense spilling out of the White House,” she said. “His disregard for laws, morality and humanity proves how intimidated he is by real Americans making real contributions. I hold the line and dare him to fucking fire me.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsElon MuskUSAidUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Denenea argued that the emails should become public, but the Saints countered that they should be protected.The state court judge handling the case had not formally resolved that dispute when New Orleans’ archdiocese filed for federal bankruptcy protection in May 2020 in an attempt to dispense with numerous pending lawsuits stemming from the church’s decades-old, worldwide clerical child molestation scandal.The bankruptcy not only delayed litigation against the archdiocese indefinitely – it also forced Denenea’s client’s case to be transferred to the federal courthouse in New Orleans.At the new venue, Judge Susie Morgan granted permission to attorneys for the archdiocese to file seven evidentiary exhibits into the case record under seal, Denenea said and court documents showed. The order signed by Morgan on 4 May 2020 directs the courthouse clerk to “take all steps necessary … to ensure that the sealed components … are entered into the record in the above-captioned matter under seal”.Eleven days later, as Denenea said and court documents show, Morgan signed an order permitting archdiocesan attorneys to file 14 additional exhibits into the case record. The order says nothing about those exhibits being sealed or maintained under any protections.It merely directed the court clerk to “take all steps necessary to ensure that the attached … exhibits … are filed in the record of the above-captioned matter”.The email communications involving the Saints and the archdiocese were among those 14 supplementary exhibits, Denenea said he confirmed.Denenea said that evident error – and the fact that the Saints “were relying on the church’s lawyers to protect the [team’s] documents” – prompted him to formally notify the ball club’s lawyers in July “that these emails were not under seal or protected”.“I put them on notice that, if they wanted to protect these documents, they needed to bring it up with the judge in a motion to seal or a motion for a protective order for those documents,” Denenea said.A letter that Denenea sent to Saints lawyer James Gulotta cited a local rule at New Orleans’ US district courthouse which reads: “In recognition of the right of the public to access material filed with the court, no document or other tangible item, or portion thereof, may be filed under seal without the filing of a separate motion and order to seal, unless authorized by a federal statute, federal rule, or prior court order in the same case expressly authorizing the party to file certain documents (or portions thereof) under seal.”Denenea’s letter also said a member of the court clerk’s office had confirmed that the email-related documents were “not sealed by any court order”.Denenea said the Saints’ lawyers took no action despite his notice.“They didn’t do it then,” he said. “They haven’t done it since.”On Tuesday, Gulotta provided the Guardian with a reply he sent to Denenea in July which contended that a protective order in state court applied to the emails and remained in effect. He also cited a 2020 ruling from the federal fifth circuit court in New Orleans reading: “In this circuit, when a case is removed from state court to federal court, the federal court takes the case and it finds and treats the state court rulings as its own.”Gulotta’s letter to Denenea said: “There is no occasion for me, as counsel for the Saints, to file a motion in federal court to preserve the effect of the protective order restricting their disclosure.”In a statement on Tuesday, Gulotta characterized Denenea’s arguments that the emails were unshielded as “erroneous”. His statement also said: “Any disclosure to the public or to the press of the protected documents is and would be a violation of the court order protecting them.”‘Shame on them’: anger and dismay from survivors over Saints clergy-abuse emailsRead moreDenenea on Tuesday countered: “It appears to me that the Saints and their attorneys foolishly relied on the archdiocese and its lawyers in protecting their precious documents.”The Saints and archdiocese emails publicized on Monday mainly establish that Bensel – the team’s vice-president of communications – directly lobbied New Orleans media outlets to focus on exalting Archbishop Gregory Aymond’s courage in releasing a list of local, credibly accused clergy abusers in November 2018, which was meant as an act of conciliation and transparency amid the ongoing fallout of the church’s clerical molestation scandal.He also solicited and frequently received feedback on – and moral support for – the messaging campaign from Benson, who is Aymond’s close personal friend, as well as the Saints and Pelicans president, Dennis Lauscha. Bensel did the same with other powerfulcivic figureswho neither worked for the Saints nor the archdiocese.The Saints have insisted the emails amount to nothing more than well-intended “public relations assistance” with media attention over the clergy-abuse scandal, which in April 2024 left the archdiocese faced with a child sex-trafficking investigation being conducted jointly by state and federal law enforcement.A statement from the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests’ Louisiana chapter on Tuesdaysaidthose emails “signal that the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church is more widespread and insidious than anyone could possibly imagine”.But at a news conference on Monday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodellhailedthe Saints as being “very involved in this community, and they are great corporate citizens”.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseLouisianaCatholicismNew OrleansNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

But with fly-tipping across the UK on the up, will it be possible to find the culprit?Kate McCuskerWed 5 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 11.17 ESTShareSquinting through her car headlights in the early dawn, it looked like some sort of surrealist horror. Weighing just short of 30 tonnes, the enormous pile of rubbish had appeared on Elaine Hutchings’ doorstep in Lichfield overnight. “The road was carnage,” she says. The smell of mildew was nauseating. Granted, Hutchings is only 5ft (1.52 metres) tall – but the heap loomed over her. “I just stood there in shock.”Discernible among the bricks and rubble were toilet seats, office chairs, school exam papers from 15 years ago and, somehow compounding the absurdity of it all, a single hairdryer. “Nothing would surprise me as to what was in there,” says the 54-year-old business director. “It could have cost someone their life. I was so upset that somebody would even consider doing that without a thought for anybody.”On the night of 19 January, two lorries dumped what is likely to be the largest mound of fly-tipped rubbish to grace a UK public road in recent years on Watery Lane. The waste firm drafted in to claw up the 15m-long pile with diggerssaid it was its largest clean-up jobin 30 years. Nearby businesses lost two days’ trade while the road was cleared. It cost the council just short of £10,000.View image in fullscreen‘In Lichfield this is big news’ … Iain Wilkinson.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“Lichfield’s a small city, so this kind of thing isbignews,” says Iain Wilkinson, 43, a university worker. “I’m quite shocked that they actually managed to perpetrate a crime like that on such a scale, because this looks like it’s been heavily premeditated. It almost seems like a gesture of sorts …” Suspicion in the city is still rife. “It makes you wonder whether there was some kind of revenge or something,” says Karen Vanderlinde, 49, who works for the department of health. “Customers are wondering whether it’s malicious,” says Katie Barton, the general manager of local cafe Thyme Kitchen, which was forced to close. “I don’t understand the thought process behind it. It’s very, very odd.”But who was behind this mountain of garbage? It’s a question that local environmental health officers are investigating with vigour. “This is what the guys who do this work livefor. It’s like solving a murder,” says the council’s regulation and enforcement manager, James Johnson.Large-scale fly-tipping is rising in Britain. In England alone, incidents handled by local authorities that were of “tipper lorry load” size increased by 13% between 2021-22 and 2022-23, according to theDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. “The number of instances of fly-tipping is about the same as the previous year, but the quantities are greater,” says Allison Ogden Newton, the CEO of environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy. The annual cost of clearing these mammoth rubbish tips was £13.2m – an increase of 23% on the previous year’s £10.7m.That’s nothing compared with the emotional toll. “It absolutely rips your heart out,” says 70-year-old football manager John Elliott, who last month woke up to six lorry-loads of mattresses, sinks and broken garden fencing that had been fly-tipped in the car park of his club, Oxhey Jets FC, in Watford. It cost the local council about £15,000 to clear it. “This football club has been my life – I built it from the ground up. To have somebody do that to you when you’re scraping the barrel trying to survive, it makes you feel so angry and sick.” The day after the first load was dumped, the perpetrators came back, broke the newly repaired locks, and did it again.A lot of waste crimes happen in plain sight. By law, waste removal businesses must be registered, but on Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace, thousands of unregistered operations offer cheap removals that will probably end with loads being dumped on public roads or private land, with farmers disproportionately bearing the brunt. Somehave complainedof having to turn their land into “medieval forts” to ward off the problem, as they’re liable for the cost of removing any rubbish. In England, waste companies thatdoregister with the Environment Agency require no vetting beyond an online form and the £154 fee.

It’s very odd’ … Katie Barton.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“The system has created opportunities for people to save or make money through fly-tipping,” says Hervé Borrion, a professor of crime science at UCL. And there is much money to be made:many believethe much-cited figure that waste crime costs the English economy alone£1bn a yearis a conservative estimate. “It’s a very high-reward, low-risk crime. You can get £2,000 for one load of waste,” says Sam Corp, head of regulation at the Environmental Services Association. “And even if you doget caught, the penalties aren’t high enough to be a sufficient deterrent. It’s deemed to be a business expense by many criminals.” As Ogden-Newton points out, the average fine for any fly-tipper who makes it to court is £526, “a slap on the wrist compared to how much they’ve probably made, plus the thousands it’s cost the local authority to take it to prosecution”. As for landfill tax evasion – a separate offence – no one has been prosecuted in the 29 years since the tax was introduced in 1996.In Lichfield, Johnson shows me the camo-print cameras his team have stealthily planted at fly-tipping hotspots across the city. “You can put one up a tree!” he says. “Guess how much?” he challenges. £700? “Less than £100! We’vecaughtpeople with this. It’s really effective.” Unfortunately, there was not one up a tree or elsewhere on Watery Lane the night of the fly-tip. Cracking this case may come down to less hi-tech methods: most fly-tippers fail to remove identifying information from the documents they dump amid the builder’s rubble and other garbage.In areas such asBirminghamandBristol, talk of reducing bin collections – to once a fortnight in the former, and to every four weeks in the latter – has left residents worried that things can only get worse. “It’s a constant menace,” says Adrian Collins, a parish councillor in Frenchay, a small village on the edge of Bristol, which has been plagued by fly-tipping in recent weeks. “I would say that fly-tipping used to happen here every couple of months or six weeks – now it’s happening almost weekly. If the plans are rolled out to collect black bins once a month, that could turn the uptick we’ve experienced in the last month into a permanent occurrence.”Of course, not all fly-tipping is the work of complex criminal networks. For those without a car, or those without a computer to book a slot at their local recycling centre, or those unable to pay their council’s collection fee, getting rid of household waste can be a logistical nightmare. “Here, the council charges £50 for the removal of three items,” says Bradford-based photographer Neil Terry, who has been documenting his area’s worsening rubbish problem as the city centre gets a facelift for city of culture 2025. “Most people, frankly, can’t afford that. It’s no wonder that it ends up on the pavement.”View image in fullscreenIn plain sight … rubbish fly-tipped in West Bromwich.Photograph: Adam Hughes/SWNSAt least local authorities are getting better at laying down the law: the number of enforcement actions brought against perpetratorswas up 5%in 2022-23 compared with the previous year in England (though the number of fixed-penalty notices was down by a quarter). Greater investment from central government could be well worth it: Corp points to2014 researchthat every £1 spent on tackling waste crime yields almost £5 in return. “The money allocated to the Environment Agency to tackle fly-tipping pales in comparison to the cost,” he says.As for Lichfield, the road has been cleared, businesses are back open, and Johnson’s investigators are on the warpath. “They’re currently out there working 10- to 12-hour days,” says Johnson. Doors are being knocked on, doorbell cameras are being searched, and they’re pretty sure they know what kind of truck they’re after – “most likely a rigid-bodied HGV with a tipper on the back or a roll-on, roll-off skip,” he says, with impressive specificity. He doesn’t yet know whodunnit, but he’s sure of one thing: “Theyreallymade a mistake dumping this in Lichfield.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The list in the modern economy is virtually endless.And all have unique properties that are almost irreplaceable or can be substituted only at prohibitive costs.Neodymium and dysprosium, for example, allow the fabrication of almost permanent, super-strong magnets that require little maintenance, making viable the placement of ocean wind turbines to generate electricity far from the coastline.Trump said Monday he wanted to reach a deal in which Kyiv guaranteed supplies of rare earths in return for US aid, an idea floated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last year.Where does most of the world’s current supply of rare earths come from?For decades, China has made the most of its rare earth reserves by investing massively in refining operations – often without the strict environmental oversight required in western countries.China has also filed a huge number of patents on rare earth production, an obstacle to companies in other countries hoping to launch large-scale processing.As a result, while rare earths reserves are plentiful elsewhere, many firms find it cheaper to ship their unprocessed ore to China for refining, further reinforcing the world’s reliance.The US and EU get most of their supply from China, but both are trying to boost their own production and better recycle what they use to reduce dependence on Beijing.At the height of a US-China trade dispute in 2019, Chinese state media suggested that rare earth exports to the United States could be cut in retaliation for American measures. Japan saw first-hand the pain of a cut-off in 2010, when China halted rare earth exports over a territorial conflict.Since then, Tokyo has pushed hard to diversify supplies, signing deals with the Australian group Lynas for production from Malaysia.How do they differ from ‘critical minerals’?Rare earths are among the elements designated as critical minerals in the US, but not the whole list.Among the measures announced by Beijing in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods coming into effect isexport controls on certain critical minerals, though none of them are rare earths.China’s Commerce Ministry and its Customs Administration said the country is imposing export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium to “safeguard national security interests”.Tungsten, tellurium, bismuth and indium aredesignated critical mineralsby the US Geological Survey – materials that are essential for advanced technologies, clean energy, and national security.Explore more on these topicsUS newsChinaUkraineIndiaEuropeAsia PacificShareReuse this content"

Andrew Roth reports“China is operating thePanama canaland we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”Donald Trump’s claim in his inauguration speech that Panama had “broken its promises” to the US was alarming for many Panamanians. Washington relinquished control of the canal in 1977, so why is Trump pressing the issue now?“For many Panamanians, this is a settled understanding that they administrate the canal, that they’ve been running it for decades,” the Guardian’s global affairs correspondent,Andrew Roth, tellsHannah Moore.“For Donald Trump to come out and make basically two claims – first of all, that the canal is mismanaged, and second of all, that China is running the canal - it’s almost like an insult to the national pride of many Panamanians.”Andrew explains the political resonance of the issue for older voters in the US, where the claims about Chinese influence have come from, and why an old grudge involving one of Trump’s hotels might also be part of his motivation.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Mark Schiefelbein/ReutersExplore more on these topicsPanama canalToday in FocusPanamaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericas"

We want peace,” Jacqueline Ngengele, one of those who attended, told AFP.The president of DRC, Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, are due to attend a joint summit of the eight-country East African Community and 16-member Southern African Development Community in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam on Saturday.A day earlier, the UN Human Rights Council will convene a special session on the crisis, at the DRC’s request.Fears the violence could lead to a wider conflict have galvanised regional bodies, mediators such as Angola and Kenya, as well as the UN, EU and other countries in diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution.But the DRC’s top diplomat accused the international community of being all talk and no action on the conflict.“We see a lot of declarations but we don’t see actions,” foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner told journalists in Brussels.Wary of the crisis spilling over,several neighbouring countries have already said they are bolstering their defences.A UN expert report said last year that Rwanda had up to 4,000 troops in the DRC, seeking to profit from its vast mineral wealth, and that Rwanda has “de facto” control over the M23.The eastern DRC has deposits of coltan, a metallic ore that is vital in making phones and laptops, as well as gold and other minerals.Rwanda has never explicitly admitted to military involvement in support of the M23 and alleges that the DRC supports and shelters the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

A large proportion of the bacteria sampled had genes linked to antimicrobial resistance.The nature of the study means that it cannot prove that the flies were spreading the bacteria, but Dr Chioma Achi, the project lead and co-author of thepaper, said it was a “very worrying” indicator.The findings demonstrated that flies “could be vectors for antimicrobial resistance” in hospitals in tropical low- and middle-income countries, where they are “abundant”, she said.Achi said: “Flies are coprophagic – they eat faeces, they eat manure. Those who have an infection pass it in the faeces, the flies take it up and can perch on the hospital surfaces or even on food, on environments that people touch – so that could be a factor [in the spread of infection].”Dr Kirsty Sands, scientific lead at the Ineos Oxford Institute for antimicrobial research, and co-author of the paper, said the findings “imply that flies circulating in hospital wards could pose a threat to patients who are vulnerable to infection during their stay, especially as flies commonly land on patients”.Drug-resistant infections are on the rise. so why aren’t we getting any new antibiotics?Read moreNigeria ranks20th out of 204 countriesfor AMR death rates, with 263,400 deaths linked to AMR in 2019.The paper, published in the Environment International journal, builds on the team’sprevious researchin a Pakistan hospital. That study found ants, spiders, flies and cockroaches carrying multidrug-resistant bacteria, and links between those bacteria and those found at patients’ surgical site infections.Achi said the research demonstrated the importance of considering the connection between human and animal environments in order to tackle the problem of AMR.The team are planning further research to find out whether insect control methods, such as window screens and bed nets, can lower rates of AMR in hospitals. The Nigerian study also serves as a pilot for a larger multi-country study on insects and AMR in hospitals.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthDrug resistanceAntibioticsHealthInsectsNigerianewsShareReuse this content"

UN peacekeepers, however, have been unable to visit the prison to investigate further because of restrictions imposed by the M23 rebels, meaning the identity of the perpetrators remains unclear.On Tuesday, it emerged that about 2,000 bodies were still awaiting burial in Goma after M23 fighters seized Goma, capital of the DRC’s North Kivu province, on 27 January.Van de Perre, who is now based in Goma with thousands of UN peacekeeping troops deployed to protect citizens, said: “There was a major prison breakout of 4,000 escaped prisoners. A few hundred women were also in that prison.“They were all raped and then they set fire to the women’s wing. They all died afterwards.”This week the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) warned thatsexual violencewas being used as a weapon of war by rival armed groups in Goma.The city, home to more than one million people, is under the total control of M23 forces. But in an unforeseen development late on Monday, themilitia announced a unilateral “ceasefire”.Until then, fears had been mounting that Rwanda was determined to take more territory from its vast neighbour, withM23 forces steadily heading southtowards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province 120 miles (190km) from Goma.A statement from a political-military coalition called the Alliance Fleuve Congo (Congo River Alliance) – of which M23 is a member – announced it had “no intention of taking control of Bukavu or other localities”.View image in fullscreenCongolese civilians displaced in fighting between M23 rebels and the DRC army take refuge near a church in Goma. Thousands of bodies await burial in the city.Photograph: Arlette Bashizi/ReutersResponding to news of the unexpected ceasefire, Van de Perre said: “I hope it stays that way because they [M23] were already moving in the direction of Bukavu with reinforcements and heavy weaponry, which can be seen passing [along] the streets in Goma.“If they retreat, that’s good news. Otherwise, we’ll have a new clash with potentially thousands of additional deaths.”She said M23 may have had a sudden rethink after reinforcements from Burundi arrived in Bukavu and a nearby airport was used by the Congolese air force.“The Burundians have sent 2,000 extra troops to Bukavu, and they are very good fighters. I think M23 is currently rethinking their next steps.”Despite evidence to the contrary, Rwanda denies it is backing the M23 or that its forces have crossed into eastern Congo.‘I curse this war’: hunger and fear in Goma after rebel takeoverRead moreHowever, Van de Perre, part of the UN peacekeeping force known as Monusco, said her colleagues had spotted Rwandan soldiers during patrols.Van de Perre urged the UN security council to increase the pressure on Rwanda. “We really need to get back to the negotiating table. And that is only possible if the members of the security council and other important countries exert enough pressure on Rwanda and Congo,” she said.Previously, another senior UN official had speculated that theDRC’s neighbour wanted to annex a chunk of DRC larger than Rwanda itself. “This is a long-term policy to get the broader Kivu area into the sphere of Rwandan influence and, later, under complete administrative control,” they said.Speaking before the ceasefire was announced late on Monday, Van de Perre said she was anxious about reports that groups were preparing for a counter-attack. “We already have reports that in certain places people are gathering and organising,” she said.Van de Perre said she was in “constant dialogue” with M23 officers in charge of Goma and that humanitarian conditions in the city were dire.Crossing the city was difficult, she said. “They [the M23] allow us to bring food and water to our bases, but apart from that we can barely move around.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaConflict and armsUnited NationsWar crimesWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The Argentinian was one of three Latin American presidents to attend Trump’s inauguration at the Capitol, alongside El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele and Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa.‘Financial suffocation’: Argentina’s medics fear impact of Milei’s chainsaw cutsRead moreTokatlian cautioned that Milei might be overestimating what Trump has to offer in return. “Argentina has so many vulnerabilities. Does this government think it will solve them by getting closer to Washington? Washington has shown it doesn’t care much whether it’s a friend, an enemy, a partner, or not,” he said.“It’s worth remembering that, in his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on Argentina for steel and aluminium … He doesn’t care if you’re an ally or an opponent. Trump will continue with his style,” said Tokatlian.Since taking office,Milei has implemented a series of austerity measures in state healthcare, the latest of which included 1,400 layoffs at the ministry of health in January – among them, 30% of the vaccine directorate staff, and 40% of the HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis response directorate team.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsArgentinaWorld Health OrganizationTrump administrationAmericasHealthDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Andrew Roth reports“China is operating thePanama canaland we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”Donald Trump’s claim in his inauguration speech that Panama had “broken its promises” to the US was alarming for many Panamanians. Washington relinquished control of the canal in 1977, so why is Trump pressing the issue now?“For many Panamanians, this is a settled understanding that they administrate the canal, that they’ve been running it for decades,” the Guardian’s global affairs correspondent,Andrew Roth, tellsHannah Moore.“For Donald Trump to come out and make basically two claims – first of all, that the canal is mismanaged, and second of all, that China is running the canal - it’s almost like an insult to the national pride of many Panamanians.”Andrew explains the political resonance of the issue for older voters in the US, where the claims about Chinese influence have come from, and why an old grudge involving one of Trump’s hotels might also be part of his motivation.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Mark Schiefelbein/ReutersExplore more on these topicsPanama canalToday in FocusPanamaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericas"

In 2023, a US government report said 30% of small packages coming into the US were fromtwo Chinese e-commerce companies, Shein and Temu, alone. The USPS declined to answer further questions.On Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry criticised the US measures and expressed “strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition”.“As a matter of principle, I want to point out that we urge the United States to stop politicising trade and economic issues and using them as tools, and to stop the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies,” Lin Jian, a ministry spokesperson, told a regular press briefing.Lin defended China’s counter-tariffs as “necessary to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests”, but said there were “no winners in a trade war”.Later in the day the World Trade Organization confirmed that China had initiated a dispute over the levies, which Beijing has described as “malicious”.On Tuesday, moments after Trump’s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect, Beijing said it was imposinglevies on importsof US energy, vehicles and equipment. On Wednesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said the 10% tariffs would also apply to products from Hong Kong, Reuters reported.Earlier, Trump suspended threatened duties against Mexico and Canada for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and undocumented migrants into the US.Big tech to tungsten: what industries are the focus of China’s new US tariffs?Read moreTrump had signalled earlier that the talks with Xi could take place early this week, but addressing reporters at the White House on Tuesday afternoon he said he was in “no rush” to speak with him.Stock markets wavered as investors braced for volatile market activity in the coming weeks over Trump’s threatened tariffs on his country’s three biggest goods trading partners.Trump imposed fresh 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against Washington’s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25% tariffs.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but on Tuesday said she had no “updates on when that call will take place”.“He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country. That was the reason for this tariff,” Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing.China unveiled 15% levies on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the US, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles and pickup trucks face 10% duties.Beijing says it will also investigate Google and the US fashion group that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.China’s government said the measures were in response to the “unilateral tariff hike” by Washington.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Research shows that China has sought outalternative marketsfor its agriculture imports, even while the United States remains reliant on Chinese import demand,” Tan said.Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, saying that tariff is the “most beautiful” word in the dictionary.The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on his threatened tariffs.Talks will continue for the next month on broader pacts.Mexico said on Tuesday it had begun deploying 10,000 border troops as promised to Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.

More than 91% of parcels valued under €150 came from China, where Temu andSheinmake and dispatch most of their goods.In a policy paper published on Wednesday, the commission said it would work with national customs authorities in the EU’s 27 member states to focus on unsafe products sold online, including stepping up market surveillance and testing.The increase in cheap products bought online is increasing pressure on customs authorities, the commission said. It called on EU lawmakers – member states and MEPs – to remove the duty exemption on imports priced below €150, in line with proposals from May 2023.“In response to the surge of low value e-commerce imports, it is critical to finalise our customs union reform,” said the European commissioner for trade, Maroš Šefčovič. He also suggested European lawmakers impose a handling fee on retailers to cover the soaring costs of supervising compliance with EU rules.The EU executive is concerned about the environmental damage caused by the flood of cheap imports, from the pollution involved in their production and transport to the “serious challenges” posed to European recycling authorities, left to deal with low-quality, toxic or hard-to-recycle products.It urged lawmakers tospeed up work on a draft lawthat would mean manufacturers of textiles and footwear would pay fees to fund rubbish collection and treatment.The clampdown comes after Donald Trump’s 10% tariffs on Chinese goodsclosed a legal loopholethat allowed China’s fast-fashion companies to ship goods under $800 (£638) into the US duty-free.Provoking fury from Beijing, the US Postal Service announced late on Tuesday that it was suspending parcels fromChinaand Hong Kong, giving no reason for the decision. On Wednesday it reversed that decision and restored incoming deliveries.Last October, the commissionstarted legal actionagainst the Chinese online marketplace Temu over concerns that it was failing to stop the sale of illegal products.

The treaty, signed by Māori chiefs and the British Crown is considered New Zealand’s founding document and is instrumental in upholdingMāorirights.Bill to reinterpret founding treaty with Māori would make New Zealand a ‘laughing stock’, MPs toldRead moreHundreds of protesters from the Toitū te Tiriti movement, which led thelargest ever protest over Māori rightsin 2024, departed the grounds as the government delegation arrived, leaving behind a largely empty peninsula.“We are sick of talking to ears that will not listen, and to minds that will not change,” leaderEru Kapa-Kingitold the crowd, before they left.Later, when ministers stood to speak in front of the marae (meeting house), prominentMāorileaders and a group of women from Ngāpuhi iwi (tribes) turned their backs.“[We] are turning our backs on them, we don’t want to listen, we have had enough,” Hinerangi Himiona told the Guardian, adding this was the first time in 80 years that this form of protest had been used at the grounds.The women, cloaked in red blankets stitched with messages and symbols of Māori sovereignty, wept quietly as they stood shoulder to shoulder – tears, Himiona explained, for the hundreds of Indigenous children in state care, for the significant population of Māori in prison and for the endless battle for Māori rights.“There is a lot to cry about, and there is a lot to be angry about – we hope that we represented the mamaetanga [hurt] of our people well,” Himiona said.The signing New Zealand’s founding document has been commemorated as a public holiday on 6 February since 1974, with events around the country, and a formal multi-day celebration held at the Waitangi grounds. It is as much a festive time of music, food and community as it is a forum for political discussion about sovereignty, equality and history and has often been the scene of demonstrations, with Māori protesting against the lack of progress made in tackling inequality and ongoing breaches of the treaty.Last year, prime minister Christopher Luxon and his coalition partnersfaced protest and boosover its policies, which many fear are rolling back Māori rights. This year, Luxon was absent, choosing instead to attend a Waitangi event in the South Island – a decision that sparked accusations of cowardice from opposition parties and some Indigenous leaders.With a missing prime minister and no discernible change in his government’s policy direction for Māori, the reception at Waitangi turned ice-cold.Since taking office, the coalition government’s broaderpolicy direction for Māori– including sweeping rollbacks to policies designed to improve Māori health and wellbeing – has promptedstrident criticism.View image in fullscreenProtesters turn their backs as politicians are welcomed onto the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on the eve of Waitangi Day.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesFew policies have angered Māori as much as the rightwing minor Act party’streaty principles bill, which proposes to radically alter the way the treaty is interpreted. The bill, which ismoving through parliament’s select committeeprocess, does not have widespread support and is unlikely to become law. However, its introduction has prompted anger from many who believe it is creating division and undermining the treaty.The bill’s architect, Act party leader David Seymour, received the frostiest reception on Wednesday – not only were backs turned, his microphone was twice taken away from him during his speech.“Here are some problems that you can’t turn your back on because the numbers do not lie,” he said in response to the protest. “Māori home ownership. Māori school attendance. Māori victimisation by criminals … none of it is getting better,” he said.“If this is what a treaty partnership looks like, how is it working out for Māori?”Speaking to reporters after the event, Seymour said his microphone could be taken away but not his ideas.“You can try and suppress ideas, but actually, people have an ability to decide what they think for themselves … I think it’s important that the message gets out, regardless of people trying to interfere with your ability.”Coalition ministers expressed their concerns over the day’s interactions. National party minister Paul Goldsmith said it was “disappointing” the microphone had been taken away, while minister Shane Jones, from New Zealand First, described the event as a “circus” and threatened to pull funding from the Waitangi National Trust unless it decided to “buck up its ideas”.Opposition politicians voiced their support for those airing their concerns to the government, while opposition Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Seymour was attempting to provoke a reaction through his attendance and that is what he got.The Ngāti Wai leader responsible for removing the microphone, Aperahama Edwards, told the NZ Herald that Seymour had been asked not to speak at Waitangi and that his presence caused discomfort.“When he didn’t listen, I took the microphone,” Edwards said.Ngāpuhi leader Waihoroi Shortland returned it to Seymour but hoped protesters turning their backs delivered a powerful message.“Everything we have wanted to say about the [treaty principles] bill has been said, everything he has had to say has been said,” Shortland said.“We’re not going to hear anything new, so let’s try silence.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMāoriIndigenous peoplesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The Italian government has not responded to a request for comment on whether it is a client of Paragon.Critic of Italy-Libya migration pact told he was target of Israeli spywareRead moreLike other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its wares to government agencies, who are meant to use it to track criminals. The company has said it sells its spyware only to democratic countries. It has declined to comment on WhatsApp’s allegation that its spyware was used to target journalists and activists residing in two dozen countries, some withinEurope.Responding to the allegations late on Wednesday, Meloni’s office denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged breaches.In a statement, her office said the government believed the allegations were “particularly serious” and instructed the national cybersecurity agency (ACN) to look into the matter. ACN spoke with Advant, a law firm appointed by WhatsApp Ireland, and it emerged that the number of Italian users so far affected “appeared to be seven”.The statement said ACN was not provided with the identities of the users, however it emerged that the users involved, other thanItaly, had phone numbers with international prefixes including Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.Under the Biden administration, Paragon agreed a $2m contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but the deal was put on hold after questions were raised about the arrangement’s compliance with an executive order that restricted the use of spyware by the federal government, in case its use represented a “significant counterintelligence or security risk”.The executive order has not been rescinded by the Trump administration.Neither Paragon nor ICE commented on the status of the contract.Paragon has a US office in Chantilly, Virginia. John Fleming, a former CIA veteran, is executive chair of Paragon US.For now, the focus is on whether Italy has used the spyware.“It has become clear; Italy has a Paragon problem. Given the cases that have already quickly come forward, it’s time to ask: who was the customer? And how far do these cases go?,” said John Scott Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital surveillance of civil society.A person close to Paragon declined to comment on the identify of its clients but said it “would not deny” that Italy was a client.Casarini has been a prominent activist figure in Italy for decades, but in an interview with the Guardian said his primary focus was now the maritime rescue NGO he founded in 2018. He was on a train heading to Bologna, he said, when he got a “ping” on his phone from WhatsApp. He joked that he initially wondered why Mark Zuckerberg – whose Meta owns WhatsApp – was messaging him. He was one of 90 people to get the alert that he had been targeted by an unknown assailant using military-grade spyware.‘Why did we give back this alleged criminal?’ Pressure grows on Meloni after Italy releases wanted Libyan police chiefRead moreWhen Paragon’s hacking software, which is called Graphite, successfully infects a phone, it can access all its information, including encrypted messages sent via Signal and WhatsApp. WhatsApp has said targets were added to chat groups and sent malicious PDFs. They did not need to click on anything to be infected, it would have happened automatically, experts say.“This is a war against solidarity, activism, against helping migrants,” he said, adding that he was already facing a trial for alleged “illegal” aid to migrants.While he was surprised at the severity of the alleged surveillance attempt against him, Casarini also expressed defiance.“I want that them to know that they can find me. But I can also find them. We can organize to defend ourselves, to protect ourselves against authoritarian activity,” he said.Recently, he has spoken out against the Italian government’s decision last month to allow a Libyan general accused of war crimes and wanted by the international criminal court, Osama Najim, to return home on an Italian secret service flight, in whatcritics have said was an attempt to shield alleged abuses committed in Libyain connection to the country’s migrant pact with Italy.WhatsApp has not publicly identified how long the targets may have been under surveillance. The targeting was discovered in December and was then shut down.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppItalyGiorgia MeloniEuropeHackingCybercrimeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Police did not confirm his identity but said the suspect had no known connection to criminal gangs. There was nothing, they said, to suggest he had acted on ideological grounds.“We still believe that it is a one-man operation. We will return to the exact motives,” said Eid Forest.Lars Bröms, the police’s head of operations for identification work, later said he hoped that all the victims would be identified within 48 hours but that in some cases they were still trying to reach the relatives.1:19'Extremely shocked': Swedish king pays tribute to victims of Örebro shooting – videoThe Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson; his justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer; and King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia visited the site of the school in Örebro on Wednesday afternoon, where they laid flowers, before attending a remembrance service.“It’s horrible. It’s hard to take in the vastness,” he said, urging people not to speculate. “In time, we will get the answers, and then we can also draw conclusions.”Eid Forest said the reason it took so long to inform the public about the death toll was the size of the school premises. “It took a very long time to search and ensure that we didn’t have any more injuries,” he said.1:26Multiple people dead in 'worst mass shooting' in Swedish history – video reportJonas Claesson, the director of health and medical services for the Örebro region, said five of the six people admitted to hospital had initially life-threatening gunshot wounds and were now stable after undergoing surgery. Two of them were being treated in intensive care. A sixth person had minor injuries. Four were women and two, men.Police urged anybody who was at the school on Tuesday or had footage of the attack to come forward. They asked the public to share only confirmed information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everyone stands behind them. This is a terrible experience that Sweden has had to go through.”The queen admitted she was “finding it a little bit difficult to talk”, saying: “I have a big wish for the whole of the Swedish people. Where did the beautiful Sweden go? I really want to ask everyone to help build it up again. To strengthen, I don’t want to say the reputation, but the name. What it means to be Swedish.”Johanna Sollerman, who works in crime strategy in the municipality and is a crisis manager, said it was in the process of setting up centres around the city where victims’ families and members of the community could speak to social workers, members of the Red Cross and representatives of churches and mosques.“We’re going to live with this as a mark for a very long time. However, what we are starting to see is civil society together with the municipality and police really rallying around for citizens of Örebro,” she said.She said Campus Risbergska mostly ran education courses for adults, including for those learning Swedish, training in professions such as nursing, and studying to go to university.Schools in the municipality had been training and practising for how to stop such an incident, she said. “For a few years now we’ve been training on how schools should act to stop a lone actor. We’ve been training in that because we know it can happen.”The municipality had taken a proactive approach to mapping criminals and gangs, she said, but “this kind of situation is very difficult for us to detect”.Pia Rizell, a spokesperson for Sweden’s teachers union Sveriges Lärare and a Örebro resident, said everyone was deeply shocked. “This is the deadliest mass shooting we have had in our history and it’s at a school, where you should be safe as a teacher and as a student,” she said.The shooting is already prompting some headteachers to question security in Swedish schools, which are often on open campuses. Marcus Hedström, the principal of Tunaskolan in Luleå, said he was looking at keeping the school doors permanently locked and installing cameras. “The principal and management have the responsibility to ensure that the school is a safe place. If that means we need to lock the doors, then we will do so,” he told SVT.Kersti Freed-Klermar, a spokesperson for Swedish Peace and Arbitration Association in Örebro, joined crowds outside St Nicolai church. Although polarisation has been on the rise in Sweden, she said she felt a strong sense of unity there. “It created a feeling that we need to care about each other,” she said. “Light is better than hate.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think so. If there have been alliances, it’s because of the threat from the far right. We need this united front of a united and popular left,” he said.Bayrou’s travails are not over. He will use article 49.3 to push through two more social security bills in the next week, prompting two more censure motions from LFI.The PS has said it intends to lodge its own no-confidence motion, possibly next week, over Bayrou’s comment – deemed xenophobic by many – that the French were “feeling submerged by immigration”.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronMarine Le PennewsShareReuse this content"

Starmer has previously called that summit “very important”.Since entering Downing Street, Starmer has shown a similar interest to his predecessor in AI, but unlike Sunak he has chosen to focus more heavily on the opportunities the technology can bring. Last month the prime ministergave a speechon the technology in which he said: “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers.”Alan Mak, the shadow science and innovation secretary, said: “The Conservatives hosted the first AI safety summit, establishing the UK as a world leader in the sector.“Keir Starmer is threatening that legacy and further damaging Britain’s leadership on the world stage by spurning this important summit.”Next week’s summit is being seen in Paris as a key moment in Macron’s presidency and a test of his clout on the international stage.Franceis keen to use the gathering to talk about how to provide clean power for AI and how to mitigate disruption to the labour market.Macron has put great store by his AI strategy, saying that mastering the technology was an “existential challenge” for France.“The president wants to make it a kind of AI version of Choose France,” an Elysée spokesperson said. “Choose France is the annual summit aimed at proving how attractive the country is to major foreign corporations.”A source close to the president told French reporters recently: “This is going to be the thing for Emmanuel Macron, and he has high expectations of it. The Élysée Palace is working very hard on this.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Keir StarmerEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

The crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has ruled out normalising ties without the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, the foreign ministry said in a statement.Jordan’s King Abdullah, who faces a difficult face-to-face meeting with Trump in Washington next week, also rejected “any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians”.It was not the first time he had made Jordan’s position clear. The country already hosts more than 2.7 million Palestinian refugees and accepting people from Gaza under duress would have a destabilising effect.Egypt’s foreign ministry said reconstruction needed to happen “without Palestinians leaving the territory”. It has previously warned any attempt to transfer people out of Gaza to the Sinai would threaten the peace deal.Late on Wednesday Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, said any “forced displacement” of Gaza’s population would be “unacceptable”.“It would be a serious violation of international law, an obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilising force for Egypt and Jordan,” the two leaders said, according to a statement from the French presidency.The US president had anticipated and shrugged off these refusals in advance, perhaps confident that both countries are vulnerable because of their reliance on American money and weapons.“The king in Jordan and the general in Egypt will open their hearts and give us the kind of land we need to get this done,” Trump said at the press conference, after laying out plans for the US takeover.But the political and security implications of taking in large numbers of people from Gaza under duress will be a powerful counterbalance to even the most aggressive threats from the White House.Trump’s comments came at the start of negotiations for a second stage of the ceasefire deal in Gaza, and sparked fears that they could threaten talks, although the framework deal defers any long-term planning for Gaza’s future to a third stage.A spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, a host and key mediator in the last round of talks, said they were focusing on extending the current agreement, due to expire at the end of the month.“I don’t think it’s a time now to start commenting on specific ideas,” spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told Fox News. “It’s too early to talk about this, because we don’t know how this war will end.”Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, embraced Trump’s comments as vindication of his decision to stay in Netanyahu’s government, despite his fierce opposition to the ceasefire and hostage release deal.The US plan would “finally bury, with God’s help, the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state”, he said in a triumphant statement, celebrating the prospect of US power deployed to force Palestinians out of Gaza. “Believe me, this is just the beginning.”Rival far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir suggested Trump’s proposal would effectively negate the need for ceasefire talks, which have been overshadowed from the start by lack of any Israeli plans for post-conflict Gaza.“The only solution to Gaza is to encourage the migration of Gazans … this is the strategy for the ‘day after’,” Ben-Gvir said.“I call on the prime minister to announce the adoption of the plan as soon as possible and to begin immediate practical progress.”One of Netanyahu’s biggest political rivals, Benny Gantz, also backed Trump’s plans to resettle Palestinians outside Gaza as “admirable”, and said Israel has “nothing to lose from it, only something to gain”.Only politicians from Israel’s relatively small leftwing parties openly opposed Trump’s proposals, with Gilad Kariv from the Democrats party describing it as “a nightmare for Israel” and Ayman Odeh from the Joint List warning that “a transfer will not happen and will not bring security”.Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau in Gaza, said Palestinians there had shown their “steadfastness” over 15 months of intense attacks, and any US troops sent to the territory would face the same opposition as the Israeli military.“What the occupation has failed to do, no American administration or power in the world will succeed in implementing,” he said.Quique Kierszenbaumcontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump actively courted those groups andpolls indicatehe made significant gains.Protests against the Biden administration’s stance led to more than700,000“uncommitted” votes in the Democratic primaries, an attempt to pressure Joe Biden to shift course.Layla Elabed, the co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement responded to Trump’s remarks andsaidthat she felt “sad, angry, and scared for our communities”.The Uncommitted movement opposed a Trump presidency, but ultimately declined toendorse Kamala Harris, citing her “unwillingness to shift” on Biden’s policies.View image in fullscreenLayla Elabed, co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement speaks in a press conference the day after the Michigan presidential primary in Dearborn in February 2024.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“For months, we warned about the dangers of Trump at home and abroad but our calls largely went unheard,” Elabed wrote. Harris, she said, “left a vacuum by not visiting Michigan families impacted by US-supplied bombs to help create a permission structure for their trust while Trump visited Dearborn and filled a community in despair with lies”.She continued: “Trump’s illegal calls for ethnic cleansing are horrific but as on so many other issues, Democrats had a chance to persuade voters they were the better alternative and they blew it.”James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, which conducted an October poll of Arab American voters,noted at the timethat in the institute’s 30 years of polling, it had not “witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior”. Anotherrecent pollfound that 29% of 2020 Biden voters who opted for a different candidate than Harris in 2024 cited “ending Israel’s violence in Gaza” as their top issue.On Wednesday, Zogby described Trump’s comments about the US taking Gaza in an interview as “dangerous, provocative, illegal and callously insensitive to Palestinian needs”.“Anyone who knows the region knows Palestinians are not going to leave,” he said. “And if they want to go anywhere, it’s back to their villages inIsraelthey were expelled from in 1948.”Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan whose family is of Palestinian origin, compared Trump’s proposal on Tuesday to ethnic cleansing.“If the United States deploys troops to forcibly remove Muslims and Christians – like my cousins – from Gaza, then not only will the US be mired in another reckless occupation but it will also be guilty of the crime of ethnic cleansing,”he said. “No American of good conscience should stand for this.Wa’el Alzayat, the chief executive officer of EmgageUSA, a Muslim American advocacy organization, said that “evicting people from their land is a violation of international law” and that sending US troops to Gaza was not only “deeply problematic” but also, he imagined, “politically very unpopular”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She ultimately endorsed Harris.“Everyone failed,” she said. “Everyone is responsible for the moment that we are in today. The idea that voters do not carry any responsibility is untenable and absurd. The idea that candidates don’t carry any responsibility is untenable and absurd.”Romman added: “No fascist here or abroad will ever be able to erase Palestinians,” adding that the “harder they try the deeper our roots will grow”.Hudhayfah Ahmad, the director of media relations for the Abandon Harris campaign, which supported Jill Stein, said in a statement: “The Biden-Harris administration’s full, unobstructed support for Israel’s campaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing has failed to remove the Palestinians of Gaza from their land.”“It is not Trump – just as it was not Biden or Harris – who decides what the Palestinians can or cannot do; that decision belongs solely to the people of Palestine,” Ahmad said.In response to finger-pointing at voters who turned on Harris, Waleed Shahid, a former organizer for the Uncommitted movement and a Democratic strategist, called for introspection.“Democratic party elites find it easier to punch down on grieving Palestinian families in Michigan desperate for a basic shift in their party’s policy than to challenge decisions made by Biden and Harris,” Shahidwrote. “But this is why Democrats lose – they don’t listen to voters; they sneer at them.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

His remarkson his social media site, Truth Socialrepresent the clearest sign that Trump is willing to hold talks with Iran to try to replace the nuclear deal signed in 2015, but from which Trump pulled the US out in 2018.He said he did not mind whether he rang the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to start the talks or the Iranian leader initiated the process. He also said: “There are many people at the top ranks ofIranthat do not want to have a nuclear weapon.” He also predicted “we will have a big celebration in the Middle East the day the deal is signed”.Trump’s social media posting came after he held talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and also signed a presidential memorandum that instructs the US Treasury and state department to implement a campaign aimed at “driving Iran’s oil exports to zero”.He also pointedly contradicted a reporter, saying he regarded Iran as strong, remarks that undercut Netanyahu’s claim that the parlous state of Iranian defences make it an opportune time to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites. Netanyahu has long argued with successive US presidents that Iran is bent on covertly building a nuclear weapon.Trump’s remarks will provoke bitter divisions within Iran about whether an agreement to constrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions will ever lead to a lifting of sanctions.Pezeshkian responded to the threat of maximum economic sanctions by saying: “With the reserves we have, we can solve the country’s problems. We are a powerful country. Our reserves and resources are exceptional in the world.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, claimed maximum pressure was a failed experiment, and trying it again would lead to another failure.But he added: “If Trump’s main issue is that Iran does not pursue nuclear weapons, that is achievable and there is no problem.”Araghchi said: “Iran’s positions are clear, it is a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, adding there was a leadership fatwa preventing Iran from building nuclear weapons.The foreign ministry has been trying to prepare the domestic ground for opening talks with Trump for weeks, but knows there is a large faction opposed to engaging with the US, even if it means economic sanctions weigh the economy down.Trump portrayed himself as a man that had signed the presidential memorandum against Iran reluctantly, adding he hoped the measures would never need to be used. He said at the signing ceremony: “So this is one that I am torn about. I am signing this, but I am unhappy to do it.” A memorandum has less force in law than an executive order.Iranian officials argued that the US attempt to weaken Iran’s already heavily sanctioned economy would be hard to achieve since the bulk of Iranian revenue comes through the export of oil to China, often via intermediaries.The imposition of extra sanctions was seen as a bargaining chip before negotiations on a nuclear deal akin to the imposition of tariffs on other countries.So far the Iranian foreign ministry has led in the two rounds of talks in Geneva with the three European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal: France, Germany and the UK. Europe has warned that it will move to reapply UN sanctions in September if a new deal is not agreed by then to replace the 2015 deal that expires this year.Nothing in what Trump said gave any clue as to the kind of assurances the US would need to reach a deal, and to be sure Iran has no intent to build a nuclear bomb. He did not indicate the US would be seeking a wider deal with Iran that seeks to constrain its support for proxy forces in the region.Iran has slashed the access UN weapons inspectors have to Iran’s nuclear sites. Both the UN inspectorate, the IAEA and the European countries have said it is possible Iran has acquired irreversible knowledge on how to build nuclear weapons.Ismail Baghaei, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “The claim that Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons is a big lie that has been proven wrong many times, and if someone is looking for certainty about such an issue, it is easily obtainable.”He added that unlike Israel “which is not a member of any international treaty banning weapons of mass destruction and explicitly threatened to use nuclear weapons in the war against the people of Gaza, the Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the non-proliferation treaty and Iran’s nuclear programme is under the full supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with safeguards agreements. Basically, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers weapons of mass destruction to be haram [forbidden] for solid Islamic and humanitarian reasons.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsIran nuclear dealUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

If true, this would have great legal significance, even if this is unlikely to have been one of the president’s primary concerns. However, the claim is systematically contradicted by Palestinians in the territory and elsewhere.‘We would rather die here than leave’: Palestinians on Trump’s plan for GazaRead moreMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, on Wednesday called for the UN to “protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights”, saying that what Trump wanted to do would be “a serious violation of international law”.In addition, Martin Lemberg-Pedersen, an associate professor at the University of Warwick, said that by describing Gaza as a “demolition site” and so a place where human life could not be sustained, Trump had made an implicit admission that Israel had violated principles of discrimination and proportionality during its offensive in Gaza.The Israeli offensive reduced swaths of the territory to rubble, destroying schools, homes, roads, clinics, sanitation systems, farms and much more. Huge areas of ruins are contaminated by chemicals andunexploded bombs.Lemberg-Pedersen said Trump’s vocabulary had been revealing, and historic given his office and the implications of his statement.“Trump referred to Gaza as a demolition site and said that those who go back there would die … That appears to be an admission that the Israeli offensive has resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure to the point where it cannot sustain people,” Lemberg-Pedersen said.The Geneva conventions and Rome statute forbid attacks which do not distinguish between military targets and civilians or civilian homes and infrastructure, unless absolutely necessary for military operations. Collective punishment, including mass displacement and targeting of entire communities, is strictly prohibited.Singer said that in the ICJ’s July 2024 advisory opinion, forcible transfer included coercion where civilians had no choice but to leave because to remain would put their lives at risk.“So you have to leave because you have no options, when the alternative would be starvation, for example,” Singer told the Guardian.Trump said current residents of Gaza would be moved and resettled “permanently” to be replaced by “the world’s people” who would inhabit an“international, unbelievable place”, though he added that many people including Palestinians would live there.Volker Türk, UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Wednesday that the right to self-determination was a fundamental principle of international law and must be protected by all states.Critics have said Trump’s plan“amount[s] to ethnic cleansing”, which the UN has defined as “… rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area.”The term was first used during the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, but is not recognised as a crime in itself in international law.“In legal terms, there is no code or international agreement with the words ethnic cleansing,” said Elena Katselli, of the Newcastle University law school.But ethnic cleansing frequently includes a collection of criminal practices such as murder, rape, torture, arbitrary arrest or deliberate attacks on civilians, which could be war crimes, crimes against humanity or, in some circumstances, genocide.“It is clear to me that powerful states want to rewrite the laws,” Katselli said.Varaki decried Trump’s “absolute silence on the fundamentals of the international order”.“We have no norms at all, so all the things that have been achieved since the second world war are threatened,” she said.Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal justiceWar crimesDonald TrumpUS foreign policyGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The plan is then to “develop” on the levelled ground, which is still filled with the bodies of tens of thousands people killed byIsrael.“The US will take over theGazaStrip and we will do a job with it too,” he said. “We’ll own it.” It followed remarks last month on Gaza where he told reporters: “You’re talking about a million and a half people … we just clean out that whole thing.”Israel has long used its occupation to make money. The modern state was built ondecades of access to cheap Palestinian labour, as workers had few lucrative options in their own stifled and isolated economy.West Bank settlements include farms and factories (often run by Israelis but staffed by Palestinians) and many settlements position themselves as cheap commuter satellite towns for Israelis working in Tel Aviv.At the same time, Israel’s tourism industry has boomed under a monopoly on access to the holy city of Jerusalem, while tour buses use the main Israel-built highway to the Dead Sea that runs right through occupied land.Many of Trump’s allies support these settler projects, either politically or financially. The former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who hasdenied that Palestinians even exist as a people, travelled to Israel during Trump’s first termto physically lay a brickin a settlement in the West Bank. At the time, he said he might “want to purchase a holiday home” there.And towards the end of Trump’s first term, Mike Pompeo became the first US secretary of state to officially visit a settlement,a deeply provocative movethat previous US administrations went to lengths to avoid. He took a trip to a vineyard in the occupied West Bank run by settlers, who blended a red wine that they named in his honour.Trump’s second time in high office is shaping up to be even more property-focused than his first. His Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, is an American billionaire real estate investor and developer, and Huckabeeis expectedto be the next US ambassador to Israel.This time around, the ruins of Gaza are in sharp focus. Last year, Kushner, a former property dealer married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka,praised the “very valuable” potential of Gaza’s “waterfront property”and suggested Israel should remove civilians while it “cleans up” the strip.Kushner has become increasingly entwined in the Middle East, with his private equity firm, Affinity Partners,sourcing funding from rich Gulf statesincluding Saudi Arabia, which has been looked at as a bankroller for the reconstruction of Gaza.Israel has promoted several economic plans for the coastal territory over the years, while at the same time besieging Gaza and demanding ultimate overarching control. An old proposalto build an artificial islandoff the coast of Gaza to house a seaport and airport wasre-pitched last year by Israel’s former foreign ministerto frustrated EU diplomats looking for a political solution.Trump’s takeover plan has echoes of this proposal. The US president said Gaza could become “the Riviera of the Middle East”, and Witkoff has backed the idea of transferring Palestinians out of Gaza, saying: “A better life isn’t necessary tied to physical space that you’re in.”Meanwhile, settler groups whowere moved out of Gazaunder a 2005 “disengagement plan” want to go back. In December, Harey Zahav, a settler-focused real estate agency, released an image showing sketches of new buildings among the destroyed remains of Gaza. “A house on the beach is not a dream!” it said.How settlers’ ambitions – or indeed those of the Israeli government – could fit with Trump’s takeover plan is yet to be seen, although they have a history of working together.Nearly 60 years after Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, it is fighting allegations ofapartheid in the West Bankandgenocide in Gaza, where it has killed nearly 50,000 people.But none of that was mentioned when Trumpannounced his visionfor Gaza. Instead, the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, stood quietly and smiled before praising Trump’s idea as something that “could change history”.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesGazaWest BankDonald TrumpIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He was assassinated in the property in 1975. Hasina later turned the home into a museum.View image in fullscreenThe house is one of several symbols associated with Hasina which have been attacked by her critics.Photograph: Mahmud Hossain Opu/APSince she fled the country, some of her supporters have tried to gather there but have been attacked by Hasina’s critics, who have targeted other symbols of her government and party since the uprising, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.On Wednesday, some protesters threatened to “bulldoze” the building if the former prime minister went ahead with her speech, which marked the start of a month-long protest programme by her Awami League political party. The party is trying to gain support amid allegations of attacks on its members and other Hasina backers.As Hasina began speaking, protesters stormed the house and started dismantling the brick walls, later bringing a crane and an excavator to demolish the building.“They do not have the power to destroy the country’s independence with bulldozers. They may destroy a building, but they won’t be able to erase the history,” Hasina said in response during her speech, even as the demolition continued.She also called on the people of Bangladesh to resist the country’s new leaders and alleged that they took power by “unconstitutional” means.Hasnat Abdullah, a student leader, had warned media outlets against Hasina’s speech and announced on Facebook: “Tonight Bangladesh will be freed from the pilgrimage site of fascism.”Many of the protesters chanted slogans demanding Hasina’s execution for hundreds of deaths during last year’s uprising against her. The uprising was among the country’s worst unrest since independence. Hasina urged a UN investigation into the deaths.They also chanted slogans criticising India. An interim government in Bangladesh led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunushas sought Hasina’s extradition but India has not responded.The country’s leading English-language publication, the Daily Star, reported early on Thursday that a wave of attacks overnight targeted several houses and businesses belonging to Hasina’s Awami League supporters.The interim government, which has been struggling to maintain order and prevent mob justice against Hasina’s supporters, has accused the former prime minister of widespread corruption and human rights abuses during her rule, which began in 2009.Hasina’s Awami League in turn has accused the Yunus-led government of violating human rights and suppressing Bangladesh’s minority groups, which authorities have denied.While New York-based Human Rights Watch has hailed the interim government’s reforms measures, it cited “a disturbing pattern of security force abuses” that has reemerged after Hasina’s ousting, this time targeting Awami League supporters, including journalists.In a report last month, the group said that police are again arbitrarily detaining people and filing mass criminal complaints against unnamed individuals, which allows the police to intimidate and threaten virtually anyone with arrest.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSheikh HasinaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Previously, it said there would be no changes to the site before the eighth anniversary of the disaster, which claimed 72 lives in June 2017.Concerns have been raised over how many loved ones were spoken to before the new decision was taken. Many families have said that the structure should remain in place until there are criminal prosecutions over the failings that led to the fire. The near decade-long wait for justice has been described as “unbearable” by some.Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and bereaved families of the disaster, said on Wednesday evening that the voices of the bereaved were being ignored.“We’ve said this to every secretary of state for housing since the very beginning: consult the bereaved and survivors meaningfully before reaching a decision on the tower,” the group said.“Angela Rayner could not give a reason for her decision to demolish the tower.”What remains of the tower has stood in place since 2017, with a covering on the building featuring a large green heart accompanied by the words “forever in our hearts”.A government spokesperson said: “The priority for the deputy prime minister is to meet with and write to the bereaved, survivors and the immediate community to let them know her decision on the future of the Grenfell Tower.“This is a deeply personal matter for all those affected, and the deputy prime minister is committed to keeping their voice at the heart of this.”The final report of theGrenfell Tower inquiry, published in September, concluded the disaster was the result of “decades of failure” by the government and the construction industry to act on the dangers of flammable materials on high-rise buildings.The westLondontower block was covered in combustible products because of the “systematic dishonesty” of firms that made and sold the cladding and insulation, the inquiry chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said.The “simple truth” was that all the deaths were avoidable and that those who lived in the tower were “badly failed” by authorities, Moore-Bick said. “In most cases through incompetence but, in some cases, through dishonesty and greed,” he added.In May 2024, prosecutors and police said investigators would need until the end of 2025 to complete their inquiry, with final decisions on potential criminal charges by the end of 2026.Separately to the inquiry, the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been consulting on plans for a permanent memorial in the area of the tower. It set out recommendations for a “sacred space”, designed to be a “peaceful place for remembering and reflecting”, in a 2023 report.The commission said it expects the memorial design to be sufficiently developed to enable a planning application to be submitted in late 2026, with a shortlist of five potential designs for it being drawn last month.Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireGrenfell Tower inquiryAngela RaynerLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

So far it has won 11 of them and lost only one, and there are two others ongoing, the BMJ reported.Its victories have led to it being allowed to open some branches for 24 hours a day and to display advertising signs featuring its golden arches logo next to roads.In one case, it told the planning appeals body that customers at a proposed new drive-through McDonald’s in Norwich would be able to order coffee, salad and meals containing fewer than 400 calories. A “notable amount of custom will be on foot or by cycle”, it insisted, despite the outlet being next to a busy ring road.It also highlighted that its provision of a climbing frame would encourage “physical activity” and “healthier lifestyles”.Despite Norwich city council’s objections, the inspectorate upheld McDonald’s appeal and the restaurant – its 10th in the city – will open in the middle of the year.The company has used statements provided on its behalf by Dr Matthew Capehorn, a GP who set up a private weight management clinic in Rotherham, to win appeals against local authorities’ attempts to stop it opening new branches in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, and Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.Capehorn, who has previously worked as a paid medical adviser to McDonald’s, told the inspectorate that its food was “healthy and nutritious”. In addition, he said “over 100” factors contributed to the development of obesity, not just unhealthy food.In submissions to the inspectorate, McDonald’s sought to allay Mansfield district council’s concerns about a planned outlet that would be near three primary schools.“Children are likely to visit the restaurant with a supervising adult who can support the child to make responsible food choices,” it said. Its appeal was again upheld.The investigation, by the health journalist Sophie Borland, identified five cases since 2020 in which a council rejected McDonald’s application to open a new branch but the firm successfully appealed by claiming it would promote healthy living.In several cases, McDonald’s threatened to sue local councils for repayment of its legal costs because they had acted “unreasonably” in refusing their applications.McDonald’s posts biggest decline in global sales in four yearsRead moreAlice Wiseman, the director of public health in Gateshead, told the BMJ that McDonald’s tactics made it hard for councils to refuse fast-food outlets permission to open on health grounds.“It’s very undermining in the role of local government in being able to shape a healthy environment. We haven’t got the resources that the likes of McDonald’s have got to be able to get into any legal battles with this. It’s David and Goliath.”Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and the head of research and impact at the campaign groupAction on Sugar, said: “It is outrageous that a major fast-food outlet is using its vast financial and legal resources to override local councils’ efforts to protect public health.“It is no more enough to just offer some salad options than to claim that a company promotes ‘healthier lifestyle’. Clear transparency on sales of healthier options is now needed, with evidence of improvement over time.”Katharine Jenner, the director of theObesity Health Alliance, said McDonald’s claims were “pure corporate spin”.Poorer areas now have twice as many fast-food outlets as rich ones, she said. “This flood of takeaways is fuelling obesity rates, with diet-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, musculoskeletal conditions and poor mental health forcing thousands out of the workforce and piling pressure on the NHS.”A Department ofHealthspokesperson said: “Fast-food giants are cruelly targeting children by setting up near schools and prioritising their profits over our kids’ health.“This government is tackling the obesity crisis head-on by giving councils stronger powers to block new fast-food outlets near schools and further measures to crack down on junk food advertising targeting children.”McDonald’s told the BMJ: “We pride ourselves on being a positive presence in the communities within which we operate.“Local decision-making is a critical part of the planning application process and we always want to work in partnership with local councils to ensure our plans are right for the community.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMcDonald'sLocal governmentPlanning policyObesityFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

We will fight for their rights, for their protections, for their freedoms.”His comments come a week after Trump issued an executive order decreeing that medical institutions that receive federal funding and grants do not provide gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and puberty blockers, to youth under age 19.US hospitals suspend healthcare for transgender youth after Trump orderRead moreIn response, some hospitals havepaused treatments, which are considered part of thestandards of carefor gender dysphoria endorsed by all major US medical associations. Trans patients, their families and civil rights groups have said the interruption of care could have dire consequences for patients’ physical and mental health. They’ve also argued that Trump’s order is unlawful, violating patients’ constitutional rights and parental rights, and that hospitals have no legal obligation to preemptively deny care, particularly while the policy is being challenged in court.More than half of US states have already passed laws in recent years restricting gender-affirming healthcare for youth, but Trump’s order has led institutions in progressive states, including New York and California, to cancel care.On Tuesday, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), a major local provider,saidit was pausing the initiation of hormone treatments for trans youth. The hospital told the LA Times it was not starting new patients’ gender-affirming care while it evaluated Trump’s order “to fully understand its implications”, but said treatment for existing patients would continue.On Wednesday, Bontawrote a letter to CHLAwarning that “withholding services from transgender individuals based on their gender identity or their diagnosis of gender dysphoria” would violate the state’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, a longstanding law that prohibits discrimination againstLGBTQ+ people.CHLA did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. An official told the Los Angeles Times it was continuing hormone therapy and puberty blockers for cisgender youth prescribed the treatments for other medical needs – a move Bonta said illustrates how the institution was discriminating against trans patients. Some cisgender youth with delayed puberty, for example, are prescribed hormones.“The Unruh Act does not allow you to provide care to cisgender patients while withholding it from transgender patients,” Bonta said in the interview.If providers such as CHLA continue to deny care, his office could take legal action, seeking a court injunction that compels institutions to comply with the state’s civil rights laws, he said, noting violations can lead to monetary penalties.The state previously sued a gym that barred a trans woman from the women’s locker room under the Unruh Act, and in 2021, shewon damages.Withholding gender-affirming care could also violatenondiscrimination protectionsin the federal Affordable Care Act, he said.Bonta’s letter further noted that he and 22 other attorneys general sued to block Trump’s order, and that a court ruling has temporarily blocked federal agencies from taking any action to withhold funding from institutions that provide gender-affirming care.New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, also sent awarningto hospitals earlier this week that the law compels them to provide fender-affirming care.Institutions and providers who offer gender-affirming treatment and abortion care have been facing immense pressure and scrutiny as Trump and Republican leaders across the country seek to erode their rights. Bonta said California would continue to defend doctors in the face of threats: “We will do everything in our power to use the full force of the law and the full authority of the office to make sure that both providers of gender-affirming care and patients are protected.”Bonta spoke to the Guardian shortly after Trump announced an executive orderseeking to ban trans female athletesfrom women’s sports and directing state attorneys general to identify enforcement best practices.“I’m disappointed, but there’s no surprise. We’re ready,” Bonta said of the sports order. He said he would be assessing the impact on the state and what actions could be taken to challenge it, but added that revoking trans athletes’ rights at the federal level would not undo California nondiscrimination regulations: “State laws protecting trans athletes will remain.”Trump’s efforts to erode trans youth care – part of a series of broad attacks on LGBTQ+ rights in his first weeks in office – have already had far-reaching consequences for families, advocates said. Trans youth and their parents, represented by the ACLU and Lambda Legal, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging Trump’s order, outlining how the abrupt interruption of care had devastated youth who depend on the treatment.‘A twist of the knife’: trans Americans respond to Trump’s executive orderRead moreKristen Chapman, a plaintiff and mother of a 17-year-old trans girl, had moved to Virginia to help her daughter access care after Republican lawmakers in her home state of Tennessee outlawed youth gender-affirming treatment. After a long struggle to schedule an appointment, her daughter was due to be seen on 29 January. But hours before, the hospital canceled, due to Trump’s order signed the day prior, she said in a statement: “I thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter. Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.”Bonta said defending trans youth remained a top priority. He said: “When you see children being harmed, being attacked by federal action, the stakes are high. This is targeting certain communities based on who they are and their ability to live their own authentic lives … This is about their rights and freedoms to seek healthcare based on who they are. These are fundamental protections. That’s why we’re acting urgently and aggressively.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Mukherjee said that nothing about aid work had changed in Washington.“I think the fidelity to Trump changed,” she said.

She is seeking an injunction for her immediate reinstatement so the board can continue functioning as a congressionally mandated independent agency.Should her termination stand, Wilcox would be the first and only board member to be removed since the board’s inception in 1935, the lawsuit notes.Wilcox was dismissed for a “blatantly political purpose that flies in the face of the NLRB’s independent status”, the filing states, noting that the president failed to cite examples of “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office”, as required when firing the agency’s board members.The White House claimed her removal and those of the NLRB general counsel were because “these were far-left appointees with radical records of upending longstanding labor law, and they have no place as senior appointees in the Trump administration”.The move triggered a chorus of condemnation, including from former chairs of the NLRB, who criticized the termination ininterviewswith the Guardian.“It was unprecedented to have a sitting board member terminated because of her positions that she’s taken in cases. That is clearly contrary to law,” said Lauren McFerran, chair of the NLRB until last month, when her reappointment wasblockedin the US Senate.Wilma B Liebman, whochairedthe NLRB from 2009 to 2011, under Barack Obama, and before that served as a board member under Bill Clinton and George W Bush, called Wilcox’s termination “brazen and shocking, contrary to long-existing supreme court precedent, the clear language of the statute (the NLRA), and decades of custom”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That strike is at the center of a lawsuit against Kroger and rival grocery chain Albertsons filed by the Colorado attorney general Phil Weiser in Novemberallegingthe chains colluded an illegal no-poach agreement to undercut the leverage of the strike.The strike comes after a proposed merger of Kroger and Albertsons wasblockedin federal court in December.“Being as understaffed as we are, it’s forcing a lot of people in different departments to race around. They’re doing the work of three to four people. In my department, I get pulled to go to other departments to do the work that needs to be done in those departments,” said Chris Lacey, a service manager at King Soopers in Littleton,Colorado.“They’re not addressing our staffing concerns, they won’t talk to us about staffing, and they won’t give us the information so that we can appropriately give them our staffing concerns.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s astronomically unfair for us that we aren’t valued,” he added. “We are doing this to get better staffing in our stores, better wages for our employees, and ultimately, to get better stores for our customers. Our customers deserve better stores. They deserve a larger staff to handle the needs that they have on a day-to-day basis, and that’s what we’re fighting for.”The union said they have been in new contract negotiations with the company since October, and are holding strikes for two weeks to publicize their concerns for the contract and give the company time to address these issues.“We urge local 7 to reconsider their approach and prioritize the best interests of our associates, their members, and the communities they serve. It is time to put aside their unreasonable demands, false rhetoric and headline-seeking tactics, and work towards a fair and timely resolution that increases associates pay while keeping groceries affordable,” said Joe Kelley, president of King Soopers, in a statement shared by email.“We want to make a fair investment in our union associates and this work stoppage only further delays adding more money to their paychecks.”King Soopers also disputed the unfair labor practice allegations, and claimed the company “prioritizes staffing”.Explore more on these topicsSupermarketsUS unionsColoradoDenvernewsShareReuse this content"

The parks-led Experiences group also incurred about $75m in expenses associated with the December launch of the Disney Treasure cruise ship.How far she went: why did the Moana films become such a phenomenon?Read moreRevenue for the quarter rose 5% to $24.69bn, slightly ahead of analysts’ projections of $24.62bn. Operating income rose 31% from a year earlier to $5.1bn.“Overall, this quarter proved to be a strong start to the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our strategy for continued growth,” said the Disney CEO, Bob Iger, in a statement.The company said it would incur $50m in costs associated with exiting its Venu Sports joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery and Fox. The media companies abandoned their plans for a sports streaming service in January, after it ran into substantial legal opposition.Operating income at Disney’s Entertainment unit, which includes film, television and streaming, increased to $1.7bn in the quarter, nearly double the results from a year earlier, thanks in part to the strong performance ofMoana2.The animated sequel topped $1bn in box office proceeds over the Martin Luther King Jr Day weekend in January, becoming the fourth Walt Disney Animation film to reach that financial milestone.Disney’s traditional television business continued to erode. Operating income at so-called linear networks fell 11% to $1.1bn.Subscribers for the company’s flagship streaming video service, Disney+, slipped 1% from the prior quarter to 124.6 million. The company had warned of a modest drop in subscribers because of a price increase that took effect in October. It also forecast a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter, compared to the first.Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ produced an operating profit of $293m in the quarter, marking the third straight quarter of profitability and a turnaround from the year-ago loss of $138m.In the Experiences segment, which includes consumer products and the cruise line, as well as parks, operating income was roughly flat at $3.1bn. Profit declined 5% at domestic parks because the hurricanes and cruise ship costs, while operating income at international parks rose 28% from a year ago.At the Sports unit, which includes the ESPN network and Star India business, operating income was $247m, compared with a year-ago loss, in part reflecting improvement in Star India’s operating results ahead of Disney and Reliance Industries completing a deal to combine their Indian media assets.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyMoananewsShareReuse this content"

AI has become a general-purpose technology, and a platform which countless organisations and individuals use to build applications,” Hassabis and Manyika wrote.“It has moved from a niche research topic in the lab to a technology that is becoming as pervasive as mobile phones and the internet itself; one with numerous beneficial uses for society and people around the world, supported by a vibrant AI ecosystem of developers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On top of this, the US Postal Service brieflysuspended deliveries of incoming parcels from China and Hong Kongbefore they were later resumed.Thetariffcloses off a trade loophole that allowed fast-fashion companies such as Temu andSheinto ship packages under $800 into the US duty-free; this loophole, called “de minimis” has beencriticizedby both political parties in recent years. On Tuesday, Reutersreportedthat Shein and Temu are now likely to raise prices, as is Amazon’s Haul, a new e-commerce app that imports products from China-based sellers.Shoppers are concerned the tariff will get in the way of their retail therapy.“Trying to get that last Temu order in before Trump puts another tariff onChina,” Armacost, who works in consulting and also makes comedy videos on TikTok, captioned a post on Monday that shows her frantically typing on a computer, hacker movie-style.

While Shein is known primarily for clothing, Temu also sells makeup, home goods and decor. These products are cheap – just over $4 for a pair of women’s sneakers on Temu, or $1.45 for bracelet on Temu – but of dubious quality. Inevitably, many end up in landfills.“A lot of the stuff comes actually way smaller than you expect,” Armacost said. “I bought a desk lamp, except it can fit in my hands.”In the months before Trump took office, shoppers urged each other to stock up on Temu and Shein, in case the new administration followed through on its promise to tax US trade partners. “Kinda feeling emo bc this may be the last good Black Friday for a while because of the tariffs,” one TikTok user wrote in aclip. “Better collect your ‘vintage Shein’ because they will probably go for $100 next year.’”Two days after the election, the fashion writer Amy Odellwarned readersof price hikes in a post to her BackRow Substack titled: “Trump Won. So Shop Now.” Susan Scafidi, a lawyer and founder of Fordham’s Fashion Law Institute, told Odell: “Everything’s going to be more expensive, which is a little crazy when you realize that a lot of the Trump appeal was with regard to the economy.”Could the tariff kill fast fashion, an industry defined by wasteful over-consumption, as we know it? No, says Margaret Bishop, a textile and apparel specialist and professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology. “If anything, I think these tariffs will strengthen fast fashion’s hold on customers,” she said. “If everything costs more, particularly food, transportation and housing, they’re going to have to cut back somewhere.“Americans have a real hunger for new fashion, so they will trade down to be able to continue to buy things. If a $1 pack of T-shirts at Temu becomes $2 a pack, that’s still cheaper than spending $20 for a couple of T-shirts that are better made,” she continued.Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, agreed that tariffs would not “fundamentally shift” Americans’ love of a good, if sketchy, deal. While small businesses will bear most of the pain from tariffs – due to supply chain snarls or the fact that Americans won’t be able to spend as much – larger corporations such as Shein and Temu tend to absorb costs.“These companies are resourceful,” Lu said. “My more immediate concern is that small and medium-sized enterprises won’t survive, or will face significant challenges.”Big tech to tungsten: what industries are the focus of China’s new US tariffs?Read moreIn 2023, a US congressionalreportalleged that there was an “extremely high risk” that Temu used forced labor in its supply chain, and that both Shein and Temu evaded US human rights reviews. (Shein denied these claims at the time, while Temu did not comment on the report.) A recentreportfrom the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that some Shein workers endure 75-hour work weeks. (Shein told the BBC it was “working hard” to address the issues raised in the report.)The fast-fashion industry is alsosynonymouswith high carbon emissions and pollution.Lu fears that tariffs will exacerbate these issues. “If they have to pay more on tariff duties but at the same time make their prices competitive, that’s not good news for workers or the environmental impact, because companies will have more incentive to cut corners,” he said.In the EU, the European Commission moved on Wednesday totighten checks on goodssold by online retailers such as Shein and Temu, amid fears that “dangerous products” were flooding the market and that local competitors were losing out to competitors selling unsafe or counterfeit products.Armacost knows that these e-commerce giants represent the worst of Americans’ desire for excess. “But also, at the same time, spending does stimulate the economy,” she said. “In response to the idea that it’s a good thing if people stop ordering so much random stuff, I say: ‘What’s the point of living in a country if I can’t order 100 pieces of junk for $15?’”Explore more on these topicsE-commerceDonald TrumpChinaSheinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its previous target was 12-16GW.It also plans to produce 2.2m barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2030, which is 10% higher than its previous plans. The company hopes to fuel this growth with barrels from Britain’s biggest untapped oilfield at Rosebank in the North Sea – despitea landmark court rulingthat the government’s decision to approve the project was unlawful.The Rosebank project has spurred debate over whether or not the Labour government can successfully pursue its green agenda while delivering economic growth.The party came to power with the promise to end new North Sea oil and gas exploration licences while respecting existing ones. However, climate campaigners have piled pressure on ministers to block the development of Rosebank, which received its licence in 2023, by refusing it a final consent permit to produce oil under a new regime that will be finalised in spring.The uncertainty has laid bare a rift in the government between the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has described the licence issued to Rosebank as “climate vandalism”, and Treasury officials eager to jump start the UK’s economic growth through multibillion pound investments from the private sector.Equinor has claimed that Rosebank will require £8.1bn of total direct investment over the lifetime of the field, of which 78% will flow to UK companies. It is also expected to create 1,600 jobs at the peak of its construction and about 450 UK jobs over its operating life. Equinor will also pay tax to the Treasury for the barrels of oil it sells from the field.Equinor has said it will continue to develop the field while working with the UK government and regulators to move the project forward under a new consent process.The Oslo-based company revealed plans to water down its green investments afterShelland BP signalled to investors that they would backtrack on their green spending plans to exploit volatility in the global oil and gas markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was still the company’s third-highest results on record, according to its chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné.Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, which campaigns against fossil fuels, said it was “no surprise” that Equinor was retreating from its “deeply inadequate global renewables targets”.“Having spent huge amounts on marketing, sponsoring newspapers and events, to try and persuade the British government and public that it is a responsible oil company committed to the transition, Equinor has finally laid bare that it cares more about profits than anything else,” Khan added.Explore more on these topicsOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryNorwayCommoditiesEuropeGreen economynewsShareReuse this content"

It helped that Newcastle’s manager took the precaution of breaking a longstanding devotion to operating with a back four.If the ensuing tactical shift to a back five was partly to compensate for the loss of the injured Joelinton’s customary abrasion in midfield, it also had the benefit of averting the need to drop one of Fabian Schär, Sven Botman and Dan Burn, all of whom could make compelling cases for starting.A revamp as much about coping with Arsenal’s threat from set pieces as smart dressing‑room diplomacy swiftly paid dividends with Schär, Botman and Burn all excelling, not to mention taking turns to step out of defence and press any remaining shreds of optimism out of Arteta’s increasingly suffocated ­players. Schär, in particular, shone in a special, quasi‑man‑marking job that nullified Declan Rice.View image in fullscreenJacob Murphy finds himself in the right place to collect a rebound off a post to score Newcastle’s opening goal.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesHowe had sensibly introduced the experienced, thoroughly streetwise Kieran Trippier at right wing‑back in place of Tino Livramento and ­Trippier’s nous frequently informed Arteta’s increasing grimaces.Not that Newcastle supporters were necessarily looking for a cool, measured approach. “Get into them” demanded one giant banner in the Gallowgate End at kick‑off. Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak were happy to oblige with the former’s fine pass prefacing the rapidly acce­lerating Sweden striker taking a steadying touch before lashing a fabulous shot into the back of the net.On that occasion VAR came to Arsenal’s rescue with the identification of a fractional offside that offered Arteta’s team a reprieve they barely deserved after leaving Isak far too much room for manoeuvre.Not that it lasted long. Moments after Martin Ødegaard spurned a decent chance, Isak thundered a 20‑yard left-footed shot against a post and watched in delight as Jacob ­Murphy directed the rebound beyond David Raya on the half-volley. Small ­wonder Arteta is so keen on buying the ­Newcastle centre‑forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Visiting possession stats in excess of 70% were all very well but, bar one save from Martin Dubravka to deny Leandro Trossard and Ødegaard grazing the outside of an upright, they never really looked like scoring potentially gamechanging goals.The need to take risks left William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães badly exposed and ­unusually vulnerable. That defensive duo can rarely have looked so ­discombobulated but then they do not have to contend with Isak and Gordon every week.Moments after missing a ­glorious shooting opportunity the latter slid a low shot past Raya ­following a passage of terrible Arsenal ­defending.It all began with the goalkeeper ill‑advisedly attempting to play out from the back and involved Rice’s ­dispossession by Schär’s tackle before the ball dropped for the ­England winger to spark choruses of: “We’re going to Wemberlee.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He also praised Mahomes last week when asked to pick a winner for the game, saying “there’s a certain quarterback that seems to be a pretty good winner.”The Chiefs may be the Super Bowl villain but we’d be lost without oneRead moreMahomes, who is aiming to win his fourthSuper Bowlwith the Chiefs, was asked about Trump’s comments on Wednesday.“It’s always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone that is in the top position in our country,” he said. “I didn’t see that clip but it’s cool to hear that he’s seen me play football and respects the game that I play.”While Mahomes declined to back a candidate in last year’s election, his mother and wife, Brittany, have both expressed support for Trump.Kelce also said he was looking forward to Trump’s presence in New Orleans.“That’s awesome. It’s a great honor,” he told reporters on Wednesday when asked about playing in front of Trump. “I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it’s the best country in the world. So, that’d be pretty cool.”Kelce’s comments are perhaps more surprising than those of Mahomes, given that Trump has publicly attacked the player’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift. In September, Trump wrote “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” on social media after she backed Kamala Harris in the presidential election. She also backed Joe Biden over Trump in 2020.Like Mahomes, Kelce did not publicly endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, although he said it had been an honor to meet Joe Biden at the White House after the Chiefs won last year’s Super Bowl.“Anytime I get a chance to be recognized by the president of the United States and get to go with my teammates and a group of men and women that I had success with to the point we get acknowledged … I’m doing it every time no matter who’s up there at the helm,” he said on his New Heights podcast of his visit to the White House, which Mahomes also attended. “No matter what’s going on in this world, it’s just such a cool opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlPatrick MahomesKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

O’Reilly said the deal would not have happened without the AFL’s support.“This doesn’t happen without the AFL’s partnership as an important player in this conversation ... that relationship can go beyond just playing [at the MCG],” O’Reilly said. “This is an incredible league and we can learn from each other. That partnership and relationship is important to us.”The NFL said the Rams’ opponents at the 100,000-seat venue will be announced in the future but it appears it will not be the Eagles, who had been tabbed as the “likely” candidatein a Herald Sun reporton Sunday.“It’s an impossibility because it’s the Rams and we’re at home,” Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said during a rare availability at Monday night’s Super Bowl media night. “We’re not giving up a home game.”According to the NFL’sscheduling formula, Los Angeles are slated to face the Eagles in Philadelphia during the 2026 season. The seven confirmed home opponentson the Rams’ scheduleare the Chiefs, the Arizona Cardinals, the San Francisco 49ers, the Seattle Seahawks, the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants and the Los Angeles Chargers. They will also host the NFC North team which finishes with the same division ranking in 2025.The Eagles had appeared to be a logical candidate for a Melbourne game since they share international marketing rights in Australia with the Rams as part of the NFL’sGlobal Markets Program. Additionally, theirstar offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, who grew up playing rugby league and reached the NFL through the International Player Pathway Program, can become the first Australian to win a Super Bowl if they defeat the Chiefs on Sunday night.The announcement marks the latest expansion of the NFL’s global footprint. The league first launched its international series in 2005, since bringing more than 50 regular-season games to London, Munich, Frankfurt, Mexico City and Toronto. This year the Eagles and the Green Bay Packers met in Sao Paulo for the first ever NFL game in South America – Philadelphia were the designated home team – while the Miami Dolphins have been named hosts for the first game in Spain next season at the Bernabéu Stadium.Lurie said he fully welcomes the NFL’s international ambitions, but can’t sign off on giving up a precious home game for the second time in three years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So if there’s an opportunity to be an away team there, we will embrace that.”As many as eight games per season will be played outside the United States next season as part of the International Series agreement. The NFL has confirmed five of these so far: three in London, one in Berlin and one in Madrid. But a first regular-season game in the Asia-Pacific region – the NFL staged a pre-season game in Sydney back in 1999 – represents the league’s most ambitious foray to date.“Expanding to Melbourne, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. “Together with the Victorian state government ... we look forward to making history in what is an important market for the NFL and a significant next step in expanding our international footprint.”Explore more on these topicsNFLLos Angeles RamsUS sportsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day.The order, which is likely to face legal challenges, calls for “immediate enforcement” nationwide. It threatens to cut off federal funding for any school that allows trans women or girls to compete in female-designated sporting competitions.The order would affect only a small number of athletes. The president of the National Collegiate Athletics Association told a Senate panel in December he was aware of fewer than 10 trans athletes among the 520,000 competing at 1,100 member schools.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead moreAthlete Ally, a non-profit athletic advocacy group, released astatement in responseto the order, saying: “Our hearts break for the trans youth who will no longer be able to know the joy of playing sports as their full and authentic selves.“We’ve known this day was likely to occur for a long time, as this administration continues to pursue simple solutions to complex issues, often resulting in animus towards the most marginalized communities in our country.”This latest attack on trans rights follows a sequence of controversial mandates by the Trump administration. During his first day in office, Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to define sex as “only male or female”based on reproductive cellsand for it to be reflected on all official documents such as passports.Last week, he signed an executive order prohibiting gender transition for peopleunder the age of 19. It included gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers, the use of hormones such as estrogen or testosterone, and surgical procedures.Trump has also taken aim at Biden’s orders to combat gender discrimination. Last month, Trumpsigned an ordercalled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” that instructs the federal government to remove “all radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she promises she has the sport’s best interests at heartWed 5 Feb 2025 04.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareLivvy Dunne is worried about the future of women’s college gymnastics. TheNIL powerhouse, who has scored major brand deals with Vuori and American Eagle, among others, has started her final season with the national champion LSU Tigers. But she’s made the biggest splash in this young season on social media by posting on X over her concerns over the popularity of gymnastics.“I’m sitting here watching NCAA gymnastics and the empty seats are concerning,” shewrote in a note on Xlast week. “If you want fans to enjoy the sport and increase viewership, you have to look at what makes the crowds go crazy! People understand what a perfect 10 is and want people who do things that look great to be rewarded.”How Olivia Dunne turned the male gaze into a gymnastics empireRead moreThe context behind Dunne’s note on social media are the changes that have been made to judging this season. A new accountability system has just been implemented to deal with the overscoring of seasons past and the proliferation of perfect 10s. Last year, there were 87 perfect marks in women’s college gymnastics, just a few shy of the highwater mark of 91 back in 2004. And behind all of those 10s, were even more 9.975s (meaning at least one judge threw out a 10 for that score), 9.95s and 9.9s. At times, it felt like the judges weren’t rigorously evaluating gymnasts’ routines based on the performance so much as scoring based on vibes, usually good ones, mirroring the enthusiasm of the athletes and crowds with their marks. The acceptable range for a “hit” routine had become quite narrow, a window of about two tenths, so that the judges didn’t have the room to distinguish between the good, the great and the truly sublime.So far this season, there’s been a notable downturn to the scores. There are still many high marks being handed out but routines that in years past might have earned a 9.9 was getting 9.8s; and there have only been three 10s so far when at this point in 2024, there had been more than 20. If the trend continues, there will be far fewer 10s this season than there have been in many years. (Though it seems like we’re mostly inwait-and-seemode when it comes to the implementation of the new judging system; they’re mostly collecting data and not acting on it this year. Perhaps the threat alone was enough to get judges to become more rigorous.)There was immediate pushback to Dunne’s note, particularly from gymnastics fans who have watched the creeping scoring inflation of the past five years with increasing concern. Many also pointed out that the viewership and attendance numbers were sound, great even, through the first month of the season, picking up right where they left off last season. Though Dunne didn’t specify which meet she was watching when she posted, it was probably the Missouri-Kentucky showdown on Sunday, which aired opposite the AFC Championship game between the Bills and the Chiefs, which was held about two hours away from the gymnastics competition anddrew a historically high TV audience. This goes a long way to explaining its sparser-than-usual crowd. No gymnastics meet, not even one featuring Dunne and the rest of the LSU Tigers, would’ve stood a chance against one of the most important football games of the year that also happened to have Taylor Swift in attendance. The judges could’ve gone full Oprah and given everyone a 10 and it still wouldn’t have changed the attendance and viewership numbers.View image in fullscreenOlivia Dunne poses with her LSU teammates after the Tigers’ national championship win in April 2024.Photograph: Aric Becker/ISI Photos/Getty Images“People are like, ‘I don’t understand why she’s complaining because this school is breaking records’… but it’s about keeping those people engaged and wanting more,” Dunne told the Guardian in a phone conversation last week about this particular line of criticism. “My concern is the longevity of gymnastics and keeping fans interested for the long run.”The backdrop of her note and these remarks is the looming House v NCAA settlement, which will bring revenue sharing to college sports and she, like many others, is concerned about the fate of the non-revenue programs. “Gymnastics is at the point right now where it could be a filled arena of record-breaking attendance, but it’s still a non-revenue sport.” Anything that might potentially cause a dip in popularity and fan engagement, such as the new judging accountability system and resultant lower scores, seems like the wrong choice to Dunne at this particular juncture. “I don’t think that [the] timing is right because of what’s happening in the future.”The connection between scoring and popularity in gymnastics is hardly straightforward. Yes, Nadia Comăneci’s first Olympic 10s were a huge global sensation, but those were awarded against the backdrop of a mega sporting event and in the midst of the Cold War. And Comăneci wasn’t even the first global superstar in women’s gymnastics. That distinction belongs to Olga Korbut of the Soviet Union who became the darling of Munich four years earlier despite never having received a 10; she won the crowds and the TV viewing audience over with her daring acrobatics and her endearing personality.In the years following Comăneci’s gold medals, 10s proliferated to the point where it becamesomething of a crisisfor the sport. Viewers, who had been repeatedly told that the 10 meant “perfection”, were seeing obviously flawed exercises receive that mark at the 1988 Olympics. These 10s were not a source of excitement but of suspicion. The final perfect marks in gymnastics were awarded in 1992 and by 2006, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) eliminated the 10 in favor of the open ended scoring paradigm. The concerns that Dunne cited in her statement – that people understand the 10 and get excited for it – are echoes of the arguments that those opposed to the shift made in the 90s and early aughts. But the popularity of elite gymnastics hasn’t appeared to suffer as a result of the scoring change. It’s been nearly 20 years now and everyone has gotten used to it. And Simone Biles, the GOAT of the sport, has thrived under this open ended scoring system (though she probably would thrive under any scoring regimen).Katelyn Ohashi’s perfect 10 reminded America life could be fun againRead moreWomen’s college gymnastics has also had an up-and-down relationship with the perfect 10. There certainly have been gymnasts whose perfect marks have helped increase interest in the sport. In 2014, LSU gymnast Lloimincia Hall became the first gymnast to go viral on social media on the strength of her engaging floor routine; the 10 she was awarded probably played a big part in its spread albeit but in a circuitous way. She was awarded the perfect mark at a dual meet in January and the video of the performance lay dormant on YouTube until the spring when a sorority website found it and posted it. From there, it went viral, resulting in articles about Hall and an interview on Good Morning America. It’s reasonable to conclude that the “10” in the video header increased its discoverability. Basically, it was good SEO.Several floor routines have gone viral since then and not all have been awarded 10s. Sophina DeJesus managed to attract the internet’s attention with her 9.925 routine in 2016 that got her featured in the LA Times and on Ellen. In 2020 and 2021, Nia Dennis’s sub-10.0 routines also led to significant media attention. Katelyn Ohashi, themost viral of them all, was awarded a 10 in 2019, but that came on the heels of DeJesus’s success at UCLA as well as Ohashi’s less celebrated viral moment from 2018. The early example of Hall aside, these later bouts of virality seem to be less about a particular score and more about performance quality, choreography, music selection and schools’ investments in digital marketing and social media. (But all the scores were in the 9.9+ range so it’s not like any of the viral performances were lowballed even if they didn’t receive 10s.)As the 10s have abounded in college gymnastics, starting in the early 90s, they’ve also attracted a fair share of scrutiny for the same reason they came under fire in elite – though some were earned, many were seen as illegitimate, “imperfect” 10s for flawed performances. Last year, there was coverage of the scoring problems of women’s college gymnastics in the Washington Post and it was amply discussed by commentators in the television broadcasts, at times even joking about the implausibility of some of these marks.View image in fullscreenJordan Chiles of the UCLA Bruins poses with her perfect score after she earned a 10 on floor exercise against the Arizona State Sun Devils at Pauley Pavilion on 11 February 2023.Photograph: Katharine Lotze/Getty ImagesBut this certainly doesn’t mean that the 10 has no role to play in increasing the popularity and reach of the sport. Dunne brought up Missouri’s Helen Hu’s 10 from the previous weekend. Hu, a fifth year like Dunne, has been known for her balance beam prowess and elegance since her high school days, but hadn’t yet scored a 10 despite getting very close on several occasions. But in the early season meet, as the last one up for her team, she finally was awarded one for a routine that, in my non-judge estimation, truly deserved the accolade.“Those great moments do make SportsCenter Top 10,” Dunne observed in regards to Hu’s performance which was highlighted. “That’s what gymnastics needs. It needs eyes on the sport. It needs eyes from the average consumer.”Would ESPN, when choosing moments to highlight, have landed on Hu’s beam routine if it had been performed identically but had receivedonlya 9.975? Probably not. As with Hall’s viral 2014 moment, the 10 aids in discoverability, not just for fans, but producers of sports programs, too. Hu’s exemplary routine would’ve been much more difficult to pluck out from the sea of 9.95s.But what of fan – and producer – education? Should we attempt to teach people what to look for in routines instead of relying on high numbers to do the work of spotlighting the exceptional performances?When it comes to learning about how routines are being evaluated, TV viewers are probably at a distinct advantage compared to the fans watching live inside the competition venue. Since the start of the season, television commentators have repeatedly stressed the introduction of the accountability system to help the lower scores seem more plausible. Inside the arena is a different story. “I think it’s definitely different in the arena because fans aren’t being told anything,” Dunne said. “It’s just based off of the energy and honestly how good the performance is.”And when there appears to be a mismatch between the crowd’s energy in response to what they perceive as a perfect or near-perfect exercise and the marks that a gymnast receives, confusion ensues. “People I know for a fact are confused,” she said. “The amount of people that have reached out to me, I can’t even wrap my head around.”I have been on social media since I was 10 and once you lose someone’s attention, that’s itShe fears that this confusion will lead to fan disengagement, especially for the newer ones who are still quite casual in their commitment to women’s college gymnastics. “I have been on social media since I was 10 and once you lose someone’s attention and they’re not interested anymore, that’s it.”“I definitely feel like the scoring should be fair. Should be fair across the board,” Dunne said. “But it’s also very confusing for fans when the scoring has been one way for three years.”What Dunne is getting at is a perennial problem for gymnastics – the relative instability of the rules. With most other sports, there might be a steep learning curve at the beginning, but once you know the rules, you’re set for years to come. But in gymnastics, skill values can change from year to year and so can requirements. Keeping abreast of all these developments doesn’t seem like much of a commitment to a hardcore gymnastics fan but might be a tall order for a more casual viewer who just wants to see some cool stuff.But there’s a tension between wanting fair scoring and also being responsive to fan enthusiasm that may not be informed by any kind of gymnastics expertise. A casual fan might know that anything 9.9+ is a good score and that a stuck vault is a good vault. But they might not realize, without the benefit of replay, that the vault they leapt to their feet over had myriad form problems in the air that demanded deductions because there is another gymnast out there, perhaps later in the same lineup, who might do both – stay clean in the air while sticking the landing. The only way to reward the gymnast who will execute on both ends is to deduct the one with clear flaws. In that case, the judges have to ignore fan demands and get their pencils out.While her primary concern was the fans and the coming of revenue sharing, Dunne also spoke about the emotional impact of the scoring on the athletes themselves. A 10 isn’t simply the highest score you can be awarded; for many gymnasts it’s a culminating career moment. “When they did flash it [the 10], I think my knees buckled a little bit. I started crying. I didn’t know what to do with myself,” Hu toldInside Gymnasticsof her reaction to this milestone achievement.“You come to college to have fun and to finally get rewarded after those hard years of club or elite gymnastics, especially in this era of gymnast[s] that did have to go through what they did in Texas,” Dunne said.She, along with many of the gymnasts currently competing in the NCAA had been on the national team at one point in their careers. And as has been well documented since 2016, many of these athletes have suffered abuse in various forms, from physical to sexual, and almost certainly emotional. The upperclassmen of the NCAA are perhaps the last group of gymnasts to have attended the national team training camps at the Karolyi Ranch in Texas before it was shut down in early 2018 after Biles, who had just come forward as a victim former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, publicly expressed her anguish that continuing her career – she had just embarked on a comeback after taking the year after the 2016 Games off – would mean that she’d have to return to the site of her abuse. Dunne has never spoken publicly about being abused herself though she must know several athletes who have been. For many gymnasts, college gymnastics is the light at the end of a dark tunnel. (Though not for all since we’re still talking about aDivision Isport where coaches want to win as much as they do at the elite and club levels and can be abusive too.) The cheers, excitement, and the 10s are part of the happy ending that many of the athletes who had suffered at the elite and club levels.View image in fullscreenOlivia Dunne of the LSU Tigers warms up ahead of the 2024 NCAA gymnastics championships at the Dickies Arenas in Fort Worth, Texas.Photograph: Chris Parent/LSU/University Images/Getty ImagesDunne said that she has received many private messages of support. “I’ve had many other gymnasts from other schools, like handfuls of gymnasts and whole teams, reach out to me saying that they feel the same way, that it’s just not as exciting and it’s not as much fun for the athletes.”As much as you want the scores to just be scores, a means of amassing points in an athletic contest, the marks signify much more than that for many athletes. Perhaps that shouldn’t be the case and we should definitely work to eradicate or at least reduce abuse at all levels of the sport, but that is not the present reality. I don’t know how you factor that into a judging accountability system while keeping the main goal – rigorous, accurate evaluation of the exercises – in sight.“I’m not doing it for myself or LSU,” Dunne said of her comments about scoring and popularity. Dunne will be, well, done at the end of this season. She’s probably set, if not for life, then for many years to come. And LSU is probably one of the programs that needn’t worry about the coming changes. Its fanbase is well established. “LSU fans are die-hard fans. People that love gymnastics here are season-ticket holders. They love it. They would never miss a meet.” After all, they stuck with this program for nearly 50 years before seeing their first championship ring.“I’m talking about smaller programs as well that don’t have boosters like LSU. … They’re going to have to fight to keep their programs alive if they don’t have fans or engagement or popularity. It’s going to be a lot harder for those programs.”Women’s college gymnastics entered this season riding high off the successes of the last few years, with record-breaking attendance and TV viewership numbers, as well as prominent athletes like Dunne and Olympic medalists like Chiles and Jade Carey earning big NIL bucks and receiving significant media attention. There’s a feeling that gymnastics can only keep going up from there. But just like in a tightly contested meet, momentum can quickly swing in the opposite direction. It is not wrong to be worried about a future that seems so uncertain with the upheaval of House v NCAA on the horizon.“That has been heavy on my mind and my heart, about keeping the sport relevant, keeping it in people’s eyes, getting the recognition that gymnastics deserves,” Dunne said.Explore more on these topicsGymnasticsCollege sportsUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

So it’ll be a very seamless transition.”Like the rest of the world, James initially assumedthe Lakers’ trade with the Dallas Mavericks for Dončić– Davis was sent the other way – was a joke when he learned about it last Saturday night while at dinner with his family in New York.The Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade is shocking, franchise-altering and bizarreRead more“My emotions were all over the place,” James said. “The first time I heard it, I thought it was for sure fake. I thought it was a hoax. People messing around or whatever. But AD FaceTimed me, and I talked to him for quite a while. Even when I got off the phone with him, it still didn’t seem real. Pretty much didn’t seem real until I saw Luka today, and then I saw the clip of AD at the Dallas shootaround. That’s when it finally hit me, like, ‘This is real.’”Midway through his record-tying 22nd NBA season, the 40-year-old James has often said in recent years that he’s seen everything it’s possible to experience in the NBA. This trade changed his mind.“Ain’t never seen this,” James said. “I haven’t. I’ve seen it all, up until this one. I’ve never been a part of a transaction like that. That was different ... It was shocking when I heard the news, but at the end of the day, I understand the business of basketball.”The NBA trade deadline is Thursday, and James said he’s determined to persevere in Los Angeles even after Davis’ departure.When asked if he was worried about the Lakers’ focus shifting to Dončić and younger players, James asked: “What’s wrong with that?”“If I had concerns, I’d have waived my no-trade clause and got up out of here,” he added. “Listen, I’m here right now. I’m committed to the Lakers organization. I’m here to help Luka and Maxi [Kleber] make the transition as smoothly as possible.”Clippers coach Tyronn Lue is well-positioned to understand how Dončić’s may fit in with the Lakers. Lue was James’ coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who won a championship with James playing alongside ballhawk guard Kyrie Irving. Lue smirked on Tuesday night when asked how he would respond to pundits and ex-players like Charles Barkley and Paul Pierce who think James and Dončić won’t work well together because they’re both ball-dominant players.“They’re not right,” Lue said. “It’ll work. When you haveLeBron James, who’s been the best player in the league for the last 15 years, and you have Luka – who’s a top-three, top-five player in the league – they’ll figure out how to make it work. LeBron can play with anybody. ... I know [Lakers coach JJ Redick] will do a good job of stacking those guys so they each have their own unit, kind of like we did with Kyrie and LeBron, and then in the fourth quarter they’ll close games together. They’ll figure it out. It’s not a tough problem to have, I’ll tell you that.”Elsewhere on Tuesday night, Irving said he was still in shock that Dončić is no longer his teammate in Dallas.“Just really shocked,” Irving said after the Mavericks’ loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. “You just don’t imagine you’re going to get ready to go to sleep and then you find out news like that. It’s still a grieving process right now. I miss myhermano.”Explore more on these topicsNBALos Angeles LakersLeBron JamesLuka DončićUS sportsBasketballDallas MavericksnewsShareReuse this content"

Was it too soon?Kim Caldwell was back on the sideline days after childbirth. But experts say the decision of when to return to work is a personal oneStephanie KaloiWed 5 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 06.03 ESTShareTennessee’s women’s basketball head coach Kim Caldwell didn’t manage to beat South Carolina on 27 January (but truly: who can?). But she did manage to surprise a lot of people by choosing to return to the sidelines just a week after giving birth to her first child (and after havingbattled the fluat the same time).Caldwell, who is in her first year of coaching the Lady Vols, told reporters she would be back for the game in apress conferencethe day before. She had missed the team’s 23 January game against Texas, something she said was “not great.”She added: “I was proud of our team, but it was not my favorite thing I’ve ever done as a coach, is have to stay home and watch it on TV.”Caldwell’s dedication to her team has been clear from the beginning. She took over an unranked team; by November Tennessee were ranked No 19, a position theystill held on the AP pollat time of writing. She has been praised for her approach to coaching, which includes quick-paced, hockey-style substitutions, something she described as “fun” to NBC News.In many ways, it’s not too surprising that she felt a strong need to get back on the court against South Carolina, the reigning national champions coached by the great Dawn Staley. It’s also not too surprising that her return sparked conversations about the expectations that surround motherhood in the United States, one of the few countries in the worldwithout mandated paid maternity leave, although Caldwell’s decision seems motivated by dedication to her job rather than any financial worries (she earns $750,000 a year).Cristen Pascucci left her career in public affairs in 2011 to study maternity care and women’s rights. It’s not a coincidence that Pascucci welcomed her son the same year. She is the founder of Birth Monopoly, through which she works for a freer maternity care market alongside national advocates, organizations, and birth lawyers. Pascucci, who has also spent over a decade focused on obstetric violence, is working on the documentary Mother May I.The first weeks following childbirth are an “absolutely critical time for the diet of the mother and the baby,” she says. “From a physiological perspective, from a biological, emotional, social, and psychological perspective, for both of them – there is a process that happens during which the mom’s brain begins to reform” in response to what she’s experienced.“Your cells literally rearrange themselves,” Pascucci adds. “You have totally different chemicals happening, things are firing in totally different ways. So you’re not the same person after birth that you were before in averyliteral sense.”This is something any woman returning to work soon after giving birth needs to consider, Pascucci says, but that doesn’t mean a decision like Caldwell’s is irresponsible or unsafe. The most important response, Pascucci adds, is to support a new mother in every possible way – something Caldwell appears to have in spades – and to trust that no one knows if Caldwell is ready to be back on the court except Caldwell.In addition to the physiological response to childbirth, there’s also a very real “physical wound” that new mothers are recovering from, says midwife Emily Varnam. “For the first week, you need to be in your bed,” she says. “And the reason for that is that on the physical level, you have a really big wound. Your placenta has detached from the wall of the uterus, and you have a wound that needs at least six weeks to heal and to stop bleeding.“If you had a big wound anywhere else on your body, if you were moving too much – if I had a wound on my hand and kept moving my hand, that would keep opening back up again.”But Varnam also emphasized that each new mother has a different response to childbirth, and if Caldwell is resting whenever possible and seated during games, she’s likely to avoid major physical consequences. The interplay between a new mom’s physical health and the demands of a career that fulfills her are complicated, Varnam adds.Varnam says it is important for new mothers like Caldwell who are motivated to get back to work to address certain factors.“There are different buckets of what you need: rest, hydration, nutrition, and bonding with your baby [are important]. But so is being able to nourish your own self, and that might be what a new mom is getting from being able to do something that feels really purposeful in her life. I feel like that’s really important.”That emphasis on respecting a woman’s decision to return to work soon after giving birth was also reflected in conversation with Assia Grazioli-Venier, co-founder of Venture Capitalist firm Muse Capital. Grazioli-Venier, a new mom herself, and her co-founder Rachael Springate, have three children between them and know what it means to be a mother who is also called to her career and her passion.“She clearly felt supported at home,” Grazioli-Venier says. “She had the right support system at home, and clearly, what she does makes her so happy. By all means, she should – like I did – go back if that’s what brings her joy, because that’s super important to bring back to your son or daughter … Every woman’s situation is totally different.”And while not every new mom has the resources and care she needs, there are different ways to find it. For example, one of the companies Muse Capital works with is Mahmee, which provides “wraparound” care throughout pregnancy and postpartum (and is covered by most insurance brands), which is especially useful for women who may not be able to access that otherwise.Of course, for every mothere who can access such round-the-clock care, there are those who have to be back at jobs that don’t necessarily fulfill them, or who have babies alone or with partners who aren’t up to the task of being caregivers. There are ways those mothers can create their own bubble of postpartum care, too, Varnam said.“Have really, really clear boundaries and prioritize your nutrition [if you can],” she says. “If you’re able to eat things that are more nutrient-dense, your body is healing … people get extremely depleted. Continue to take your prenatal vitamins after birth” and most importantly, “make sure you get quality time with your baby. Mothers get edited out of their own story so often – and that creates a lot of emotional pain.”As for Caldwell and the Lady Vols, she will next lead the team in a heavyweight battle against No 5 UConn at home on Thursday. It may be hard for some to understand what is motivating Caldwell to be back on the floor so soon, but her story as a mother, as a coach, and as a woman most likely has everything to do with it.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsMaternity & paternity rightsBasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It also showed some teams did not conduct background checks, which allowed coaches previously terminated for misconduct to be rehired by other teams.The settlement, which was announced on Wednesday by the attorneys general, requires the NWSL to create a $5m fund to compensate players and implement league-wide policy changes to improve player safety.“For too long, the hardworking and talented women of the National Women’s Soccer League were forced to endure an unacceptable culture of abuse, harassment, and retaliation,” New York attorney generalLetitia James, a Democrat, said in a statement.She said the settlement “sends a clear message that such misconduct will not be tolerated and ensures players receive the compensation and protections they deserve.”With oversight from the attorneys general, the NWSL must also continue to comply with extensive changes to its protocols, including rigorous vetting of prospective coaches and training for players and staff on how to prevent sexual misconduct.NWSL also faces $2m in penalties if it fails to comply with any terms of the agreement, the attorneys general said.The fallout from the allegations engulfed the NWSL and prompted the departure of former commissioner Lisa Baird and demands for reform, while five of the league’s 10 teams parted ways with their head coaches over player complaints before the end of the 2021 season.US Soccer founded the NWSL in 2012 and operated as manager, providing logistical and financial support, through 2020.

The expanded group stage for the Champions League, with each team playing a minimum of eight games, has hardly helped matters, while 12 European teams are playing in an expanded Fifa Club World Cup in the US this summer.Most of the concessions made to elite sides’ expanding fixture lists have so far come in the form of cuts to domestic competitions, such as the controversial shelving of FA Cup replays in England.Cutting the additional 30 minutes from two-legged ties would go a small way towards alleviating the problems caused by late-season fixture congestion. It could also be popular among clubs that undergo the gruelling regimen of qualifying rounds in July and August.Underdogs who feel the pace of an added period against clubs with better-stocked squads would sense a fairer playing field. There may also be some appeal to broadcasters that would see less risk of an unpredicted dent in their schedules and perhaps relish the opportunity to cut straight to the shorter-form drama of spot-kicks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He looked and sounded invigorated before the second leg ofTottenham’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Liverpool. It was almost as if a different man had spent the past few weeks staring into the microphone following another costly defeat, dealing with a ludicrous injury list and facing question after question about when Spurs were finally going to make an outfield signing.Fresh from overseeing a dogged2-0 win against Brentfordon Sunday, Postecoglou sat down and spoke for 43 minutes before a moment that could define his time in north London. The head coach considered the chance for Spurs “to make a big impact” by going to Anfield and building ontheir 1-0 win in the first leg. He thought about his captain, Son Heung-min, still being trophyless after nearly 10 years at the club. He seemed energised by sealing deals for thecentre-back Kevin Dansoand theFrench forward Mathys Telat the end of a difficult transfer window.‘An unbelievable finisher’: why Mathys Tel is a perfect fit for SpursRead moreThere was humour from Postecoglou when he discussed how he wooed Tel, who had been wavering about joining Spurs on loan from Bayern Munich. “There is something to be said for honesty and integrity,” the 59-year-old said. “I think I’ve got a pretty compelling story to tell. When I speak to players, I’m not trying to sell anything that there isn’t plenty of evidence for. I don’t think it’s smooth talking, or selling. I think there’s a real good story here, which I really believe in. I speak from a real strong conviction that what I’m saying will come to fruition. I really believe that. I don’t think I need to do anything special.”Pressed on his phone manner, Postecoglou said there are times when he speaks to a potential signing and feels a disconnect. With Tel it was about football. The 19-year-old, who will be involved at Anfield, has left Bayern in search of regular football and was not short of suitors. Postecoglou said he wore him down. “It lasted a couple of hours. He was falling asleep by the end.”Presumably Tel was paying enough attention to know that Spurs have an option to buy him for £50m. Postecoglou was in headline‑writing mood when he insisted that the former Rennes forward will join permanently. “He’ll be a Tottenham player,” the Australian said. “I think he’ll show everyone he’s going to be a Tottenham player in the next six months. I didn’t bring him here for six months.”Spurs have thought in the long term when it comes to recruitment, placing a heavy focus on signing young players in the past 18 months.

We had some experience here, which has helped. I’ll always make decisions I feel are best for the club. All these decisions, I’m as much a driver of as the club.

It doesn’t exist in the modern game. Somebody can say: ‘Hey Ange we’re right behind you,’ and then you know … there’s no guarantees about anything, but I don’t care. Being a manager in today’s world, you can feel so isolated and so vulnerable. I don’t feel that. I feel like the playing group is rock solid, the staff are rock solid, I feel supported and that’s all I can ask for. Where that takes us, time will tell. I firmly believe it will take us to success.

But can Spurs rise to the challenge of holding offLiverpool? Can they cope with the Anfield atmosphere? Will it be the same old story: expectation followed by disappointment? Spurs have already knocked out Manchester United and Manchester City. They are struggling in the Premier League but are through to the last 16 of the Europa League and visit Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Sunday. This strange season could have a special ending.Not that it will be easy. Spurs head to Merseyside with the injured contingent still numerous and Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven unavailable in central defence. Van de Ven returned last week inthe win against Elfsborgbut is taking precautions with his recovery from a hamstring problem. Even Postecoglou, who could start Danso, knows when not to gamble.It would be a surprise if Spurs do not at least play with freedom in Liverpool. The odds are against them but they can score past anyone. Son is looking sharper and has “a real focus in his eye”, according to Postecoglou. The vibe is good. The question is whether Spurs can bring it to the pitch when it truly matters.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecoglouLiverpoolCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You could argue it is the least important of domestic competitions, but the more something eludes a team the more they want it.The chances of West Ham troubling the Women’s Super League leaders were slim. The two sides had met four times in the League Cup (twice at the semi-final stage) before this meeting at a shivering Kingsmeadow, with Chelsea winning all four games by an aggregate score of 19-2.There were five changes to the side that sealed a 1-0 win against Aston Villa in the league on Sunday but such is Chelsea’s depth that it was not a weakened team. Chelsea’s other new acquisition – the USA defender Naomi Girma, who signed fora world‑record fee of £890,000– is not yet ready for the bench having been in the middle of the US off-season. But she was sitting in the stands between the rested Lucy Bronze, and Zecira Musovic, who announced on Monday that she is pregnant.Despite utterly dominating proceedings, it took 20 minutes for the rejigged home team to make a breakthrough against the side they put five past in January. A clearance landed at the feet of Rytting Kaneryd, who swiped it in at the near post. Before the half‑hour Chelsea doubled their lead as Nüsken and Guro Reiten muscled Eva Nyström off the ball on the edge of West Ham’s area before the former rounded the goalkeeper Kinga Szemik and rolled the ball into the net.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Johanna Rytting Kaneryd scores their first goal against West Ham.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersThe hour brought a double change for Chelsea that would put a chill into any team battling to get back into a game, with Aggie Beever-Jones and Lauren James refreshing the home attack.“We were playing home and I think we had a good first half in terms of result and performance,” Bompastor said. “At half‑time we were leading the game 2-0 and I think it was good enough.”It took until the 78th minute for West Ham to muster a shot on target amid the Chelsea onslaught, which they did well to contain. Manuela Paví found Kirsty Smith wide on the right but the angle got too tight and it was easy for Hannah Hampton when the shot did come in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coventry could only blame themselves for being two goals down at the break. Piroe’s expertly taken finish made Ellis Simms pay for a mistake before Bogle was handed a gift by the goalkeeper Oliver Dovin.Wilson Isidor and Enzo Le Fée show class as Sunderland sink MiddlesbroughRead moreLeeds could have had more but for Dovin, who denied Manor Solomon, Piroe and Largie Ramazani, as the league leaders cruised to a sixth successive clean sheet in all competitions andextended their unbeaten runto 14 games. Daniel Farke’s side have made a habit of scoring early in recent games and this time they struck in the 17th minute.Simms played a loose back-pass deep into his own half and straight to Solomon who slipped through Piroe to clinically dispatch his 13th goal of the campaign. Coventry were the creators of their own downfall and could only look at themselves when their opponents surged into a 2-0 lead. Bogle looked like he touched the ball too far into the grasp of Dovin after a run into the area, but the goalkeeper spilled it back into the path of the defender who slotted into the back of the net.Leeds pushed for more and Dan James latched on to a long ball over the top but he shot straight at Dovin. The visitors were in complete control, with Coventry struggling to play out from the back against a ferocious press.Leeds picked up where they left off after the interval. Solomon proved to be a menace for the Coventry defence and picked out James who could only fire into the side netting.Coventry thought they had got themselves on the scoresheet but Illan Meslier got down low and produced a fine save to keep out Simms’ header. They were almost punished on the break but Dovin was on hand to deny Solomon’s rocket 10 seconds later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dovin twice denied Leeds by stopping low drilled efforts from Solomon and Piroe. The goalkeeper may have been to blame for Leeds’s second but he kept his side in it, spreading himself to stop Ramazani with his feet. Meslier kept his clean sheet intact by tipping Bobby Thomas’s header on to the bar while Wilfried Gnonto’s late effort was belatedly ruled out for offside at the other end.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipCoventry CityLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Celtic were unstoppable.Portuguese winger Jota, who recently returned to the champions 18 months after leaving for spells in Saudi Arabia and France, started the game, following hisgoalscoring appearance off the benchagainst Motherwell on Sunday. Right-back Alistair Johnston and Engels were also reinstated with Anthony Ralston, Luke McCowan and Kühn dropping out. Jeffrey Schlupp, the 32-year-old utility player signed on loan from Crystal Palace until the end of the season, was on the bench.Lyall Cameron, who is moving to Rangers in the summer, was absent for Tony Docherty’sDundeeside due to an achilles injury while fellow midfielder Finlay Robertson and defensive duo Antonio Portales and Ethan Ingram were back in the starting lineup.The visitors managed a couple of forays forward, which offered some hope, but that dissipated whenCeltictook the lead. The referee Colin Steven initially awarded a foul to Dundee when Mohamed Sylla tussled with Auston Trusty at a corner but was asked to check his pitchside monitor by the VAR, Alan Muir, and after a long look pointed to the spot. Engels fired low to Trevor Carson’s right for the lead – his sixth penalty in the league this season.Dundee tried valiantly to push forward but their attacks were sporadic, while only poor final touches and decision-making prevented Celtic adding to their lead. However, just before the break, the visitors succumbed again – Carson saved an initial effort from Idah and then parried Jota’s drive. Idah, the former Norwich striker, then fired high into the net from eight yards.Rodgers said of Idah: “I’m so pleased for him, he’s just moving different now and he’s getting a real handful. His goal was very good, makes a good run, gets his shot off, doesn’t lie about the floor, gets up and then he’s able to get the rebound and a really good finish.”The second half was a straightforward drubbing. Jota showed some trickery coming in from the left before his right-footed cross to the back post was headed in by the unmarked Maeda. Then some entertaining play from Reo Hatate and Jota ended with Engels sending Maeda down the right channel and his perfect lob from the edge of the box beat Carson and dipped under the bar.View image in fullscreenDaizen Maeda heads in to make it 3-0 – his second goal of the match was to follow four minutes later.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockThe Northern Irish goalkeeper was beaten again when Engels curled a wonderful shot from 25 yards in off the bar. Rodgers then moved quickly to replace Idah and Greg Taylor with Johnny Kenny and Schlupp.However, it was another Celtic substitute, Kühn – on for Jota – who lifted a shot from the edge of the box into the far corner to complete a fine evening’s work for the rampant league leaders.Of Jota, Rodgers said: “I’d obviously seen him before from the outside looking in and then I’ve seen him train and work but he’s a big player. I can’t wait for him to get up to the level in terms of that football fitness. He’s missed a lot of football, hasn’t played a great deal but he’s a class act … a big talent.”Docherty said: “It was a tough one in the end. We lost poor goals and we addressed that with the group after the game. We take full responsibility and we have to be more resolute defensively, but we need to get back on the horse now.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipCelticDundeematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Dutchman is hoping to kickstart a new era of ­success by booking his first trip to Wembley.TheLiverpoolhead coach has never watched a game at the national stadium, let alone managed there, but has the chance to lead his team at Wembley next month if they can overcome a 1-0 first-leg deficit in the Carabao Cup against Tottenham on Thursday.Anthony Gordon stuns Arsenal and sends Newcastle into Carabao Cup finalRead more“In life, it’s not only about winning trophies,” Slot said. “I have to steal something Jürgen [Klopp] said. It is also very important that the fans leave the stadium thinking: ‘When do they play again?’ I like that sentence a lot because I would love us as managers being judged more on that than only on trophies. How do they play? Is it nice to watch them? Are the fans looking forward to the next game already? I agree that we are more mostly judged on the trophies we win, but I judge myself and the players on work rate and the quality they bring during every single game.”Liverpool won the Carabao Cup last season,beating Chelsea 1-0 in the finalafter extra time and their frequent visits to Wembley has seen it nicknamed Anfield South by supporters. “It cannot be underestimated,” Slot said of the chance to reach Wembley again. “Maybe some of these players are already used to Wembley, but it would be my first time to go to Wembley. If you go to England people are talking about Wembley as an iconic stadium, especially if it’s a final. So you can be sure that we as a team want to win that game tomorrow to go to Wembley.”After making no acquisitions in the January transfer window, Liverpool’s recruitment’s focus has turned to the summer. The key complication being Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold –who misses tonight’s match through injury– who will miss Thursday’s match through injury, being out of contract in the summer.“You always have to be prepared for all the new things coming up,” Slot said. “We have some contractual situations but Trent, Mo and ­Virgil haven’t extended yet. So we are aware of the fact that we have to be sharp and ready for things that can happen.”Slot has called on the English football authorities to expand match-day squads to 23 players to help with the hectic schedule. Federico Chiesa and Joe Gomez were omitted from the squad that playedagainst Bournemouth on Saturdayand the Dutchman would rather be able to include everyone available.“We are here in a country where we play the most games, especially the likes of Aston Villa, Chelsea, Arsenal, us – all the ones playing in Europe and we have the League Cup and the FA Cup,” Slot said. “I don’t understand why we don’t go to 23 in this country because in this country, we play the most games everywhere around the world and we only have 20 players we can take to the game. It’s not for that game because nine substitutes is more than enough but to keep the dressing room going because you need more than 20 players in this country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Carabao Cup semi-finals have trialled the use of officials explaining the process that led to the outcome and this protocol is expected to be used in the Premier League in future. The first leg against Spurs saw this used after Dominic Solanke had a goal ruled out but had no remit to intervene when Lucas Bergvall committed a potential second bookable offence beforescoring the match-winner.“For me that is not necessary,” Slot said. “I wonder if it’s a good thing for the referee because he’s already under a lot of pressure in every game from the home fans.

She denies the charges.Giving evidence on Wednesday, Kerr was asked by her defence counsel, Grace Forbes, about the incident with PC Stephen Lovell at Twickenham police station in the early hours of 30 January 2023, and the hours beforehand, including the taxi ride.Kerr told the court she felt “powerless” in the police station after her account of being “terrified for [her] life” in a locked, speeding taxi was doubted by officers who she said treated her differently “based on what they perceived to be the colour of my skin”.Forbes asked the Matildas star about her experience of racism growing up in Australia. Kerr, who identifies as White-Anglo-Indian, said: “At school, I experienced being in situations where teacher had instigated that I was the troublemaker, or had started trouble,” she told the court.Kerr said she continued to face racism over social media and was “often followed around by security or a member of staff” while shopping if she was not “dressed correctly”.Kerr said she moved to the UK in December 2019 after signing with Chelsea. She said she met her partner, Kristie Mewis, six months later after the West Ham United player “slid into my DMs”. She said the pair are due to get married in December and are expecting a baby boy in May.On the evening of 29 January, they had been on a dinner date before visiting another restaurant for a friend’s birthday. Kerr said she had had some wine and cocktails that evening and ended up in a nightclub that was “a bit of a dungeon”. They stayed for 15 minutes before leaving to head home because the club “wasn’t for us”.Kerr said she had tried to request three Uber taxis but they couldn’t find a ride. Instead, they hailed a black cab, which she told the court she never used over fears related to the Claremont killer, who murdered young women in an area of Perth close to where Kerr grew up.“I lived in a state where, for 30 years, there was actually a serial killer roaming that was thought to be a taxi driver, everyone was talking about not getting in taxis,” she said.She said, at first, the taxi driver drove normally. Roughly 15 minutes into the journey however, Kerr began to feel sick. She put the window down and laid her head “on the outside of the window”.“I started to feel a little bit sick and I was spit vomiting outside of the gap,” she said. While her head was still sitting on the car’s open window frame, Kerr said the driver rolled it back up. She said from this point onwards, the atmosphere in the cab became “very scary”.She said he “instantly starting screaming after putting the window up” and it “became very dangerous and very erratic”. Kerr said the car was going “dramatically faster than before” and that it was “swerving in and out of lanes”.Kerr said neither she nor Mewis had seatbelts on and they were “getting thrown around” the cab.“I hate speed at the best of times so I was terrified for my life. I didn’t have a seatbelt on so I was getting thrown around the back of the cab,” she said. “Everything was going through my mind being in a car with a stranger.”Kerr told the court that Mewis had pleaded with the driver to stop the car but he did not listen. She said they had “tried everything” to get out of the car, both when it had stopped and was moving, including door handles and trying to open the windows again but everything was locked.Kerr said the Mewis had smashed the window, kicking it “a couple of times” with her boot while the car was still moving. Forbes asked whether they had discussed this beforehand, Kerr said no and that she felt “surprised”.Forbes asked Kerr how she felt when it shattered? “Relieved, because I saw it as a way out,” she said.After they got out of the car, which had parked outside Twickenham police station, Kerr approached police which she said left her feeling “relieved, because I thought they would help us” and that Lovell, on first impression “wasn’t that bad”.After Lovell spoke to his colleague who stayed with the taxi driver, Kerr said his tone changed and he made the couple feel like they “were the ones who had done something wrong.”Kerr said she began filming the interaction because she felt “this was a situation where I would need to prove that I was being treated poorly.”Kerr said she felt “powerless” while in the police station and that they had the power to decide whether she “went home tonight”. She said she believed officers were “treating me differently based on what they perceived to be the colour of my skin.”Forbes asked why Kerr mentioned lawyers from Chelsea football club. She said: “To make sure they knew I would have people who would protect me”. At one point, Kerr called her interactions with officers “triggering”. When asked to explain, Kerr said she had experience “of people trying to put things on me”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He is scheduled to take the stand on 12 February.Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are on trial alongside Rubiales.They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months’ jail against them.Jenni’s teammate Misa Rodríguez told the court the striker was “under a lot of pressure” and “started crying” shortly after Rubiales talked to her on the plane.“At no point did she tell us that the kiss had been consensual,” the goalkeeper added.Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballSpainShareReuse this content"

Alongside a solitary silver for the men’s curlers, the total fell below the UK Sport target of three to seven medals for the Games.Now Muirhead believes expectations should be centred on allowing athletes to compete without undue pressure. “Winter sports are very unpredictable,” she said.No transparency please, we’re the IOC: Coe makes his pitch for world sport’s top jobRead more“There are such small margins between winning and losing on the winter stage. But we don’t put numbers on it, I think it would be unfair to put that pressure on the athletes. They will perform the best they can. If they come away with a smile on their face, then that’s good.“You look at Sochi 2014, Pyeongchang [in 2018], it was the best medal returns that we’ve had – five medals at each of those Games. Yes, Beijing, we were at the bottom of the UK Sport’s medal range, but it was held in that Covid environment. It didn’t help preparations. We don’t set medal targets and we never have. It would be unfair to do that. It would be unfair to put that pressure on the athlete.”With a year to go before the Games begin, Muirhead expectsTeam GBto take about 50 athletes to Italy, qualification depending. She is enthused by the prospect of Milan and Cortina’s four geographical “clusters” of activity and remains positive that the rebuilding of the 100-year-old sliding track in Cortina will be completed in time, with Lake Placid in the US acting as a backup venue.“It’s very much an alpine skiing winter feel, they have World Cup events yearly, and I think that is just perfect for a Winter Olympics,” Muirhead said of the location. “For us in Great Britain, we’re only an hour time change away, so I think it will be great for viewing at home and for spectators to get out there. We’ve got a huge opportunity from it being on our doorstep.”Of the sliding, Muirhead said she had recently discussed progress with the Games’ organising committee. “I had a call a couple of weeks ago and they are doing monthly checks on the sliding and all is up to speed and up to date. There is still some work to do on it but they are still very positive come the next check in mid-February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Colin Graves, the club chairman, urged last year for the club to demutualise to protect its financial future, with more than £20m owed to the Graves family.The Guardian reported last month that those demutualisation plans had been paused as the club focused on the Hundred auction, with Sunrisers linked as a possible partner. Yorkshire’s chief executive, Sanjay Patel, confirmed that discussions with Sun Group have been ongoing.“We are delighted to be entering into an exclusivity period with the Sun Group, and will be continuing our conversations with them in the coming weeks with a view to setting the Northern Superchargers up for long‑term and sustained success,” said Patel, who was the managing director of the Hundred before leaving the ECB in 2023.“Having been in consultation with them for some time now, it is clear that they are aligned to the values and future direction of the club and will play a huge part in ensuring we can go on to achieve great success in the coming years.“Today is clearly a huge milestone for Yorkshire CCC, the Northern Superchargers and the Sun Group, but it is worth stressing that there is a lot of detail to be discussed alongside further due diligence and legal processes before a contract can be signed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his absence, Bordeaux’s mercurial fly-half Matthieu Jalibert is the favourite to wear the No 10 jersey at Twickenham.England team’s struggles remind me of Manchester United, says WigglesworthRead moreJalibert was not part of the squad that beat Wales 43-0 but he has been training alongside Antoine Dupont this week and is considered the most likely to get the nod when Fabien Galthié names his side on Thursday.Ntamackwas shown a red cardin the 72nd minute of France’s opening victory for a high tackle on Ben Thomas. At a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday the 25-year-old admitted an act of foul play and, though the entry point for such an offence is six weeks or matches, he was given the full 50% mitigation for factors including his clean disciplinary record. It will be reduced to two weeks or matches provided he completes World Rugby’s coaching intervention programme known colloquially as “tackle school”.His absence is a blow for France but Galthié will have been planning without Ntamack this week. Jalibert last started for France in theSix Nationslast year and he was their No 10 during the 2023 World Cup while Ntamack was nursing a long-term injury.The disciplinary panel is yet to confirm the second match that Ntamack will miss but, given Toulouse have a fixture on 16 February, it may be the case that he is considered available for France’s third-round match against Italy seven days later. Either way, he will be available for their penultimate match against Ireland.During France’s autumn campaign Galthié preferred to use Thomas Ramos, a full-back by trade, at fly-half and beforetheir one-point victory against New Zealandit emerged that Jalibert had left the camp. Jalibert had requested to be allowed to leave rather than be among the non-playing reserves, leading to suggestions of friction between him and Galthié.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both teams have been having difficult seasons but inside the red rose camp there remains a firm belief that, given a little patience, the tide will eventually turn for them.England’s attack coach, Richard Wigglesworth, also happens to be a United fan and sees similarities between the respective situations at Twickenham and Old Trafford. He thinks Amorim will eventually deliver success for United, now 13th in the Premier League, and is also backing England, who have won just two of their past nine Tests, to turn the corner in the not-too-distant future.England’s early promise blown away by Ireland’s second-half stormRead moreWigglesworth is well aware thatFrance will be formidable opponentsthis weekend but he insists signs of recovery are already visible in England’s performances.“We’re going to get there,” Wigglesworth said, pointing to the fact England have scored three tries against both Irelandand the world champions South Africain recent months. “We’re seeing green shoots in this England team; we play fast, we’re aggressive and we score tries.“Against South Africa we scored tries with limited ball and limited possession because we’re looking a little bit more dangerous. When did we last look dangerous with the ball? I think we were the only team to have scored three tries against South Africa in the past couple of years. Against Ireland there were 11 line-breaks against a good defence which doesn’t give up line-breaks. There is stuff coming.”Wigglesworth fully accepts, however, that professional sport is about results and hebelieves that coaches, whether it be Amorim at United or Borthwick with England, need time to revitalise struggling squads. “I’m not avoiding the fact that if you don’t win then people are passionate about it. They want to leave the game happy and leave with that [winning] feeling – as I am with Man United and when I was a fan and not a player or coach of England rugby.“WhenMan United played Arsenal[in the FA Cup last month] I’m seeing players sprint back and I’m thinking as a fan that I have not seen that for a long time. The manager says he wants them to run like wild dogs and I’m seeing that. The little bits [of improvement] that he’s getting in … I am fascinated by him as a coach. With my limited knowledge of football, just from watching him and how he speaks, [I think] he’s the real deal.“I love how he speaks about the team. He comes across as honest and looks as though he values the right things. The club have kept changing and changing and now they’re in their worst moment ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, the whole thing starts again: staffing and the players all change. That is proven not to be the way to do it. You need the right man. To me, he looks incredibly impressive. So given time, resources and a bit of luck that everyone always needs, it would be nice to see him turn it around.”The big difference between the Premier League and international rugby, of course, is that Borthwick has many fewer games per year in which to transform England’s fortunes. Defeat by France would be their eighth consecutive loss against tier one-opposition, the worst run in their history, with a dangerous‑looking Scotland next up.Wigglesworth, though, insists England are not ducking short-term reality. “We want to win but not everyone gets to win all the time, straight away. We are working to make that happen but there is evidence to back up the best way of creating good teams over time. We’re going to get there.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The group action has been slowed by interminable arguments about the disclosure of evidence and how the test cases should be selected. “When Moses led his people out of the wilderness, it took 40 years to get to the promised land,” Cook said. “We’re not going to spend that amount of time wandering around.”There are currently 386 claimants from union and a further 177 from league, and around a dozen from each of these groups will be chosen to come to trial on behalf of the entire cohort. Players who played in both codes will be obliged to choose to be involved in one suit rather than both.Cook duly refused the defendants argument that they should have the right to have the claimants examined by their own independent neurological experts before selecting test cases, saying that he could see “no reason” why it was necessary.He also expressed his concerns about the chaotic disclosure of medical records by the claimants’ solicitors, Rylands Garth, which he compared to “throwing documents in the air and saying: ‘find them’”.The legal teams on both sides will now begin the process of selecting 28 players each to form a pool of potential test cases before the next hearing in July. Those 56 players will be chosen to be representative of the seven different neurological conditions diagnosed among the claimants, as well the eras in which they played and the standards they reached during their careers. They will then be reduced to a total of 21 players ahead of the trial. The defence is expected to provide its generic defence in time for the second hearing in December.The progress of the case could yet turn on whether Rylands Garth has fulfilled its obligation to share all available medical records with the defendants. Rylands Garth insists it has, but the defendants argue otherwise. If the defendants are correct, then any affected cases could be struck out.Susan Rodway KC, acting for Rylands Garth, argued that the defendants had turned disclosure into “a sisyphean task in which we keep pushing this stone up the hill only to be met by a barrage of defendants who keep pushing it back down” in an attempt to draw out the case.In a statement, Rylands Garth described it as “an excellent week in court for the claimants in both the rugby league and union cases” and criticised the “continuous efforts by the defendants to stall and delay their progress”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We remain concerned by the claimants’ lawyer’s statement that ‘not all the players involved in the case have been tested’.”Cook also stressed that it is incumbent upon the claimants to establish not just that the defendants were negligent in their handling of the players, but also to substantiate what the defendants could have done differently.“It is the defendants’ view, and I have some sympathy with it, that the pleading failed to state what the defendants should have done to comply with its respective duty of care,” he said. “Claimants should be under no illusion that it is their duty to illuminate the steps the defendants should have taken, and which they failed to take.”Explore more on these topicsConcussion in sportRugby unionRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

But the most successful trainer in the history of the meeting nominated Kopek Des Bordes, the warm favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle, as his “banker” bet of the week at a media morning at his County Carlow stable here on Wednesday.Kopek Des Bordes, unbeaten in three starts to date, is already top-priced at just 11-10 for the opening race of the four-day festival, which is often one of the key contests in the battle between punters and bookies as both sides look to start the week on the front foot.Aga Khan dies with mystery of Shergar kidnapping still unsolvedRead moreThe five-year-old produced a slightly guessy round of jumping on the way to victory on his debut over hurdles at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting, but was much more polished over his hurdles as he ran away with a Grade One novice hurdle at the Dublin Racing Festival at the same track last weekend.Mullins said here on Wednesday that he had been taken aback by the ease of Kopek Des Bordes’s success, not least as the race did not unfold ideally for such an inexperienced hurdler.“It was a huge performance,” Mullins said “We would never ask a horse that sort of question at home but to me, it blew my mind, against a field of top-class horses.“[Fellow trainer] Ted Walsh rang me the following day and he said that he hadn’t seen a performance like that since Golden Cygnet [the 1978 Supreme Novice Hurdle winner], which is something huge for someone like Ted to say.“Paul [Townend] got down off the horse after the race and said to me, he ran away with him three times in the race.

Denenea argued that the emails should become public, but the Saints countered that they should be protected.The state court judge handling the case had not formally resolved that dispute when New Orleans’ archdiocese filed for federal bankruptcy protection in May 2020 in an attempt to dispense with numerous pending lawsuits stemming from the church’s decades-old, worldwide clerical child molestation scandal.The bankruptcy not only delayed litigation against the archdiocese indefinitely – it also forced Denenea’s client’s case to be transferred to the federal courthouse in New Orleans.At the new venue, Judge Susie Morgan granted permission to attorneys for the archdiocese to file seven evidentiary exhibits into the case record under seal, Denenea said and court documents showed. The order signed by Morgan on 4 May 2020 directs the courthouse clerk to “take all steps necessary … to ensure that the sealed components … are entered into the record in the above-captioned matter under seal”.Eleven days later, as Denenea said and court documents show, Morgan signed an order permitting archdiocesan attorneys to file 14 additional exhibits into the case record. The order says nothing about those exhibits being sealed or maintained under any protections.It merely directed the court clerk to “take all steps necessary to ensure that the attached … exhibits … are filed in the record of the above-captioned matter”.The email communications involving the Saints and the archdiocese were among those 14 supplementary exhibits, Denenea said he confirmed.Denenea said that evident error – and the fact that the Saints “were relying on the church’s lawyers to protect the [team’s] documents” – prompted him to formally notify the ball club’s lawyers in July “that these emails were not under seal or protected”.“I put them on notice that, if they wanted to protect these documents, they needed to bring it up with the judge in a motion to seal or a motion for a protective order for those documents,” Denenea said.A letter that Denenea sent to Saints lawyer James Gulotta cited a local rule at New Orleans’ US district courthouse which reads: “In recognition of the right of the public to access material filed with the court, no document or other tangible item, or portion thereof, may be filed under seal without the filing of a separate motion and order to seal, unless authorized by a federal statute, federal rule, or prior court order in the same case expressly authorizing the party to file certain documents (or portions thereof) under seal.”Denenea’s letter also said a member of the court clerk’s office had confirmed that the email-related documents were “not sealed by any court order”.Denenea said the Saints’ lawyers took no action despite his notice.“They didn’t do it then,” he said. “They haven’t done it since.”On Tuesday, Gulotta provided the Guardian with a reply he sent to Denenea in July which contended that a protective order in state court applied to the emails and remained in effect. He also cited a 2020 ruling from the federal fifth circuit court in New Orleans reading: “In this circuit, when a case is removed from state court to federal court, the federal court takes the case and it finds and treats the state court rulings as its own.”Gulotta’s letter to Denenea said: “There is no occasion for me, as counsel for the Saints, to file a motion in federal court to preserve the effect of the protective order restricting their disclosure.”In a statement on Tuesday, Gulotta characterized Denenea’s arguments that the emails were unshielded as “erroneous”. His statement also said: “Any disclosure to the public or to the press of the protected documents is and would be a violation of the court order protecting them.”‘Shame on them’: anger and dismay from survivors over Saints clergy-abuse emailsRead moreDenenea on Tuesday countered: “It appears to me that the Saints and their attorneys foolishly relied on the archdiocese and its lawyers in protecting their precious documents.”The Saints and archdiocese emails publicized on Monday mainly establish that Bensel – the team’s vice-president of communications – directly lobbied New Orleans media outlets to focus on exalting Archbishop Gregory Aymond’s courage in releasing a list of local, credibly accused clergy abusers in November 2018, which was meant as an act of conciliation and transparency amid the ongoing fallout of the church’s clerical molestation scandal.He also solicited and frequently received feedback on – and moral support for – the messaging campaign from Benson, who is Aymond’s close personal friend, as well as the Saints and Pelicans president, Dennis Lauscha. Bensel did the same with other powerfulcivic figureswho neither worked for the Saints nor the archdiocese.The Saints have insisted the emails amount to nothing more than well-intended “public relations assistance” with media attention over the clergy-abuse scandal, which in April 2024 left the archdiocese faced with a child sex-trafficking investigation being conducted jointly by state and federal law enforcement.A statement from the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests’ Louisiana chapter on Tuesdaysaidthose emails “signal that the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church is more widespread and insidious than anyone could possibly imagine”.But at a news conference on Monday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodellhailedthe Saints as being “very involved in this community, and they are great corporate citizens”.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseLouisianaCatholicismNew OrleansNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

AI has become a general-purpose technology, and a platform which countless organisations and individuals use to build applications,” Hassabis and Manyika wrote.“It has moved from a niche research topic in the lab to a technology that is becoming as pervasive as mobile phones and the internet itself; one with numerous beneficial uses for society and people around the world, supported by a vibrant AI ecosystem of developers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The OnePlus 13 is the latest in the Oppo sub-brand’s series of keenly priced phones. Despitebecoming more expensive every year, the £899 (€1,049/$899) new model still costs a little less than its £1,000-plus Google and Samsung rivals.The OnePlus comes in a choice of colours, including a particularly attractive blue microfibre back version as pictured, which feels great and stands out in the sea of glass and metal slabs modern phones have become.View image in fullscreenThe expansive screen has thin bezels and curved edges.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 6.8-in screen is bright, sharp, smooth and colourful, putting it on par with some of the best. The bevelled metal sides are almost retro, reminiscent of theOnePlus X from 2015, but make the 13 fairly easy to handle. Though it is still a big phone requiring two hands to wield most of the time. The handset is well-built with IP68 water resistance against immersion, similar to most competitors, and an unusual IP69 rating against 80C water jets, should it end up in the dishwasher by accident.Rapid in use with the fastest new chipThe OnePlus is one of the first handsets to use Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which will no doubt find its way into most high-end Androids in 2025. In tests, the chip is about 40% faster than its predecessor and makes short work of games and other intensive tasks. But the OnePlus feels even faster in day-to-day use than the numbers suggest as the software has been tuned for speed, rapidly responding to app launches, taps, swipes and other interactions. Even the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in the screen is super fast at unlocking the phone.View image in fullscreenIt still has OnePlus’s signature alert slider for quickly switching between ring, vibrate and silent modes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianPleasingly, the 13’s top performance does not come at the expense of battery life. The phone lasts a consistent 50 hours on a full charge when used on a mix of 5G and wifi with the screen actively used for about six hours. That means charging it every other day, or nightly on very heavy usage days, which is roughly on par with top competitors.A full charge using a standard 45W USB-C charger (not included) hits 50% in under half an hour and completes in 68 minutes, or as little as 37 minutes if you buy a special 100W SuperVooc charger. The phone has up to 50W wireless charging too.SpecificationsScreen:6.82in, 120Hz QHD+ OLED (510ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteRAM:12 or 16GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:OxygenOS 15 (Android 15)Camera:50M + 50MP ultrawide + 50MP 3x; 32MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68/69 (1.5-metre depth for 30mins/80C water jets for 30 seconds)Dimensions:162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5mmWeight:210gSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe OnePlus 13 is solidly built but does not include recycled materials.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery is rated to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,600 full charge cycles and can be replaced for £80.The phone does not contain recycled materials but isgenerally repairable, with screen replacements costing £280. The company does not publish product environmental impact reports, but is included in parent-company Oppo’syearly sustainability reports.Oxygen OS 15 with some AIView image in fullscreenOnePlus displays media, timers and other activities around the selfie camera at the top of the screen, left. The AI tools have their own slide-out dock, centre.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 13 runs Oxygen OS 15, which is the firm’s customised version of Android 15. It behaves like most western versions of Android and is truly rapid in operation. It has a few rough edges, such as text descriptions of features displayed only in Chinese, but also a good amount of customisation options for those that like to tinker.A few new AI tools have been added that werelacking from previous versionsas it tries to play catch up with rivals. It has a few of Google’s AI features including its Gemini voice assistant, Circle to Search, and writing tools in Gmail and Messages. The OnePlus photos app now has a few AI editing tools, too, one of which is able to erase reflections from pictures shot through windows with impressive results.OnePlus has some AI summary, writing and proofing tools of its own, but they are confined to its Notes app and an odd pop-out dock at the side of the screen. They are hit and miss and feel tacked on rather than being part of the system like better rivals.OnePlus will provide only four years of Android updates with six years of security patches,ending on 7 January 2031. That falls far short of the seven-plus years of full software and security support provided by Apple,GoogleandSamsung.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app has most of the tools you need to take a good photo and plenty of modes with which to experiment.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 13 has three 50-megapixel cameras on the back, including a 0.6x ultrawide, 1x wide and 3x telephoto that can reach 6x magnification before requiring digital zoom, plus a 32MP selfie camera on the front.The triple rear camera is a marked improvement over thephone’s predecessor, shooting detailed and well-balanced images across a range of lighting conditions. Images from the ultrawide can look a little soft, but the telephoto camera is one of the best at 3x zoom. The phone also does a good job of capturing motion and handles low-light conditions very well. OnePlus has a tendency to overbrighten and over-sharpen images more than rivals, but otherwise the 13 is the closest yet to the best in the business. Most people will be very happy with the results.The camera app also has a solid set of features including a “master” mode for manual control, fun macrophotography, slow-mo, tilt-shift and time-lapse modes, and a setting to shoot photos at the full 50MP resolution of the sensors.PriceThe OnePlus 13 costs from£899(€1,049/$899).For comparison, theGoogle Pixel 9 Procosts from£999, the Samsung Galaxy S25+ costs£999and theiPhone 16 Procosts£999.VerdictThe OnePlus 13 is the most expensive non-folding smartphone the company has made, but the money has mostly been spent wisely to create a top-tier phone that rivals the best in the business on many, if not all fronts.It sets a new speed benchmark as one of the first phones of 2025 with the new top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip from Qualcomm, which is expected to be used in most high-end Androids this year. The camera is improved on predecessors and the closest OnePlus has come to the best in the business from Google, Samsung and Apple. The screen is great, the two-day battery life is good and the phone looks particularly special in the blue microfibre version.The Oxygen OS Android software is rapid, making the phone feel very fast indeed, but has a few rough edges. It has a couple of good AI tools from Google, but many of OnePlus’s own AI features are poorly integrated and not quite up to scratch. OnePlus also lags Google and Samsung on software updates, which is a shame.At just shy of £900 the OnePlus is certainly not a budget option. But it undercuts big-screen rivals by about 10% and is well worth considering alongside the top Androids this year.Pros:Slick, attractive design, good screen, long battery life, rapid performance and top Android chip, good camera, water resistance, Google Gemini and other AI tools.Cons:Oxygen OS has rough edges and poor AI integration, fewer AI tools than rivals, software support short of best, more expensive than predecessor.Explore more on these topicsAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It said payments dropped off sharply in the second half of the year, reflecting the impact of action taken against cybercriminals and a refusal to pay.Ministers consider ban on all UK public bodies making ransomware paymentsRead moreThe 2024 total is also lower than the $999m and $1.1bn recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In ransomware attacks, criminals access their victims’ IT systems, steal data and lock up files by encrypting them. The assailants – typically based in Russian or former Soviet states – then demand a ransom payment, usually in bitcoin, to decrypt the files and return the data.Jacqueline Burns Koven, head of cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis, said the new figures indicated that a “ransomware apocalypse” had been averted. “For years now, the cybersecurity landscape seemed hurtling towards a so-called ransomware apocalypse, so this sharp decline, to levels even lower than those in 2020 and 2021 speaks to the effectiveness of law enforcement actions, improved international collaboration, and a growing refusal by victims to cave into attackers demands,” she said.However, Burns Koven said the downward trend in payments was “fragile” and that ransomware attacks remained “prolific”.In further evidence of victims refusing to meet attackers’ demands, in the second half of last year sums demanded by cyber gangs were 53% higher than the actual payouts – despite an increase in the number of ransomware attacks.Over the same period the number of ransomware-related “on-chain” payments – the term for payments registered on a blockchain that records crypto transactions – declined, indicating fewer payments by victims.One expert said a coordinated international operation in February last year totake down a leading ransomware gang, LockBit, appeared to have had an effect as well as the disappearance of another cybercrime outfit called BlackCat/ALPHV.“The market never returned to the previous status quo after the collapse of LockBit and BlackCat/ALPHV,” said Lizzie Cookson, of the ransomware response firm Coveware. “The current ransomware ecosystem is infused with a lot of newcomers who tend to focus efforts on the small- to mid-size markets, which in turn are associated with more modest ransom demands.”In the UK, ministers are considering banning schools, the NHS and local councils from makingransomware payments.Under the proposals, payouts by private companies will have to be reported to the government and could be blocked. Reporting ransomware attacks could also be made mandatory if the government consultation leads to legal changes.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeMalwareInternetData and computer securityOrganised crimeData protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

She says it seems like “basically everything” in her apartment comes from Temu.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Donald Trump’s10% tariff on China-made goodssold to the US, which went into effect early on Tuesday morning, might change her shopping habits. On top of this, the US Postal Service brieflysuspended deliveries of incoming parcels from China and Hong Kongbefore they were later resumed.Thetariffcloses off a trade loophole that allowed fast-fashion companies such as Temu andSheinto ship packages under $800 into the US duty-free; this loophole, called “de minimis” has beencriticizedby both political parties in recent years. On Tuesday, Reutersreportedthat Shein and Temu are now likely to raise prices, as is Amazon’s Haul, a new e-commerce app that imports products from China-based sellers.Shoppers are concerned the tariff will get in the way of their retail therapy.“Trying to get that last Temu order in before Trump puts another tariff onChina,” Armacost, who works in consulting and also makes comedy videos on TikTok, captioned a post on Monday that shows her frantically typing on a computer, hacker movie-style. It was mostly a joke, but she has friends who made one final Temu run. “My friend Piper got a ton of apartment stuff during a last-minute tariff haul,” she said.View image in fullscreenVivi Armacost has friends who made a final Temu run.Photograph: Tiktok user @viviarmacostTemu – which surpassed Amazon as the most-downloaded shopping app in 2023 – andSheinare beloved by the overly trendy and the obsessively thrifty. While Shein is known primarily for clothing, Temu also sells makeup, home goods and decor. These products are cheap – just over $4 for a pair of women’s sneakers on Temu, or $1.45 for bracelet on Temu – but of dubious quality. Inevitably, many end up in landfills.“A lot of the stuff comes actually way smaller than you expect,” Armacost said. “I bought a desk lamp, except it can fit in my hands.”In the months before Trump took office, shoppers urged each other to stock up on Temu and Shein, in case the new administration followed through on its promise to tax US trade partners. “Kinda feeling emo bc this may be the last good Black Friday for a while because of the tariffs,” one TikTok user wrote in aclip. “Better collect your ‘vintage Shein’ because they will probably go for $100 next year.’”Two days after the election, the fashion writer Amy Odellwarned readersof price hikes in a post to her BackRow Substack titled: “Trump Won. So Shop Now.” Susan Scafidi, a lawyer and founder of Fordham’s Fashion Law Institute, told Odell: “Everything’s going to be more expensive, which is a little crazy when you realize that a lot of the Trump appeal was with regard to the economy.”Could the tariff kill fast fashion, an industry defined by wasteful over-consumption, as we know it? No, says Margaret Bishop, a textile and apparel specialist and professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology. “If anything, I think these tariffs will strengthen fast fashion’s hold on customers,” she said. “If everything costs more, particularly food, transportation and housing, they’re going to have to cut back somewhere.“Americans have a real hunger for new fashion, so they will trade down to be able to continue to buy things. If a $1 pack of T-shirts at Temu becomes $2 a pack, that’s still cheaper than spending $20 for a couple of T-shirts that are better made,” she continued.Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, agreed that tariffs would not “fundamentally shift” Americans’ love of a good, if sketchy, deal. While small businesses will bear most of the pain from tariffs – due to supply chain snarls or the fact that Americans won’t be able to spend as much – larger corporations such as Shein and Temu tend to absorb costs.“These companies are resourceful,” Lu said. “My more immediate concern is that small and medium-sized enterprises won’t survive, or will face significant challenges.”Big tech to tungsten: what industries are the focus of China’s new US tariffs?Read moreIn 2023, a US congressionalreportalleged that there was an “extremely high risk” that Temu used forced labor in its supply chain, and that both Shein and Temu evaded US human rights reviews. (Shein denied these claims at the time, while Temu did not comment on the report.) A recentreportfrom the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that some Shein workers endure 75-hour work weeks. (Shein told the BBC it was “working hard” to address the issues raised in the report.)The fast-fashion industry is alsosynonymouswith high carbon emissions and pollution.Lu fears that tariffs will exacerbate these issues. “If they have to pay more on tariff duties but at the same time make their prices competitive, that’s not good news for workers or the environmental impact, because companies will have more incentive to cut corners,” he said.In the EU, the European Commission moved on Wednesday totighten checks on goodssold by online retailers such as Shein and Temu, amid fears that “dangerous products” were flooding the market and that local competitors were losing out to competitors selling unsafe or counterfeit products.Armacost knows that these e-commerce giants represent the worst of Americans’ desire for excess. “But also, at the same time, spending does stimulate the economy,” she said. “In response to the idea that it’s a good thing if people stop ordering so much random stuff, I say: ‘What’s the point of living in a country if I can’t order 100 pieces of junk for $15?’”Explore more on these topicsE-commerceDonald TrumpChinaSheinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Italian government has not responded to a request for comment on whether it is a client of Paragon.Critic of Italy-Libya migration pact told he was target of Israeli spywareRead moreLike other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its wares to government agencies, who are meant to use it to track criminals. The company has said it sells its spyware only to democratic countries. It has declined to comment on WhatsApp’s allegation that its spyware was used to target journalists and activists residing in two dozen countries, some withinEurope.Responding to the allegations late on Wednesday, Meloni’s office denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged breaches.In a statement, her office said the government believed the allegations were “particularly serious” and instructed the national cybersecurity agency (ACN) to look into the matter. ACN spoke with Advant, a law firm appointed by WhatsApp Ireland, and it emerged that the number of Italian users so far affected “appeared to be seven”.The statement said ACN was not provided with the identities of the users, however it emerged that the users involved, other thanItaly, had phone numbers with international prefixes including Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.Under the Biden administration, Paragon agreed a $2m contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but the deal was put on hold after questions were raised about the arrangement’s compliance with an executive order that restricted the use of spyware by the federal government, in case its use represented a “significant counterintelligence or security risk”.The executive order has not been rescinded by the Trump administration.Neither Paragon nor ICE commented on the status of the contract.Paragon has a US office in Chantilly, Virginia. John Fleming, a former CIA veteran, is executive chair of Paragon US.For now, the focus is on whether Italy has used the spyware.“It has become clear; Italy has a Paragon problem. Given the cases that have already quickly come forward, it’s time to ask: who was the customer? And how far do these cases go?,” said John Scott Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital surveillance of civil society.A person close to Paragon declined to comment on the identify of its clients but said it “would not deny” that Italy was a client.Casarini has been a prominent activist figure in Italy for decades, but in an interview with the Guardian said his primary focus was now the maritime rescue NGO he founded in 2018. He was on a train heading to Bologna, he said, when he got a “ping” on his phone from WhatsApp. He joked that he initially wondered why Mark Zuckerberg – whose Meta owns WhatsApp – was messaging him. He was one of 90 people to get the alert that he had been targeted by an unknown assailant using military-grade spyware.‘Why did we give back this alleged criminal?’ Pressure grows on Meloni after Italy releases wanted Libyan police chiefRead moreWhen Paragon’s hacking software, which is called Graphite, successfully infects a phone, it can access all its information, including encrypted messages sent via Signal and WhatsApp. WhatsApp has said targets were added to chat groups and sent malicious PDFs. They did not need to click on anything to be infected, it would have happened automatically, experts say.“This is a war against solidarity, activism, against helping migrants,” he said, adding that he was already facing a trial for alleged “illegal” aid to migrants.While he was surprised at the severity of the alleged surveillance attempt against him, Casarini also expressed defiance.“I want that them to know that they can find me. But I can also find them. We can organize to defend ourselves, to protect ourselves against authoritarian activity,” he said.Recently, he has spoken out against the Italian government’s decision last month to allow a Libyan general accused of war crimes and wanted by the international criminal court, Osama Najim, to return home on an Italian secret service flight, in whatcritics have said was an attempt to shield alleged abuses committed in Libyain connection to the country’s migrant pact with Italy.WhatsApp has not publicly identified how long the targets may have been under surveillance. The targeting was discovered in December and was then shut down.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppItalyGiorgia MeloniEuropeHackingCybercrimeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.The company issued a statement after the news broke: “We’re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we’ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there. We’ve updated our 10-k language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.”Alphabet’s annual filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday showed it omitted a line saying it was “committed to making diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve”.

We need to do more than just ban phones in schools.”The study called for a more “holistic” approach to lowering phone use among students.It said: “This approach does not necessarily preclude restrictive school mobile phone policies. But these policies would be linked with a wider holistic approach to adolescent mobile phone and social media use.”Joe Ryrie, the director of the campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood, described the results of the study as “somewhat surprising”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a critical societal issue that requires urgent attention from parents, from schools and from government.”Ryrie urged parents to delay giving smartphones to their children. But he added: “Far tougher regulation is going to be needed to make social media platforms safer and non-addictive for kids, because the really stark statistic in this report is that the average daily time students spend on their smartphone was four to six hours. That’s a terrifying amount of time for children to spend scrolling and swiping.”Last week the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson,rejected calls to bring in a new law to ban phones in classrooms, as she called the Conservative party’s proposal a “headline-grabbing gimmick”. But she also said phones had no place in the classroom and that it was right for schools to take firm action against their use.A government spokesperson said teachers had clear guidelines for managing phone use in schools. They said: “Our focus is on keeping young people safe, while also benefitting from the latest technology. By thesummer, robust new protections for children will be in force through the Online Safety Act to protect them from harmful content and ensure they have an age-appropriate experience online.“More robust evidence is needed to reach clear conclusions on the impact of smartphones on children, which is why we have launched our own research, led by the University of Cambridge, into the impact of social media on children’s overall wellbeing.”The headline and text of this article were amended on 5 February 2025 to make clear that the study found phone bansalonedid not improve grades or wellbeing.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsChildrenSmartphonesPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsMobile phonesnewsShareReuse this content"

I just had to watch my friend, Nikole Hannah-Jones, articulate a great point that many have missed: Donald Trump is pursuing a racial agenda, not an economic one.This isn’t historically novel. Most progress is met by this kind of backlash – from the “Red Shirts” and Klansmen who used brutal violence against Black citizens following the gains of the Reconstruction era, to thevoting restrictionsthat followed the election of Barack Obama. But this time is different.This time isn’t aboutPete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, and Trump using the recent American Airlines plane crash in Washington DC to envelop themselves in anti-DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) outrage. This isn’t about Maga devotees fighting against anti-discrimination measures,eliminating pronouns, pushinganti-vaccine pseudoscienceor changing the name of theGulf of Mexicoor canceling identity-driven celebrations like the ones duringBlack History Month.It’s about the fact that in spite of all this, many of us have grown numb to this brand of rightwing viciousness and cruelty. As Trump and Elon Musk try to disassemble the greatest nation on earth at its core, Washington Democrats don’t even look like they’re up to the task to stop it. Even as the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, rolls out his“resistance agenda”, questions remain. Where have Democrats been since 5 November? What is our message? What is our voice? Why aren’t we in spaces where this voice can be heard?Meanwhile, Trump continues to use hyperbolic rhetoric invoking race and division, pushing his agenda instead of the economic populist message he ran on. His Ice raids aren’t just targeting immigrants, they’ve also ended in thedetainmentof US citizens, including a veteran.Trump reversed the 60-year-oldexecutive orderthat prohibited federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination, putting countless minority small business owners on the chopping block. He stopped every single Department of Justicecivil rights investigationandpolice reform agreement– that includes the agreements in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, that were reached following the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. These aren’t abstract political principles we’re talking about. This is about real people with real lives on the line.Trump’s attack on civil rights and his agenda rooted in racial division don’t just affect people of color, they reach other citizens as well. Do you know what would have happened if a federal judge hadn’t paused the Trump spending freeze? It means your lead water pipes don’t get replaced. It means doctors working to cure cancer or fight Alzheimer’s have to stop their research. It means your daily commute is even more dangerous because crews stopped fixing the roads and bridges and, if you have one of the more than330,000 clean energy jobscreated by the Inflation Reduction Act, Trump tried to freeze your paycheck.Meanwhile, the price of eggskeeps going up.So I don’t care if Trump wants to buy Greenland or not. I care that he’spardoning white supremacistswho already organized one insurrection. I care that he fired every FBI agent and DoJ official who worked on any of the multiple investigations against him. I care that he got rid of theindependent inspectors generalof at least 12 major federal agencies.What’s more, Trump and Scott Bessent, the newly confirmed treasury secretary, just gave Musk and his “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cronies unfettered access to Americans’ sensitive information. Musk, a billionaire from South Africa who grew up filthy rich because of apartheid, is not a paidgovernment official. He isn’t a presidential appointee. The Senate has never interviewed him, and they sure haven’t confirmed him because Trump’s Doge isn’t a real government agency.But now they have access to your social security number, your address and your work history, and they can stop every dollar you get from the federal government, from your Medicare benefits to your tax return. Remember how mad you were the last time you heard about some huge data breach that might have exposed your personal information? Well, this is the same thing but worse and no one can investigate because Trump fired the inspector general.I’m a Democrat from blood-red South Carolina, so I know that I’m supposed to toe the party line and lay this all at the feet of the Maga extremists. But the silence we’re getting from a lot of Americans, regardless of political party, is deafening.Too many Republicans andDemocratsare doing absolutely nothing to stop Trump, and I can only imagine how their failure to resist thrills the oligarchs in Russia and China who have been praying for this kind of good fortune for generations. It’s one thing to cheer for the madman burning down your house. It’s worse when you know how dangerous it is and have the power to stop him but you don’t.

Oh, how wrong I wasArwa MahdawiThe Maga kingpin has only been president for a couple of weeks, but the chaos he has unleashed in the US is already much worse than I thought it could be. I’m genuinely frightenedWed 5 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 08.14 ESTShareThe day after Donald Trump won the election, everyone in my liberal corner of Philadelphia seemed shell-shocked. At preschool drop-off, a mom burst into tears. At the playground, a gay parent I know told me that they were aggressively downsizing in case they had to flee the country. Meanwhile, I felt oddly sanguine and thought people were being a tad dramatic. I rolled my eyes about Ellen DeGeneresrelocating to England. I was optimistic that Trump 2.0, while horrific, wouldn’t actually be the end of US democracy.This was an unusual attitude for me, because catastrophising is one of my main pastimes. I spent about 10 minutes this morning staring at a red dot that has appeared on my nose, wondering if it meant I was dying. But when Trump won the election, I was already too emotionally drained from a year of watching Joe Biden help turn Gaza into an unliveable hellscape to worry about things getting even worse.Some people believe that if you think positive thoughts you will manifest them into reality. Unfortunately, this did not work for me. Trump has only been president for a couple of weeks and things are already far worse than I had imagined they could be – and not just in Gaza, where he has threatened an American takeover that has been described as“ethnic cleansing by another name”. I feel genuinely scared in a way I didn’t expect to. Trump and his partner-in-crime, Elon Musk, are in the process of smashing the US to bits with a sledgehammer so they can sell it off for scrap and rebuild it to their liking. Even if you’re privileged enough not to be directly affected by that sledgehammer, you can still feel the reverberations.Almost nobody in the US has escaped the chaos that Trump and Musk have already unleashed in such an incredibly short time. My wife works in international development and has friends who have already lost their jobs because of Trumpdismantling USAidand throwing all its contractors into disarray. I have friends in the education sector who have been scrambling todeal with the paniccaused by Trump’s plans to freeze federal loans and grants: students have been freaking out that they might not be able to get financial aid,some daycare centresreliant on federal funding were forced to temporarily shut down, and researchers are worried about theirprojects losing funding. (From a selfish point of view, I’m worried a project of my own will lose funding.) That freeze has been temporarily blocked but who knows what’s going to happen next?Meanwhile, people are being rounded up and deported. It’s not as if this is the first time that mass deportations have happened in the US (Obama was known as the “deporter in chief”), but Trump’s raids are designed to cause maximum panic. He has allowed immigration authorities to go into sensitive places such as schools, churches and hospitals. Rumours about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents being spotted near schools are all over social media andparent groups. People are terrified – which, of course, is the point. And it’s not just immigrants who are scared: the raids also seem to bescooping up US citizens, including Native Americans.Trump has plenty of volunteers lining up to help the deportations. The president seems intent on outlawing all support for Palestinians and has been suggesting kicking outforeign studentswho protest against Israel’s actions; a number of pro-Israel groups are keen to make that happen. One group called Betar has compiled a list of students and teachers it thinks should be expelled from the US and given this listto the Trump administration. Betar also recently tweeted that it would crash a vigil in New York for Hind Rajab –the five-year-old girl killed with her family as they attempted to flee Israeli forces– to document all attenders and assist Ice in “deportation efforts”. The Biden administration alsobrutallycracked down on pro-Palestinian speech, of course, but Trump is taking things to a new level. I’m on a green card that needs to be renewed very soon; if I write a column saying Israel isguilty of genocide, might I get deported?If I do have to flee the US with my wife and kid, then do any Cotswolds-based readers happen to know Ellen? Please tell her I’m sorry for having been mean about her in the past. Please, Ellen, open up your damp mansion to some refugees from Philadelphia.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’m horrified that Trump wants to keep immigrants thereMansoor AdayfiThis moral failure and sends a clear message – the government prioritizes deterrence over dignity and cruelty over compassionWed 5 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 06.01 ESTShareIn a move that has reignited outrage, the president, Donald Trump,signed an executive orderto expand the Migrant Operations Center at Guantánamo Bay, aiming to detain up to 30,000 immigrants labeled as “high-priority criminal aliens”. For many, including myself, this decision is a painful reminder of the facility’s dark history – a history marked by torture, indefinite detention and systemic dehumanization.Guantánamo Bay, a name synonymous with human rights abuses, was first repurposed in 2002 under then president George W Bush and defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a detention center for individuals branded as “the worst of the worst”. I was among those detainees – abducted, shackled and transported like cargo, blindfolded and unaware of my fate. The memories of roaring military planes, soldiers barking orders and the growls of attack dogs still haunt me.The US government justified our detention by painting us as dangerous terrorists, a narrative that allowed for indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial. Now, more than two decades later, a similar narrative is being constructed. Trump’s rhetoric of labeling undocumented immigrants as “the worst criminal illegal aliens”, is a deliberate and dehumanizing tactic that opens the door to further abuses under the guise of national security.This decision is not just a policy shift; it’s a moral failure. Having endured nearly 15 years in Guantánamo without due process, subjected to torture and inhumane conditions, I can attest to the facility’s capacity for cruelty. I shared those cages with innocent men and even children, all victims of a system designed to strip away their humanity.The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s power grab: a coup veiled by chaos | EditorialRead moreGuantánamo Bay remains one of the world’s most secretive and expensive prisons. Its remote location and stringent security measures ensure that the atrocities committed within its walls remain hidden from public scrutiny. By choosing to detain immigrants there, the US government is sending a clear message: it prioritizes deterrence over dignity, and punishment over compassion.This move is the culmination of years of rhetoric. During his 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to keep Guantánamo open. In 2019, he floated the idea of classifying immigrants as enemy combatants and sending them there. The new executive order makes those threats a reality. But at what cost? How many innocent people will be subjected to indefinite detention, stripped of their rights and isolated from the world? How many families will be torn apart and forced to endure conditions that defy basic human decency?Guantánamo has long served as a symbol of injustice and the abuse of power. It has been a testing ground for torture and indefinite detention, a place where the rule of law is dead and justice is denied. The decision to repurpose it for migrant detention is a stark reminder of the US government’s willingness to sidestep international norms in favor of political expediency.The choice of Guantánamo is no accident. It’s a calculated move meant to instill fear, distract political opponents, and satisfy a base that thrives on exclusionary policies. By selecting a location synonymous with torture and human rights violations, the administration is doubling down on its commitment to cruelty over compassion.For years, even during my detention, I have fought for justice, the closure of Guantánamo and accountability for its abuses. Today, I call on the international community, human rights organizations and individuals of conscience to join this fight. We must demand the closure of Guantánamo and resist any attempts to use it as a tool of oppression.The world cannot afford to look away. We must stand together to uphold the principles of human rights and dignity. The legacy of Guantánamo is one of suffering and injustice, and we cannot allow history to repeat itself.In the words of the late Nelson Mandela: “To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.” Let us not deny the humanity of those seeking refuge and a better life. Let us choose justice over cruelty and compassion over indifference.Together, we can ensure that Guantánamo becomes a relic of the past, not a blueprint for the future.Mansoor Adayfi is the author of Don’t Forget Us HereExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpGuantánamo BayUS immigrationCubaUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But everyone knows what the election will be fought about – cost of living.Got a new infrastructure proposal? Great, link it to the cost of living.Healthcare policy?Great, but make sure you also get in a line about cost pressures and cost-of-living relief from cheaper medicines.Education? Try free Tafe and less Hecs debt – but this is all really about the cost of living (which doesn’t mean they are bad policies).Defence? Errr … can we say how nuclear submarines we may never get will help our cost of living? (Hah, no, we can’t even convincingly explain how it will help our defence.)‘It just can’t be replaced’: Mallacoota’s black summer grief is still fresh after five yearsRead moreThe level of jobseeker payments? Ahh, sorry, we’re only concerned with the cost ofliving, not the cost of living inpoverty.So, it is good that Wednesday saw the release of thequarterly living costs dataas it gives us a sense of where things are at.Always remember, “inflation”, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), does not measure the cost of living. Yes, there is a lot of overlap, but there are two key differences: the CPI is an average of all households in Australia, and it counts the cost of building a new home.Building a new home is generally not something that matters to too many of us, and it sure as heck is not a cost of living.So, the ABS’s “living cost indexes” divide households up into groups – because being a family with someone in work, with kids at school etc has a lot of different costs compared with, say, an aged pensioner or that “self-funded” (through tax breaks) retiree.The living costs measure also doesn’t count the cost of building a home; instead it counts the cost of repaying a mortgage. And that makes all the difference right now.If the graph does not display click hereThe government is struggling to talk up the fact that inflationis well and truly under control. CPI rose just 2.4% on the past year. That’s right in the Goldilocks zone.But that ignores that people don’t care too much about annual growth of prices – they care about how much prices have gone up by.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIf the price of something goes up 7.5% in one year, then 3.3% in the following and is now rising at 3.0%, people will not care too much about the 3.0% because they still feel the impact of the 7.5% – and that, overall, prices over that time have gone up 12%.This is why the opposition on Tuesdayasked the prime ministerhow much the cost of food has risen since he took office (12%). But Albanese was also right to point out thatwhen Labor was elected food prices were rising at 5.9% a year and are now rising just 3.0%.So he is right, but will it convince anyone? Especially when the cost of living for employees’ households didn’t rise 2.4% or 3.0% in the past year, but 4.0%.If the graph does not display click hereThe good news is that all household types are seeing the cost of living go up slower now than in September last year, and much slower than a year ago.But the big issue is mortgage repayments, which rose 14.7% in the past year.That is less than the 18.9% rise in the year to September last year, and miles less than the 91.6% rise in the year to June 2023. But it highlights just how big of an issue rate rises are – and why talking about inflation will not cut through while the cash rate remains at 4.35%.If the graph does not display click hereSo great is the impact of interest rate rises that, since June 2022, mortgage repayments have accounted for nearly half of the total increase in the cost of living for employee households:If the graph does not display click hereSo yes, economists and politicians can talk about inflation falling all we like. But until the Reserve Bank starts cutting rates, I doubt anyone will care to listen.The good news for those of us lucky enough to have a mortgage – and for the government’s chances of re-election – is investors currently are essentially 95% sure the RBA will cut rates in two weeks:If the graph does not display click hereThe market is even pricing in three rate cuts by August.That will be too late to affect the election – but it will certainly affect how people feel about the cost of living.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia Institute and the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsEconomicsGrogonomicsCost of living crisisInterest ratesLabor partyAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Starmer’s ratings are nowworse than Rishi Sunak’s at his nadir, and Nigel Farage’s Reform – a party with just five MPs –appears to be edgingahead of the party of government in the polls. So far, this government has spent its timeclobbering pensioners, being showered with freebies by well-heeled donors and damaging economic confidence with ill-judged post-election doom and gloom, followed by a panicked “growth above all else” reverse ferret. Just months after securing power, the prime minister’s own staffbriefed two Times journaliststhat they had no idea what he really believed, and that he wasn’t really running the country – that he’d been deceived into thinking he was “driving the train”, when he’s really been sat at the front of the driverless Docklands Light Railway.It’s almost enough to make you pity Starmer – imagine publicly humiliating the prime minister you are paid to work for just months after winning power? – until you remember that he appointed this backstabbing rabble in the first place. The published excerpts from Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund’s new book, Get In: The Inside Story ofLabourUnder Starmer, lay out the strategy of this rightwing faction. “Occasionally they even spoke of their leader as if he were a useful idiot,” they write. “Keir acts like an HR manager, not a leader,” his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is quoted as saying.They saw Starmer as a convenient empty vessel, whom they could deceive a Corbynite Labour membership into voting for, then use their yes-man to permanently bury the left before replacing him with a true believer, the ultra-Blairite Wes Streeting. Alas, the Tories managed to implode and the man they see as a useful idiot sits in No 10, pretending to drive a train.Let me mount a defence of Starmer, the scapegoat of these rightwing factionalists, who are ridiculing him for doing literally everything they asked him to do. To be successful, a government needs purpose. Purpose gives it coherence, provides backbone to survive crises, prevents it from being buffeted by events, leaves ministers understanding what goals they’re working towards, and allows voters to understand what their rulers are trying to do. Whatever you thought of them, the Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair governments had purpose, and succeeded, but the administrations of Gordon Brown and Rishi Sunak did not, and collapsed.Think Trumpism couldn’t take root and flourish in Britain? Think again | John HarrisRead morePurpose does not deliver inevitable success – no one can accuse Liz Truss of lacking vision, yet she was famously outlasted by a lettuce – but it is a precondition. The political project of Starmer’s aides is a crude replication of late-stage Blairism, lacking that crucial ingredient of purpose. Whatever I may think about New Labour, it wasn’t a cheap rip-off, and the party’s current masters are political and intellectual minnows by comparison. New Labour’s project was straightforward: accept the Thatcherite settlement, but humanise it using the tax revenues flowing from an unsustainable economic model centred on the City of London. That model went bust in 2008, never to recover, and the Labour establishment couldn’t think up anything new. Their cupboard was empty, which is why Corbynism – which offered a clear alternative narrative – usurped them in 2015. The problem isn’t Starmer per se: it’s a faction with no answers to the crisis-afflicted Britain of 2025.That Starmer has many personal traits that make him unsuitable as leader is undeniable. The new book notes that he used to text me rather peculiar reprimands when I criticised him in this column or on Twitter (now X). For example, when Iwrote a columncriticising Starmer for ordering Labour MPs to abstain on a Tory bill that allowed MI5 agents and police officers to commit crimes if it prevented a more serious crime or threat to national security, he texted me to say I was better than that, like a disappointed schoolteacher. You might wonder whether he had better things to do. I would agree. The point is: he is thin-skinned, and the faction around him weaponised that to crush the left. That emphasises why this is a caricature of New Labour. Blair used to telephone leftwing firebrand Dennis Skinner for advice,and invite him for tea. Starmer would probably have purged him.The problem is that Starmer’s team always knew what they opposed – those ghastly lefties! – but not what they stood for. In opposition,Starmer assailed the Toriesfor their mantra of “cut the green crap”; his flailing government now has a growth strategy dependenton expanding Heathrow, to the distaste of even a parliamentary Labour party largely handpicked for blind loyalty. The suggestion that this government is in thrall to vested interests is underscored bythe book’s claimsthat wealthy donor Waheed Alli, who showered Starmer with clothes and spectacles, blocked proposals to ban foreign political donations, opening the way for Elon Musk to try to help bankroll Farage into Downing Street.Here’s the problem. Our economic model has stopped offering sustained rises in living standards and improvements to the public realm. Two possible outcomes flow from this. Either voters are offered an alternative, which means challenging the concentration of wealth and power in the bank accounts of a few. Or voters may simply conclude that democracy no longer delivers, and be susceptible to messages that blame migrants and other stigmatised minorities for decline. The latter is now on the ascendant across the west, because the former is missing in action.That’s where the left comes in. As well as a need for thetimid Greensto find their voice, the Labour left should stop being the punch bags of the soulless hacks using Starmer as their hapless puppet.Seven of those MPswere suspended for voting against keeping Tory benefit cuts that drive children into poverty. Some may never be let back in; others only if they pledge slavish obedience – and then what’s the point of being there anyway? Call the bluff of your assailants: leave, and form an alliancewith the Green and leftwing independent MPs. There are other leftwing Labour MPs who haven’t been booted out – such as Clive Lewis – who would be a good fit. Such an alliance, with the right strategy, could suddenly put formidable pressure on Labour from the left, and force a conversation about redistributing wealth and power that would force Labour, Tory and Reform UK alike on to the defensive.Alas, these MPs have an ingrained loyalty to Labour, one that is not reciprocatedby the leadership. But if they don’t make a difficult but courageous jump, what beckons? They will be condemned to irrelevance. If and when Starmer eventually goes, the vultures circling him – that is, his aides – will replace him with someone who does the same thing, but with more gusto. Farage will dictate the terms of our national conversation, until he plausibly secures power. This is not inevitable: the appetite for an alternative exists, but lacks direction and leadership. If it remains untapped, whoever is driving this train, it will plunge into the abyss, taking all its passengers with it.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

The phrase didn’t just claim that the economic benefit of big-money infrastructure projects would somehow trickle down to workers struggling to pay the rent. It implied that anyone who didn’t do their duty for the labour market – say, people too disabled or ill to work, family carers and jobseekers – should expect very little from Labour.Such sentiments could be dismissed as empty rhetoric, of course, but by all accounts are actually a preview. In the autumn budget,Reeves committed to keepingthe £3bn of disability benefit “savings” the outgoing Conservative government planned. It is now expected that a package of spending cuts will be finalised in the next fortnight, in whatthe Times describesas a “radical overhaul of welfare” that could see hundreds of thousands of disabled and chronically ill people lose their benefits.Under one option reportedly being considered, the universal credit “limited capability for work or work-related activity” category would be abolished, which would require often severely disabled or ill people to make preparations for work. That could see claimants lose about £5,000 a year.At the same time, personal independence payments (Pip) – which pays for some of the extra costs of disability and is unrelated to whether someone is in work – is said to be being lined up for an “overhaul”, with those with conditions such as depression and anxiety,the fastest-growing reasonsfor disability benefits, likely to be targeted. Options being looked at include one-off rather than monthly payments for some, or means testing. Vouchers for specific equipment or aids instead of cash – asplanned by Rishi Sunak last year– have reportedly been ruled out. No change for either benefit has been confirmed.If any of this feels familiar, it’s because it is – and not just that it was only a decade ago that the coalition governmentwas “reforming” the system. Since the election last July, Labour ministers have been dripfeeding rumoured benefit crackdownsto the rightwing press, from specific plans to remove fraudsters’ driving licences tovague pledgesto get hordes of people off out-of-work sickness benefits.A reader with a terminal illness emailed in despair. What she told me should shock us all | Frances RyanRead moreThe point of these constant briefings may seem baffling, but there are two likely explanations: testing the waters before announcing firm policy; and/or communicating a message. For the latter, just look at the seemingly innocuous lines inthe Times story: ministers have told business leaders that changes to Pip eligibility “will be the first priority” in spending cuts in March, as Reeves is “desperate” to reassure City bosses that “welfare savings” will cool the need for a tax-raising emergency budget.It is not simply that such things invite uncomfortable questions about the influence of the rich on governance, but that they signal very clearly who matters to Labour – and who doesn’t. That is not necessarily an accident. Back in January, Reevesweakened changes to non-dom statusafter hearing “concerns” from business leaders. In contrast, concerns from disabled people – as well as multiple thinktanks and charities – about the proposed disability benefit cuts over the past six months have, funnily enough, not had the same effect. Disabled voters are apparently expendable. Wealthy potential donors less so.Politics, at its core, is a matter of priorities: where public money will be spent, where it won’t, and how it will be raised. That aLabourgovernment is seemingly willing to sacrifice poor and disabled people’s benefits in order to protect the wealthy and healthy from paying a bit more tax is the kind of dystopian deal that feels at best perverse and, at worst, a betrayal.None of this is to say that Britain having anincreasingly sick populationis not a crisis that must be addressed. But it is to say that arbitrary cost-cutting is not the same as genuine reform, or that complex public policy should be dictated by the Treasury. I can’t help but wonder how many of those currently crowing to get disabled people “off benefits” will speak out againstfailings in the Access to Work schemethat are causing disabled people to lose their jobs. Wanting to get disabled people off the “welfare bill” is not the same as wanting to help them work.In some ways, austerity under Keir Starmer and Reeves looks different than the last time we were here: unlike under David Cameron and George Osborne, there is no ideological drive to shrink the state nor an explicit nasty impulse to punish “skivers” – more a couple of management execs looking to balance the books. And yet even this bean-counting is flawed.Recent research for anti-poverty charity Z2Kfound the economic value of disability benefits far outweighs the cost: while there is a £28bn annual bill for administering the benefits, they give a potential £42bn economic boost due to how they improve wellbeing.Besides, that Labour ministers’ motivations are (perhaps) distinct from the Tories is hardly much comfort to the disabled people reading yet another story musing how their only income could be taken away. If their disability benefits are cut when Labour wins an election, as well as when the Conservatives do, what exactly is the difference?Much of this goes far beyond whether the red team or the blue team is in office. It is about the systems that normalise impoverishing and isolating disabled people while protecting the assets and power of the privileged. It is about the attitudes towards disability and poverty that make those with the least seem the right group to lose the most, and the dehumanisation that says their suffering doesn’t really matter.As more potential benefit cuts are inevitably briefed in the coming days, it is worth remembering there are human beings behind every speculation. What to politicians and pundits is an abstract game is to others the fear of whether they will be able to eat regular meals or charge their electric wheelchair next year. That’s the thing about leaks.

But they have yet to get real about how to fund it, how to spend it, or how to staff it.Nearly three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine upended European security, an immediate and sustained surge in defence investment is needed to rearm Kyiv and protect the continent from Russian aggression and Chinese assertiveness. Somemilitary commandersandintelligence serviceshave said Europe may have as little as three to five years to prepare for a potential Russian attack on a Nato country. Others see a longer timeline of perhapseight yearsas a result of Moscow’s heavy casualties in Ukraine. But given the way that Vladimir Putin has hardened his revisionist ideology, built a war economy and forged strategic partnerships with China, Iran and North Korea, the risk of confrontation is clearly rising unless he can be pushed back in Ukraine.Europe is already facing Russian covert warfare in and around EU and Nato territory, with increasingly frequent acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, disinformation, election interference and assassination attempts. In recent weeks alone,RussianandChinese shipshave been detained on suspicion of repeatedly cutting undersea cables in the Baltic Sea.Yet while the imperative to build Europe’s military deterrence is widely acknowledged after three decades of neglect, most European countries face fiscal constraints because of low economic growth, high energy prices and self-imposed deficit rules. We need more money for defence now, yet our politicians dare not take it from pensions, healthcare, education or welfare.The EU leaders agreed on Monday to explore loosening their strict fiscal rules to allow for a significant increase in national defence spending, perhaps by exempting some or all military expenditure from debt and deficit calculations or using an emergency exception clause– a concession by fiscal hawks such as the Germans and Dutch. But that would not generate sufficient extra money fast enough.The obvious answer is to borrow now and repay out of future defence budgets. Germany created a€100bn (£83bn) special fundthrough national borrowing in 2022 to start a catch-up in its threadbare armed forces’ equipment. When that programme is exhausted in 2027, Berlin faces a €30bn to €40bn annual hole in its defence budget just to meet Nato’s existing goal of 2% of GDP, let alone a higher target of 3% or more, likely to be set at the alliance’s summit in June.The double challenge after the general election in February will be to persuade the new Berlin government to get over its frugal aversion to borrowing to invest, and to convince it that borrowing with European partners will deliver more bang for the euro, and perhaps more orders for German defence companies, than borrowing nationally. The former looks easier than the latter.Historically, wars have almost always been fought on credit. The UKpaid offits final first world war loan in 2015, almost a century after the conflict ended, by issuing new bonds. It would be socially unacceptable and politically suicidal in most west European countries to finance a surge in defence spending in peacetime by slashing social expenditure. Only countries on the frontline with Russia have raised their outlays much beyond the Nato goal, with Poland reaching4.1% of GDPlast year thanks partly to its healthy economic growth.TheNatosecretary general, Mark Rutte, argues that if European countries merely spend more on defence, without reforming antiquated national procurement systems, even 4% won’t be enough. A “big bang” in European military capabilities and personnel is possible in the next decade, but only if Europeans spend their increased defence investment in a much smarter, more collaborative way.The best way would be for a coalition of willing European countries to establish a fund of up to €500bn (£416bn) through collective borrowing, to finance jointly procured equipment consistent with Nato’s force requirements such as a European air and missile defence shield, a European cyber-shield, strategic airlift and air-to-air refuelling tankers. Such anintergovernmental fund, which might be managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) or another existing institution, would avoid vetoes by neutral, non-aligned or pro-Russian EU countries, while allowing the UK, Norway and EU candidate countries including Turkey to join, if they so wish.The money would be available well before the next EU long-term budget takes effect in 2028, and would enable European countries to front-load their defence spending and order urgently needed air defence missiles and other kit on credit. At the same time, unspent money in the current EU budget for regional development and Covid-19 recovery should be repurposed to adapt ports, bridges, roads and railheads for military mobility to help reinforce the eastern flank.Moreover, EU finance ministers should instruct the EIB to change its lending guidelines to permit investment in arms and ammunition production, not just so-called dual-use technologies. That would signal to institutional and private investors that defence is a European public good, consistent with those environmental, social and governance principles that prompted some to divest from the sector.EU governments are torn over whether to allow future EU defence funds to be spent on third-country suppliers, as Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands want, or to limit them to EU-based and owned defence companies, as France insists. Given the limited production capacity in Europe’s fragmented defence sector after 30 years of shrinkage, countries are bound to go farther afield if they want to rearm swiftly. Poland, for example, has turned to the United States and South Korea for most of its new kit. The UK and Turkey have strong aerospace and defence industries that could contribute to a European defence surge if they are not shut out.Another hurdle to boosting European defence is a shortage of skilled personnel for the armed forces, defence companies and cybersecurity. Many armies have shrunk to their lowest levels since the 19th century. While Nordic and Baltic countries are moving back towards conscription, which Finland never abandoned, other European states should build up their reserves with regular training and exercising. They should also register young people of both sexes at age 18 to identify candidates and skills for selective military and civil defence tasks. Women are the most underutilised resource for European defence.The purpose of the exercise would be to persuadeRussiathat it would face an overwhelming response to any attack on a European country, whether or not the US came to Europe’s defence. Investing in deterrence is therefore an investment in peace, to avoid war.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionRussiaUkraineNatoEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

This time next year, Britain will still be negotiating Brexit. And for every foreseeable year after that.That isn’t a comment on the scope of the “reset” in relations that Starmer outlined ata Brussels summitthis week. It is a statement of fact that Britain is tethered to the EU by forces of geography, economics and geopolitics, and those factors didn’t cease to exist when membership of the club was terminated. And since the European project is always evolving in response to global events, Britain will also continually seek adjustment to the terms of the relationship.Starmer’s reset is just the first of many. His ambitions also happen to be relatively modest. He has chosen to operate in a claustrophobic niche, trying to expand cooperation in Brussels without rubbing against Eurosceptic sensitivities back home.The prime minister’s opening bid isa new security partnership, which is something the EU wants from Britain and that isn’t covered by the trade and cooperation agreement thatJohnson signed in 2020.Closer cooperation on defence is intended as the first easy step in a new relationship, building trust and serving a mutual interest, without getting into a messy relitigation of the economic divorce settlement. Most EU governments agree with this approach. They see plenty of reasons in a scary, volatile world to receive Starmer’s overture with open arms.Russia is waging a war of territorial aggression on the continent’s eastern flank. The Kremlin runs campaigns of systematic sabotage and malign influence to destabilise European democracies. Donald Trump is blowing up the foundations of the transatlantic alliance. It isn’t yet clear what if any function the US president sees for Nato, but his talk of Denmark ceding Greenland and Canada becoming the 51st state of the US demonstrates that the new White House regime has no concept of relationships based on reciprocal interest or alignment by values. Where once there were treaties, now there is a mafia-style protection racket. Pay tribute to the boss in the Oval Office, or take a punishment beating in tariffs.Britain’s military and intelligence capabilities are no substitute for the US guarantees that have underwritten European security since the middle of the 20th century. But they are hefty by EU standards and respected in the Pentagon (or at least not dismissed as irrelevant). That gives the authors ofLabourpolicy a glimmer of hope that London could revive its old function as the mediating voice between Washington and Brussels.A new, optimistic post-Brexit concept of UK-EU relations comes into view: closer partnership in areas of collective strategic interest – defence, energy security, migration, climate – starts a virtuous cycle of confidence, leading to reduced friction in trade and a growth dividend from more fluid cross-border commerce. Except that second bit has to be achieved without smudging sacred red lines that prohibit return to the single market or customs union. And that imposes a familiar cap on any gains from closer economic integration.The basic equation hasn’t changed. Access to European markets is priced in alignment with European rules, and it isn’t a pick-and-mix counter.There is some flex at the margins. Everyone seems to agree that a veterinary agreement to lubricate agricultural exports is available, for example. And there are precedents for selective participation in the single market. Switzerland has a bespoke deal, but it involves contributions to the EU budget and freedom of movement – unspeakable concessions in the present climate of British politics.Such is the aversion to anything that smells like liberal migration policy that ministers publicly flinch at the mention of even a time-limited, quota-controlledyouth mobility scheme. (Privately some say a deal can easily be done on that score. Others say the home secretary is implacably opposed and No 10 is either unwilling or unable to adjudicate.) Youth mobility, something the German government is particularly keen on, has become one of the EU’s opening demands in the reset talks. Another one, pushed to the top of the agenda by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is access to British fisheries.And so the neat sequence that envisaged a fairly uncontroversial defence pact unlocking the door to a grander bargain is morphing into another tangled, multitrack Brexit-infused negotiation. Starmer wants to talk about a new chapter in cross-Channel partnership, but it turns out that first he has to wrangle over cod.That isn’t just frustrating for the prime minister. There are voices in the European commission and national governments urging a less fussily bureaucratic, more creative conversation about a future role for Britain in the wider European project. The UK has a friend in Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister who holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union.But Starmer hasn’t given his continental allies much to work with. The wave of relief at no longer having to deal with Conservatives, and enthusiasm at the prospect of a more amenable Labour government, has subsided. There is enduring gratitude that Starmer’s Downing Street is not in thrall to a cult of anti-Brussels paranoia, but the prime minister’s inscrutability is a different kind of barrier. In Whitehall he is known to be suspicious of abstract ideas and loftiness, which he sees as distractions from the practical business of problem-solving. That trait, which friends see as admirable aversion to bullshit and demagoguery, leaves audiences – domestic and foreign – unsure of how a list of individual policies combines to form a bigger picture.It is possible to manage EU relations without such a thing. The existing Brexit deal already contains a timetable of deadlines for implementation, reviews and renewals. The negotiation train will keep trundling down the line regardless of whether the prime minister has a fixed destination in mind. Some officials and politicians, in Whitehall and Brussels, think more can be achieved without one; that grand visions and soaring rhetoric only drive up the political temperature, interfering with a process that works best when boring and technical, when no one is paying attention.That is true up to a point – a point reached around the time when Trump returned to the White House. There is now a national interest and a moral imperative in Britain strengthening alliances that are governed by law and treaty, not coercion and extortion. Urgent mutual interest drives the EU and Britain towards common ground across a range of issues. And yet the undertow of institutional inertia and political timidity pulls the other way. Pro-Europeans are left hoping for an infusion of political will and imagination, waiting for a feat of leadership, afraid that time is running out.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeLabourKeir StarmerBrexitForeign policyFishing industrycommentShareReuse this content"

But that might be harder under Trump 2.0.As a centre-left leader, Albanese – and indeed his ambassador in Washington, Kevin Rudd – lack natural and easy access to the informal networks surrounding Trump.Australia has always adopted a friends-to-all-enemies-to-none approach in Washington, working both sides of the aisle.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead moreBut with Trump, even more so the second time around, the Albanese government is having to push its case up some very steep hills.In his first term, Trump hired many conventional staffers who acted as a brake on his most anarchic impulses.This time, Trump has surrounded himself withMaga uber-loyalists. Trump’s worst instincts are now implemented with speed and conviction.To be sure, it is early in the administration, and Trump will almost always negotiate. But if Trump wants tariffs, his Maga team will ensure he gets tariffs.The secondary effects of protectionism are harder to measure but nonetheless real, from slower overall global growth.Any damage to China’s economy, which takes about one-third of Australia’s exports, will almost certainly flow through to Australia, though not in a straight line.Australia’s exports to China are dominated by iron ore which goes into making steel, the production of which is already declining in China, with or without Trump.On the flip side, Australia could benefit from Trump’s targeting of China, which is sure to remain in the crosshairs throughout his second term.1:56Trump announces US plan to 'own' and develop the Gaza strip – videoAny retaliation against US tariffs by China against American agricultural goods, for example, could allow Australian farmers to make up the shortfall.But the real blowback for middle-powers like Australia may not be in the ups and downs of a quixotic and damaging trade war.Rather, it will be the unravelling of the global trading system which has underpinned our postwar wealth, and, potentially, the severe undermining of trust in our main ally, the US.The ties that bind Australia to the US run deep – through the economy, military and intelligence interdependence and scientific and technological exchanges.China can’t substitute for that, and the trust that has been built up alongside of it.Trump, however, can damage it, by unravelling the institutions of the US state which underpins such exchanges.The damage will not be nearly as visible as the headlines about tariffs, but they will be far longer lasting.Richard McGregor is an analyst at the Lowy InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionAustralian economyInternational tradeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Again. Young people have been getting jobs and simply attending them during their contracted hours and, frankly, the oldies have had enough.“Meeting targets” is out. “Great customer service” is nothing. Even “saving lives” can’t make up for rudely clocking off when the day ends. The only way to be great at your job is to exist there for as many minutes as humanly possible.The most recent complaint is from a hospital administrator, allegedly responding to a junior doctor’s rostering issue, who’s claimed the future will be a “workforce of clinical marshmellows” [sic]. I’m keen to know what makes a marshmallow “clinical”, or why this person doesn’t recognise marshmallows as one of confectionary’s hardest and most delicious workers. But more importantly: it’s just. so. boring. This claim is as tired as the people making it (because they never go home).Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsI don’t mean that it’s wrong. It’s not. In my experience, each generation is less inclined than the last to put work first. GREAT. They probably don’t have their entire identity tied up in what they do. Maybe they don’t have panic attacks about being productive. I’ve heard rumours some of them don’t even have email on their phones.The problem is what older generationsmean.One hundred years ago, when these people were themselves young and making their way in the world, work-life balance was different. If Facebook nostalgia is to be believed, they started out their working lives serving milkshakes and having mum cook them dinner every night, only to graduate to carrying a briefcase and having their wife cook dinner every night. “Work” meant dictating a single letter to a secretary, and “life” meant watching Australia’s Funniest Home Videos.Even for me, a millennial – I am 42 years old – the “life” part of work-life balance began with smoking bongs in the park and setting pass-agg statuses on MSN Messenger. When I got home from work in 2000, I ate Shapes and played The Sims for six hours.But this is late-stage capitalism. Young people’s bones have been ground to make Boomers’ bread and “work-life balance” is a grossly inadequate term to describe what they’re actually doing. They’re not clocking out –on time, not even early – to go to a warehouse party. No one pays them enough to keep up with cocaine prices anyway.The “life” part of “work-life balance” is unrecognisable. “Life” for someone in their 20s is actually just several other kinds of work peppered with watching MAFS on the toilet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Then they return to their eight-person share house where “life” looks something like this: worry about their friends; panic about climate inaction; doomscroll; attend a ceasefire rally; wonder which country will nuke first;learn about tariffs; watch a TikTok about ADHD symptoms; decide whether to buy food or electricity; help a friend in crisis; breathe in black mould; get on a psychologist’s waitlist; monetise a hobby; feel guilty about not doing enough to fix everything.Without intending it, that hospital administrator is right on the money. A future of “clinical marshmellows” [sic again] is a very realistic outcome of unprecedented existential threat. On the other hand, if the email does somehow motivate staff to work more, they couldactually become stupider. It’s a both-ways bet. Classic Gen X.Of course, we know this isn’t new. Generations have been fighting about who has it worse since before we invented generations. There’s something comforting about it. Younger generations aren’t lazy, they’re just newer.Today I read a 1920s agony aunt column complaining of “lazy young people”. I read a 1954 letter to the editor, in which Julia calls herself “one of those lazy young people you read so much about today.” And in another 40 years, if we still have above-water land masses, someone named Jayden will be shaking his sleeve tattoo at Gen Delta.Until the economy improves enough to let anyone retire, we will be locked in a timeless stalemate – old people banging away on their smartphones, and young people being told how easy they have it.Explore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionWork-life balanceWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

Then my friend had the same conversation with meBianca DennyI got out of an abusive relationship thanks in part to my friend initiating that difficult discussion. Be that person to someoneTue 4 Feb 2025 19.53 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 01.24 ESTShareI’m accustomed to speaking about taboo topics and leading difficult conversations. In my clinical practice as a psychologist, these discussions are increasingly about gender-based violence. Sadly, I’m no longer shocked at the extent or type of abuse perpetrated against women, families and intimate partners. What surprises me, however, is the silence that often surrounds these behaviours.Too often I find myself saying, “that sounds abusive”, “what you’re describing is coercive control” or “violence isn’t just physical”. Tellingly, people are often quick to downplay a perpetrator’s behaviour. This may be through justification (“they’d had a hard day at work”), minimisation (“it’s just words, they would never hit me”), or self-blame (“I said something that set them off”).Gender-based violence is insidious.Too often within families and relationships this behaviour becomes ingrained and normalised, making it all the more difficult to recognise and discuss. I should know. A friend once had the same conversation with me that I have with many patients. Hearing her observations of abusive behaviour in my own relationship was the hardest discussion in our long friendship. In retrospect, her honesty and advocacy was vital to helping me realise the reality of behaviours that I had justified, minimised or blamed myself for.It is not somebody else’s problem. And it is never the fault of the person being subjected to itBut I never blame patients for lack of insight about the behaviour inflicted upon them.It is all too easy to judge others’ lives and decisions from a safe distance. Often, people experiencing gender-based violence cannot see the forest for the trees. Enduring an abusive relationship is akin to being caught in a rip; it is impossible for the distressed swimmer to navigate towards the safe waters so easily spotted from the shoreline.Like the occupants of a house remaining fast asleep during a fire; flames are licking at the door but its inhabitants are oblivious to the heat and smoke. Closeness breeds subjectivity, distance brings much-needed objectivity.Abuse loves secrecy. It thrives on shame, and is perpetuated by silence. Abuse wants us all to look away. To turn a blind eye to a bruise, ignore a broken bone, discount a shattered psyche. Isolating victims from friends and family is a common strategy for perpetrators; destroying a person’s social connections is a tragically effective way to implement yet another barrier to leaving a relationship.That’s why it is so integral to have these conversations about gender-based violence and what it comprises. And we must keep having these conversations, at a societal level but also with individuals. Personally and professionally, I understand the frustration when a person signals their intent to leave a relationship or change a behaviour, and then does not do so. This can be demoralising for those who initiated those difficult conversations or offered other support. But leaving any relationship (even those that are not violent or abusive) is often easier said than done.‘I can’t keep the unthinkable at bay – did he abuse me?’: an exclusive extract from the memoir of Dominique Pelicot’s daughterRead moreKeep the conversation going. Repeat statements until the truth is acknowledged. “Your partner tracks your location on your phone, and you’re ‘not allowed’ to stay out past 9pm?” “All your wage goes into their bank account, and then you’re given a small allowance?” Ask them what they would tell you to do, if the tables were turned. At some point, the message will stick.Recognition of the behaviour is the first step; a conversation can help a victim of gender-based violence reach this. Next, contemplation, planning and, eventually, action. Most of us who have tried to kick a habit – say, smoking or drinking, or even cutting down on screen time – know that it takes a few cycles to fully cease a behaviour. These attempts are not failures, but instead opportunities to strengthen resolve, develop coping strategies, and build capacity.I got out of an abusive relationship. That is in no small part thanks to my friend initiating that difficult discussion. Be that person to someone. Have that conversation. Say those things that otherwise will go unspoken. We must not diffuse the responsibility of talking about gender-based violence. It is not somebody else’s problem. And it is never the fault of the person being subjected to it.Clearly, more is needed to resolve the national crisis of gender-based violence. But in the absence of a social revolution or a reversal of the collective behaviour of perpetrators, a conversation is a practical and accessible starting point. This remains incumbent of us all – if you see something, say something.Dr Bianca Denny is a clinical psychologist based in Melbourne.

But the current White House regime despises the old way of doing things and intends to reshape the world so drastically that restoration of a pre-Trumpian order will be impossible.The absurd incoherence ofMr Trump’s proposalthat the US “take over” Gaza doesn’t make it any less sinister. The requirement that 2.2 million Palestinians be forcibly resettled in neighbouring Arab states amounts to unambiguous endorsement of a criminal atrocity – ethnic cleansing.The idea that the land, having been requisitioned by the US government, will then be transformed into a Mediterranean “riviera” is disturbing and grotesque in its detachment from reality. Mr Trump is treating a war zone at the centre of one of the world’s most intractable conflicts as if it were a patch of derelict Manhattan real estate. He is toying with the lives of millions of people in the idiom of a corrupt property developer and with the methods and ethics of a mafia boss.The inevitable consequence of handling complex international issues with cruel and bovine simplicity is to spread fear, uncertainty and instability. It adds gratuitous volatility at precisely the moment when the opposite approach is imperative to preserve thefragile ceasefirein Gaza.Every government in the Middle East, except Benjamin Netanyahu’s ultra-nationalist coalition in Israel, rejects Mr Trump’s intervention as dangerous and counterproductive. That is also the view among the US’s European allies – or the countries that two weeks ago considered themselves free-thinking allies of the US but now see that nosuch concept existsin the president’s mind.He recognises only clients, rivals and enemies. It is possible to move between those categories by deploying flattery and offering favours. But durable alignment based on mutual interest, legally binding treaty obligations and democratic values is a model that no longer has currency in the White House.That is a tremendous boost to the geopolitical ambitions ofRussia and China. It vindicates a vicious might-is-right approach to international relations. It legitimates the kind of imperialistic land grab that Vladimir Putin is pursuing in Ukraine. For Beijing, an age of American unreliability offers lucrative avenues of economic and strategic expansion. China sees a vacancy for itself as the world’s most predictable superpower.There is a common rationalisation that explains his recklessness as opening moves in a negotiation. His most outlandish ideas, like American appropriation of Gaza, are thus sanitised as the freewheeling improvisations of a “transactional” businessman. He is cast as a master of brinkmanship who uses shock and chaos to wrongfoot opponents beforesettling, in the end, for more sober outcomes.That analysis looks increasingly naive, even if it tallies with the president’s self-image. He might think he is just doing “deals”, but others should be clear that the correct terms are coercion and extortion.There are plenty of examples from history of capricious potentates spreading disorder in their own territories and abroad. There is no precedent for that happening to the world’s most powerful democracy, and no playbook to guide that country’s former allies in handling the situation. But one thing is now clear – hoping Mr Trump’s America might be cajoled into following the old rules is not a safe strategy.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I went to a wedding and could hear bombs and alarms going off’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 5 Feb 2025 10.22 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 10.24 ESTShareIgrew up in Ahvaz, a city inIranthat’s close to the border with Iraq, during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88. I have a memory of going to a wedding party as a child and hearing bombs and alarms – I didn’t fully understand what was happening, or why the bride looked nervous, but there was a paradoxical feeling of still wanting to spend our time in the happiness of that moment.This photograph reconstructs that memory. It was shot at a location used for making movies about the war: a huge place in the desert where they have all the necessary props. Getting permission wasn’t easy but I wanted to tell my story there, sketching normal life events – weddings, birthdays, Iranian new year – into a war zone. The series, from 2008, is titled Today’s Life and War, and it reflects my interest in the relationship between war and everyday life. I often explore themes of displacement, survival and human resilience in my work. Creating this series helped me process the emotions and memories of growing up in wartime. Many people who lived through it told me they connected to these images because they show struggle and survival.While my generation grew up with nonstop images of the war in magazines, newspapers and television, at the same time life continued. The couple appear numb, expressionless – as if they cannot imagine what their future will look like.When you go to the bazaar and ask for tea, they might answer by reciting a poem. Poetry is everywhere in IranTraditional Iranian art makes use of the imagination. Iranian artists believe God already made what exists, so we don’t need to make it again. My photography is a response to that tradition. I want to make something, not take something. But my compositions and references draw on archive documentary photography of the conflict – the images I grew up with – which I return to for inspiration.I mix my story with real life and the poetry that is everywhere in my country. When you go to the bazaar and ask for tea, they don’t say whether they have it or they don’t, but they might instead answer by reciting a Persian poem by Saadi or Hafez. We all have this connection with the poetic and I wanted to bring it into my photography.My most recent work is about the cypress tree: collage works with Polaroids, manipulated with silver and gold leaf, connecting the tree’s symbolism in Iran with the stories of the poetFerdowsi’s 10th-century epic, Shahnameh. The cypress tree is strong; it stands even when it is dead and symbolises freedom and eternity. It encourages us to remain grounded, by drawing upon our heritage as a source of resilience.When I was a student, the artist and film-makerMitra Tabriziangave a talk at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran. She inspired me to tell my story through photography, and to address social issues in my work. When I had a solo exhibition in the Photographers’ Gallery in London two years ago, she came to see it.I chose photography because images can tell powerful stories without words. I hope my photographs make people think, feel and remember important moments in history. The best feedback is when people enjoy my photographs enough to write to me. In my work, I try to show how people continue to live, love and hope even in difficult times.Gohar Dashti’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Ahvaz, Iran, 1980.Trained:Photography at the University of Art, Tehran.Influences:“The nature and landscapes of Iran and the US have deeply inspired my work.

McBurney is as still and reflective as a lake, though you sense the currents of contemplation moving behind his eyes. Next to him, Pite can barely stay on her chair and her arms keep rising up in urgency and encouragement. Both are facing the other side of the studio, where the company’s outstanding dancers are crafting a new piece, working through details of timing and spacing as they test the viability of different moves. At the centre of it all stands a deathbed.It’s a shock at first, but it makes sense. Pite and McBurney are working on the last part of a trilogy called Figures in Extinction. The idea of extinction has evolved over the course of these three pieces: the first focused on non-human life forms; the second on neurological connections between our inner and outer worlds; and the third – well, that’s what they’re finding out right now.View image in fullscreenNeurological connections … Figures in Extinction [2.0] in 2024.Photograph: Rahi RezvaniThey had been introduced to each other because their companies, NDT and Complicité, thought their multimodal, highly physical approaches to performance would provide much common ground. They were right: Pite and McBurney were transfixed when they saw each other’s work. But it was the ecological theme with which they found common cause. “Straight away we decided we wanted to make something centred on the climate crisis,” says Pite. “Which is not,” stresses McBurney, “separable from human crisis. We are all inescapably part of this living world.”It was planned as a full evening of work, in three parts. “The idea was to have me in the driver’s seat for part one, Simon for part two, then work jointly for part three,” explains Pite. In the event, their roles quickly merged so that the sequence was less about who was driving and more about the accelerating dynamic between them. “It’s like bouncing a ball back and forth,” she continues. “At the start, there was time between each throw, but now the ball is going like this” – and her hand vibrates like a hummingbird wing.Each piece has taken them into a different tone and terrain, though Pite-watchers will recognise a signature technique that she developed in collaboration with another theatre director, Jonathon Young – a kind of physical lip-syncing that brings movement into lockstep with words, then stress-tests that bond.The first of the trilogy (staged in 2022)is perhaps the most thematically recognisable, being based on our current, well-documented sixth age of mass extinction. Pite took her choreographic cues from forms of life that no longer exist (not just animals, but glaciers and rivers), while McBurney came up with a framework to hold the scenes. “I had the idea of a simple list of extinctions,” he recalls. “I imagined Crystal would take it into a more organic direction, but the more we looked at the list, the more right it seemed. Because that’s what we do, as humans: we label and list, like in a museum.”‘We label and list’ … Pite and McBurney in rehearsals.Photograph: Dauphine StofbergThat instrumentalised, classificatory mindset was a spur for the second work (staged in 2024), which turns its gaze on to the human species in the modern age; specifically, on to our brains. McBurney had been much taken by the work ofneuroscientist Iain McGilchrist, which meshes the operations of our cerebral hemispheres with expansive questions of culture, philosophy and ecology. He showed a short video animation about McGilchrist’s ideas to Pite. “It was sharp and funny,” she says, “and very choreographic. I could see it translating on to the stage in an excitingly cartoonish kind of way.”How about thefinal part? McBurney breathes slowly, and one of his contemplative currents comes to the surface: “There’s an aspect of our society which treats death as a kind of failure. So, in part, we’re dealing with our separation from death – which is to say, a separation from mystery, from things beyond our knowledge. What happens to us if we eliminate mystery from our lives? What happens if we say the dead don’t matter? Or rather, they don’t exist?”“The unknowable is not nothing,” agrees Pite. “That has been a really inspiring thought for me. To live and to work with those great unanswerable questions. To feel expanded, not diminished by them – and to try to create the conditions for that expansion in the theatre.”Back to that deathbed, then. It’s central to the scene, but not because it represents the extinction of a life, as I had first thought. Rather, it shows death as an ungraspable mystery that is integral to and essential for life. The disavowal of death within our lives is, for McBurney, one of the problems of our age. “I’m tempted to call it the extinction of the dead,” he says. “And the amazing thing about working with Crystal is that I can feel all these ideas surging up unspoken through the body. Because, in the end, we are trying to communicate through a work of art, and it’s the work which is speaking, not the ideas.”The Figures in Extinction trilogy is atAviva Studios, Manchester, 19–22 February.

The supporting lineup is a Who’s Who of metal greats, including Metallica, Slayer, Pantera and many more, and the concert’s musical director, Tom Morello ofRage Against the Machine, promises: “This will be the greatest heavy metal show ever.”It is fantasy-fulfilling news for rock fans, who didn’t dare to suspect that the original quartet of Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward would ever play together again, not only because of their combined age of 303, but because of fractious relations between them.Black Sabbath, who have sold a reported 75m albums worldwide, remain arguably the most influential heavy rock band in history. Playing potent melody and psychedelic moods with crushing force, inspired in part by the industrial sounds of their nativeBirmingham, they shaped the entire style of heavy metal. Their first eight albums featured Osbourne, and included the UK No 1 Paranoid as well as classics such as Master of Reality and their 1970 self-titled debut.Osbourne left for a solo career in 1979, and various other vocalists stepped in thereafter, including Rainbow’s Ronnie James Dio, Deep Purple’s Ian Gillan, and Tony Martin, before Osbourne was brought back into the fold in 1997.The last time the original lineup performed was on the2005 Ozzfest tour, after which Ward left the group. He was later announced as part of the lineup for a 2012 tour and studio album, but again left before contributing to the recording, citing a contract disagreement.Osbourne publicly upbraided himand said Ward wasn’t up to playing thanks to shoulder surgery, writing on Facebook: “Deep down inside you knew you weren’t capable of doing the album and a 16-month tour … So how is all of this my fault? Stop playing the victim and be honest with yourself and our fans.”Their final album 13 was released in 2013 and had Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk filling in for Ward.Black Sabbath later announced an emphatic end to their career, playing a final tour entitled The End, which concluded in Birmingham in February 2017. This time, Tommy Clufetos played drums. But Osbourne said there was friction between himself and the other original members: “I spent nine or 10 years in Sabbath, but I’d been away from them for over 30 years. With them, I’m just a singer. With me, I get to do what I want to do. I was getting bad vibes from them for being Ozzy. I don’t know, what the fuck else can I be?”He also said he missed Ward being part of the band. “I didn’t like the fact that Bill Ward wasn’t there … Tommy did great, but the four of us started this, and it should have been the four of us ending it. Those final gigs in Birmingham were bittersweet because you think of how far we came, and how much we did, and it would have been good to have shared that together. Maybe one day there’ll be one last gig, I don’t know.”View image in fullscreenTony Iommi and Sharon Osbourne at the announcement of Black Sabbath’s final show at Villa Park.Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Live Nation UKThat has now come to pass, with Osbourne saying in a new statement: “It’s my time to go back to the beginning … time for me to give back to the place where I was born. How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham for ever.”The concert will feature a short solo set from Osbourne before he joins with Black Sabbath. Other supporting bands are Gojira, Halestorm, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Anthrax and Mastodon, while there will be special appearances fromSmashing Pumpkinsfrontman Billy Corgan, Disturbed frontman David Draiman, Duff McKagan and Slash of Guns ‘N Roses, Frank Bello and Scott Ian of Anthrax, Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst, Korn’s Jonathan Davis and numerous others.Profits from the concert will be shared between three charities: Cure Parkinson’s, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and the Birmingham-based Acorns Children’s Hospice.It had looked as if Osbourne’s performing career had already petered out in rather less emphatic fashion. He first announced his retirement from gigging back in 1992 with the No More Tours tour, before reversing his decision, and later re-announcing it with No More Tours 2 in 2019. He postponed the European dates due to illness, then in 2020 announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s.In 2022 he had extensive spinal surgery after a 2019 fall, which had exacerbated an earlier quad-biking injury. A hoped-for 2023 tour was cancelled as he continued to recuperate, with Osbourne saying: “Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way.” A one-off gig that year was announced, then also cancelled.His final gig will be at the home ofAston Villa, the football team based in the Aston area of Birmingham where Osbourne grew up before forming Black Sabbath in 1968. Osbourne recently appeared in a video promoting the team’s 2024-25 season kit, and created an official T-shirt line with the club.The city has long revered the group – even Birmingham Royal Ballet have paid tribute, creatingBlack Sabbath: the Balletin 2023, commissioned by Carlos Acosta.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathMetalMetallicaSlayerRage Against the MachineGojiranewsShareReuse this content"

Then came a social media scandal and a serious backlashSteve RoseWed 5 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2025 05.58 ESTShareYou can generally tell when awards season is going well for a movie because its stars are everywhere, attending galas, treading red carpets, doing as many interviews as they can, and repeating the same bland sentiments about how special this movie is and everyone was a dream to work with. Conversely, you can tell things aren’t so rosy when your lead star is cancelling all their US appearances, being discreetly airbrushed out of the campaign and issuing statements such as: “I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain.”This is where Emilia Pérez and its lead, Karla Sofía Gascón, find themselves. Less than two weeks ago the movie was riding high, with a remarkable13 Oscar nominations, including best actress for Gascón – the most for any movie this year and one short of the all-time record. Now, though, it is looking as if the wheels have come off for Emilia Pérez’s awards campaign, or at least for Gascón herself. Many are wondering how this could have happened so quickly; was it a spectacular act of self-sabotage, or are there darker arts at work?At least part of this debacle has been self-inflicted. When Gascón won joint best actress at Cannes last May, the first transgender performer to have done so, she tearfully dedicated the award to all trans people “who suffer” and anticipated the online hate that was sure to follow: “Tomorrow, there will be plenty of comments from terrible people saying the same things about all of us trans people,” she said. “But I want to end with a message of hope … We all have the opportunity to change for the better, to become better people.”But it turns out Gascón herself has been dishing out the online hate too. Arecent excavationof the Spanish actor’s X/Twitter posts since 2016 unearthed many deeply problematic and offensive comments: about Muslims (“Islam is becoming a hotbed of infection for humanity”); about the victim of police brutality, George Floyd (“a drug addict swindler”); China (“The Chinese vaccine, apart from the mandatory chip, comes with two spring rolls …”); and even about the Oscars themselves. Commenting on the 2021 awards, where nominees included Nomadland, Minari, Judas and the Black Messiah and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Gascón wrote: “More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films. I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M [international women’s strike].” So much for becoming better people.View image in fullscreen‘Every time she had a scene we said: “Wow, what is this?”’ ... Selena Gomez in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Page 114/Why not Productions/Pathé Films/France 2 CinémaIronically, this year’s Academy Awards are shaping up to be another ceremony for what some might call “independent and protest films”. This is the firstOscarsof the second Donald Trump regime, with liberal Hollywood having failed to tip the balance in Kamala Harris’s favour, and there are nominations for stories about the young Donald Trump (The Apprentice), institutional racism (Nickel Boys), Catholic corruption (Conclave), conflicted women (Anora, The Substance), and bleeding-heart socialist hippy folk singers (A Complete Unknown).And leading the charge is Emilia Pérez; a Netflix musical about a Mexican gangster (Gascón) who begins a new life by faking their death, transitioning and starting a charity dedicated to finding the remains of victims of Mexico’s cartel-related violence. Given the Trump administration’s vicious assault on transgender rights, this movie ought to be a rallying point for the culture war resistance. But when your star actor is championing one marginalised group while also demonising several others, it’s not a great look.In response to the social media revelations, Gascón may have dug herself even deeper. In a subsequent interview – reportedly conducted without the oversight of Netflix – and an Instagram post, she alluded to unidentified adversaries who “have achieved their objective, to stain my existence with lies or things taken out of context”. She also denied she was a racist, claiming: “I feel and very much identify with the people who were thrown off buses for the colour of their skin.”The traditional sentiment at this stage should be, “And it was all going so well”, except it wasn’t really. From the outset, Emilia Pérez has been battered by such a barrage of criticism and mockery, it’s a mystery to many how it got nominated for anything at all. The movie has its fans, despite or perhaps because of its wildly implausible plot and agreeably bizarre moments, such as a musical number set in a cosmetic surgery clinic (the lyric “Man to woman / From penis to vagina”has gone viralall on its own). But it has anaudience score of just 18%on Rotten Tomatoes and a Letterboxd score of 2.2 out of five – the lowest scores for any best picture contender in history.Jacques Audiard, Emilia Pérez’s writer and director, is no stranger to awards. Three of his previous films (Dheepan, A Prophet and A Self-Made Hero) also won major prizes at Cannes and went on to achieve great acclaim. Perhaps he just got bored of winning so easily. Emilia Pérez is certainly a departure for this straight, white, cis, French, 72-year-old director – a musical, in Spanish, set in Mexico, about trans identity. But in other ways it is not a departure at all, because Audiarddidn’t even go to Mexico: he made the movie in a studio just outside Paris, with a principally non-Mexican cast and crew, led by Spain-born Gascón, Zoe Saldaña (who is an American of Dominican Republic and Puerto Rican descent) and US born-and-raised Selena Gomez.View image in fullscreenWildly implausible plot ... Gascón and Adriana Paz in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/Netflix via APMexican audiences and critics have not known whether to laugh or cry at Emilia Pérez’s depiction of their country and culture. On the one hand, there is the cast’s accents. Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez said of watching Gomez: “Every time she had a scene, we looked at each other to say, ‘Wow, what is this?’” Gomez responded to him on TikTok: “I’m sorry, I did the best I could with the time I was given.” Again, not exactly an awards-season quote for the ages.Mexicans have also taken issue with the way Emilia Pérez stereotypes their country as a landscape of death, drug cartels and gangsters, then uses the real-life plight of hundreds of thousands of missing persons as a backdrop for a song and dance. One Mexican screenwriter Héctor Guillénsummed it up with a post on X that read: “This is a message to the Academy: Mexico hates Emilia Pérez” and described the film as a “racist Eurocentrist mockery”.Camila Aurora, a trans Mexican film-maker, even returned the favour with her ownparody film, Johanne Sacreblu, “a tribute to Emilia Pérez”, depicting stereotypically “French” people in striped shirts, berets and painted-on moustaches, dancing in the streets of “Paris” (but filmed in Mexico).Audiard, who does not speak Spanish, was pretty blithe about all this initially. “I didn’t study [Mexico] much,” he said. “What I needed to know I already knew a little bit.” But when confronted ata press conference in Mexico, he backtracked. “If it seems to you that I do it too lightly, I apologise,” he said.Despite Gascón’s heartfelt Cannes speech, many LGBTQ+ viewers have also found the film’s portrayal of trans people riddled with damaging stereotypes. The way Gascón’s character abandons her wife and children to transition, for example, or the way she sings about being “half him, half her … half kingpin, half queen”. Or how, during a scene when she turns violent and threatening, her voice reverts to the low, growly register of her “male” self, as if to suggest she’s “really still a man underneath”. Hence headlines from trans critics such as: “Emilia Pérez Isthe Most Unique Cis Nonsense You’ll Ever See”. LGBTQ+ rights group Glaad called it a “profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman”.View image in fullscreenParody ... Johanne Sacreblu.Photograph: Camila D Aurora (Camiileo)It doesn’t stop there. It has emerged that Gascón’s singing voice in Emilia Pérez wasAI-enhanced to increase her vocal range, which is likely a turn off for Academy voters. Another frontrunner in this year’s race, The Brutalist, has also had to defend itself over use of AI – to fine-tune the actors’ Hungarian accents.But what of Gascón’s allusions to people out to “stain her existence”? Is it coincidence that these years-old tweets are coming out now, the week before the final round of Academy voting begins? Apparently so, according toSarah Hagi, the freelance journalist who found them. Hagi denies she is a “studio plant”; after being alerted by Gascón’s use of the term “Islamist” in a post, she decided to dig deeper and was appalled by what she found. What’s more surprising is that all these comments were widely available online and nobody thought to check, including Netflix, which might not be in this situation had it thought to do some due diligence.That doesn’t mean dark artsaren’tbeing deployed. In another unguarded moment last week, Gascón railed against rival “social media teams … trying to diminish our work”. In particular, she pointed the finger at the Brazilian movie I’m Still Here, whose lead Fernanda Torres is also up for best actress this year (and recently won the Golden Globe). “There are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down,”Gascón statedin a Brazilian newspaper interview (though she later stressed she was not accusing Torres or her team directly). Torres’ only response has beenan Instagram postsaying how kind Gascón had been to her in person.Days later it was Torres issuing the apologies, after footage resurfaced of herperforming in blackface, in a comedy sketch on Brazilian television, 17 years ago. Unlike Gascón, Torres dealt with the issue swiftly and sincerely. “I am very sorry for this,” she said. “At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organisations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn’t yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil.” If it carries on at this rate, we’ll have to start a new Oscar category for best apology.View image in fullscreenAdriana Paz, Selena Gomez, Karla Sofía Gascón and Zoe Saldaña at the Golden Globe awards in January.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersDespite the grandstanding speeches and appeals to higher values, awards season can still be ruthlessly aggressive. “It is deeply, deeply competitive, and ‘dark arts’, let’s not be naive, are definitely looked at,” says one veteran. Another commented: “It’s so Harvey Weinstein, isn’t it?” As head of Miramax, the disgraced producer was notorious for aggressively promoting his own films and trashing their rivals. In 1998, for example, he reportedly began a whispering campaign that Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan “tailed off” after its epic opening battle scene. Ultimately, Miramax’s Shakespeare in Love won best picture at the Oscars.‘My most sincere apologies to all the people who may have been offended’: when Oscar campaigns implodeRead moreThese days, though, you don’t even need a Weinstein-like figure pulling the strings. Amateur fans, or enemies, will happily do the work themselves on social media. “There’s now a willing cadre of people ready to jump on these things,” one publicist said. “There could be someone in the background orchestrating things, but I don’t know if that’s entirely necessary for something like this to happen.”Perhaps this is not just an Emilia Pérez problem, then, but an awards season one. In recent years they have successfully cleaned up their acts. In 2021, the Golden Globes announced a “roadmap for change” in response to allegations of racism, corruption, favouritism andeven sexual assault. The Academy has also undergone a decade-long overhaul in response to the #OscarsSoWhite backlash in 2015, inviting new members from a broader pool in order to dispel its “old white guy” dominance. It is this more modern, diverse, global academy that has elevated films such as Emilia Pérez – but if the goal was to champion diversity and highlight trans identity, it now seems to have backfired, erasing the trans actor who was supposed to be the hero of the year, and handing a victory to the anti-trans, anti-“woke” lobby the film was supposed to be standing against.When artistic merit is increasingly overshadowed by mudslinging, dirt-digging, counter-recriminations and grudging apologies, it’s hard to see the awards season exercise as a pure “celebration of cinema”. Maybe it never was, but maybe it should be, and could be, with a little more compassion and better background checks. In the words of Gascón herself: “We all have the opportunity to change for the better, to become better people.”Explore more on these topicsEmilia PérezOscarsAwards and prizesJacques AudiardSelena GomezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he has come to Cannes with a brazen and startling picture which, though flawed, does justice to the extraordinary and scarcely believable drama of his own situation and the agony of his homeland.It’s a movie about Iranian officialdom’s misogyny and theocracy, and sets out to intuit and externalise the inner anguish and psychodrama of its dissenting citizens – in a country where women can be judicially bullied and beaten for refusing to wear the hijab. The Seed of the Sacred Fig begins as a downbeat political and domestic drama in the familiar style of Iranian cinema, and then progressively escalates to something extravagantly crazy and traumatised – like a pueblo shootout by Sergio Leone.Iman (Missagh Zareh) is an ambitious lawyer who has just been promoted to state investigator – one step short of being a full judge in the revolutionary court. He gets a handsome pay rise and better accommodation for his family: wife (played by actor and anti-hijab protester Soheila Golestani) and two student-age daughters (Setareh Maleki and Mahsa Rostami). But the promotion almost immediately brings disappointment and tension: Iman, a thoughtful and decent man, is stunned to discover that he is expected to rubber-stamp death-penalty judgments without reading the evidence. He is told that he must now be secretive with friends and family who could be threatened and doxed by criminal elements as a way of pressuring him.Most fatefully of all, he is issued a handgun for his family’s protection, apparently without any training or guidance as to how to use or store it. Naive Iman casually leaves it lying around the house and tucks it in the back of his trousers like a Hollywood gangster. (Are Iranian prosecutors really allowed to be so casual with firearms?)When the anti-hijab protests explode in Iran, whatever liberal scruples Iman once had are suppressed. He coldly rebukes his daughters over dinner for their rebellious feminist views and accuses them of falling for the propaganda of enemies and foreign elements. “What foreign elements?” his daughters demand – but Iman sullenly refuses to elaborate. (Here is a flaw in the film, surely – in real life, Iman would make some very specific, ugly, paranoid claims.) When his wife and daughters help a terrified young female anti-hijab protester who has been shot in the face by the police, this too must be concealed from Iman. And then, catastrophe – Iman’s gun goes missing and, with increasing resentment and fury, he suspects one of the women of his family has taken it and is lying to him. His toxic outrage bleeds into the fabric of the film itself.View image in fullscreenTense … Missagh Zareh and Soheila Golestani in The Seed of the Sacred Fig.Photograph: Run Way PicturesThe Seed of the Sacred Fig starts out in the modern world of Instagram reels and YouTube, composed in the complex and oblique style that we have got used to in Iranian cinema in films byAsghar Farhadi: a world of subtle, realist implications that has arguably replaced the fashion in Iranian cinema for the poetic and the sublime. Rasoulof’s mysterious parable Iron Island from 2005 is a good example. It is possible to watch this movie and initially assume (as I admit I did) that the obvious prime suspect for the gun-theft is not a family member and their refusal to mention the probable culprit’s name is a symptom of their unease at having widened the circle of trust to someone outside the family – an indication of their repression and groupthink dysfunction.‘Exhausting and extremely dangerous’: Mohammad Rasoulof on his escape from IranRead moreBut no. The answer lies elsewhere and emerges almost casually as the drama evolves into something almost jaw-dropping. We get a car chase, violence, and a final demonstration ofChekhov’s ruleabout what happens to a gun produced in act one. And yes, perhaps the point is that The Seed of the Sacred Fig is a film to be finally understood in precisely those enigmatic, poetic and symbolic terms that looked to have been superseded in Iranian cinema – and that the realist depictions of what Iran has become are to be found in the smartphone footage being shared on social media. The film may not be perfect, but its courage – and relevance – are beyond doubt.The Seed of the Sacred Fig screened at the Cannes film festival, and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekIranCannes 2024Drama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For months now I have been in the thrall ofPokémon Trading Card Pocket. It’s a devilishly slick blend of card-collecting and pared-down battling that has had me obediently opening the app on my phone at least twice a day since it launched. The virtual cards are beautifully done; the rare art cards especially, with their pastoral scenes of Pokémon in their natural habitats. I have spent many hours on the battles, too, honing decks and chasing win streaks to earn myself victory emblems. I got most of my friends into it, anticipating the day when its makers at DeNa would finally enable trading so I could fill the last couple of holes in my collection.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This week, on the day that the trading went live and an expansion full of pretty new cards was introduced, I quit. I made a couple of trades for the Venosaur Ex and Machamp Ex that had evaded my grasp despite openinghundredsof packs, took a screenshot of the “collection complete” screen, and I haven’t opened it since. I’m done.I didn’t quit in protest at thefiddly, expensive natureof the new trading feature, or because the new cards mostly feature monsters from an era of Pokémon that holds no nostalgic power for me. I’ve just suddenly had enough. I was enjoying every minute I spent with the game … until I wasn’t. Usually, you know you’re done with a game when you’ve finished it, but in this era of the forever game, we have tochoosewhen to quit. Sometimes this happens overnight for me. One day I’m enjoying a game, the next day I’m sick of it.Inconveniently, I realise it about 75% of the way through a game’s campaign. Especially with open-world titles, the best hours are the ones in the middle, where you’ve played enough to understand a game’s unique ideas and systems butnotenough to have totally mastered them; there comes a point where you know you’re nearing the endgame. Suddenly, the friction between me and the game world – the “stickiness”, as game designers refer to it – is gone, and everything feels smooth and easy, and I lose interest. (This is why I loveFromSoftware’s games so much: from Dark Souls to Elden Ring – they never get easy or predictable.)View image in fullscreenEnough is enough … Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.Photograph: Games PressHere is a small selection of games from the past year that I abandoned in this way, not long before the end:Indiana Jones and the Great Circle; Dragon’s Dogma 2; Paper Mario: the Thousand-Year Door; Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom; Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. I could sit down with any of these for a couple of evenings and polish them off – some of them I already have, months after leaving them unfinished – but it always feels like a chore. Meanwhile, I’ve played Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders,Balatroand Hades long past their completion points, because the stickiness is still there.I often get readers writing to ask when it’s OK to quit a game. For me, the answer is “whenever you stop having fun”. I rarely quit because I get stuck; instead I quit when Istopgetting stuck, when I sense I’ve seen everything meaningful that a game has to offer. I think it’s easy to keep playing something that’s lost its appeal out of a sense of obligation.Studies of trophy and achievement stats over the years have found that onlybetween 15-35% of players(pdf) actually complete any given game. I feel for the developers making hours of content that people might never see, but there is just so much entertainment available to everyone that you can hardly blame people for not finding the time for all of it. Some players take pride in finishing every game that they start, but for the rest of us? It’s OK to stop.I felt briefly bereft when I was done withPokémonTrading Card Game, the same feeling I get when I finish a good novel. Part of me also felt relieved to be freed of the daily habit. It’s opened a little space in my day for something new – and something new isalwayswhat I’m looking for when I pick up a video game.What to playView image in fullscreenLife ruiningly compulsive … Civilization VII.Photograph: 2K GamesTwo enormous, time-eating historical games are out this week:Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a pitilessly challenging simulation of 16th-century Bohemia that really rubs your face into the horse dung at the start, andCivilization VII, the next in the venerable, life-ruiningly compulsive strategy series that challenges you to rerun human history from the start.

The judge said she would deliver her reasoning in a written judgment at a later date.In a 19-page ruling published on Wednesday, Steyn rejected the claims made by Clarke’s legal team, which revolved around a decision by journalists to delete messages exchanged with one another on Signal, a messaging app.During a hearing intoClarke’s application on 29 January, the court heard how Paul Lewis, the Guardian’s head of investigations and the principal editor supervising the story, asked two reporters, Sirin Kale and Lucy Osborne, to delete Signal threads.His request occurred before the publication of any articles and more than a year before Clarke notified the Guardian of his intention to sue.Clarke’s lawyers sought to argue that the deletion of the messages, and what they claimed were attempts to “fabricate” evidence, amounted to attempts to destroy evidence that was relevant to the current legal proceedings.They argued that Guardian journalists had perverted the course of justice and Clarke was therefore unable to receive a fair trial.However, in her judgment, Steyn dismissed those arguments.She said: “I reject the contention that the defendant has perverted or attempted to pervert the course of justice. There has been no fabrication of evidence. Some documents were deleted prior to the commencement of proceedings, and over a year before a letter, before claim giving notice of the intended claims was sent to the defendant.“But such deletion was not in breach of any duty to preserve documents, and in any event it neither had the tendency to pervert, nor was it intended to pervert the course of justice.“As the allegation of perversion of the course of justice fails, it follows that the strike-out application must inevitably be rejected in its entirety.”The judge said: “Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart [nee Kale] were free to delete these peripheral documents in accordance with their organisation’s data minimisation policy, at a time when the legal department had not instructed them to preserve potentially disclosable documents.”Steyn said Clarke’s application was “entirely vague” about what the Guardian’s journalists were accused of fabricating and she criticised claims Clarke’s lawyers made in oral submissions at last week’s hearing.She said: “The approach taken by the claimant’s representatives is unacceptable: deletion is not fabrication, and such a grave allegation should not have been made and publicly aired without foundation.”Her ruling concluded that Clarke’s application failed both because the Guardian had not perverted the course of justice, or attempted to do so, and because the “limited pre-action deletion” that had occurred did not preclude a fair trial.A Guardian spokesperson said: “We are pleased that Mrs Justice Steyn today rejected the entirely false allegations made by Mr Clarke’s legal team against our journalists.“Our reporting on Noel Clarke in 2021 was based on the accounts of 20 brave women. After we published our first article, more women came forward.“At trial, 32 witnesses are set to testify against Mr Clarke under oath. We look forward to a judge hearing the evidence.”The articles Clarke is suing over were published in 2021 and 2022.The high court ruled in November 2023 that the articles meant there were strong grounds to believe Clarke was a serial abuser of women, who abused his power over 15 years to prey on, harass and sometimes bully female colleagues, and that he engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching and groping women and making sexually inappropriate comments.The articles also meant he took and shared sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.Clarke has denied any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing. He accepted he once made inappropriate comments about one woman, for which he later apologised. He said in November 2023: “I have always disputed the content of the eight Guardian articles.”Steyn’s ruling outlined some of the evidence expected to be heard during the high court trial set to begin on 3 March.It said the Guardian had served 34 witness statements in support of its defence. They included six journalists, who would provide evidence in support of a public interest defence, and 28 witnesses who had provided witness statements in relation to the truth of the allegations published by the Guardian. All but two are scheduled to give evidence at trial. Clarke, the judgment said, had served 15 witness statements.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Didion spoke in the sessions about her relationship with Quintana, who lived with mental illness and alcoholism, and died in 2005 aged 39.According to UK publisher 4th Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins, the conversations Didion had with the psychiatrist “were central to Didion’s understanding of the themes she turned to in her brilliant late works,Where I Was From,The Year of Magical ThinkingandBlue Nights.”Kishani Widyaratna, publishing director at 4th Estate said: “It is a great honour to be bringing this extraordinary new book to readers.

On Wednesday, Tate said it now expected it to reopen in the spring of 2027, as politicians, funders and trustees were shown around after the completion of phase one of the project.“Flinging open the windows” is a central part of the revamp, Macdonald said. Previous visitors to the gallery would, once inside, have had little idea they were even inLiverpool, let alone next to the Mersey or inside a Grade I-listed 19th-century warehouse.The first phase has involved removing the ugly, no-longer-cutting-edge air conditioning units that ran the length of the building, and stripping back the interiors to the original brick walls.It has also brought natural light into the building, and that is just the beginning, gallery bosses say.“We get the most spectacular sunsets over the Mersey but these spaces were boarded up or covered up,” Legg said, pointing to what will be the new cafe. “You will get a sense of being on the river … it’s going to be incredibly beautiful.”View image in fullscreenWhen Tate Liverpool opened in 1988 about 200,000 visitors a year were expected. By the pandemic the actual number was 700,000.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianTate Liverpool was opened in a derelict warehouse in Royal Albert Dock in 1988, a conversion designed by James Stirling.It was a risky venture, seen as mad by many, but it proved a catalyst for Liverpool’s regeneration and it helped kick off a wider revolution for contemporary art. After Tate Liverpool came Tate Modern in London as well as gamechanging galleries across the UK and Europe such as the Baltic in Gateshead, the Hepworth Wakefield, the Guggenheim Bilbao and Louvre-Lens.Legg said other galleries learned from the success of Tate Liverpool. “But it also meant that Tate Liverpool got left behind in all of the new thinking that developed afterwards,” she said.One reflection of that is the new Tate Liverpool will have a ground-floor art hall where larger works can be shown.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Helen Legg, Tate Liverpool director; Roland Rudd, Tate chair; Steve Rotheram, Liverpool regional mayor; and Maria Balshaw, Tate director.Photograph: James Speakman/PAPart of the need for such a significant revamp is the success of the gallery over four decades. When it opened, 200,000 visitors a year were expected. Before the pandemic, the number visiting was 700,000. When it reopens, 1 million visitors are hoped for, entering through bigger doors and walking up wider stairs.It is England’s most visited contemporary art gallery outside London and has staged memorable and popular exhibitions includingGustav Klimt in 2008andKeith Haring in 2019, the latter of which made the Guardian’s Adrian Searle feel “like Dante being led into the circles of hell by Mickey Mouse”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All the gas boilers are being removed.Insulation is being improved, said Owen Watson, of 6a. “It is a major decarbonising project.

He said the project captured what made the region so special – “honouring our history while looking ahead to the future”.He said: “By breathing new life into this historic building, we’re not only celebrating its legacy but strengthening its role at the heart of our £6.25bn visitor economy and restating our place as the UK’s cultural capital.“The impact of this project stretches beyond art. It’s about creating opportunities, driving regeneration and showcasing the very best of our city region to the world.

The Idaho law “goes even further than previous laws by removing classic books from public libraries in addition to schools”, said Dan Novack, associate general counsel at Penguin Random House.HB 710’s definition of “harmful” materials is “vague and overbroad”, says the lawsuit. The law allows private citizens to file complaints, putting librarians “in the untenable position of having to guess whether any member of the public might file an objection to a book whose message they disagree with” by claiming the text falls within the law’s definition of harmful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Now under-18s cannot enter the library without their parent or guardian completing a three-part waiver.“Our programming – which includes the only option for after-school care in Donnelly – has been severely impacted, with children unable to step inside the building to use the bathroom or keep warm without a complex waiver,” said the library’s director, Sherry Scheline.Scheline added: “Our circulation has also declined significantly.” There was a 42.8% fall in materials checked out from the library in the six weeks after the introduction of the legislation, compared with the previous year.Since the law took effect, titles moved to adult-only sections or removed from libraries entirely include A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou and Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut.Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingLibrariesnewsShareReuse this content"

His exceptional photograph serves as a powerful reminder that local nature and wildlife, often just outside our homes, can inspire and captivate us.”Wood said winning the award was “truly humbling”, but he also highlighted the “darker side” to the image as he called for an end to badger culling in the UK, which aims to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis.“I live in rural Dorset, where I’m on a rewilding mission to enhance habitats for a huge array of wildlife,” he said. “The badger cull – which is still ongoing – has decimated their numbers and I fear that unless the cull is stopped, we’ll only see badgers in urban settings in several parts ofEngland.“My hope is for this image to raise awareness of the damaging effect of the badger cull and help push for change.”The people’s choice shortlist was selected from nearly 60,000 entries to this year’s wildlife photographer of the year competition.Four other highly commended images also impressed wildlife lovers, including Francisco Negroni’s photo of a double lenticular cloud over the Villarrica volcano in Chile, and Jess Findlay’s action shot of a ghostly barn owl exiting through the hayloft window of a derelict barn.David Northall’s snap of a honey badger returning to finish off a Cape porcupine, and Michel d’Oultremont’s photo of a stoat sitting up to observe its territory across a snowy landscape in Belgium also won over voters.All five images will be displayed online and at the Natural History Museum in London until 29 June.Explore more on these topicsWildlife photographer of the yearBadgersNatural History MuseumPhotographyWildlifeEast SussexEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The man, who worked as an adult entertainer in Las Vegas, claims he was hired by Combs in 2007 to perform a strip show, and was subsequently booked on other occasions lasting until 2012 at hotel rooms and Combs residences across the US.The lawsuit,obtained by Rolling Stone, claims Combs instructed the man “to perform acts that were outside the scope of the agreed-upon performance and limitations set by plaintiff and his agency”, including sexual intercourse with women. He alleges Combs sexually and physically assaulted him, drugged him with Viagra, and covertly filmed the sexual encounters to use as blackmail material. He also claims Combs manipulated him by promising to assist in the man’s hoped-for music career.“Combs dehumanised plaintiff and reduced him to a mere object for Combs’ own amusement and to satisfy his own sexual fetishes,” the suit claims. “Combs gravely exploited plaintiff, effectively imprisoning him and controlling him through surreptitious surveillance and filming.”Combs’ lawyers denied the allegations in a statement to Rolling Stone, saying: “No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex-trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to separate fact from fiction, and Mr Combs is confident that he will prevail in court.”Two other women, also filing lawsuits anonymously on Tuesday, allege that they were drugged and sexually assaulted on multiple occasions at parties held by Combs during the 1990s. One alleges that an assault against her was filmed, and that Combs refused her request to delete the footage. Combs’ lawyers denied the allegations ina statement to Billboard.On Monday, another man identifying anonymously as John Doe filed a separate lawsuitseen by Billboardregarding an alleged incident in 2015. The man, then an aspiring rapper, claimed he was given a drink by Combs at a party which caused him to lose consciousness, before waking to find Combs groping him. He alleges Combs then tried to coerce him into having sex with an unknown woman, but the man escaped the venue instead.The man says the incident caused him “pain and suffering, mental anguish, physical impairment and emotional torment”. Lawyers for Combs issued the same aforementioned denial following the allegations.Combs is currently being held at New York’s Metropolitan Detention Center, having been denied bail three times as he awaits trial on federal charges, separate to the dozens of civil cases he faces.Those charges, to which he pleaded not guilty, are that he “abused, threatened, and coerced women and others, and led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labour, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes”. A start date for his trial has been set for 5 May.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsRapnewsShareReuse this content"

As first lady she was criticised for her extravagance, pilloried for her attention-seeking, and even accused of being a traitor. Her son Robert had her committed to a mental institution following her husband Abraham’s assassination. Many historians have portrayed her as an intemperate, even violent figure.View image in fullscreen‘I cannot be remembered this way’ … Miriam Grace Edwards  as Mary Lincoln  in Mrs President.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJohn Ransom Phillips questions this depiction in his new play, which imagines Lincoln on her visits toMathew Brady, the famous American photographer who took the portraits by which she is most recognised today. There’s an instant clash of egos between the regal Lincoln, taking up literal space in her vast hooped dress, and Brady, pursuing his own tyrannical artistic vision. “I shape the image of the people who shape America,” he cries, with mad scientist energy. “So I am shaping America!”Miriam Grace Edwards brings great emotional range to the first lady, whose many tragedies – losing two infant sons, witnessing her husband’s murder – render her a sympathetic figure. Scenes follow each other in phantasmagorical fashion, with a game Sam Jenkins-Shaw metamorphosing between Brady and his photographic subjects, from naturalist John James Audubon to revolutionary martyr John Brown.The principals largely talk at, rather than to, each other, offering more of a conceptual framework than a central narrative. It’s never quite clear where the action is taking place – in Brady’s imagination? One of Lincoln’s psychotic episodes? – and the bursts of biographical information that explode at regular intervals are entertaining but rarely illuminating.Designer Gregor Donnelly does some neat work with a magically appearing darkroom and flashbulb renderings of the portraits themselves. But Bronagh Lagan’s direction is awkwardly undermined by scenes where the stage is empty except for a chair and camera tripod, which talk to each other in a manner you might see midway through a Disney ride.“I cannot be remembered this way,” Lincoln cries at one point. Unfortunately she’s right: this overworked thematic treatment, of who gets to define how we’re seen, obscures a more interesting glimpse of the first lady herself.AtCharing Cross theatre, London, until 16 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreAbraham LincolnreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over three hours and 20 minutes, from a sequence of fixed camera positions, it blankly transcribes the ordinary life of Jeanne Dielman, a fortysomething widowed single mother, living with her teenage son Sylvain in a modest one-bedroom apartment in central Brussels (he sleeps in a foldout sofa bed in the front room).The flat is heavily furnished in a style that clearly dates from before the second world war, the glass-fronted dresser weirdly reflecting the flashing blue lights from the store across the street, a touch which the audience will come to notice in time and which may be a premonition of the police’s future arrival. The hours and the days go by, each like the last. Jeanne cooks, washes up, cleans, goes shopping, shines Sylvain’s shoes; sometimes she looks after a neighbour’s baby in a carrycot; she mends Sylvain’s jacket, fatefully leaving her dressmaking scissors in the bedroom. And in the afternoons, while he is out at school, Jeanne supplements the widow’s pension we see her collecting from the post office by having sex for money with gentlemen visitors who are discreetly attended to on a towel placed primly over the counterpane on what was once Jeanne’s marital bed. But her life and state of mind come to pieces – gradually, then suddenly – for reasons which we, the audience, have to supply.Dielman is played by Delphine Seyrig, her son by Jan Decorte, and her clients by film-maker Henri Storck, critic and director Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and actor Yves Bical. This is also the 10th anniversary of something very grim. Akerman heartbreakinglytook her own life in 2015and never lived to see her workwin the all-time best film pollrun by the UK’s Sight and Sound magazine in 2022. Maybe that’s just as well. It triggered a certain amount of punching-up satire about out-of-touch elitist cinephilia, on account of this “greatest ever” prize that Akerman neither expected nor sought and might well have horrified her. Perhaps it’s only by forgetting about this gold medal that we can see the film clearly.View image in fullscreenDielman (Delphine Seyrig) supplements her widow’s pension with sex work.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyJeanne Dielman’s secret life is not a secret. The truth is made quite clear at the very beginning of the film: a sad-faced, well-dressed man politely hands over money and leaves. And yet the film follows this with a real-time exposition of her day-to-day life of such sustained banality that we almost forget what we’ve just seen. It numbs us and we lose our sense of what was just happening, just as Jeanne has herself forgotten about it, over time. It is a surrealist effect. Bought sex in the afternoon is not dramatised or fetishised as it is in, say, Luis Buñuel’s Belle de Jour, and it doesn’t give us any insight into Jeanne’s mind. When we see her in the kitchen, wearing a dull housecoat and that permed hairdo immaculately in place, kneading minced beef for a dish at almost unfathomable length, she is in a housewifely trance. There is nothing very sensual about it. Perhaps she is the mound of minced beef in the hands of her customers. We never see her face in closeup, although it comes nearer to the camera in the final act, and we only glimpse her smiling briefly, and in profile, when she makes polite conversation with shop assistants.What explicit guide there is to her life comes from a letter from her sister Fernande, who lives in Canada, which Jeanne reads aloud and which informs the audience Jeanne has been a widow for six years. The title – as well as naturally representing Jeanne’s placid bourgeois existence – is in fact Jeanne’s postal address, the words which Fernande will have written on the envelope. In a clothes shop, Jeanne will recount the story of when Fernande came to stay when Sylvain was just six years old and mother, father and son slept in the same bed. Another expository set piece comes when Sylvain, just before sleep, asks his mother about her sex life and confesses that a friend once told him sex was so painful for the woman that he would, as a child, fake bad dreams at night to rescue his mother from this ordeal. Jeanne is coolly disapproving of this, but tells him that his father’s ugliness was of no account: “Sleeping with him was just a detail.” Sleeping with these men is just a detail in the film as well.The time of our lives: Tacita Dean on Chantal AkermanRead moreBut then, after the second man on the second day, it becomes more than a detail. Something happens in the bedroom. Jeanne becomes subtly discomposed: forgetful and in almost infinitesimal, but escalating disarray. Was there a moment of violence? Have Sylvain’s puberty and his newly impertinent and hurtful comments on sex suddenly opened Jeanne’s eyes to the truth? Or something else, something suggested by the director herself, that Jeanne is shocked by feeling pleasure, perhaps for the first time, and by the feelings of disloyalty to her late husband and disloyalty to her whole sense of self. Watching this again,I’m reminded of the brutal line from David Mamet’s 1991 movie Homicide: “It’s like the old whore says: ‘Once you start coming with the customers, it’s time to quit.’”This is not the climactic truth about Jeanne. It is not that her sex work is the secret beneath her respectable image; it is perhaps more that her respectable image is the secret beneath the sex work. And when did Jeanne begin this sideline anyway? Presumably after her husband died; but not necessarily. It is not entirely out of the question that it started before her widowhood. The vision that she gives us of herself and her sister just after the war shows how transactional sex could be; her sister went with a GI and married him. As attractive young women they had that sexual capital and nothing else in the chaos of war. The wartime memories are very real; this film is much closer to the end of the war than it is to our present day. The framed photograph of Jeanne’s parents on the bedside table is another glacially sad touch.From our 21st-century perspective, we can see how Akerman’s film has influenced Jaime Rosales’s The Hours of the Day from 2003 or Michael Haneke’s Hidden from 2005, although perhaps there aren’t many film-makers who can or wish to imitate it. The modern conversation around ASD and ADHD perhaps sheds a new diagnostic light on Jeanne’s behaviour and the film’s own procedure. The silence of Jeanne Dielman is the film’s weather and its atmosphere. It is a silence of terrible loneliness, and a silence in which a storm is gathering.Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 February. A retrospective season, Chantal Akerman: Adventures in Perception, is at BFI Southbank until 18 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsChantal AkermanWorld cinemaBelgiumEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’sBear Gryllsof course, not a real bear. I mention that upfront just in case, like me, your heart leapt in anticipation when the title Celebrity Bear Hunt flashed up on your screen. Exactlywhichminor celebs were envisioned screaming and flailing through undergrowth pursued by an ursine foe hungry for buffed, botoxed flesh will have been different for each of us – but what a vision indeed!No doubt the day will come, and sooner than we think, when such entertainment is a standard part of the TV schedules. Until then, I’ve got to tell you: this is a remarkably full-blooded substitute. Only two episodes were available for review but by the end of them we’ve had, under the broiling Costa Rican jungle sun, boats sinking in crocodile-filled waters, two captures in camouflage nets, ravine crossings, snakes, and earnest discussions about making sure to do your daily poo before the next challenge so you can bomb along with as little hindrance as possible. The 12 celebs are divided into teams and, as soon as one of them splits from their pack, Bear – yes! – leaps out of the undergrowth, rugby-tackles them to the ground, trusses them up and leaves them in the sun to die. No, all right, not the last bit – he goes and collects them later – but the rest is true and excellent. I haven’t had this much fun watching a reality TV competition since the earliest days of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me out of Here!.View image in fullscreen‘Unusually good value’ … Mel B tries not to sink in Celebrity Bear Hunt.Photograph: Tom Dymond/NetflixAnyone who fails a challenge and gets rugby-tackled and tied up by Grylls (of the dozen contestants, only Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen makes the “I usually have to pay extra for this” joke and I admire him and the other 11 participants for it) has to undergo a second challenge, this time in the Bear Pit – an even more croc-filled, snake-stuffed and booby-trapped section of the jungle surrounded by giant palisades that really should have got separate billing. Anyone who fails that challenge is eligible to be thrown out of the game at Bear’s behest. In tones more of sorrow than anger – as befits the Chief Scout who is only there to help you become your best self – he will explain how they were undone by their lack of situational awareness, and that the helicopter is on its way to return them to their shameful little half-lives of ease and comfort.The celebrities are unusually good value. As well as LLB, there’s exuberant, forthright Mel B happily taking menopause advice from the inordinately charming Shirley Ballas. There’s actor Joe Thomas, quiet, anxious (“the biggest thing I’ve ever had to survive is a stressful meeting”) and homesick, whose transformation in the second episode is a rare delight – which is to say it is both unexpected and convincing. There is loudly bonhomous rapper and chef Big Zuu, who loves to lead though without any idea of what the psychological or physical qualities needed to do it well might be. When Grylls suggests that the much-vaunted situational awareness can be likened to moving through the forest like a deer, he protests – loudly, albeit correctly – “I’m not a deer-y man!”View image in fullscreen‘Remarkably full-blooded’ … Big Zuu in Celebrity Bear Hunt.Photograph: Tom Dymond/NetflixLottie Moss (“I’m best known for being Kate Moss’s sister. Or a model”) provides the tearful vulnerability quotient. She was apparently about to re-enter rehab when this opportunity presented itself instead. I’m sure that’s fine. I’m sure that’s absolutely fine. Making up the quieter portion of the signings are journalist and TV host Steph McGovern, retired rugby player Danny Cipriani – a surprisingly soothing presence – plus singer Una Healy, model Leomie Anderson and former Wimbledon champion and more recent jailbird Boris Becker, whose picture should be in every dictionary under the word “phlegmatic”. Yes, he has made mistakes that “cost me dearly”. No, he will not be sharing any stories from his231 days in prison– they were terrible and he has accepted what he did and then you move on. No, he never got stressed before tennis matches because he always had control of his mind. No, he was not shocked to win Wimbledon at 17 because “you are too young to know you are not supposed to do it”. It’s possibly my imagination but the whole jungle appears to still when he speaks. Apart from Big Zuu.Oh, and I nearly forgot –Holly Willoughbyis presenting, but is so extraneous to proceedings that I nearly forgot she was there. Anyway, Netflix has overall done its job well. Celebrity Bear Hunt is fast, the contestants are surprisingly funny and the jeopardy – if the third episode’s trailer and tabloid reports of the injuries and near-misses during filming are anything to go by – is real. Or at least more real than usual. The trap is set and I suspect viewers will take the bait in droves.Celebrity Bear Hunt is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsReality TVTV reviewTelevisionBear GryllsHolly WilloughbyBoris BeckerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Twice shortlisted for the Pulitzer and once for the National book award, he has followed up an acclaimed debut (the short story collection You Are Not a Stranger Here) with three novels at dignified intervals of six to eight years, including the highly garlandedImagine Me Gone. On the side, a constellation of fellowships, and a journalistic career. As a way to pursue a life in writing, I would say to my own students: this is how it’s done.It’s strange, then, to read Mothers and Sons and reflect on just how much of his third novel wouldn’t make it through a writers’ workshop. Haslett is a writer of extraordinary strengths – he excels at an emotional undercurrent, the trancelike rhythms of routine and the cauterised numbness of trauma – whose architectural abilities, the skills required to craft the underlying tectonic structure of a story, seem strangely underdeveloped here.Peter Fischer is working as a legal aid immigration lawyer, filling every waking hour with the bureaucratic tedium of court filings, appeals and affidavits, his caseload a litany of traumatic stories of flight and insecurity. Just as Haslett proved his acuity with his first novel,Union Atlantic, writing about the arrogance of bankers as the financial crash brought them to the forefront of public consciousness, he has once again situated a novel on a faultline of our times, as the incoming American administration promises to pursue its deportation agenda with unprecedented vigour. Elsewhere, Peter’s estranged mother, Ann, a secondary protagonist who is not afforded Peter’s first-person perspective, is running a women’s retreat.Both live entrenched lives of apparent moral worth, with little room for emotional volatility. In Peter’s case this is because he won’t let anyone in, preferring instead to occasionally text Cliff, his not-quite partner, and invite him over for sex. In Ann’s case it’s because any emotional turbulence is resolved within the retreat’s listening circles. These are two very different kinds of torpid calm, but the effect is strangely similar. It turns out that the listening circles are just as much a deflection tactic as Peter’s solitude – despite aiming to help women open up about their struggles, Ann has signally failed for several years to engage with her feelings for Jeanette, another woman working at the centre.It’s frustrating to read a work where significant gifts are spent on a story that doesn’t really go anywhereHaving established his protagonists in their isolation, Haslett proceeds to sustain that isolation for 200 pages, until mother and son eventually reunite and confront one another. The trigger for this reunion is that one of Peter’s colleagues challenges him, while walking to lunch, over the fact that he never takes gay cases. Peter takes the very next case that comes up, a young Albanian man named Vasel’s attempt to prove he would be in danger if sent home. This has profound consequences.This is where I start to wonder about Haslett’s plotting. Is it enough, after years of avoiding gay deportation cases, that one casual inquiry should lead Peter to change tack so fundamentally? And does it satisfy the requirements of good storytelling that something so small should lead to Peter’s breakdown, and the confrontation Peter has with Ann about the tragedy that set them chasing their twin silences? Every storyteller I’ve come across would ask for more from the triggering event.They’d also want their protagonists, in some way, to change: which may not be entirely true to life, but is surely something we expect from good fiction. At the end of Mothers and Sons, I don’t think either Peter or Ann have shifted in their courses. All that’s emerged is that these do-gooders are, in fact, people whose selfless deeds mask a colossal and appalling selfishness. Perhaps that’s the violence that underpins the United States, but I’m not sure it makes for satisfying plotting. It also becomes slowly more difficult as one reads to accept how similarly written Ann and Peter are; this isn’t a novel that finds conflict and stimulus in the contrast between its protagonists’ voices. It’s two people going through the same thing, in the same key, except one of them, Peter, is a more interesting character. Ann’s relegation to a third-person narrative feels like a telling admission of defeat – she struggles to come across as more than an extension of Peter’s crisis.It’s frustrating to read a work where significant gifts are spent on a story that doesn’t really go anywhere. Haslett’s depiction of Peter’s love for Jared, a boy in the year above him at high school, his recounting of the death of Peter’s father, and his percussive portrayal of the minutiae of the courtroom, are magnetic. But the book comes to feel like circular storytelling, a tale freighted with false catharsis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The ancient Athenians did it, their choruses a weave of sound and movement, though no one really knows what shapes they threw back in the fifth century. They probably didn’t give the hands-in-the-air delirium of Hofesh Shechter’s spectacular dancers in this new version of Oedipus – but dance becomes the irresistible core of the tragedy.Shechter and Matthew Warchus co-direct a text by Ella Hickson (The Writer). Ina freak of scheduling, they follow Robert Icke’s inexorable modern-dress Oedipus: two very different takes on Sophocles’ family values.Here, Thebes gasps with drought under a harsh red sun and Tom Visser’s lighting, a dust storm in charcoal and crimson. King Oedipus resolves to save his people, either by leading them to fertile ground or solving the ancient murder that a faction of hardline believers argue has angered the gods. Big mistake, huge.Rami Malek’s air of having dropped from another planet has served him well on film as a Bond villain or Freddie Mercury. He brings outsider vibes to Oedipus – speaking in an elusive American drawl, adopting the mantle of leadership like a haunted robot.Confession later fractures his speech – he becomes shambling, disjointed, bones awkwardly resettling in his body. The truth remakes Oedipus, and then undoes him.Oedipus claims to lead with “courage, conviction and ingenuity” – the very qualities which brought him to power will destroy him as he stubbornly pursues his terrible identity.As the state’s climate change emergency is derailed by a cold case, he sifts through box files and summons the prophet Tiresias. “Bring in a raving hermit, that’ll do it,” scoffs his wife, Jocasta – though Cecilia Noble makes a strikingly disgruntled seer, feet planted wide, unleashing the truth in a wide-mouthed cackle.View image in fullscreenDancers from the Hofesh Shechter Company in Oedipus.Photograph: Manuel HarlanShechter’s soundtrack of fervent chants and wild drums rattles the Old Vic’s plasterwork, volume rising like panic, and his dancers are on fire. They’re mosh pit ecstatics – hands raised in plea or pleasure, lolloping, squirming. They scrabble, shuffle or form a serpentine scrawl of bodies.There’s no literal transposition of Sophocles’ choruses – no dance equivalent of “call no man happy till he dies” – but their delirium leeches into your blood. You feel them lost in the stomp, consumed by physical impulses even as Oedipus struggles to unwind a mystery.“People need to struggle with nuance and difficulty,” Oedipus huffs. But while the movement offers a superb, needling ambiguity, Hickson’s text is parched. She struggles to find a resonant public register (“we feel your pain”) or an intimacy for her private scenes: “Darkness is the soil in which I nurture my humility” sounds like a shonky translation. Indira Varma’s elegantly sceptical queen (cheekbones, pashmina) gets the best lines, resisting her brother Creon (Nicholas Khan), a black-clad theocrat with an itch for power.The ancient pollution is named and rain falls again. The blissed-out chorus spin, feet raising happy spumes of water – they appear fundamentally unbothered by the destructive, seamy dynamics of the royal drama.

When she is good, she is great – and, for the most part, that was on Inside Amy Schumer, her zeitgeist-y Comedy Central sketch show that ran from 2013-2016. Schumer’s brand of comedy – bawdy, self-deprecating, pointing to overarching sexism while skewering certain types of white women – was both native to and critical of the pop feminist era, your oversharing best friend during the personal essay boom.Bring Them Down review – Barry Keoghan farmer-feud revenge drama goes right over the topRead moreFor better and, at least on the big screen, for worse, Schumer’s sensibility has remained there. Kinda Pregnant, her new film at Netflix, plays the hits Schumer is known for – shameless physical comedy, frank discussion of bodies, brash refusal to play good girl – but feels stuck in the past, unable to generate new sparks. Written by Schumer and Julie Paiva and directed by Tyler Spindel, Kinda Pregnant continues a string of underwhelming Hollywood vehicles since 2015’sTrainwreckedthat have hamstrung Schumer’s talent with sub-par writing (2018’sI Feel Pretty) or plotting (2017’sSnatched).This time, the issue is more existential: though it tries – there’s pratfall and physical gags aplenty – there’s just not that much funny to be found here. If the 2022 reboot of Inside Amy Schumershowed the limits of its topical comedypost-Trump, then Kinda Pregnant evinces the dead end of this particular style of comic fuck-up. It doesn’t help that the 100-minute film has the stale flavor of Netflixcontent: overlit, undercooked, checking off boxes by sticking a bunch of funny people together and hoping for the best.The setup should be, um, fertile ground for Schumer, pregnancy and childbirth being states that warp the female body – the site of her most ruthless and revealing jokes – freighted with the cultural scripts she loves to flout. Schumer herself is no stranger to pregnancy fare, having documented her own arduous pregnancy in the 2020 docuseriesExpecting Amyand mined its ribald absurdities for the 2019 standup specialGrowing.Here, she plays the other side of child-free/parent friend divide (a rich topic!) as Lainy, an uncensored and increasingly unhinged Brooklyn schoolteacher in an oddly affordable Williamsburg who has long been desperate to start a family. In her early 40s and four years deep in a relationship with Dave (Damon Wayans Jr), details unknown besides being a cad, she believes she’s on the precipice of an engagement and thus her dreams. It all blows up spectacularly and, for the viewer, tiresomely – I appreciate an attempt to revive the old studio comedy but, again, pratfall too aplenty – at an inopportune time. A day after being so desperate for a ring she digs for it in a cake, Lainy learns her forever best friend Kate (Jillian Bell) is pregnant.Besieged by jealousy – Schumer, as usual, is adept at playing a woman barging through the “I’m so excited for you” script while not really meaning it – Lainy entertains a flight of fancy: what if she justpretendedshe was pregnant with a fake bump? The world becomes an Elf-esque oyster, all cooing and congratulations and gifted seats on the subway. And because this movie entertains a fluid sense of magical realism and Brooklyn-as-small town, a friendship with the actually pregnant Megan (Brianne Howey), a young mom desperate to connect over the horrors and loneliness of the endeavor, whose brother just so happens to be the guy Lainy flirted with at the coffee shop (Will Forte).Hijinks ensue with a strenuous physical edge – Kinda Pregnant derives a good bulk of its humor from Schumer stuffing a variety of objects under her shirt when caught unawares, or hiding the ruse from various parties. There are intriguing nuggets here: the way society patronizes pregnant women (and now criminalizes, though that’s smartly not mentioned; implication is enough), the crazy-making insecurities of falling behind one’s friends, how jealousy commingles with joy. Bell is particularly good as the film’s voice of reason, though still one throwing a joint baby shower with the worst parody of gen Z New Jerseyans I have seen in Shirley (Lizze Broadway) and her backwards-hat bro husband Rawn (Alex Moffat).Ironically for a comedy so bent on the outrageous, as epitomized by Kiwi comedian Urzila Carlson’s vaping school counsellor, Kinda Pregnant finds its groove in the more grounded and honest. The tiptoeing around big changes in one’s best friendship, the tension between joy and dread, the role of a friend when another is going through something irrevocable all get mentions that hint at something sharper and stickier. But what texture exists gets steamrolled by the loud and extreme. Schumer’s style – force and exaggeration, pushing boundaries to sometimes hilarious ends – may have reached its limit.Kinda Pregnant is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsAmy SchumerNetflixComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

We weren’t in the Arctic on a cruise ship but steering a narrowboat in northern England, almost the farthest north you can reach on the inland waterways. There was snow on the hills. The Leeds & Liverpool Canal, which climbs to 148 metres above sea level as it crosses the Pennines between the east and west coasts, had only recently thawed after a cold snap.Canal mapA canal holiday is usually thought of as a summer pastime: standing at the tiller in T-shirt and shorts, followed by evenings in canalside beer gardens. But the canals are quieter in the off season (from October to May), and it is unlikely you will find queues at locks or water points. The sparsity of boat traffic is also easier on the nerves if you’re new to steering a 30-tonne steel battering ram round bends, through narrow bridges and beside expensive moored boats. For the first time ever, I would be at the tiller of a wide-beam (11ft 5in-wide) boat.View image in fullscreenThe cosy interior of Paul Miles’s hired boat.Photograph: Paul MilesThe 127-mile-long Leeds & Liverpool canal was completed in 1816 and has 14ft-wide locks. Significant amounts of cargo, such as coal and limestone, could be carried by each vessel, which meant the canal remained financially viable until the early 1970s. Now those spacious lock dimensions accommodate larger-than-average holiday boats. Our main cabin was big enough to host a small country dance. We had a spacious open-plan kitchen-living room-diner with a two-seater sofa and huge armchair in front of the wood burner. There were two en suite bedrooms plus the sofa bed. Being able to offer such relative luxury (did I mention central heating?) had sealed the deal with three friends who joined me.Heading west from the hire boat base at Silsden, it would be 11 miles before we reached our first lock, but this didn’t mean the crew could relax: there were 14 swing bridges to operate, three of them carrying roads. Pedestrians waited patiently, children smiling and waving. “We don’t see many boats on the move in winter,” said one parent in the pretty canalside village of Kildwick.View image in fullscreenAfter mooring, Paul Miles and his friends hiked some of the nearby Yorkshire Dales.Photograph: Paul MilesOur plan was to cruise to the summit level of the canal, near Barnoldswick (pronounced Barlick by the locals). The Nicholson Waterways Guide describes this stretch as “one of the more remote stretches and probably the most scenic”. It was a journey of just 20 miles and 15 locks one way. The websitecanalplan.ukestimates a journey time of 11.5 hours. There and back in a week would be a nice leisurely trip, cruising about three hours a day. But it was not to be.Our plan was to cruise to the summit level of the canal, near Barnoldswick, one of the more remote stretches and probably the most scenicOn day three, we took more than an hour to cruise through two locks. They leaked badly. Several paddles were broken. It took the might of three of us – plus the boat in forward gear – to open the heavy gates. I phoned theCanal & River Trust(CRT) to report the problems. At this rate, ascending the next nine locks to a hoped-for picturesque rural mooring near the village of Bank Newton was looking overambitious for the day. When walkers on the towpath warned us that the pound (the stretch between locks) above the next lock was very low, it confirmed our change of plan. We would moor for the night here in Gargrave instead. With our newly free afternoon, we could hike some of the Pennine Way that crosses the canal and visit a local pub.That evening, over pheasant curry and pints of Timothy Taylor in the Masons Arms, we learned that we were not the only ones to find the locks on this canal especially tricky. “It took me an hour to go through one on my way up from Leeds,” said fellow boater Anita Weedy, who lives on board her (solar-electric) narrowboat. “I had to ask passersby to help.”View image in fullscreenThe poor maintenance of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal hit the headlines last year.Photograph: Rachel HaynesThe poor maintenance of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal, specifically the reservoirs that keep it topped up,made headlineslast year. One hire boat company,Pennine Cruisers, in operation for 60 years, has ceased its holiday hire business, blaming the CRT’s poor maintenance. “Customers were having to cut short their holidays when they got stuck because the CRT had padlocked locks due to water supply issues,” said director Zoe Venn. “The decision to stop hiring holiday boats isn’t one we’ve taken lightly, but we were having to give refunds all the time. We can’t get insurance to cover that.” The CRT says it is “raising funds to invest significant sums in the Leeds & Liverpool Canal … to ensure our canals get the care and maintenance they need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This hadn’t just been a holiday but a waterways protest of sortsAs for our fortunes, we now had more woes. A storm was forecast. We would lose at least a day’s cruising. Advice that Zoe had given came to mind: “Choose a direction, not a destination.” We had gone westwards, perhaps that was enough of an achievement? We abandoned plans to reach the summit level and turned round to slowly mosey back. Skipton had looked charming when we cruised through. We could spend time there. Descending locks was far quicker; under 10 minutes each. We meandered along the side of the Aire valley. Fields threaded with dry-stone walls rose up into a swirling mist. Soggy sheep grazed and stared as we passed. Hills like bruise-coloured waves rolled towards us through low cloud. There was none of the forecast winter sun but it was all still magical in its own way.View image in fullscreenIcebreaker … Skipton proved a good place for mooring up and enjoying walks, cafes and pubs.Photograph: Andrew Hopkins/AlamyBy cruising the canal, using locks and bridges, even if only a few, we were also doing a good deed. “Use it or lose it” has long been the ethos of the inland waterways. Decades ago, the pioneering author and co-founder of the Inland Waterways Association Tom Rolt cruised the canals with his colleagues to draw attention to their state of decay. Rolt cruised the length of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal in 1948 in one of the first holiday hire boats, a former wooden cargo boat named Ailsa Craig. In his autobiography, he mentions the “sensational” Bingley five-rise locks and “the long winding 17 miles through the Yorkshire countryside and the market town of Skipton to Gargrave bottom lock.” In our own small way, following in his wake, we liked to think we were continuing this tradition of “use it or lose it”. This hadn’t just been a holiday but a waterways protest of sorts.We moored in Skipton for three nights to enjoy cafes, hikes in woods and dales and canalside pubs with real ale and folk music. It turns out that a wide-beam boat with a wood-burning stove makes for a unique holiday base. On our voyage back to Silsden, the winter sun did indeed shine brightly. By the time we moored up, we had cruised 23 miles and negotiated 28 movable swing-bridges and six locks in a week. The holiday was the journey, not the destination.Paul Miles was a guest ofsilsdenboats.co.uk, one of few companies that hires boats year-round. A week for four on a wide beam in February costs from£1,300. The Canal & River Trust carries out scheduled maintenance in winter.

In truth, however, it is both: soothingly starchy and deliciously savoury. My take on this classic dish makes no claim to be the one true Carcassone, Castelnaudary or Toulouse cassoulet, but it is worth your time.Soak8 hr+Prep15 minCook4 hr 15 minServes6-8800g dried haricot beans1 onion, peeled and halved1 head of garlic, left whole and unpeeled, plus 4 peeled garlic cloves, roughly chopped2 fresh thyme sprigs1 bay leaf1kg bone-in pork belly, or lamb breast2 confit duck legs, plus their fat4 garlicky Toulouse sausagesSalt and black pepper300ml white wine120g dried breadcrumbs1 Soak the dried beansView image in fullscreenHaricot are preferable here, and you can get some lovely heirloom French varieties online, but if need be dried cannellini or other white beans will do. Put the beans in a large, ovenproof pot, cover with cold water and soak for at least eight hours; I’m afraid this is one recipe where tinned shortcuts just won’t cut the mustard.2 A note on the meatIf you don’t eat pork, then substitute lamb breast for the pork belly and sausages as appropriate; ideally, though, use something that’s relatively fatty and mildly spiced (there’s a decent-looking quickvegetarian recipeon the Gourmet magazine website to which you could add meat-free sausages, for example). Toulouse sausages and confit duck are both easily found in large supermarkets, delis and online; Pipers Farm sellsfree-range confit duck.3 Cook the soaked beans and meatView image in fullscreenDrain the soaked beans and return them to the pot. Pour in cold water to cover by about 3cm, then add the halved onion, garlic head, herbs and pork belly. Bring to a boil (you may at this stage need to remove some water, but top it up during cooking). Cover and simmer for about two hours, until the beans are just tender.4 Fry the duck and sausagesView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, melt some of the fat from the duck confit in a frying pan on a medium-high heat, then fry the duck and sausages separately until the duck skin is crisp and both are golden all over.Transfer the duck and sausages to a plate and set aside the frying pan and the rest of the duck fat, both of which will be used to make the topping later. Once cooled, cut the sausages into large chunks and strip generous pieces of the meat off the duck legs.5 Drain the beansView image in fullscreenOnce the beans are cooked through, but still firm and holding their shape, scoop out the pork belly and cut it into bite-size pieces; discard any bones, as well as the onion halves and herbs, but not the garlic.Drain the beans into a heatproof bowl, retaining the liquid separately; keep the pot they were cooked in.6 Mash the garlic and duck fatView image in fullscreenSqueeze the cooked garlic cloves out of their skins and into a bowl, add four tablespoons of the reserved duck fat and the remaining four peeled and chopped garlic cloves, and mash to a paste.Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3 (you can cook this on a low heat on the hob, if you prefer, but it’ll brown better and be easier to look after in the oven).7 Build the cassouletView image in fullscreenGrease the base of the pot with a little of the garlicky duck fat mix, then tip in the beans, meats and all but a tablespoon of the remaining garlicky duck fat mix, plus any jelly from the confit jar or tin.Lightly season and mix well, then pour in the reserved bean cooking liquid and the wine; if there’s not enough liquid to cover the beans, top up with a little water.View image in fullscreen8 Top with breadcrumbs, then bakeView image in fullscreenFry the breadcrumbs briefly in the reserved tablespoon of duck fat, just to coat, then scatter a thin layer over the top of the cassoulet (don’t use them all).Bake uncovered for about two hours, keeping a beady eye on the pot: once a crust has formed, stir this into the bean mix, top with more fried breadcrumbs, and bake until you end up with a thick, golden topping.9 Cool a little, then serveView image in fullscreenLeave to cool to warm before serving, preferably with a green salad to follow (or even, though very untraditionally, alongside). Note that you can make the cassoulet a couple of days ahead of time and reheat it in a low oven, topping up the liquid, if required. It also freezes well, so it’s worth making it in this quantity, even if you’re serving a smaller number of people.Explore more on these topicsFrench food and drinkFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodWinter food and drinkStewPorkDuckSausagesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have oldtraditionsof preserving and of cooking with seasonal fruit and vegetables, influenced by observing 180 days of fasting annually (fortunately not all in a row). Even when we do cook with meat or fish, our dishes often feature spring onions, leeks, chard, spinach, courgettes, aubergines and tomatoes, and there are constant culinary nods to the Roman empire, too: leeks, so loved by the Romans, are the culinary symbol of Oltenia in the south of the country; we still bake ash bread under a dome-shaped earthenware lid called atestum, known locally as ațest, much as they did in Pompeii; we add vinegar, a Roman favourite, to our soups; and we uselotsof lovage and parsley, which flavoured many ancient Roman dishes. But the similarities stop at garlic, which Romans hated, and which we love.Mâncare de praz cu mӑsline(leek stew with olives – pictured top)Dishes with leeks have dual nationality in my family. My grandfather, Gheorghe, was from Oltenia, where leeks are considered a culinary symbol, and I now live in Wales, where they play a similar role. What a coincidence! This stew is very popular, especially during Lent (during which event we skip the wine), and I love it for its sweet-tangy notes. It’s usually served with bread, butburghul wheatand rice are also common south of the Danube.Prep10 minCook50 minServes4Sunflower oil, for frying2 large leeks, washed and cut into rounds, green tops includedSalt andblack pepper1 tsp coriander seeds50ml white wine200mlvegetable stock2400g tins chopped tomatoes250gmixed olives, plain or marinatedZest and juice of 2 lemonsCover the base of a large frying pan with a thin layer of oil and heat well.

Add the stock and chopped tomatoes, turn down the heat to medium-low and carry on cooking for 15 minutes; if you like, cover the pan, in which case reduce the heat even more so it cooks at a very gentle bubble.Stir in the olives, lemon zest and juice, cook for five minutes more, then adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve with bread, burghul wheat or rice.Papricaș de pește(fish paprikash with egg dumplings)View image in fullscreenIrina Georgescu’spapricaș de pește– fish paprikash with egg dumplings.When people hear the wordpapricaș, they immediately think of the famous Hungarian chicken dish with tomatoes and paprika, yet you find carp or catfish paprikash in many traditional restaurants in Budapest, the country’s majestic capital city. It is usually served withnokeldi, a German term popular in central and eastern Europe to describe any type of dumpling.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4Sunflower oil, for frying2 medium brown onions, peeled and thinly slicedSalt and black pepper2tsp smoked or sweet paprika300mlfish stock, or vegetable stock400g tinned finely chopped tomatoes, or passata if you prefer a smoother sauce100gcreme fraiche1 green bell pepper, or Turkish pepper, pith and seeds removed, flesh sliced, to finish (optional)For the dumplings250gplainflour2 large eggs1tsp salt, plus extra for cookingFor the fishSunflower oil, for frying4 medium sustainably sourced cod loins, or similar white fishPut a thin layer of oil in a saute pan or casserole dish for which you have a lid, and set it over a medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Quickly stir in the paprika, so it doesn’t catch and burn, then pour in the stock and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat to low, and adjust the seasoning to taste.Combine all the dumpling ingredients in a medium bowl, then mix in 100ml cold water. Bring a large pan of well-salted water to a boil, then dip a teaspoon into the hot water and use it to start scooping up small amounts of the dumpling mix and dropping them into the hot water – half a teaspoon is usually a good size, but don’t worry if you make them larger. Put as many dumplings as possible in the pan of water so that they drop to the base of the pan in a single layer, then boil for about three or four minutes, until they pop up to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked dumplings to the pot of paprikash sauce, stir to coat in the sauce, then repeat with the remaining dumpling mixture. Stir the creme fraiche into the sauce and keep warm on a low heat.Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan large enough to accommodate all the fish, then pat the fish dry and fry for a couple of minutes on each side, until just cooked through. Break the fish into large flakes, then tuck these in among the dumplings. Serve with the sliced green pepper, if using, on top.These recipes are edited extracts from Danube: Recipes and Stories from Eastern Europe, by Irina Georgescu, published by Hardie Grant at £28.
