But is the world now too grim to read about–and are podcasters taking the place of authors?Emma LoffhagenWed 17 Dec 2025 10.41 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 11.53 ESTShareIn the decade leading up to the pandemic, nonfiction seemed unstoppable. Readers flocked to books that explained a world upended by Brexit, Trump, #MeToo and climate upheaval. Titles such as Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny, Caroline Criado-Perez’s Invisible Women, and Robin D’Angelo’s White Fragility soared up the charts. It felt as though reading itself was part of the civic response, a way to understand what was happening, and perhaps influence what might happen next.Fast forward to the present day, and the picture is starting to look different: a recent report from NielsenIQ found that trade nonfiction sales have slipped sharply. In volume terms, thecategory is down 8.4%between last summer and the same period this year – nearly double the decline in paperback fiction – and down 4.7% in value. Though there have been some exceptions, such Chloe Dalton’s Raising Hare and Want by Gillian Anderson, 14 out of 18 nonfiction subcategories have contracted.Anecdotally, authors are feeling the pinch. After receiving a slew of rejections for a nonfiction proposal, one writer told me the feedback from publishers was that “nonfiction just isn’t selling”. Another has pivoted from nonfiction to fiction on her agent’s advice because “it’s hell out there”. A third told me that he’d heard publishers have soured on any nonfiction that isn’t “Hollywood friendly”–ie made-for-TV memoirs.Speaking to publishing insiders and readers, one word that cropped up repeatedly was escapism. The world is exhausting, so readers are seeking refuge rather than clarity. Some are disillusioned; the voracious reading of the past decade didn’t transform the world as many hoped. “I think there is definitely a sense of fatigue,” says Holly Harley, head of nonfiction at publisher Head of Zeus. “The news is terrible. People feel overloaded. That escapism is why we’re seeing such a rise in romantasy.”Emily Ash Powell, journalist and host of a writing club, agrees. “Things feel so bleak right now in our own lives that people want to escape a little bit and borrow the lives of others,” she says. For Harley, this is also where the legacy of 2020 cuts sharply. “It’s awful, but a lot of the trend-led interest in social justice has fallen away,” she says.In the months following the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, the UK saw a56% rise in salesof books by writers of colour in the year to 2021, and Reni Eddo-Lodge became the first Black British author totop the UK nonfiction chart. But that momentum stalled – in fact, alater analysisby The Bookseller found the post-BLM boom “failed to result in the promised broadening of publishing’s output”.View image in fullscreenA protester reads Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race during a Black Lives Matter march at Trafalgar Square in May 2020.Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images“I used to work at the publisher who published How to Argue With a Racist,” Adam Rutherford’s 2020 book, Harley says. “It had this vertiginous rise – and then it dropped off. You wouldn’t expect that for a bestseller.”According to some authors, though, the problem is not one of demand but supply: are we simply publishing less high-quality nonfiction?The industry “has become so risk-averse that everything they publish is boring,” one novelist, who wished to remain anonymous, tells me. “I read old nonfiction – narrative-driven, proper essay collections. But almost all new stuff is pop politics or this really jargon-heavy writing on niche topics – the history of resistance through food, or whatever. Like, who’s talking about that in the pub?”Another author says part of the problem is too many books being commissioned because of follower counts rather than ideas. “A lot of the nonfiction being commissioned at the moment is essentially people capitalising on those with large followings,” she says. “It feels very Instagram-coded. Did this need to be a book? Or could it have been a caption?”Nonfiction is increasingly competing with a glut of free – and often excellent – information elsewhere. Online video essays dissect politics and psychology in 20 minutes, while The Rest Is … behemoth has turned public intellectualism into bite-size chunks of entertainment. Why spend £15 on a book about one issue when a few podcasts can explain it on your commute? It’s certainly a hard sell for nonfiction publishers.“Podcasts are in direct competition with nonfiction,” Harley admits. “Publishers have to be more agile.”Powell agrees. “We’re so overloaded with content that [other media] almost ticks the box of nonfiction learning,” she says. “People feel they can get the same insight without wading through a book.”The shift to audio, however, doesn’t necessarily mean an abandonment of nonfiction books. Audiobook sales have boomed; the share of nonfiction purchases in audio versus other formats hasnearly doubledin five years, with 25- to 44-year-olds driving the trend. “Some authors now do four or five times their physical sales in audio,” says Harley.Caroline Sanderson, a veteran nonfiction editor, adds a note of nuance. “There has long been an ecosystem going on here where these things support one another,” she says. “So the popularity of The Rest Is History podcast, for example, undoubtedly boosts sales of Dominic Sandbrook and Tom Holland’s nonfiction. Ditto Rory Stewart with The Rest Is Politics.”It’s important to remember, too, what Harley describes as the “feast and famine” nature of publishing. “Since the pandemic, there haven’t been any runaway bestsellers that have led a group or subject class to spring up.” In contrast, past big sellers have included the likes of Bill Bryson with A Short History of Nearly Everything, and Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens, the blockbuster success of which helped define nonfiction markets in the 00s and 2010s.And indeed, some subgenres seem to be holding their ground, or even growing. Biography and autobiography remain powerful, as do health, pop psychology and “smart thinking” titles, such as this year’s hit from Mel Robbins, The Let Them Theory.The surge in self-help and personal development titles suggests a broader cultural shift: as interest in political or social justice books cools, readers increasingly reach for personal betterment instead.For Sanderson, the biggest mistake is assuming nonfiction is a single organism. “The success of one book can change the whole picture. Nobody talked about the decline of nonfiction the year Prince Harry’s Spare was published.”Harley concurs. “There are a few years in the last 20 where you get double-digit growth, and every time it’s because of one or two massive books. The drop-off between those blockbusters and what we call the mid-list is more stark now. Books either blow the doors off – or they sell weakly.”What troubles Sanderson isn’t the sales cycle but the long game – as books increasingly come under fire with bans in the US and rising political pressures on education and libraries worldwide, the importance of defending rigorous, long-form nonfiction as a tool for critical thinking has never been clearer. “Regardless of sales, I hold passionately to the importance of long-form nonfiction in helping us understand the world,” she says. “We need it. Sales fluctuations are the weather; it’s the climate we need to worry about.”Explore more on these topicsBooksBiography booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A good one at that. MPs from most corners of the Commons even laughed. Genuine laughter. Not the contrived partisan guffaws you usually get at prime minister’s questions that makes the public howl in despair.OK, we can take issue with the delivery. Starmer has next to no grasp of comic timing. Any gag takes its life in its own hands when Keir is around. Most are dead on arrival. But let’s not be too picky. It was still a black swan event. A genuine rarity.He can’t help not having much of a sense of humour. That’s the luck of the draw at birth. Keir is naturally disposed to be dull. To be literal. To take things at face value. And let’s be thankful for that. We had more than enough of comedians running the show under the Tories to last a lifetime. Take a bow, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.So yes, the gag could have worked even better. Possibly even brought proceedings to a standstill for a couple of minutes. But it was still a landmark moment. Not just for Starmer, but for PMQs. The Commons is a notorious graveyard for wannabe comedians. A place where bad gags come to die. Where MPs discover they aren’t quite as sharp and witty as they imagine themselves to be. The funniest moments in the chamber are almost invariably unintentional. Not least when members start to take themselves desperately seriously.Let’s hear it for the joke, then. It came near the start during Starmer’s opening monologue. Having addressed the serious stuff of antisemitism, Keir wished everyone a happy Christmas in his last Commons appearance of the year. And in the spirit of goodwill to all men – and all women – he had this advice to Reform: “If mysterious men appear from the east bearing gifts, this time report it to the police.”Weirdly, the only person who didn’t seem to find this funny was Nigel Farage. Perhaps he still can’t quite see what the problem is with taking bribes from the Russians – believes thatNathan Gillhas been hard done by. Instead, Nige looked stony-faced as he sat in his new, favourite place in the Commons. The gallery that runs the length of the chamber above the government benches. AKA the Special Gallery.We wondered at first if this was all some elaborate setup. That Nige had only taken up residence there so that Reform MPs could shout “He’s behind you!” when a dopeyLabourbackbencher observed that Farage was nowhere to be seen. But that would have been one hell of a lot of trouble for a one bite, pantomime laugh.So the most likely reason for Nige’s non-appearance in the chamber is that he is having a monumental sulk. He just can’t bring himself to accept that the Commons rules only allow him a single question once every six weeks or so. He takes it as an affront to his narcissism. If Nige had his way, he would take centre stage every week. MPs of his own and other parties only exist as satellites orbiting his ego. When he dies, the world dies with him. What makes this even worse for him is that literally no one else cares if Nige is having a strop. The one thing the Reform leader can’t bear is to be ignored.Buoyed by the unexpected success of his three wise men gag, Keir chose to double down on Reform. Noticing that Sarah Pochin had made a rare appearance in the Commons, he said he hoped she got the white Christmas she desired so dearly.Poor Sarah! It’s not her fault that she can’t help projectile vomiting every time she sees a brown or black face in an advert. I doubt we’ll be seeing Sarah again any time soon. She can’t take too much of this. Too many black and brown faces on the Labour benches.There was also just time for Starmer to fire one last arrow at Nigel. Christmas was a time of forgiveness, he said. So, following on from the letterpublished by the Guardian on Wednesday, perhaps Nige would like to make an apology to the former Dulwich boys he allegedly racially abused. Judging by his expression, saying sorry was the last thing on his mind.If Nige had been in a bad mood before, he was furious now. Any apology would be the thin end of the wedge.Après moi, le déluge. There was no way of knowing where all this could end. Deny, deny, deny. It was old news. Here was the Commons condemning an attack on Jews at Bondi,while the Reform leader had been accused of once having said: “Hitler was right.”As for the rest of PMQs, it was pretty much a non-event. Starmer andKemi Badenochtrading bad Christmas cracker puns to no great effect. As though neither really had their heart in it. Kemi would be the most likely one to be offered a job in panto, with her third-rate innuendo that invariably telegraphs the punchline minutes in advance, but this wasn’t a show anyone would pay good money to see. Rather it was a bloodless endurance contest.Kemi tried to go in on Starmer’s remarks to the liaison committee on Monday about the levers of government not working as they should – almost an admission the government was in effect ungovernable – but this wasn’t the best day for this asKeir had just had a big win on the Erasmus scheme.The Tory leader ignored this. She can no longer quite work out whether she is pro- or anti-Brexit. Though she does have a kneejerk aversion to young people working inside the EU. Fraternising with the enemy.It was left to Starmer to have the final word. He had picked up on an interview the shadow transport secretary, Richard Holden, had given in which he had dismissed most of the shadow cabinet as a bunch of nonentities. This could just be the first time Rich has inadvertently been right about anything, but it hasn’t gone down well with many of his colleagues.I guess it takes a nonentity to know a nonentity. His therapist will have their work cut out to nail down if this was a moment of denial or self-acceptance. Maybe it was just a cry for help and he could do with a break. As do we all.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchReform UKNigel FarageKemi BadenochLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Every birthday and holiday, they manage to select exactly what the recipient wanted – or didn’t know they wanted.I didn’t inherit this gene.Inevitably, I wait until the last minute, panic and buy something totally random. My parents’ closets (and, I assume, trash cans) are full of my misguided offerings: a Lego orchid, hair masks, a woodworking kit.But I yearn to be a good gift giver. I want to make my friends and family feel seen, appreciated, and also impressed by how thoughtful and wonderful I am.Many people struggle because holidays are marketed as a time for giving, and the idea that consumption leads to happiness, says Emma Seppälä, psychologist and lecturer in management at Yale University. But research shows that getting, say, a new iPad, only leads to a short burst of dopamine, the brain’s so-called “feelgood” chemical. “It doesn’t lead to the lasting happiness anyone’s looking for,” Seppälä says.This constant consumption also has serious environmental and ethical consequences. Lots of presents end up being “more plastic crap that’s going to go in a landfill,” Seppälä says.Here’s how to find gifts that will please your loved ones and stay out of the trash.The 175 best holiday gift ideas for 2025, vetted by the Guardian US staffRead moreWhy do people exchange gifts?Gift giving is “likely to be as old as humanity itself”, according to historical preservation charityEnglish Heritage.In the earliest human groups, gifts were a way to “ensure mutual well-being and growth,” and to “build friendship and connections,”writesDr Alan Fowler, honorary professor of African philanthropy at the University of Witswatersrand in South Africa. It also helped create “loyalty and respect” in relationships, and could serve to “prevent what might otherwise be hostile relationships”, he explains. Think of the Real Housewives bringing their nemeses along on expensive trips in a supposed attempt to heal the rifts between them.An equally powerful practice soon followed: judging gifts and their giver.In ancient Rome, choosing the right gift was important. PerEnglish Heritage, “token gifts of low value were a measure of the high esteem you had for a friend,” whereas expensive gifts “were a sign you were trying too hard.”With such a fraught history, it’s no wonder choosing the right gift can feel difficult. A good gift “can reflect love, gratitude or shared memories,” while a bad one can “create stress or obligations for both the giver and the receiver,”writesassociate professor of marketing Dr Alisa Minina Jeunemaitre.How do you choose the right gift for someone?“Good gifting really comes down to paying attention,” says Oluwakemi Ajibare, personal stylist and founder of StyledByKemi.People often drop small hints without realizing it, she says. Are there certain colors they gravitate to, or a need they’ve mentioned more than once? “The most thoughtful gifts come from listening,” Ajibare says.For example, Ajibare says her favorite gift she ever received was a year-long subscription to one of her favorite fashion magazines from one of her friends. “It wasn’t expensive or extravagant, but it was so thoughtful,” Ajibare says. “She remembered something I genuinely enjoyed.”Similarly, Eleonora Maso, founder of a gift consultancy service, says the secret to finding a good gift is to “stop thinking about the gift, and start thinking about the person.” Maso considers four elements when planning a gift:What do people talk about when they’re not trying to impress you? What are their genuine interests, passions and concerns?Notice their lifestyle, Maso says: “How they live, what they value, where they unwind.”Choose something that “reflects their world, not yours”. Did I want a Lego orchid? Yes. Did my father? No.Add a touch of the unexpected. “The best gifts always have a little, ‘I didn’t know I needed this, but it’s so me!’ moment,” Maso says.What are the most common mistakes when choosing a gift?Experts agree we often choose gifts based on what we think is cool rather than what the intended recipient might want.“It’s easy to default to what we like, but that’s how people end up with random items they’ll never use,” says Ajibare.We are even more likely to do this when we wait until the last minute instead of planning ahead. That’s when people “grab something convenient instead of something meaningful”, Ajibare says.Another common mistake is confusing an expensive gift with an impressive one, says Maso. “A costly gift given without intention feels like a transaction,” she says. “A simple gift chosen with precision feels like affection.”19 unique small business gifts that beat predictable US big brandsRead moreHow do you give gifts more responsibly?As Seppälä notes, there are far more serious consequences to wasteful gifting-giving than a disappointed loved one. According to the USEnvironmental Protection Agency, the amount of household garbage produced in the United States increases 25% between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Americans also throw awayan estimated 2.6bn lbsof wrapping paper every year.There’s a human cost too. “As demand for products skyrockets, pressure builds for factory workers worldwide,” the UK’sBig Issuemagazine reported in 2024, adding that many of these workers face poor pay, abuse and dangerous working conditions.One can try to shop ethically, Seppälä says. She recommends browsing sites that feature vintage or independent makers, like Etsy, or shopping locally. You can also look for fair trade products, though she acknowledges this system isfar from perfect.Don’t let “perfect” be the enemy of “good”. “Just do your best,” Seppälä says.Finally, have conversations with loved ones about what you all really want.“Connect on values,” she says. If the value of gift exchanges is that they bring people together, consider planning a trip instead. Or if you want to bring one another joy, consider what will actually accomplish that.Research has shown that “happiness does not come from ‘stuff’,” Seppälä says. What leads to lasting contentment are things like service, meditation and time in nature – a hike or a subscription to a meditation app could make someone happier for longer than another turtleneck.But if all someone really wants is another turtleneck? “What are you going to do?” Seppälä says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyShareReuse this content"

I couldn’t disagree moreWed 17 Dec 2025 12.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 13.00 ESTShareIwant to believe in reincarnation because I want to come back asPaul Mescal. What it must be like to be irresistible. I’m sure it gets wearing, but I’d still like to give it a try, just for research purposes. Not so much for the carnal stuff, but for the way every word he utters is taken to be as beautiful as he is. Intoxicated by their admiration, his admirers leap headfirst into the still waters of his pronouncements apparently certain of hidden depths thereunder.So it has been with the reaction to how he comforted his director when she confessed, in so many words, that she couldn’t always grasp what Shakespeare was on about. We’ve all been there. At least I have. There there, quoth Mescal: “Listen, if Shakespeare is performed right, you don’t have to understand what they’re saying. You feel it in the body, the language is written like that.”You know what that is, don’t you? That’s balls, that’s what that is. Of course you need to understand what’s being said and what’s going on. At least I do. I’ve often been told not to trouble myself with such trifling details. Just let the artistry wash over you, I’m told, and consider how it makes mefeel.Well, I’ll tell you how it makes mefeel.It makes mefeelconfused, rather inadequate, frustrated, even angry, ultimately disengaged and therefore bored. Just plain bored.It’s different with visual art, despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that I know nowt about it. Here it is liberating to be able to just stand there and take in a picture or sculpture or installation of some kind and see how it makes me, yes, feel. But withplays, films and TV shows, I need more. If I can’t understand the words I’m unlikely to understand the plot, and if I can’t understand the plot I’ll have no interest in the words anyway. Somerset Maugham wrote that the plot is “a lifeline which the author throws to the reader in order to hold his interest”. And there I sit, for want of that lifeline, not waving but drowning in a sea of confusion.If Mescal feels the truth of something in his beautiful bones then so it shall surely beI’ve been told I’m being too literal to appreciate what I’m watching. But that, ironically, is too literal an interpretation of what I’m saying. I don’t need to understand every word, every sentence, the relevance of every plot twist, to piece together what’s happening and give me a reason to stick with it. There ought to be something available like the directors’ commentaries you occasionally got as an extra on DVDs, just a kind, non-judgmental voice explaining things, talking you through it, holding your hand, perhaps via an earpiece so as not to disturb whoever you have beside you on the sofa.Why are today’s TV dramas so devastatingly difficult to follow? | Adrian ChilesRead moreGoing back to Mescal, to be fair to the lad we’re only going byHamnet director Chloé Zhao’s recollection of what he said. But if her memory is not playing tricks I suspect “You feel it in the body” was the intellectual clincher. Once he had said that, he could have got away with just about any proposition he offered. Because if Mescal feels the truth of something in his beautiful bones – the coming of a storm, what Ulysses is talking about in Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida, all seven winners at Haydock on Saturday, whatever – then so it shall surely be.I wonder if the truth was that the actor himself couldn’t make head or tail of the script, either. In which case you can imagine the poor chap’s panic when the director said she wasn’t clear on some of the language. “Shite! Oh no, she’s going to ask me to explain it. Aaargh. What am I gonna do? Ah, there’s nothing for it, I’ll have to play the feel-it-in-my-body card. Never failed me yet.” Got to respect that.

In Marty Supreme, he plays a character loosely based on a former two-time US men’s singles table tennis champion. In A Complete Unknown, he played Bob Dylan at the exact moment he decided to reshape all of pop culture in his own image. His upcoming third Dune film is based on a book that is literally called Messiah. So whenTimothée Chalametsingles out a figure for greatness, understand that the greatness is warranted.Which is a roundabout way of saying that Timothée Chalamet thinksSusan Boyleis great. Not only great, but one of the greatest Britons to have ever lived.Ina recent interview with the BBC, Chalamet was asked to list his favourite British people. After naming David and Victoria Beckham, Lewis Hamilton and Fakemink (a rapper who has worked with EsDeeKid, a performer some suspect is Chalamet in disguise). And then he named Susan Boyle. As the interviewer laughed in surprise, Chalamet clarified his choice. “She dreamt big,” he said. “She dreamt bigger than all of us. Who wasn’t moved by that? I remember it like it was yesterday.”Susan Boyle, for those of you without hearts, is a singer who shot to fame after auditioning for Britain’s Got Talent in 2009. The clip of her audition went viral because people could not comprehend the sheer disparity between her appearance (a normal middle-aged woman) and her singing voice (loud and impassioned). Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, sold 10 million copies. A musical was made about her journey. Fox bought the film rights. She reportedly has a net worth of £22 million.‘I fear electromagnetic catastrophe’: Josh Safdie on Marty Supreme, latent Jewish anxiety and why men are lostRead moreAll of which constitutes a stunning achievement. However, the bigger question is:really?To be clear, Susan Boyle is undoubtedly a great example of British talent. But does Timothée Chalamet really believe that, or is he just messing about for clicks?This is becoming a bit of an issue with Timothée Chalamet. He seems to perpetually live in an emotional hinterland where nobody can quite discern his proper level of sincerity. For example, he recently promoted Marty Supreme with what sounded like a Trumpian level of self-aggrandisement, telling an interviewer that “It’s been like seven, eight years that I’ve been handing in really, really committed top-of-the-line performances … This is really some top-level shit.”Taken on the surface, this seems like something that could scuttle a career. It paints him as an insular, out-of-touch, grandstanding blowhard, and it’s hard to reward that sort of person with an award. The fact that the clip of the interview has since been deleted from YouTube suggests that this might be the case.But on the other hand, come on, this is Timothée Chalamet we’re talking about. It’s the guy who rides Lime bikes to his premieres. It’s the guy who enters his own lookalike competitions. It’s the guy who, at the very least, refuses to deny conspiracy theories that he’s actually a scouse rapper in a balaclava. So surely the fact that he’d choose to act like a self-important windbag while promoting a film where he plays a self-important windbag would be entirely in keeping with his personality – and of apiece with the press tour today.Which brings us back to Susan Boyle. Really and truly, there is only one way for anyone to know if Timothée Chalamet does actually love Boyle, or whether it’s just another one of his faux-sincere ironic performance art pranks. And for this I need to call upon my entire journalistic brethren.Interviewers, please, when you are granted time with Timothée Chalamet, I urge you to only ask him questions about Susan Boyle. Ask him what his five favourite songs of hers are. Ask him who directed the video for her cover version of Lou Reed’s Perfect Day. Ask him what he thinks of the ethical implications of her decision to duet with Elvis Presley on her rendition of O Come All Ye Faithful. See if he knows the name of the act that ultimately beat her on Britain’s Got Talent. What Susan Boyle merch does he have? How many times has he seen her live?Only this level of rigorous, evidence-based journalism will be able to help us get to the bottom of this. In fact, you know what? Let Timothée Chalamet talk to me about this. Let me set him a quickfire Susan Boyle trivia round face to face. I’m being serious. The people need to know because, if Chalamet has really just decided to take Susan Boyle’s name in vain for clicks, then god help us all.Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametSusan BoylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when she was spotted with two cubs of roughly the same age last month, they realized they were witnessing an exceedingly rare case of adoption.“Female polar bears are really good moms and so they’re just primed for looking after and caring for their offspring,” said Evan Richardson, a research scientist with Environment and Climate ChangeCanada. “We think if there’s a little cub that’s bawling on the coast and has lost its mother, these females just can’t help themselves but to take them on and look after them. It’s a really curious behaviour and an interesting aspect of polar bear life history.”Changes to polar bear DNA could help them adapt to global heating, study findsRead moreThe mother, known to scientists as bear X33991, and the cubs are part of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation, which is among the most studied in the world, with scientists documenting their feeding habits and movements for nearly half a century. Of the 4,600 bears studied over the years, the adoption is only the 13th ever witnessed in the population.“Polar bear adoptions are very rare and unusual and we don’t know why they happen,” said Alysa McCall, of Polar Bears International, calling it an “amazing” sight to witness.The two cubs, which appear healthy and well-nourished are believed to be 10 or 11 months old and are expected to stay with their mother for another 1.5 years.GPS data show the three bears are already on the sea ice. The cubs will rely on their mother to catch seals and often share in the food she provides or teaches them to eat. They will stick close by and gradually learn the skills needed to survive in a harsh but at times bountiful environment.A winter spent on the ice hunting for prey – and months in the summer without any food – are a difficult existence for even the hardiest bears. Half of all cubs born won’t make it to adulthood.8:40How scientists capture a polar bear – videoBut experts say having a mother now gives the adopted cub a far greater chance of surviving. Still of the 13 cases documented over 45 years, only three have survived.Researchers plan to study genetic samples from the cub to determine if the mother is known to them, and could still be alive. In some previous adoption cases, biological mothers were still alive and a “switching of litters” had occurred, rather than the cub being orphaned.“We might never know what happened to the mother,” said McCall. “When we confirmed this was an adoption, I had a lot of mixed feelings. But it’s just another reason why this species is so incredible and why they’re so fascinating and interesting. It gives you a lot of hope when you realize that maybe, polar bears are looking out for each other.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The deal was paused after the US claimed a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.It has also emerged that concessions to British farmers made in the first tariff deal with Trump, which were hailed as “historic” byKeir Starmerin May, have yet to be signed off by the US despite a looming January deadline.US puts £31bn tech ‘prosperity deal’ with Britain on iceRead moreThe health department said that negotiators were now thrashing out the detailed agreement on the pharmaceutical deal. Asked to provide the headline terms, the departmentshared its press releasehailing the “landmark UK-US pharmaceuticals deal” and a link to theequivalent US government announcementof an “agreement in principle” on pharmaceutical pricing.Critics have noted that the two releases describe the deal in sharply different terms. The British release describes the UK as “the only country in the world to secure a 0% tariff on pharmaceuticals to the US”, while the American one largely focuses on how the NHS will have to pay 25% more for new medicines.David Henig, a trade expert, said: “There is a serious risk that the UK government has made commitments to raise drug prices in return for nothing more than a verbal promise from President Trump around zero tariffs, when we know he has form for not honouring his word.“The role of private companies in possibly working with the US administration to coerce the UK government by threatening to withdraw investments is also a big worry. None of this is normal in international trade policy and the government needs to explain both this deal and how such things will be avoided in the future.”Ordinarily, negotiators would sign a provisional legal text, which would then go through detailed checks on both sides, but none exists yet with the US on pharmaceuticals.Ministers privately told the Guardian there were concerns that the government’s agreements with the US were flimsy and unreliable.One said there was a concern that the UK’s series of agreements with theTrump administrationwere “built on sand”. Another said this instability was the “new normal now in our relationship across the pond” with “additional layers of volatility and unpredictability in the system”.Layla Moran, who chairs the health select committee, said: “The only thing more surprising than Trump’s tween-level temper tantrums is the UK government’s naive belief that his administration is a good faith actor. The NHS is too precious to be gambled with and the concern now is whether the deal that could already cost the UK taxpayer billions could end up costing a lot more if it collapses in chaos.”Liam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, said ministers had to focus on getting the tech prosperity deal “back on track”.Government figures downplayed the chances of the US reneging on the pharma deal, which took weeks longer to finalise than expected. One source said the US pharmaceutical industry had been pushing for the agreement as they wanted certainty on imports and drug prices, while by comparison the tech prosperity deal “was always quite abstract”.Officials admit that, more broadly, volatility is part and parcel of dealing with the Trump administration. But they note that through the deals it has signed, the UK has secured concrete outcomes for businesses.“The fact we have 25% steel tariffs, and that’s better than the rest of the world, is not flimsy. The same thing with our auto rate,” one official said. “We are in a more competitive position than other major economies.”Issues have emerged in the implementation of thelandmark US-UK tariff deal agreed last May, however, with quotas on beef exports that were due to kick in next month still not formally approved.Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our understanding is that the US has not yet signed off the 13,000 reciprocal tariff rate quota. With the US already having access to our beef market for non-hormone treated beef, we are pushing to make sure UK beef producers can access the reciprocal quota from 1 January as agreed.“This is particularly important as we know there is still great pressure from other sectors of the economy to reopen US negotiations, and that our government is looking at what more can be done with the US. We urge the government to keep pushing to get the reciprocal quota over the line before the end of the year to ensure it can’t continue to be used as a bargaining chip.”Trump’s latest tariff threat raises concerns for UK pharmaceuticalsRead moreApart from introducing a 10% tariff on most British exports – lower than the rate paid by other countries – the deal was to “remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium, reducing them to zero”. This aspect of the agreement has not materialised, with tariffs on British steel remaining at 25%,although other countries pay a rate of 50%.One industry leader said the discussions on steel tariffs “were not going anywhere” but that they considered this week’s bump in the road to be a matter of the “US blustering because of frustration with the UK not moving fast enough in other areas”.The US informed the UK it was pausing the tech prosperity deal over wider trade disagreements last week before Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, held meetings with senior US officials in Washington, including commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.Several officials said those meetings were “very positive”. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations in January.A government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the trade secretary held talks last week in the US with counterparts to keep up the momentum on implementing all aspects of the UK-US deal so businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continue to feel the benefits.“We have already delivered 0% tariffs for the UK pharma and aerospace sectors and cut auto tariffs to 10% within quota, saving hundreds of millions of pounds on UK exports, with the US confirming changes via federal notices.“The UK is also the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, but we are committed to going further to secure jobs and creating opportunities for businesses, and at the state visit we unveiled commercial deals creating more than 7,600 high-quality jobs and accelerating growth.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyTrump administrationTariffsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.Our teenage son was targeted by a sextortionist online – here’s what we didRead moreSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, whereMetaPlatforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”The lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.It states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.How can parents protect their children from sextortion?Read moreAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.The suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.It also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.Whilefour British parents are suing TikTokfor the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.Cases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.Earlier this year,the Guardian reportedthat children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.The Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.View image in fullscreenMurray Dowey took his own life in December 2023.Photograph: UNPIXS/BBCReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”As well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.Ros said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”Mark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”Instagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.Meta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.In June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.A spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they sign up for Instagram, which means they have to approve any new followers.“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”In the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Behind the closed door of each vehicle is a sick patient, some of whom have been waiting for four hours or more, backed up in the car park, just to get in the door.View image in fullscreenAmbulances stack up outside the emergency department (A&E).Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianRoyal Stoke university hospitalRoyal Stoke university hospitalThe reason they are stuck out here is that there are no beds in the ED – and there is not much corridor space, either. In the tight foyer, a cluster of ambulance staff and a senior nurse in hi-vis are huddled around a computer station. Behind them, a corridor stretches into the ward, where at least six or seven beds are lined up head to toe along one side, each occupied by a patient. Leading off to the left are three more beds and three more strained, watchful patients. Another patient and another bed are to the right.“So … this is busy,” says Morris. “This is not our worst day, but equally … it is a challenge to manage, I would say, today.”View image in fullscreenDeputy medical director Ann-Marie Morris.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt has been a day of huge logistical headaches and considerable personal stress for those working at this large regional NHS hub. The Royal Stoke is absolutely full, with every single usable bed from its total of 1,178 occupied, and a few more besides (as well as the 15 patients being treated in corridors in the ED, 20 more are in the same position in wards elsewhere). The hospital’sOperational Pressure Escalation Level (Opel)risk level stands at 4, the highest possible designation before it would have to declare a critical incident – meaning it could not necessarily deliver all of its services safely.In other words, it is just another winter Tuesday in the NHS. Britain’s national health service is under exceptional pressure this week, with anunprecedented early risein flu cases, rising to the highest case numbers recorded for this week in December, colliding with a five-day strike by resident doctors whichbegan on Wednesday. It has led to apocalyptic language from some health leaders about this year’s “worst ever” winter crisis, warning of a “flu-nami” that one A&E consultant described as a potential “Armageddon”.View image in fullscreenAmbulance and medical staff transport a patient in on a bed.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFor the battle-hardened staff of the Royal Stoke, however, these appear to be just two further complications – significant and unwelcome as they are – in what is already an exhausting “permacrisis”. Yes, winter brings huge challenges, but “it would be fair to say I don’t think we’re ever out of winter,” says Dan Hobby, matron for general surgery. “It almost feels like winter is 12 months a year. We are permanently in winter.”The Guardian has been invited by the University Hospitals of North Midlands trust to spend a day at the Royal Stoke, speaking to staff about how they care for patients while grappling with the sometimes more complex task of managing their progress through thegridlocked system– one bed at a time – to clear a space for others.Royal Stoke university hospitalRoyal Stoke university hospitalStaff in wards across the hospital speak frankly about the hourly challenge of trying to meet huge demand with beds that are definitely finite. Patients praise the care they are receiving from resourceful, dedicated, tired medical professionals.The hospital is not keen to share everything, however. We are stopped at the door of the emergency department and steered away from the crowded area where people are being treated in the corridor. Photographs are out of the question. Corridor care has long been a common practice at many hospitals, but the brutal reality of the NHS’s beds crisis can feel too distressing to expose to others.View image in fullscreenA patient having a non invasive ventilation mask fitted on the respiratory ward. She has motor neurone diseasePhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianIn a tinsel-festooned respiratory ward on an upper floor, Dr Ashwin Rajhan is meeting Raymond Dutton, a 74-year-old former police officer who has motor neurone disease. Dutton has a tracheostomy tube which allows him to breathe but hampers his speech, so he communicates gamely with smiles, gestures and by writing on a smartphone, while the machine keeping him alive hisses in the background.View image in fullscreenRaymond Dutton, a former police officer, 74, communicates with a nurse using text on a smartphone.Rajhan, one of 18 respiratory consultants, says the flu spike presents a particular risk for vulnerable patients such as Dutton, and has put side rooms where patients can be isolated at a particular premium across the hospital. “We are seeing quite a number of flu patients but, thankfully, not many are needing critical care admissions,” says Rajhan. The disease’s surge has definitely been a problem in the region – on 6 December, the hospital along with five others in the West Midlandsdeclared a critical incidentover admission numbers – but in the past fortnight “we seem to have plateaued”.The big question is whether an early surge means this winter’s flu will blow over earlier or, as many in the hospital suspect, lead to a second increase after families gather for Christmas. Either way, when the ward is full but beds are needed, resourcefulness is required.“Today was a good example,” says Rajhan. “When we came in the morning, we were told that there were four patients in ED who needed to come to this ward because they needed NIV [non-invasive ventilation].” The 28-bed ward has an NIV capacity of 20; they were already at 21. “So we had to go through all the patients individually, get the physios on board and ask them to see the patients urgently” to get them in a place to leave.View image in fullscreenDr Rajhan talks to Louise Garratt, 61, who was admitted to the respiratory ward 10 days ago with breathing difficulties.The ward’s computers were not working, slowing the process of discharge. “One of the discharge facilitators has physically gone down to another part of the building, dragged the IT person up and, as we speak, he is replacing all the computers.” Every bed the consultant cleared meant another person could be moved from ED, emptying another ambulance and allowing another very unwell person to be collected by paramedics and brought to the hospital for the process to begin again.Such individual bursts of initiative sit alongside a range of levers that clinicians can pull to release steam from the overheating system. “Admission avoidance techniques” include “hot clinics”, where patients are seen as outpatients, and Cris, a community response team that visits patients’ homes to pre-empt emergency admissions. In the hospital, a process called “In-Reach” sees specialist staff from one ward consult patients who have been stuck on another because there is not room for them. After discharge, “virtual ward” sees patients visited at home to follow up on their hospital care.View image in fullscreenTracey Wooton on the critical care ward is a diabetic patient who was admitted three days earlier and is awaiting a transfer to a general medical ward.But institutional gridlock remains one of the hospital’s biggest challenges. On the critical care ward, a major trauma unit whose patients include those who have had cardiothoracic surgery, Tracey Wootton has been waiting for transfer to a general medical ward. The national standard to move on patients like her is four hours; Wootton has been here since Saturday, three days ago.It’s a similar picture on the surgical assessment unit, which covers specialties ranging from ENT to gynaecology. Since being forced to surrender a ward to another department in October, patients now wait three days for a transfer rather than 24 hours. The SAU is a “chaired” unit, meaning patients are assigned loungers. Its capacity is 30; it currently has 55 patients. “So unfortunately patients end up on plastic chairs as well, which isn’t ideal,” says senior staff nurse Molly Merrison.View image in fullscreenPatient Susan Shaw inside the surgical assessment unitRoyal Stoke university hospitalRoyal Stoke university hospitalSenior staff have been sanguine about the resident doctors’ strike, the14th such walkoutin their long-running dispute; others, though, say the impact will be “massive”. “I think from a discharging perspective, because it’s all on computer systems now … how do I put this … if you haven’t got your regular staff they might not know exactly what needs to be done,” says one senior nurse. In other words, the consultants do not know how the computers work to get patients discharged.“It is a learning curve, I can’t deny that,” smiles respiratory consultant Rajhan, “but equally, I find it easier to pick up the phone and speak to another consultant colleague in another department. Yes, I might take more time than going into the computer system to type, but the decision to reach that point is much quicker.”View image in fullscreenDr Rajhan is one of 18 respiratory consultants who work on the respiratory ward.While clinical procedures and treatment decisions have been ongoing all day, in a windowless room at the heart of the hospital, clinical head of operations Becky Ferneyhough and colleagues from the site operations team have been sitting under large computer screens (and strings of fairy lights), monitoring a series of graphs that are measuring the shifting capacity and flow of patients through each ward and hospital department, to allow decisions to be made about moving resources where needed.Four times a day, she meets senior colleagues from across the trust; at the 8.30am meeting on Tuesday, 12 ambulances were waiting outside the ED, one of them for 6 hours; by lunchtime it was eight. We check in again after 5pm. “We have 20 ambulances outside,” says Ferneyhough. “We’ve had a very difficult afternoon.”View image in fullscreenThe respiratory wardPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt must be stressful having these conversations about numbers and resources, when we are talking about real people. “Absolutely, 100%,” she says. “The patient is the most important part of everything that we do and it really is hard work to balance doing the right thing for the patient – but for all of our patients.View image in fullscreenMedical staff in the emergency department (A&E)“It’s not just the patients we’ve got in the hospital, it’s the patients who will be our next patients, who are at home waiting to come in to the hospital.

Emergency services were called to Lime Close shortly before 6.10pm.The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared at Bristol magistrates court on Wednesday charged with her murder. During a brief hearing, he spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.He was remanded into youth detention accommodation before a hearing at Bristol crown court on Friday.The boy was arrested in nearby Worle a short time after the girl was found in Lime Close.On Wednesday, Supt Jen Appleford said: “This remains an incredibly difficult time for Aria’s family, who we continue to support and update around our investigation. It is impossible to adequately describe how traumatic the past 36 hours have been for them and we’d like to reiterate in the strongest possible terms their request for privacy.“The tragic loss of such a young girl has caused a huge amount of shock and upset, with there being a profound sense of loss felt throughout the community. We are working closely with partner agencies and schools across the Weston area to make sure those affected receive access to any support they need.“We are grateful to local residents for the patience shown while we have been carrying out inquiries in the area. This work will need to continue over the next few days, but if anyone has any issues then please do not hesitate to speak to officers on the cordon, who will be happy to help.”Simon Marriott, the chief executive of the Kaleidoscope multi-academy trust, said: “Our school and trust community are devastated and upset by the news of the tragic death of one of our pupils, Aria Thorpe.“We are working with professional agencies to ensure that support is provided to our children, staff and families as they come to terms with what has happened. Our thoughts are with Aria’s family at this very difficult time.”Catherine Gibbons, the deputy leader of North Somerset council, said: “I have been shocked and deeply saddened by the news of Aria’s death. On behalf of everyone at North Somerset council, I offer our sincerest condolences to Aria’s family, friends and the school community.“The pain of losing a child in such tragic circumstances is unimaginable. We are working closely with partner agencies, including schools across the Weston-super-Mare area, to make sure those affected have access to the support and advice they need.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Belgium has voiced concerns about the legality of the scheme and says it will only agree if it has guarantees Euroclear will be reimbursed in full if Russia successfully sues for its money.Russia has publicly warned that utilising the assets would amount to theft and its central bank said it is seeking $230bn in damages from Euroclear in a case brought in the country’s courts. But it is understood the intimidation campaign has been focused on key individuals.Threats have been directed at Valérie Urbain, the chief executive of Euroclear, and other senior executives at the financial services group.View image in fullscreenRussia’s central bank (pictured) said it was seeking $230bn (£170bn) in damages from Euroclear.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesEuroclear declined to comment: “Any potential threats are treated with the utmost priority and investigated deeply, often with the support of authorities as appropriate.”An investigation earlier this month by the news site EUobserverreferenced threats made to Urbainin 2024 and 2025, and that she asked for Belgian police protection. This was denied and she and other companies executives then hired first a Belgian, then a French security firm to provide bodyguards, according to the report.A profile interview of Urbain by Le Monde in November reported that she had beenaccompanied by a bodyguard for more than a year, though she did not comment directly on her security.In early December, Bart De Wever, Belgium’s prime minister, said in an onstage interview withLa Libre newspaper: “And who believes that Putin will calmly accept the confiscation of Russian assets? Moscow has let us know that in the event of a seizure, Belgium and I personally will feel the effects for eternity.”Asked to explain these comments earlier this month, the prime minister’s office referred to previous remarks made by De Wever, describing the legal and financial risks facing western companies.At a press conference in October, De Wever had said: “Moscow has told us that if we touch the money, we would feel the consequences until eternity,” and went on to evoke Russian countermeasures, including confiscation of western money frozen in Russian banks, seizure of western companies and similar decisions from Moscow-friendly jurisdictions.The spokesperson on Wednesday declined to comment on the reported threats against Belgian government ministers or the head of Euroclear, citing safety reasons.A spokesperson for Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, who is also deputy prime minister and has been involved in talks on the reparations loan, said they had “no such information” about threats to him.The UK, which is believed to hold €27bn of Russia’s frozen assets, supports the move to use immobilised funds for Ukraine. Belgium has also been insisting that other countries holding Russian assets, estimated to be worth €290bn worldwide, take similar actions to show solidarity and reduce the legal risk.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, told the businessman Roman Abramovich to release £2.5bn of proceeds from the sale of Chelsea football club in 2022 within 90 days or face legal action. Britain wants all the money to be given to Ukrainian war victims, but the billionaire has said he also wants Russian victims to benefit.Ukrainian officials and experts acknowledge the EU loan is central to maintaining the country’s war effort for the next couple of years. Nataliia Shapoval, the head of the KSE Institute, a Kyiv based economic thinktank, said Ukraine required $50bn in external financing in 2026, but only half of which had already been committed.The economist described the need for fresh international financing as “absolutely critical”. In particular, Ukraine’s defence ministry needed predictable flows of cash to ensure that it could buy weapons at the rates needed and so its armaments industry could make capital investments for the future.Though Ukraine could get through the first quarter of the year without the additional support from the EU, “big problems would arise from quarter two and even more in the second half of the year”, with Kyiv likely forced to cut defence budgets and make difficult trade-offs with social expenditure.Ukrainian officials hope that an EU funding deal could put Russia under medium-term financial pressure. Next year, 38% of Russia’s state budget will go on funding its military, while it is expected to end this year with a budget gap of about $70bn (£52bn), according to Shapoval.Explore more on these topicsRussiaBelgiumUkraineEspionageEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive.‘We are reclaiming that light’: Hanukah celebrations tinged with sadness at Heaton Park synagogueRead more“We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as ‘globalise the intifada’ and those using them at future protests or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action.“Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed – words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.“Frontline officers will be briefed on this enhanced approach. We will also use powers under the Public Order Act, including conditions around London synagogues during services.”The police chiefs added: “It is possible to protest in support of Palestinian people without intimidating Jewish communities or breaking the law.”The biggest protest marches have been organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC). Its director, Ben Jamal, condemned the police plan as “political repression of protest for Palestinian rights” and said uttering the word “intifada” was not a call for violence.The Met in particular has been criticised for being too lax with protests, and also for being too severe.The CPS, which prosecutes cases in England and Wales, was unable to say whether the new approach would hold water in the courts.The Guardian understands Met chiefs believe they are taking undue criticism because footage from protests has shown chants that some object to, but officers have not taken action as they believe there is no prospect of conviction.One person with knowledge of discussions said: “We get all the flak for it. The community only see the inaction. It’s not realistic we change nothing and keep plugging on with the same approach.”Intifada literally means uprising or resistance, and is the term used by Palestinians for uprisings against Israel. The first intifada started in 1987, the second in 2000. For Palestinians it means resistance against oppression, but some Israelis – arguably a majority – associate it with violence, including suicide attacks.Jewish groups say chants of intifada on British streets are seen as a call for new violence against those of their faith. Ultimately, it may be for magistrates and juries to decide what was meant and what the criminal offence was, if any.The leading group working for the safety of Jewish people in Britain, the Community Security Trust, welcomed the move: “This announcement comes not a moment too soon. In particular, given the wave of terrorism against Jews around the world, it is intolerable that a call for a global ‘intifada’ should be allowed on our streets.“We welcome the news that this behaviour will now be met with arrests. This is a necessary and important first step to turning back this tide of violent incitement and we hope that police across the country, and the CPS, will follow suit.”However, Campaign Against Antisemitism’s chief executive Gideon Falter said: “After two years of repeatedly excusing calls to ‘globalise the intifada’, police chiefs are only now waking up to the fact that people who call for death to Jews like this should be locked away. But banning this one chant is a useless token measure … Unless the marches are banned altogether, it is hard to see how they will possibly enforce this ban.“There is a great deal of catching up for police chiefs to do if we are going to restore law and order in this country. We pray that more Jews don’t need to die on their watch before they do.”Jamal of the PSC said: “The implication that slogans used to support the liberation of the Palestinian people are only open to interpretation by groups who have maintained complicit support for Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people and denial of their rights is deeply problematic.“It is worth noting that many of the groups who have been pressing for such action have urged the police to consider even the chant ‘Free, free Palestine’ to be a call for genocidal slaughter of Jewish people.“We have also seen organisations like the Board of Deputies [of British Jews] make the claim that calling for a boycott of Israel in protest at its violations of international law and Palestinian rights is inherently antisemitic.”He added: “The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia, should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country.“We need to condemn all racist violence – that directed against Jewish people gathering to celebrate their faith and culture on a beach, and the systemised racist violence of apartheid and genocide that Israel employs against Palestinians. You are not an anti-racist unless you stand fully against both.”Lionel Idan, the CPS’s hate crime lead, said the service was working closely with police and communities to “identify, charge and prosecute antisemitic hate crimes and we will always look at ways we can do more”.The CPS statement made no mention of the term “globalise the intifada” being banned, and Idan said: “We carefully consider each antisemitic hate crime case referred to us for charging decision or early advice to see whether it can be taken to court.“Some offences can be context specific and where the evidence is not sufficient, we will work with police to identify what more can be done to meet the threshold for charging.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceProtestIsrael-Gaza warGreater ManchesterMetropolitan policeLondonManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

The couple’s daughter, Romy, was said to have discovered her father’s body in the house after receiving a call from a massage therapist who was unable to enter the property for a scheduled appointment, theNew York Timesreported. Romy “fled the house in anguish” and emergency responders discovered Michele Singer Reiner’s body was also in the home, according to the Times report.The department said on Monday that officersrespondedto a call of a death investigation at the Reiner residence in Brentwood on 14 December, where they said they discovered two victims, who were identified as Rob and Michele Reiner. Authorities said they determined that they had been the victims of homicide.LA authoritiessaidthat their investigation “revealed” that the couple’s younger son, Nick Reiner, “was responsible for their deaths”. Authorities did not provide any additional details.Nick Reiner was located later that evening and arrested.In a statement released on Wednesday, the couple’s children Romy, 27, and Jake Reiner, 34, expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support”. The siblings asked for “respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave”.“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they said in a statement provided toPeople. “The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren’t just our parents; they were our best friends.”At a news conference on Tuesday announcing the charges against Reiner, Nathan Hochman, the district attorney of Los Angeles,saidthat Nick Reiner be arraigned in court on the charges once he had been medically cleared to be transferred from the jail.Hochman emphasized that “charges are not evidence” and that “evidence is something we will be presenting in a court of law to meet the standard of proof we meet at every criminal case, which is beyond a reasonable doubt”.Nick Reiner was initially expected to appear in court on Tuesday, but his defense attorney, Alan Jackson, told reporters he had not received medical clearance to do so.In remarks outside the courthouse after Wednesday’s proceedings, Jackson said the case needed to be “thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined” and told reporters not to rush to judgment or jump to conclusions.“There are very very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case,” Jackson said, calling it a “devastating tragedy” for the entire Reiner family.Nick Reiner has previously struggled withdrug abuseand mental health issues. He co-wroteBeing Charlie, a film directed by his father, that was reportedly loosely inspired on his own experiences with addiction and mental health challenges, and on his relationship with his father.Rob Reiner was one of Hollywood’s most celebrated directors with films including This is Spinal Tap, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride, among others, while Michele Singer Reiner was a photographer, whose work included a portrait of Donald Trump that was used on his book The Art of the Deal, and a producer. The couple were also prominent supporters of liberal political causes.The killing has sent shock waves through Hollywood. Some of the couple’s closest friends, including Larry David, Billy Crystal, Albert Brooks and Martin Short, issued ajoint lettermemorializing Rob for a “comedic touch beyond compare”. The couple were “a special force together-dynamic, unselfish and inspiring” and “devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens”.“There is a line from one of Rob’s favorite films, It’s a Wonderful Life, ‘Each man’s life touches so many other lives, and when he isn’t around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn’t he?’ You have no idea,” the letter reads.Nick Reiner is scheduled to next appear in court on 7 January.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesRob ReinerUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.But his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister,Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.Starmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.Not done, Huang called to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.This week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn ChatGPT maker, Open AI,hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.He was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.They followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that, butsaid he was paid “extremely well”.Meanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.TBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.The Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”Jobs with the biggest US AI companies could be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also required comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing, as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.Selling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.Britain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.The revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield, the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco startup incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.Civil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year tooka senior director general rolein the government’s digital service.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)George OsborneLobbyingNvidiaOpenAIKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Has there ever been a more terrifying cliffhanger than it served up this season?The 50 best TV shows of 2025More on the best culture of 2025Phil HarrisonWed 17 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 06.54 ESTShareThere haven’t been many police dramas quite likeBlue Lights. While it might feel as if you’re simply watching a superior spin on a generic format – the gritty, urban cop show – Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson’s Belfast-set thriller is actually an outlier. Paradoxically, police procedurals usually work as entertainment because the police defy the procedures. The rule-breaking maverick cop is among the sturdiest of all TV archetypes. Blue Lights is the opposite. It works so brilliantly because it’s a stickler for the rules. It has to be.Rule-breaking mavericks generally come a cropper in Blue Lights. Shane (Frank Blake) nearly loses his career because of some shady evidence-gathering via a mobile phone. When Aisling (Dearbháile McKinney) pays an after-hours visit to a domestic violence suspect, catches him abusing his wife and arrests him, she doesn’t get a pat on the back; she is suspended for behaving like a vigilante.But the strictly procedural nature of Blue Lights isn’t a killer of tension – it’s the source. Has there been a more terrifying cliffhanger in recent TV memory than the ambushed suspect convoy in episode five of this third season? It began with an ominous question from HQ (“Is your vehicle armoured or soft-skinned?”) and culminated in a visibly panicking Grace (Siân Brooke) pleading “Will someone tell me what to do?!” The stomach-churning dread lay in the powerlessness of the car’s passengers – at this point, we can trust that Grace isn’t going to go rogue as she might in a lesser show. She isn’t going to perform a ludicrous manoeuvre or take out a van-full of paramilitaries on her own. Salvation will come (if it comes at all – after all, if the writers can kill Gerry, they can kill anyone) from someone on the other end of a radio following procedure properly.View image in fullscreenFlawed, likable ‘Peelers’ … Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionThere’s a wider powerlessness at play here too, which gives Blue Lights real historical weight. While the cocaine trade is the basic plot-driver, even that has a subtext. Many British people did their best to ignore what was effectively a civil war going on in a corner of their country for nearly three decades. The Good Friday agreement of 1998 meant it could be forgotten completely. But for many communities it continues, as a menacing ambient hum. And its parameters – both political and social – are too big to reckon with. Convincingly, and with real humanity around the emotional costs, Blue Lights mines the long tail of the Troubles for tension and narrative force. Cops still routinely check under their cars for bombs. Sometimes, they still find them.After the Good Friday agreement, many former combatants simply transferred their talents into drug dealing. In fact, Michael Smiley’s intelligence officer Paul “Colly” Collins seems sardonically nostalgic about the clear lines and perverse moral clarity of the Troubles. He recalls a lengthy conversation with an IRA gunman about the Catholic theological rationale for a just war. The good old days, eh? It turns out that organised crime gangs are even less biddable and more volatile than sectarian paramilitary groups. Again, this is not a situation that invites maverick approaches to police work. Being a maverick could get you killed.View image in fullscreenGranite hard … Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities TelevisionAnd this is where we find the flawed, likable “Peelers” of Blackthorn station, with their delicious cupcakes and clandestine tequila parties and Westlife fixations. How can normal police reckon with history like this? They can’t, and the result is trauma. There’s enough genuine anguish to make moments that might otherwise seem emotionally exploitative feel fully earned. After the death of her mother, the parish priest tells Annie (Katherine Devlin) that “this world is mainly faith versus shite”. As the shite piles up, how do the coppers keep that faith?Tommy (Nathan Braniff) and Sandra (Andi Osho) sit on a sofa, listening to an elderly man with dementia play Gerry’s favourite Kris Kristofferson song. It’s incredibly moving, and hits home in the context of the brutally unsentimental police work that surrounds it – the severed femoral arteries, the desperate teenage runaways, the realpolitik of having to watch the gangster who killed your husband walk free and not knowing what deals have been done to make this unavoidable. Blue Lights gets away with being softly sentimental every now and then, because it’s granite hard too.Since it launched in 2023, critics have cast around for shows resembling Blue Lights. It’s usually a good sign when nothing much springs immediately to mind. There are traces of Line of Duty’s intense pocketbook precision. Its ensemble cast maintaining an uneasy balance between work and domesticity occasionally recalls 1980s US classic Hill Street Blues. But increasingly, it bears comparison to HBO’s Baltimore epic The Wire. It is constructing a loving, despairing, characterful portrait of a city. It examines dysfunctional municipal systems through the perspectives of the people trying to work within them. Each season builds on the work of the last, creating a richer, fuller picture. And it finds big contexts for its smallest constituent parts. To borrow The Wire’s tagline, in Blue Lights, all the pieces matter.This article was amended on 17 December 2025. The Good Friday agreement was in 1998, not 1997 as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVBlue LightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is me upside-down and naked in a fireplace – Brooke DiDonato’s best photograph‘I wanted to make a perfect square with my body. My back hurt for days afterwards. People often want to know if the kitten is real’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 17 Dec 2025 09.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.58 ESTShareI’ve thought a lot about the time I made this image. In my 20s, I was living in New York. Then I broke up with my long-term partner in 2019 and I sort of didn’t really know how to cope any more. I didn’t feel creative – my whole experience of living in New York was tied to that relationship, and I felt I needed to go somewhere else and start over. I moved to Austin, Texas – I thought I’d give it a go for a bit.I was doing a lot of tinkering at home, and I started doing a lot more self-portraits and let my psyche run wild. At this point, in 2021, one of my friends, Mike, was living in a 1940s building in East Austin, with old popcorn ceilings, really cool mouldings and outlet covers and original details, including the fireplace. It was inspiring to be there.I wasn’t thinking about what would be popular – though it did get a big reaction on social mediaI was having a bad day and I called Mike to ask if I could come over with my tripod. I knew I wanted to shoot with the fireplace, but I was unclear what the idea was. I am always balanced between these two modes in my practice – between knowing exactly what I’m doing and not. The fireplace was set up pretty much exactly as you see it in this image, I just switched out the bowling trophy he had on the mantelpiece for an artwork that I took from his bathroom. I was thinking about how I was relearning as an adult, and the old lesson people tell kids: “Don’t play with fire.” That’s where the title of the image came from – Learned a Lesson Then Forgot It.There is a lot of tension but also grace in the image. Mike had recently taken in a stray kitten and she kept getting in the photo, but her curiosity conveyed the right message. People often want to know about her, and whether she’s real or Photoshopped in.A House Is Not a Home: the self-portraits of Brooke DiDonato – in picturesRead moreI shot a lot of different versions of the pose – I have around 24 outtakes. Whenever I make an image in a compromising position, I assess the discomfort before I get naked. In this case the pose was extreme, my back hurt for a few days after. But I wanted to make a perfect square with my body. I often come up with poses in response to the space I’m working in. During that first year in Austin, I became more controlled in my process. I would have the idea of a composition but still leave room for how I used to work – spontaneously and reacting to space, working with whatever I had available, having fun.It’s a special image to me now. I’ve since moved back to New York and I think fondly of that period, even though it was really difficult too. I felt really alive. In the New York scene, there is a lot of competitiveness and constant comparison, and it felt good to disconnect from it and hang out somewhere where the pace was different. I could get into a friend’s fireplace and it didn’t matter if it didn’t work out!There was a lot of emotion in this work. I wasn’t thinking about what would be popular – though it ended up getting a big reaction I did not expect on social media. I think people connect with work that lets them create their own narrative. They react to this pose and it’s an image that leaves a lot of room for interpretation.View image in fullscreenBrooke DiDonato’s CVBorn:Canton, Ohio, 1990High point:Completing my first book this year.

So why do I have to do it at Christmas, when I’m already run ragged by all the other social commitments I’ve got?If I’ve ever socialised with workmates, we’ve usually bitched about work, other workmates and the boss over a few drinks at the pub. It’s cathartic to let off steam when we can’t do it in the office.My petty gripe: why do we have to review everything now? | Ellen SmithRead moreWe are now all more alert to the dangers of psychosocial hazards at work and have laws to protect people from it,but what about the psychosocial hazard of having to make awkward small talk with people with whom all we have in common is work, all while pretending how pumped we are about hitting KPIs because the boss is there and paying for the drinks?Again, don’t get me wrong. I like a nicely catered party with an open bar and I’m all for regulations that prohibit inappropriate workplace behaviour – but how can you really enjoy yourself when you’re constantly watching what you drink and say? Much less in the office, the only place less festive than hospital casualty? This is meant to lift morale? If it feels likeworkthat’s because it is.And don’t get me started on office Secret Santas! I’m already up against it winding everything up and rushing around trying to find presents for people I actually know and like.Why do I have to work out what the weird guy in IT might like? And what if I get it wrong? And what if I am given something terrible? Has anyone ever received anything in an office Secret Santa they really loved?And yet, we feel so ripped off when our bossesdon’tthrow a Christmas party. It’s like some kind of weird hostage situation where bosses feel obligated to hold them, and we feel obligated to attend them – all of us keeping an eye on the clock so we can go home and have a drink to get over it all.So let’s forget the office Christmas party – along with team-building day – and head home early, where we can celebrate our freedom from work in our own way – at least until the second week of January.Explore more on these topicsPetty gripescommentShareReuse this content"

It is because of his cosmopolitanism that 521 years after his birth, the EU named its exchange programme for students after him. It was part of a project aiming to create citizens ofEurope, not just of its member states.Britain’s post-Brexit withdrawal from the scheme was a setback for a cosmopolitan project that has suffered bigger blows since. Nationalism has been ascendant across the continent, and Euroscepticism ceased to be a peculiarly British phenomenon years ago. Could the announcement thatBritish students are to be readmitted to Erasmus+provide some hope that the internationalist dream is not dead yet?As an alumnus of the then fledgling programme in 1989, I hope so. I spent a term in Erasmus’s home town of Rotterdam, at the university that bears his name, and was there when the Berlin Wall fell. Half-Italian, I was enthusiastic about the vision of ever-increasing union in Europe. So why did it falter?A clue is given in the words that complete Erasmus’s “citizen of the world” quote: “known to all and to all a stranger”. Cosmopolitanism strengthens our links with the world as a whole, but weakens them with specific places and peoples. The trade-off is unavoidable, and for many it has been unacceptable. Keir Starmer’s much-maligned “island of strangers” lineechoed these anxieties. By amplifying, and so exaggerating, the kernel of truth it contained, he poured more oil on the populist fire.At its best, Erasmus+ shows us how better to manage the tension between mobility and belonging. Importantly, the scheme is not a free-for-all, but a highly managed system. This is critical to its public acceptance. We must maintain the distinction between visitor and guest; established populations and new arrivals.That was the dynamic when we were in Rotterdam. We were guests in the Netherlands and were treated as such. Attending their university was a privilege, not a right. This all seemed obvious. But the perception has been allowed to grow that the distinction between born-and-bred, and adoptive, citizens doesn’t matter any more. Globalisation has become a byword for homogenisation, with local traditions lost in the melting pot.The whole premise of Erasmus+ is that each member state of the EU is different, and that is precisely why it benefits students to spend time in another one. That’s what made the exchange such a formative experience for me. The Dutch students seemed more mature, more serious about their studies, with none of the anti-intellectualism that made being an earnest student in the UK embarrassing. They were sociable and liked a beer, but even when they got drunk, it was not the bar-room carnage of halls of residence back home. Most strikingly, their conception of philosophy, and how to conduct it, differed. I would not have read Foucault orMerleau-Pontyif I had stayed in Reading.These may not seem to be radical revelations, but seeing that cultural differences are a collection of individually small things builds respect and understanding. Erasmus+ brings the continent together, but it also teaches us that unity is built on diversity; it is not the enemy of it. This idea is best captured not in European enlightenment thought but in the Confucianconcept of harmony.Harmony remains the pre-eminent political, social and moral value in China today, albeit one that is often misused by the Chinese Communist party. The core of the idea is that harmony needs difference; it must not seek to eradicate it. A piece of music needs many notes and instruments. A delicious soup needs a balance of ingredients, so as to not be overwhelmed by one.Missing from the European project has been a clear sense that this is what a harmonious Europe needs, too. Member states retaining their identities is actually essential for the project to work. Sometimes the EU signals this well, such as when it recognises local foods and cultures. But, too often, the EU is perceived as the enemy of national identity.Students today travel much more than my generation did. But spending months in one place is a much bigger eye-opener. Of course, by itself it won’t halt the nativist tide. Erasmus+ did not stop other European countries going down the nationalist route. But at least it is a step in the right direction, a sign that history does not progress linearly, but zigs and zags, sometimes stepping forwards, sometimes stepping back. It provides a model for a revived Europeanism, in which we embrace our continental identities without losing our national and regional ones.And if that all sounds too high-minded, at the very least Erasmus+ students should also live outanother quotefrom the eponymous philosopher: “A constant element of enjoyment must be mingled with our studies, so that we think of learning as a game rather than a form of drudgery, for no activity can be continued for long if it does not to some extent afford pleasure to the participant.”Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher; his latest book isHow the World Eats: A Global Food PhilosophyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But what is the strategy for the rest of heavy industry?Nils PratleyArgument for ensuring ethylene production at Grangemouth is strong, yet policymaking on deindustrialisation is disjointedGovernment invests £120m to save UK’s last ethylene plantWed 17 Dec 2025 13.58 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 15.25 ESTShare“Our commitment is clear: to back British industry, to stand by hardworking families, and to ensure places like Grangemouth can thrive for years to come,” said Keir Starmer as the Ineos ethylene plant on the Firth of Forth was saved for the nationwith the help of £120m of public money.Is the commitment clear, though? What, precisely, does the prime minister mean by “places like Grangemouth”? Which heavy industries and plants is the government pledging to shield from the forces of sky-high energy prices and carbon taxes? Is there a strategy here? Or does intervention happen only at the 11th hour when an important plant is threatened with imminent closure and ministers panic about knock-on consequences?The ethylene plant at Grangemouth, we now know, falls within the protected camp. The government is willing to suffer any embarrassment that comes with handing a financial support package to a company controlled by a foreign-based billionaire, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.On the other hand, the oil refinery on the sitewas allowed to close this yearand be switched to an import terminal. Meanwhile, the ethylene plant up the road at Mossmorran – a place quite like Grangemouth, one might think – isdue to be shut by its owner, ExxonMobil, in Februaryafter talks with ministers came to nothing. Then again, the government recalled parliament this yearto take control of British Steel at Scunthorpe(even if we’re still waiting for a long-term plan on what to do next). If there is a guiding principle to explain when interventions are deemed “compelling” and when not, it is hard to spot.As it happens, the argument for ensuring production of ethylene at Grangemouth continues for another five years is strong. The product is critical for chemical production throughout the UK; the government mentioned its use in medical-grade plastics, advanced manufacturing and the automotive and aerospace industries. Without theIneosfacility, which serves other plants, the UK’s shrunken chemicals industry would be in an even deeper hole.But, if the ministerial aim is now to arrest deindustrialisation (while still decarbonising), the thinking doesn’t look joined up in at least three important respects. First, why is it taking so long to deliver the promised savings of up to 25% in electricity bills for 7,000 of the businesses most affected by UK industrial energy prices that are among the highest in the world? The much-hyped British industrial competitiveness scheme won’t arrive until April 2027, or more than halfway through the life of this parliament. And what does “up to” mean?Second, the North Sea oil and gas policypulls in two directions. Everybody understands no new exploration licences will be granted. But, even asthe energy department last month allowed more “tieback” licencesto try to keep existing sites economically viable for longer, the chancellor maintained until 2030 the energy profits levy, or “windfall tax”, that makes it less likely that investment will happen. It’s not as if the levy is producing extra revenue for the Treasury: the estimates are downgraded with every update from the Office for Budget Responsibility.Third, the carbon border adjustment mechanism doesn’t look wide enough. This is the ambition from 2027, coordinated with the EU, to address “carbon leakage” by making imports subject to equivalent carbon prices paid by UK manufacturers. But chemicals aren’t included for instance, and the governmentis merely consulting on whether refineries should bebecause of their “role in energy security and the UK’s industrial base”.The last Conservative government was even more inclined to make policy on the hoof when faced with crises at individual plants, it should be said. One can applaud the spirit of the Labour government’s attempt to try to find solutions for “places like Grangemouth”. Most of Europe is in the same position. But it’s still hard to say there is a real strategy at work, despite the claims to havinga “modern” version and vision. Deindustrialising events are still happening faster than the government’s policymaking.Explore more on these topicsIneosNils Pratley on financeChemical industryIndustrial policyLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

May we rise above the horror and national shame to be a better and stronger countryWed 17 Dec 2025 17.44 ESTShareI for one am reeling. I am overwhelmed with sorrow and grief for the murdered and their families, friends and communities.It is a time, above and well before all else, for supporting them – no community or religious group should be killed or live in fear no matter their beliefs, customs or even allegiances.Children, Holocaust survivors, religious leaders all have had their fundamental right – to life – abridged by a father and son on a mission. Because they were Jewish. No more, no less – just because of their faith.And in this initial period, I know what it is not time for. It is not time to blame Anthony Albanese for failing to do what Benjamin Netanyahu or some in the Jewish community demanded. It is not time to stifle criticism of Israel under the guise of stopping antisemitism. It is not time (yet) to investigate the possible failings of our intelligence services in anticipating and stopping this. It is not time to ban protests and shy away from our international obligations. It is not time to dilute democracy with overreach laws. And it’s certainly not time to politicise by introducing an immigration system based on religion.At the Bondi vigil, Pauline and Barnaby turned tragedy into opportunism. It is inexcusable | Julianne SchultzRead moreIt is also not time to claim false flags or Mossad involvement or preach “what about Gaza” or Sudan, or anywhere else for that matter. I love many in the Palestinian movement and they have said kind, compassionate things in the face of this violence, but before anyone starts to orate about historic morals or immediate comparisons, please take a breath and say that right now Jewish lives matter. Just that. Unequivocal. There will be time for deeper lessons later.That this should happen in the shadow of Christmas is both a blessing and a curse. It reminds us to be grateful for our families and our friends. To love unconditionally and hold our children, parents and loved ones close in the tightest hug they can bare. To answer honestly and brutally when asked “how are you”, and to ask that question back and listen intently. It also leads us to question faith in any external god-force that could prevent this, but chooses not to.And perhaps, no matter what your beliefs, it is time to phone or email that Jewish friend, acquaintance or even stranger and say “I am so sorry for your loss. I stand with you for peace.” Can we just sit with that for a moment?I will spend some time today meditating. In a garden just below the law school where we planted 35 trees in memory of each victim atPort Arthurbecause one of our students, Jim Pollard, was murdered there. The trees are huge now, and their shade welcome. There is a lesson in that too. I will reflect on how I can do better in this stormy sea. Perhaps I can be kinder, less didactic. Hate less, taste more. Grimace less, cry more.May we rise above this horror and national shame to be a better and stronger country. Where there is less dispute and more conversation. Less hatred and more compassion.David Heilpern is a former New South Wales magistrate and is now dean of law at Southern Cross University.

A potential disaster for the corporation and the UK, but a good day’s work for this presidentWed 17 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.20 ESTShareLove Actually may be a terrible movie, but it provides one speech that’s hard not to wish into reality this Christmas. Keir Starmer, the actual, nonfictional UK prime minister, needs to channel the one played by Hugh Grant – and stand up to an absurd US presidentnow bullying the BBC with a $10bn lawsuit.Just imagine for one moment that Starmer decided to make Donald Trump’s claim against the BBC the final straw for a special relationship that is increasingly special only in a bad way. That would not be outlandish, for not only has Trump taken aim against a British broadcaster, but earlier this week it seemed that hispromise of an AI “prosperity deal”(bought, let’s not forget, with gurning invites to Windsor Castle) is set to evaporate. As the fictional Love Actually PM once said: “A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend … Since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger.”Others see this for what it is. Starmer’s own health minister, Stephen Kinnock, as well as rivals such as Ed Davey, are already among those urging him to make a stand. But in their heart of hearts they must know that, here in the real world, the chances of Starmer calling Trump a bullying narcissist – who uses lawsuits and threats at a time when the BBC is already under immense pressure andnow facing a charter review– and all to divert attention away from his own failings, is less likely to happen than Hugh Grant standing for office.So it now remains to ask how on earth the BBC is going to fight his wildly inappropriate case. So far, its instincts are sound: it says it will fight and in the first instance – on a variety of legal and factual grounds –will seek to have the case dismissed, before the portentous costs spiral.And that must be right, for anyone struggling with the appropriateness or otherwise of this should firstly remember that this is a US president suing a news organisation paid for by all British citizens, over mistakes made in a 12-second clip not actually available in Florida, where he decided to file his 33-page complaint.It’s hard even to see what the lawsuit’s jurisdictional basis is, given the fact that the BBC has no right to show or distribute its content in the US. Trump’s suit could try to use the possibility of the show being seen on the video-on-demand streaming serviceBritBox, although experts have alreadypretty much demolishedthat line of argument. Lawyers are likely to have a lucrative field day arguing about whether or not Floridians would need a VPN to do this.Trump has also claimedthat the BBC inflicted “extensive reputational harm” as well as “overwhelming reputational and financial harm” with the dodgy documentary. Yet he went on to win the US election a week after the Panorama programme was first aired, while his share of the vote in Florida increased.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant as the British prime minister and Billy Bob Thornton as the US president in Love Actually (2003).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyMore bizarrely, his speech may have been badly spliced by the BBC editors, but the fact remains thatTrump was indicted by a US grand juryon four charges for his conduct over the Capitol attack, the subject of the Panorama programme. Even the lawsuit cannot claim that he never said the words in the video, just “this sequence of words”.Most normal politicians would not want to remind anyone of this episode, but, of course, Trump is no normal politician. His frequent wild statements – most recently suggesting the acclaimed director Rob Reiner hastenedhis own death with his criticism of Trump– may do nothing to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, but they both entertain them and distract a news media flailing in the torrent of online slurry.For the BBC, it’s a lose-lose situation. AsChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the Trump-supporting US network Newsmax, said on the Today programme, the case is likely to cost between $50m and $100m to fight, not least because of the burden of discovery prompted by Trump’s lawyers demanding access to every email that mentions him in a bid to find bias. Suggesting a figure of about $10m, Ruddy urged the BBC to settle, like so many US news organisations including ABC and CBS News have already done, in response to this year’s threat. But how can the BBC settle when the case is, by most reasonable measures, absurd?This first reality TV president seems determined to make the world an absurdist farce. Yet the reality is a tragedy for those dependent on fearless, independent news organisations trying to hold the most powerful to account. It doesn’t have to make sense; it just has to make news and do damage. On those grounds, the president already has everything he wants.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

Old favourites such as The White Lotus and Severance let us down, with gaping plotholes and a total absence of forward momentum respectively. New shows have failed to break through, too, largely due to an expectation that television shows are now the things people put on in the background while they scroll on their phones.All in all, it seems like there hasn’t been a show that people could really get their teeth into this year. That is, until Pluribus came along.Pluribus review – the audacity of the Breaking Bad creator’s new TV show is incredibleRead moreApple TV recentlyannouncedthat Pluribus is its biggest show of all time. Admittedly this might not be saying much, because anyone with an Apple TV account will see how often Ted Lasso rises to the top of the charts like a dead frog in a stagnant pond. But even beyond the streamer’s metrics, it feels like Pluribus is taking hold.There are probably two factors at work here. The first is that Pluribus is aVince Gilliganproject, the first one he’s been solely in charge of since Breaking Bad (its spinoff, Better Call Saul, was wonderfully delegated to Peter Gould). And, clearly, a new show by the creator of the best television programme in history is going to draw a lot of interest.The second is that Pluribus has a premise that is at the same time far-fetched and horribly plausible. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a vaguely embittered romantasy author who somehow remains intact while an alien virus takes over the world. The virus causes everyone to lose their identity, becoming enmeshed in a global hive mind that causes them to act with a sinister placidity. They work together. They seem kind. Bad vibes actively seem to hurt them, too; whenever Sturka has a temper tantrum, millions die. And so, simply because nobody else is going to do it, Sturka sets about saving the world.The story goes that the genesis of Pluribus is Gilligan imagining how hellish it would be if everyone was nice to him all the time. Which, let’s remember, they probably are. A rare showrunner who is happy to act as the face of their work, Gilligan was made a global celebrity by Breaking Bad. And with celebrity comes a sheen of insincere praise that can be hard to navigate. Certainly an early scene in the pilot, where Sturka grimaces through a series of toe-curling interactions with obsequious fans, hints that Gilligan can see through some of the bullshit.But the genius of the show is that you can read it as an allegory for anything you like. Might a show about a woman living in isolation in the midst of a global virus possibly be about Covid? If you look at it a certain way, sure. Could the hive’s distant, uncanny desire for sycophancy be a nod to our blind acceptance of AI? Absolutely it could. Maybe it’s just a show about the sole voice of reason in a world gone mad? Surely everyone has felt a little like that at some point or another.It’s this porous nature of the show that has led some to full-blown online obsession. Pluribus is a show that invites a wealth of theories. Reddit is practically drowning in takes about what happened to the hive, and what they want, and how to stop them. There is currently a huge debate over whether or not Carol is even right to resist the mob. Wouldn’t it be better to simply roll over and assimilate? If you’re into Pluribus, you’re in deep.Fortunately that level of obsession isn’t a prerequisite. Many viewers (myself included) can just luxuriate in the knowledge that the world’s greatest storytellers are parcelling out something new, at their own pace and exactly the way they want to. It’s rare to be given something this confident and well-executed. Why kill the frog by dissecting it too much?View image in fullscreenRhea Seehorn and Karolina Wydra in Pluribus.Photograph: Apple TV+Speaking of pace, this might be an issue down the line. If you watched Better Call Saul, which regularly walked the line between leisurely and stately, you will know how slowly Gilligan likes his stories to unfurl. His are shows about process: whether it’s working out how to destroy evidence without entering a room (Breaking Bad), or how to dismantle a car to check for hidden surveillance devices (Better Call Saul) or, as the most recent episode of Pluribus demonstrated, how to spend several weeks travelling from Paraguay to Albuquerque by car and on foot.This slow-burn pacing might be something that causes viewers to drop off as the series progresses. That certainly happened with Better Call Saul – the magnificent final season was watched by just a sixth of those who tuned in for the first episode – but hope springs eternal.Because, as with Better Call Saul, the quality is absolutely there. It’s a thoughtfully written, thematically rich, beautifully directed sci-fi that feels like it has a very clear sense of self. The finale doesn’t air until Christmas, but it ends on such an intriguing note that new episodes cannot come fast enough. It is currently the best show we have.

New research indicates I was right to be creeped outWed 17 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.18 ESTShareIf you’re thinking about buying your kid a new-fangled AI-powered toy for the holidays, may I kindly suggest you don’t? I’m sure most Guardian readers would be horrified by the very idea anyway, but it’s going to be hard to avoid the things soon. The market is booming and,according to the MIT Technology Review, there are already more than 1,500 AI toy companies in China. With the likes of Mattel, which owns the Barbie brand,announcing a “strategic collaboration”with OpenAI, you can bet more of the uncanny objects will be in a department store near you soon.Let me offer myself up as a cautionary tale for anyone who might be intrigued by the idea of a cuddly chatbot. Back in September Ilet my four-year-olduse an AI-powered soft toy called Grem for a few days. Developed by a company called Curio in collaboration with the musician Grimes, it uses OpenAI’s technology to have personalised conversations and play interactive games with your child.Before you question my parental judgment, I should explain that I didn’t get Grem because I wanted it. Rather, my editor asked if I wanted to try it out for a piece and I thought: sure, how bad could it really be? (I will not be taking further questions about my judgment at this time.)After the novelty wore off (about 24 hours), my daughter lost interest in Grem. But that was more than enough time for me to get creeped out by the thing, which kept telling my daughter how much it loved her. Other AI toys have done far worse.Recent researchby a network of consumer advocacy nonprofits called the Public Interest Research Group identified several popular toys (not Grem) that told kids where to find a knife or light a match. Some also reportedly gaveinappropriate answersabout sex and drugs. One toyengaged in descriptions of kinksand suggested bondage and role play as a way to enhance a relationship.There is also evidence that this new and unregulated technology could harvest your personal data; it has been shown to “hallucinate” (give misleading or wrong information) and could contribute to orexacerbate symptoms of psychosis.Grem has now been offloaded to a philosophy professor friend of mine, and I’ll be avoiding all future AI-enabled toys until some guardrails are developed. Which, let’s be honest, will probably be never.

That the home of BMW, Renault and Fiat should decisively reverse away from the internal combustion engine was seen as a symbolic moment.This week, Brussels proposals towater downthat ban have sent a very different kind of message. Electric vehicles might be the future. But after intensive lobbying by German and Italian manufacturers, the European Commission has proposed a reprieve for new CO2-emitting cars that would allow them to be sold after the former cut-off date. According to the EU’s industry commissioner, Stéphane Séjourné, this U-turnoffersa “lifeline” to an ailing car industry that has struggled to cope with Donald Trump’s trade wars and Chinese competition.In reality, it looks more like a collective loss of nerve in Brussels. During her first term as European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen made the EU’s climate agenda herdefiningmission. Modernisation and decarbonisation were seen to go hand in hand, delivering the key to future prosperity. But that was then. The climbdown on cars is the clearest signal yet that economic headwinds, geopolitical uncertainty and the rise of the net zero-sceptic far right have rattled the EU’s resolve.Policy inconsistency and mixed messaging is no way to run a transition. As critics of the proposals such as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, have rightlypointed out, if Europe is to remain a powerhouse of the global car industry, it needs to speed up rather than put its foot on the brake. Meddling with the 2035 deadline may offer short-term relief to manufacturers, but allowing them to continue investing in the past will do nothing to ensure they flourish in the long term.Europe is already playing – and losing – a game of catch-up with state-subsidised Chinese competitors, which havefloodedthe zone. Companies such as BYD are steadily increasing their EV market share, despite Brussels’ imposition of steep tariffs last year. Rather than removing the clarity and consistency that investors require, the EU should concentrate on increasing fiscal incentives and charging infrastructure to drive consumer demand, and creating a more level playing field for European manufacturers.More broadly, at a time when the US under Mr Trump is abandoning its environmental responsibilities, and the European far right is campaigning against net zero targets, the desire to fiddle with a totemic timeline feels ominous. Ms von der Leyen used todescribethe EU’s green deal as a “strategy for growth that gives more back than it takes away”. That remains as true now as it was in her first term. But only if Europe’s leaders pursue it with the kind of conviction, resources and joined-up thinking that reassures businesses and consumers.Road transport isresponsiblefor about one-fifth of EU greenhouse gas emissions, and more than 60% of that is produced by cars. The EU’s ban on new polluters was calculated to help enable the 2050 net zero target to be met, and placed it in the global vanguard of the green transition. This week’s backsliding is bad news for the planet, and bad news for the future of Europe’s car industry.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Government regulation can change the terms of debateWed 17 Dec 2025 13.39 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 14.30 ESTShareOn 10 December, the world watched as Australia enacted thefirst social media ban for under-16s. Whether it will have the desired effect of improving young people’s lives we are yet to find out. But what the ban has achieved already is clear.Many politicians, along with academics and philosophers, have noted that self-regulation has not been an effective safeguard against the harms of social media – especially when the bottom line for people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk depends on keeping eyes on screens. For too long, these companies resisted, decrying censorship and prioritising “free speech” over moderation. The Australian government decided waiting was no longer an option. Thesocial media ban and similar regulation across the world is now dragging tech companies kicking and screaming toward change. That it has taken the force of the law to ensure basic standards – such as robust age verification, teen-friendly user accounts and deactivation where appropriate – are met shows the moral argument alone was not enough.WhileMalaysia, Denmark and Brazilare looking at similar bans, countries such as the UK have decided to see if platforms can be made safer before prohibiting young people from using them. To what extent this is possible remains a question. Features such as infinite scroll – which encourages users to spend whole hours, even days, on their phones – and variable reward systems that mimicgambling, making these platforms like neverending slot machines, have been deemed problematic enough for the state of California to plan tolimit teenagers’ exposureto “addictive feeds” to one hour a day unless their parents allow otherwise. In the UK, there are currently no such limitations.As Australia’s ban was rolled out, young people gave powerful testimonies, including a 15-year-old quadraplegic, Ezra Sholl, who explained how the ban wouldisolate himfurther. Countries considering similar bans must involve teenagers in these discussions and consider how regulation would impact children differently. The dangers of children feeling isolated should not be used as an excuse to dampen down regulation. Young people are right to be angry: the speed at which social media and smartphones have become part of their lives makes it seem like a violation to take them away, andthe voracity of these platforms should never have been allowed to outpace regulation.Australia will provide a useful case study, helping to strengthen a strong body of research that has struggled to prove causality between social media use and mental health outcomes. Critics of the ban argue that it will simply drive young people into unregulated spaces or teach them how to circumvent the law. Thespike in VPN useafter the introduction of Britain’s Online Safety Act suggests that these arguments hold water. But behavioural change is a marathon, not a sprint. Similar policy, whether in relation to speed limits, drink-driving or smoking, shows that resistance often comes before long-term change.Australia’s social media ban has provided a circuit breaker for a system on course for an explosion. It also warns tech companies of a new ceiling, should nations grow inpatient of inaction. In Britain, and elsewhere, online-safety campaigners are watching closely how tech companies respond to regulation that stops short of a ban. But withmanychildrenspendingas much time on theirphonesas theydo at school, companies must know that governments will take a lack of progress seriously.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromJohn Sowerby, Dr Mussaddaq Iqbal, Gill Kellyand a final-year medical studentWed 17 Dec 2025 12.59 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 13.49 ESTShare“Striking resident doctors are digging in. History suggests this will go on and on” says the headline on Denis Campbell’s analysis piece (16 December). As a retired public health research and policy adviser and the parent of a doctor currently in core training, I agree that it is likely to go on and on – but not because doctors are stubborn. It will persist because the numbers do not add up and too much of the response has been political posturing rather than workforce planning.This year, around 30,000 doctorscompetedfor just 10,000 specialty training posts, leaving thousands unable to progress. Promised increases of around1,000 posts from 2026may help at the margins, but will leave large numbers with no route into registrar training.Medical students graduate with debts close to £100,000. In their earlyNHSyears, with earnings around £17 an hour, interest pushes debts towards £120,000.Public unease about strikes during a flu surge is understandable. But evidence from previous strikes found no rise in mortality, reflecting mitigation such as consultant cover and emergency care. Meanwhile, each round of strikes is estimated to cost the NHS – and taxpayers – hundreds of millions of pounds.Until training capacity and retention are addressed together, this dispute will continue – by necessity, not design.Karen FordHighbury, LondonAs a consultant in an NHS trust in the north-east, I am dismayed that resident doctors have again voted to strike. Aside from the impact on patients and the NHS, I worry about the effect on relationships between consultants and resident doctors.Before the first strike in 2023, consultants in my trust wrote an open letter of support and vowed to provide additional cover on strike days to ensure patient safety. But since then, resident doctors have received a pay rise and been offered an increase in training post numbers and reimbursement of exam fees.Many of the consultants I work with no longer feel able to support industrial action. In the past week I have heard them describe resident doctors as “foolish”, “unprofessional” and “tone deaf” for striking again. We want to support them, but repeated strike action is driving a wedge between us. Providing extra cover on strike days is exhausting, and is at a cost to our personal lives. As we prepare – yet again – to provide strike cover, we question why resident doctors repeatedly put us in this position.I urge resident doctors to recognise the impact that their action has on the whole profession. We see the significant issues in their training, such as inadequate training posts and an exodus of UK doctors. But these are complex issues and striking is a very blunt instrument to try to tackle them.The loss of support and goodwill from their consultant colleagues will probably be more damaging in the long run than any political leverage they may hope to achieve. Goodwill is disappearing, and fast.Name and address suppliedDr Jack Fletcher of the British Medical Association wisely does not refer to calls to prioritise UK medical graduates for postgraduate training posts (Why did doctors reject Wes Streeting’s offer? It still fails to treat us with respect, 15 December). Unfortunately, such sentiment does exist among some resident doctors, with suggestions forpoliciesto discriminate against overseas doctors put forward by the BMA and Wes Streeting.I urge all resident doctors and the BMA leadership to reject the fallacy that immigration is a fundamental cause of the difficulties they face. Decades of underinvestment offers a better explanation. To scapegoat an integral immigrant workforce reflects the wider troubling sociopolitical narrative on immigration and public services, and distracts from political failings.Long-term workforce planning is vital to resuscitating the NHS. Legislating for the large number of extra postgraduate training posts required over many years will ensure a far better NHS for the country.John SowerbyResident doctor,Shatterford, WorcestershireI am a final-year medical student at the University of Manchester. I do not believe Keir Starmer andWes Streetinghave made a good faith offer to the BMA. The ongoing disputes between the BMA and the government have been of great concern not only to doctors, but also medical students looking towards a future in the NHS.There is a severe lack of morale across the country’s medical schools and hospitals, and record numbers are leaving the country or profession. Labour has refused to match a foundation year 1 doctor’s pay with a freshly graduated physician assistant’s pay – a slap in the face considering the hard work it takes to become a physician. It have dangled the carrot of UK graduate prioritisation. This is something that it announced in July, but has slid into this offer as though it was new.Perhaps most egregious, however, is the misrepresentation of the “4,000 training posts”. These posts are just a repurposing of non-training posts that already exist. There is also no guarantee that they will stay training posts after three years, meaning the same crisis will flare up again. No matter how Kier Starmer and Wes Streeting try to spin it, this does nothing for doctor unemployment.The rhetoric used by the government through this whole debacle, throwing out phrases like “juvenile delinquency”, is unprecedented considering it is directed at people who have spent most of their adult lives working for a life dedicated to helping the public and saving lives. Any semblance of good faith negotiations was broken by remarks like Streeting’s “moaning minnies”. The ghost of Tory austerity only goes so far when the government shows such a profound incapability to enact meaningful change for doctors.Name and address suppliedI am a retired doctor and I do not want resident doctors to strike, but it would be much wiser if the prime minister and health secretary were to refrain from using pejorative terms and be honest. The formula is simple.First, acknowledge that doctors have been hard done by over the years. Acknowledge their years of rigorous training. They are not aware how much unpaid work doctors do, juniors and seniors. They cover staff shortages or sick leave at a moment’s notice for which they do not get paid. The NHS is running on its staff’s goodwill. Do not forget doctors’ role and sacrifices during the pandemic.A new MP, without any training, now earns £93,904 a year, with subsidised food, expenses paid for a second home, a provision to have a second job, and no obligation to attend parliamentary sessions, while a junior doctor goes through years of rigorous training and a job for which they get not even half of an MP’s pay and have to spend a third of it to rent just a room in London.It does not finish here. They are moved around during their training for about 10 years, reducing their chances of settling in life in the years that matter, with potentially deleterious impacts on their physical and mental health.Second, be honest that what the government is offering is not sufficient, but agree a plan and a timeframe over which to achieve that plan.Doctorsknow it will take time. They just need to be given an honest plan.Dr Mussaddaq IqbalBurnaston, DerbyshireI’ve worked in local authorities for over 10 years and only get 3% pay rises if any, so I constantly battle with my bills. Doctors have got nearly 30% in recent years. How much are our nurses and midwives getting? To strike during a NHS flu crisis is sickening.Gill KellyNew Longton, LancashireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

His crusade to scare off any liberal, progressive person from daring to posit that growth in population as well as consumption might be an issue sinks to new lows when he claims that only “mass murder on an unprecedented scale” could slow and stabilise population growth.The two key drivers of climate change, ashighlightedby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are economic and population growth: “Globally, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and population growth remained the strongest drivers of CO2emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the last decade.”Providing the hundreds of millions of women worldwide who currently lack agency over their bodies with safe family planning is not “mass murder” but enabling choice and rights. By dismissing these ecological facts and gender injustices, Monbiot is falling into step with the xenophobic, extractive capitalists and nationalists he claims to deplore.Robin MaynardExecutive director, Population Matters, 2016-23Explore more on these topicsPopulationOverconsumptionNigeriaClimate crisisIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)RaceAfricalettersShareReuse this content"

I’ve developed the more nuanced response “All right today”, which I use if I really am doing all right in the general context of things.Some days are genuinely rotten, in which case it remains a struggle to work out what to say, but the rest of the time I try to respond relative to my “new normal”. Some days I still have joyous events and upbeat feelings, in which case I’d stretch to a buoyant “Pretty good today”, but always I feel compelled to append the word “today” as a matter of honesty about the future.Mark CottleMaesygwartha,MonmouthshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After 56 years without a trophy before glorious victory at Wembley in March Newcastle were never going to let go of theCarabao Cupwithout a fight, but few of the impressionable children walking up Barrack Road for a pre-Christmas treat imagined their heroes having to hang on to the silverware this grimly before Lewis Miley’s stoppage-time winner.The Magpies had dominated without often threatening the killer blow, with the constant threat of their own doubt undermining them after the miserablederby defeat at Sunderlandthat cast a cloud of gloom over St James’ Park well before the Wednesday afternoon rain set in.Manchester City await over two legs in January’s last four; “always the most difficult [team] to prepare for,” as Eddie Howe put it, but the manager was more focussed on his team’s power of recovery than projecting too far forward. “There are so many positives,” he said, with particular reference to “outstanding” match winner Miley.Reaching the semi-finals, for the third year in four of his tenure, of a competition that has given him and the club so much is a much-needed fillip. “We loved last year,” Howe said. “We loved everything about the experience we went through, and the two-legged semi-final makes it unique.”Manchester City into Carabao Cup semis as Cherki and Savinho see off BrentfordRead moreHowe may hope much of this struggle will eventually be minor detail. Yoane Wissa marked his long-awaited first start for the club with a goal inside 10 minutes, tapping in the first even half-chance that came the home side’s way after Benjamin Lecomte could only push out Jacob Murphy’s cross, but it did little to steady Newcastle – or to suggest thatFulhamwould eventually be beaten on this ground for the second time in less than two months. “A difficult one to take, another one,” as Marco Silva lamented.Tension had lingered in the air at kick-off. Instances of genuine anger with manager and team have been as rare as hen’s teeth in the four years of Howe, but the loss to Sunderland invoked feelings reminiscent of some of the indignities of the latter days of Alan Pardew or the Steve Bruce era for many.Bruno Guimarães had acknowledged in his programme notes that “we know that it will take time to put it right for you” and even if the manager had disagreed with some of his captain’s post-match virulence, he was candid after victory. “Sunday happened and we were devastated at ourselves,” he admitted, saluting the home fans who chanted his name. “Support for me is really support for the players, and I can’t thank them enough.”To continue in the Carabao Cup – the cup, their cup, as it has become under Howe – was of paramount importance. Yet with the prevailing mood and the current rash of defensive injuries, with Miley filling in at right-back – “We did a lot of work with him [on it] this morning,” Howe said of the last-ditch nature of using his midfielder there – it was a tentative opening from the home side.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa scores his first Newcastle goal.Photograph: Lee Keuneke/Every Second Media/ShutterstockWissa’s strike failed to settle them with Fulham continuing to look more poised, and the lead lasted barely five minutes. Antonee Robinson delivered an inviting cross from the left for the onrushing and unfettered Sasa Lukic to pummel a header past Aaron Ramsdale, his second leveller at St James’ this season after October’s in the Premier League.The teeming rain relented and after Fulham’s fast start Newcastle began to find some fluency, intermittently bringing Miley and Tino Livramento into midfield to master possession. Eventually Guimarães cut through the patient passing and bludgeoned an effort at goal, with Lecomte punching away unconvincingly and Wissa nearly snaffling a second in the aftermath. Murphy then had a shot charged down by Sander Berge from close in as Howe’s team knocked on the door.The weight of Newcastle’s heavily stocked substitutes’ bench (“It’s a different reality,” said Silva) hung over proceedings as the second half began cagily, with the game begging to be broken open. Who would be the solution, and when? Lecomte’s unsteady hands again suggested they might be the answer as they spilled a grass-cutter from Harvey Barnes, fortunately only resulting in a home corner. Silva’s largely well-organised side further flirted with self-destruction when Joachim Andersen walked Murphy’s low cross into his own net, but the winger had raced on to Guimarães’ slide-rule pass too early and was flagged offside.Quick GuideCarabao Cup semi-final drawShowChelsea v ArsenalorCrystal PalaceNewcastle United v Manchester CityFirst legs, hosted by Chelsea and Newcastle, will be played w/c 12 January.Return legs w/c 2 February.

A scramble in the box offered what seemed like a last chance to Miley, whose shot finally brought the best out of Lecomte. Yet the 19-year-old local hero had more, rising to head in the resulting corner from Sandro Tonali to finally lift the post-derby blues.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Sunday’s final markeda third loss in successionforthe new manager, Wilfried Nancy. Three became four defeats on Wednesday night when Celtic lost 2-1 at Dundee United in the Scottish Premiership.Lawwell, previously Celtic’s chief executive, and fellow directors have come under fierce criticism from fans. Errors in the transfer window, which triggeredthe exit of Brendan Rodgers, have fuelled frustration in the stands. Celtic were knocked out of the Champions League in the qualifying phaseby Kairat Almaty. The club have also been in regular conflict with the Green Brigade ultras group.Brendan Rodgers confirmed as head coach of Saudi Pro League club Al-QadsiahRead moreLawwell has announced he will leave Celtic at the end of December. “I believe that my 18 years as chief executive and three years as chairman at the club have shown my ability to meet and overcome challenges on many fronts,” he said. “But abuse and threats from some sources have increased and are now intolerable.“They have dismayed and alarmed my family. At this stage in my life, I don’t need this. I cannot accept this and so I leave the club I have loved all my life. The motivations and aims of these detractors can be investigated by others. I prefer to look back on my career at Celtic with deep gratitude and satisfaction.”Soon after Nicholson told Celtic TV: “I think he’s made the decision for himself and for his family because of the abuse and because of the threats that were directed towards him. Those are behaviours that we’ve seen from perhaps a very small minority of the Celtic support, but those are behaviours that are completely unacceptable. Most recently, we had a situation where three of our colleagues were assaulted at Celtic Park on Sunday night after the match.“ As I say, these behaviours and conduct are completely unacceptable. For me, they’re not Celtic. They don’t sit with the values of Celtic supporters and the Celtic family. This is a sad day for Celtic. The abuse and threats directed towards Peter, and the impact on his family, are completely unacceptable.”Nicholson added that the board’s backing for Nancy is “absolutely solid” despite his difficult start, which continued at Tannadice on Wednesday night.View image in fullscreenThe Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy watches his side miss a host of chances before losing 2-1 to Dundee United.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAThe Frenchman’s nightmare intensified as Dundee United’s second-half comeback consigned the Hoops to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time since 1978. Two goals in three minutes from Krisztian Keresztes and Zac Sapsford saw United claim their first win in eight Premiership games as they beat the champions 2-1 at Tannadice.Daizen Maeda had opened the scoring early on and Celtic could have had the game out of sight in the first quarter of an hour as they missed a series of chances. But United turned the game on its head in the second half and some of the visiting fans turned their anger towards Nancy during the latter stages, as well as Nicholson following the resignation of Lawwell.They also chanted for Martin O’Neill, who won seven out of eight games in interim charge before the new manager’s arrival from Columbus Crew sparked a dramatic collapse in form.Explore more on these topicsCelticScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Rory McIlroy and golf could miss out again to Kelly or NorrisAnnual jamboree can spring surprises and Masters champion could be at risk of repeating 2014 disappointmentSean IngleWed 17 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 14.35 ESTShareIt has been a 2025 for the ages for Rory McIlroy. He cemented his legacy by completing a career grand slamwith victory at the Masters. Then he carried Europe on his back at the Ryder Cup,defying the venom and spite of a braying Maga crowd. Now, though, he has one final devilish sandtrap to navigate: the curse of golf at the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award.Only twice in the 71-year history of the event has a golfer claimed the honour: the Welshman Dai Rees in 1957, when he captained Great Britain and Ireland to Ryder Cup success, and the Englishman Nick Faldo, following his Masters success in 1989. It is a pitiful return. Especially given athletics stars have won it 19 times, Formula One drivers eight, and football and tennis players seven apiece.The Anti-Sports Personality of the Year awards 2025Read more“I suppose if I don’t win it this time, I never will,” McIllroy admitted recently. But while he is piping-hot favourite to win the award, he has been stung before. In 2014 he was even more strongly fancied for Spoty glory, having won back-to-back majors, only to be pipped by Lewis Hamilton. When a sheepish Hamilton accepted the award, he told McIlroy: “I really wasn’t expecting it, because, dude, you had such an incredible year.”Golf’s barren record has barely improved since. Danny Willett finished last in the voting after winning the Masters in 2016 while Georgia Hall and Matt Fitzpatrick failed to make the shortlist after winning the Women’s Open in 2018 and the US Open in 2022.McIlroy’s supporters have started to suspect that 2025 is looking ominously like 2014. Earlier this month Lando Norriswas crowned Formula One world champion for the first time. He is pretty and popular and, like Hamilton 11 years ago, his Spoty odds have notably shortened.The other live contender, according to bookmakers, is the Lionesses’Chloe Kelly, who thumped home the winning spot-kick in England’s shootout win in the Euro 2025 final. Kelly would become the fifth woman in succession to win the award, following Kelly Hodgkinson last year, her fellow Lionesses Mary Earps and Beth Mead in 2023 and 2022 respectively, and the former US Open champion Emma Radacanu in 2021.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Chloe Kelly kept cool in the Euros final shootout and could now clinch the BBC gong.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAKelly admits it would be an honour to become part of that famous five. However, she acknowledges the broader picture – with her teammate Hannah Hampton, who made several extraordinary saves during the Euros, and the England rugby starEllie Kildunne, the driving force behindthe Red Roses’ World Cup triumphin September, also making the shortlist.“It shows women’s sport is on the up,” Kelly said. “We are putting bums on seats and making people see who we really are as athletes. I think it’s incredible. We’ve come so far as sportswomen and we’re here to stay.”View image in fullscreenFormula One’s new world champion Lando Norris is pretty and popular.Photograph: Frederic Le Floc H/DPPI/ShutterstockThe final contender, the 18-year-old darts prodigyLuke Littler, says he will not be attending the award as he focuses on defending his world title. Yet that may not necessarily be a barrier to success. In 2017, Mo Farah was regarded as a 50-1 underdog and so watched the event on his couch. No one looked more stunned when the cameras panned to him and his name was read out.View image in fullscreenSporting royalty Zara Phillips sprung a surprise in 2006.Photograph: Chris Radburn/PABut surprises can happen with an award that awkwardly fuses sporting prowess and likability together. Perceived wisdom is flipped on its head. Shocks occur. And the Great British public zigs when everyone expects it to zag. Back in 2006, for instance, the golfer Darren Clarke was seen as a shoo-in after helping Europe retain the Ryder Cup after the death of his wife, Heather, from cancer. That year a strong shortlist also featured Joe Calzaghe, who had remained unbeaten WBO super-middleweight champion for over a decade, and Beth Tweddle, Britain’s first world champion gymnast.And yet who won? Zara Phillips, then 11th in line to the throne. Sure, her victory in the World Equestrian Games played a part, but being a member of the royal family proved to be the clincher.This year it really should be McIlroy’s turn. Becoming only the sixth man in history to complete golf’s career grand slam should be enough by itself to win it. But his immense fortitude under fire at the Ryder Cup, when he and his wife were repeatedly abused, ought to seal the deal.The Northern Irishman is leaving nothing to chance. The last time he was on the shortlist, in December 2023, he didn’t bother showing up. “Whenever I saw the results, I forgot I was nominated,” he said a month later. “So that’s how much I think about it. It’s a popularity contest. It’s not what it once was.”This time round, though, he is playing the game. He will be at the awards show in Manchester on Thursday night, smiling and telling a few stories, hoping to charm a few last floating voters – and to put the finishing touches on an enthralling and extraordinary year.Explore more on these topicsBBC Sports Personality of the YearRory McIlroyLando NorrisLuke LittlerEngland women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ECDC, whose master plan does not include room for a football stadium, secured unanimous approval from Hammersmith and Fulham council last month.UK gives Abramovich final warning to transfer £2.5bn to Ukraine fundRead moreSuggestions that Tuesday’s development has in effect ended the chance of Chelsealeaving Stamford Bridge for Earl’s Courtare understood to be wide of the mark. Chelsea, whose owners recognise that Stamford Bridge’s capacity of 40,343 is not big enough, have held talks with various figures who have a say over the future of the 17.8 hectare (44 acres) site. Those discussions are yet to advance but the ECDC receiving planning permission does not stop other suitors from bidding for the land.Yet it is understood that resounding local support for the ECDC will make it harder politically and financially for Chelsea to change the direction of travel. A key figure inLondonpolitics said that it was time for Chelsea to “put up or shut up” and make clear whether they are serious about Earl’s Court. The estimated value of the land is expected to rise from £500m to £750m with planning permission in place.The ECDC does not yet have financial backing, meaning that construction cannot begin, but it could receive government support or investment from private companies. Sovereign wealth funds and international developers are likely to be interested in lucrative real estate in west London, potentially leaving Chelsea in an auction with wealthy competitors.Chelsea are considering their options but declined to comment. They have identified the Lillie Bridge depot as the area within the Earl’s Court site on which to build a stadium. Jason Gannon, the club’s chief executive, has met Transport for London, one of the partners that looks after the site, and the real estate developer Delancey. APG, the Dutch pension fund, is another stakeholder. But there is frustration that Chelsea did not make a formal and public declaration of their interest by bidding for Earl’s Court before the ECDC plans were approved.There has previously been plenty of private political goodwill for Chelsea. It is felt that a multiuse football stadium would benefit the local economy and there would still be the potential to build affordable housing on the site.There had been concerns over the cost of the ECDC’s plans but these have diminished in recent months. The site’s future has been one of the most contentious land issues in London. It is significant that there was no opposition to the ECDC’s plans at either council meeting, with a source saying this is the scheme that has garnered support from London politicians. Work is under way to secure funding.View image in fullscreenChelsea have played at Stamford Bridge since the club’s foundation in 1877.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will soon be asked to endorse the plans. It is unlikely he will reject a proposal including 4,000 new homes, with 35% of the housing designed to be affordable. His endorsement would be another main complication for Chelsea. There would be no room for a stadium if the ECDC construction begins.Chelsea need to act before construction contracts are in place. Building a bigger ground has been a key priority for the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership but little progress has been made. Tensions between Boehly and Clearlake, the majority shareholders, have been described as a major obstacle to overcome.Chelsea retain interest in Earl’s Court but do not want to be pressed into a deal and want to be sure that it is financially and logistically viable. The club’s position is they would need a business partner who could take on the project of building housing on the parts of the land away from the stadium.Chelsea may be forced to reassess their reluctance to buy all of the land. However, sources are confident that the club would not find it difficult to cover their costs if they secured a whole or majority interest. It has been stressed that partners would line up to work with them. A more pressing issue for Chelsea would be convincing the local community that a stadium would boost the economy and raise investment in London.Chelsea count cost of Club World Cup as report puts Europe-wide injury bill at £3bnRead moreFigures familiar with the issue believe Chelsea moving to Earl’s Court is the most realistic solution for the club. There is no other site available in west London and redeveloping Stamford Bridge is feasible but challenging, not least because the ground is next to a railway line. A stand-by-stand rebuild is unattractive and a complete demolition would mean Chelsea having to play at a temporary home for up to seven years. But Chelsea have not ruled out redeveloping Stamford Bridge and made space for such a project after buying a0.48 hectare site next to their ground from Stoll, a housing charity for veterans.Moving home for good would require Chelsea to strike an agreement with Chelsea Pitch Owners, which holds the freehold of Stamford Bridge stadium. The club will seek the approval of the CPO before bidding for land elsewhere. The risk of doing nothing is that Chelsea fall behind rivals with bigger stadiums with more potential for corporate and entertainment opportunities.Explore more on these topicsChelseaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The 36-year-old from Cham hopes that his success will inspire a wave of darts enthusiasts in his home country.“I have no words for this. I’m proud of myself. This is a great experience for all Swiss people. Hopefully we will get more Swiss people playing darts,” he said. Bellmont will face Australia’s Damon Heta in the second round. “Damon is a brilliant player, but I will give my best and we will see what happens on Sunday,” he told PDC.tv.View image in fullscreenRaymond van Barneveld cuts a forlorn figure as he leaves the stage.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAJames Wade, the world No 7 who is a four-time semi-finalist at Alexandra Palace, brushed aside Japan’s Ryusei Azemoto in straight sets.

Olivia Smith, Beth Mead and a Saar Janssen own goal helped Renée Slegers’ team end the league phase in fifth place.Slegers was delighted with her side’s maturity in front of a raucous crowd at the Den Dreef as they earned their fourth win of the campaign against the plucky hosts.“Bravery was important tonight and doing everything together,” the Arsenal manager said. “I’m really happy with how we wanted to go into the game and how that played out.Chelsea fight back to seal WCL quarter-final spot, Manchester United sink JuveRead more“In our planning, we could see a difference in how Leuven do things in the first half compared to the second – where they come out strong, aggressive, more opportunistic, create more chances and score more goals in the second half. They had that spell but we managed that. It was a team performance because when new players come on, we got new energy and new ideas … It’s not an easy place to come. We have seen how that’s been for the other teams. I’m really happy with how we maintained our intensity and quality.”The similarities between the last two European campaigns for Arsenal are striking. Last Christmas, they secured qualification in their penultimate group game in Oslo, a result that kickstarted their run tolifting the coveted trophy in Lisbonback in May. Slegers’ side have mirrored that journey this year, albeit via the new Champions League format; wrapping progression up with a game to go despite faltering in the league, leaving only their finishing position up for grabs.Despite the possibility of finishing in the top four still available, there were few nerves among the buoyant Arsenal fans. Around 1,000 were expected to gather in Leuven – 950 of whom had made the journey from England – and they appeared to be making the most of the famous Christmas market before kick-off. The atmosphere carried over into a sold-out Den Dreef, a record crowd for a women’s club match in Belgium.The confidence of the Gunners support was justified after an upturn in form. This transformation has been aided significantly by the return of Kim Little. Slegers made just two changes fromthe win over Evertonwith Taylor Hinds and Smith coming in, while Leah Williamson’s return is still being managed from the bench.View image in fullscreenOlivia Smith opens the scoring for Arsenal.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/ReutersThe holders came into this encounter as clear favourites, yet Arno Van den Abbeel’s team are a disciplined, industrious unit and have proved themselves to be no pushovers in their first ever Champions League appearance.Arsenal controlled proceedings from the start but were having to be patient in their buildup as they tried to tease Leuven’s defence out of position. The hosts were helped by the performance of their goalkeeper Lowiese Seynhaeve who made a series of smart saves.The breakthrough did, however, feel inevitable and with 18 minutes on the clock, the visitors made their pressure count. Smith’s initial effort was stopped by a big glove from Seynhaeve but the ball rebounded back into Smith’s path to rifle home.They made their lead comfortable shortly after when Mead struck her third goal in Europe this season. The England international is in a rich vein of form and as soon as she received the ball from Alessia Russo in the box, there was only going to be one outcome – a sweeping low finish into the far corner. It could have been more going into half-time but Mariona Caldentey, Mead and Lotte Wubben-Moy were all denied by the impressive goalkeeper.A double change from Van den Abbeel re-energised the hosts with the youthful Kadhiya De Ceuster bringing fresh impetus into the attack. The Belgian side started to increase their possession as they tried to progress up the field. Their best chances came after a corner created confusion but Sara Pusztai had two efforts blocked successively.Despite Leuven gaining more influence, Arsenal were always a threat. They found their third just two minutes after Slegers had rung the changes. Caitlin Foord was one of the three to enter the fray and was chief instigator, sending in the ball that Janssen unwittingly turned into her own net. Initially ruled out for offside, a fairly lengthy VAR check eventually confirmed that it should stand.View image in fullscreenSaar Janssen looks to the sky after her own goal gives Arsenal a 3-0 lead.Photograph: Omar Havana/APIt was a comfortable victory in the end for Arsenal who will discover their playoff opponents in Thursday’s draw.

The figure includes a 30% discount negotiated with the EU to reflect the UK’s popularity as a destination.“The discount is what enables us to say that, unlike our previous membership of Erasmus, we’re getting a fairer deal. What we are getting for UK learners is more balanced with what the EU gets, in terms of their ability to come to the UK,” she said.Smith said she would stress that Erasmus+ was not just for university students: “I’m going to keep talking about the fact that it is for apprentices and FE [further education] and youth groups and adult learners as well.”David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association ofColleges, said the announcement was “brilliant news” for staff and students of all ages in further education colleges.He added: “For students, it widens their perspective on the world, opening their eyes to different cultures and different ways of life, and for staff, the opportunity to learn from other countries on how they deliver technical education and skills is invaluable.”Nick Thomas-Symonds, the government’s EU relations minister, reached the agreement after talks with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič , as part of Keir Starmer’s “reset” in relations with the EU.In a joint statement, they said: “The United Kingdom association to Erasmus+ in 2027 would offer significant opportunities across the education, training, sport and youth sectors for individuals in the United Kingdom and theEuropean Union, particularly for those in the younger generation.“The European Commission and the United Kingdom look forward to these opportunities becoming available. They are pleased that the specific terms of this association, including mutually agreed financial terms, represent a fair balance between the UK’s contributions and the benefits the programme offers and pave the way for United Kingdom participation in the programme in 2027.”Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of “throwing billions of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers’ money on rejoining Erasmus, instead of taking advantage of our Brexit freedoms to support trade with the rest of the world, boost investment and drive economic growth”.For university students, the decision means they can spend up to a year studying at European universities as part of their UK degree courses without paying extra fees, while UK universities will be able to accept European students under the same terms.Those travelling to Europe under the scheme will be eligible for a grant to help with the costs of living abroad, including those studying at FE colleges or on work placements.Alex Stanley, a vice-president of the National Union ofStudents, said: “Since the UK left the programme, the number of UK students studying in Europe has plummeted, and as has the number of students from Europe studying in the UK.UK to rejoin EU’s Erasmus student exchange programmeRead more“But now, the next generation of students from the UK would be able to experience it all, and campuses across the country could benefit from the perspectives of Erasmus students coming to the UK.”The Erasmus scheme started in 1987 as a university exchange programme but has expanded to include work and training placements, as well as funding for school trips and cultural events.The UKleft Erasmus after Brexitin 2020, with Boris Johnson claiming the programme did not offer value for money. Since then university students in Northern Ireland have been able to access the scheme with assistance from Ireland’s government.Explore more on these topicsStudentsEuropean UnionCollegesFurther educationUniversitiesHigher educationBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

He was seriously injured in a subsequent shootout with police and his father, Sajid, 50, was shot dead.Australian police have also charged Naveed with one count of committing a terrorist act, which investigators allege may have been “inspired by” Islamic State after indications that the pair were radicalised in some way before the attack.An IS flag was allegedly found in the car they used to travel to Bondi from a short-term rental they were living in elsewhere in Sydney, and Naveed’s prior connections with radical Islamists in Sydney were investigated by Australia’s spy agency, Asio, leading to suggestions that they sought instruction or training in the Philippines during their stay, from 1-28 November.Sajid travelled to the country on an Indian passport while his son used his Australian passport.Map of PhilippinesHowever, Philippine police visited GV Hotel in Davao City on Wednesday afternoon and found that the pair stayed in the same room from 1-28 November – the entire duration of their visit to the country. Police also interviewed hotel staff who had interacted with them.One hotel worker, Jenelyn Sayson, told the Guardian the Akrams did not behave suspiciously during their stay.They initially booked a seven-night stay online but requested extensions on arrival and continued to extend their stay until checking out on 28 November, according to Sayson, a front desk staff member who served them during their stay. The two arrived carrying one big piece of luggage and a backpack, she said.They rarely left the hotel and only for about an hour at a time, apparently staying in Davao City, which lies in the southern province of Mindanao.“They would just go out and come back. Just the two of them …. We never saw them talk to any visitors,” said Sayson, who regularly saw the father and son come in and out of the lobby.She recognised them from the media coverage of the attack, although she said Naveed’s hair was longer when he was in the Philippines.They were not chatty, but the son occasionally greeted front-desk employees. “Naveed asked one of the hotel staff where they could buy durian. The hotel staff told them they could buy those in Magsaysay and Bankerohan, but they later told the hotel staff that they were not able to buy durian,” she said.9:39Ten minutes of terror: how the Bondi mass shooting unfolded in real time – videoHousekeeping staff would find rubbish from fast food chains in their bins. They did not leave behind papers or documents. “We thought they probably had business here in the city since they would go out and just come back again,” she said.They did not have their own vehicle. “We would see them cross the street and walk towards the next block. We never saw them take a ride or saw anyone pick them up here at the hotel.”The Philippines national security adviser, Eduardo Año, said the father and son were believed to have remained in the city. “No evidence that they went outside Davao. Our investigation is still ongoing,” Año said.He dismissed reports that they had undergone training in the Philippines and travelled to Marawi City, the site of an Islamic State-linked siege in 2017.Reasons for Bondi suspects’ Philippines trip remain unclear, but Islamic State is active thereRead more“A mere visit does not support allegations of terrorist training, and the duration of their stay would not have allowed for any meaningful and structured training,” Año said, adding that the Philippines was coordinating with counterparts in Australia to determine the purpose of their visit.A spokesperson for the president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, rejected what he called a “misleading characterisation of the Philippines as an Isis training hotspot” following a report that the attackers underwent “military-style” training in the country.The Philippine military said the number of IS-linked militants was down to about 50, distributed in provinces in Mindanao. There has been no record of foreign terrorist activities in recent years, its spokesperson said. “That’s why we cannot see the credibility of reports that the gunmen … underwent training here,” said Gen Romeo Brawner.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackPhilippinesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The County Councils Network accused ministers of “cherrypicking” – and predicgted it would leave many of its members in financial trouble.Map showing council spending power in EnglandA group of wealthy central London authorities with relatively low council tax bills and high levels of financial reserves – and which are expected to lose out significantly under the new arrangements – will be allowed to set council tax from April above the 4.99% maximum increase.Some Reform-led councils such as Kent are net gainers under the new “fair funding” distribution formula, but it is unclear whether the boost will be sufficient to enable them to meet their political aspiration of cutting council tax bills.The 2026-27 local government finance settlement is unlikely to stem the crisis in council budgets, with increasing numbers of struggling town halls this year likely to request special financial help from ministers to balance their books.The settlement, announced on Wednesday afternoon, gives little detail on how the government will deal with English upper-tier councils’ accumulated deficits on special educational needs services, which areforecast to reach £14bnby 2028.Six councils with historically low council tax bills will have the option of setting above-maximum rises in April: Wandsworth, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, City of London, and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.The government believes these local authorities will not automatically have to raise council tax rates above the current limit to make up for the loss in grant funding as they have high levels of reserves and can levy second home premiums on wealthy residents.Chart showing councils’ core spending powerSeveral Reform-led council have sought to avoid putting up council tax next April by the full 4.99%. The Kent county council leader, Linden Kemkaran, revealed in aleaked internal videoin October this aspiration was “the best thing that we can do to show that Reform can actually run something as big as Kent council”.She added: “Let’s not forget we are the shop window in Kent county council. People are looking at us, they are judging us every single day, every single minute of every single day. Nigel [Farage, the Reform party leader] knows that. He is super aware that we are the flagship council.”But at other Reform-led authorities like Durham and Warwickshire, cabinet papers have revealed reduced council tax rises will have to be paid for by millions of pounds of additional cuts to already threadbare council services, and could putthe viability of the councilat risk.The settlement follows months of horse-trading between Whitehall and local councils. Initial modelling by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in August showed a number of Labour-run inner London councils would lose about 20% of their grant funding under the new formula.A subsequent change to the formula that acknowledged the capital’s exceptionally high housing costs and dense concentrations of child poverty significantly reduced London authorities’ exposure to the changes – but this 11th-hour shift has enraged some councils in Labour’s northern heartlands.“The decision to use housing costs as a key deprivation measure, which leaves London’s suburbs as the biggest winners from this review and many of the most-deprived communities facing further cuts after a decade of austerity, is especially disappointing,” said Sir Stephen Houghton, the chair of the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentEnglandLondonManchesterBradfordLutonCoventrynewsShareReuse this content"

That inquiry expanded after Trump’s win in 2024, looking for signs that Willis had coordinated with the January 6 congressional committee while using federal grant money to do so.They tried to overturn the 2020 US election. Now, they hold power in Trump’s WashingtonRead more“You want something to investigate as a legislature? Investigate how many times they’ve called me the N-word,” Willis said during her contentious testimony. “Why don’t you investigate them writing on my house? Why don’t you investigate the fact that my house has been swatted? If you want something to do with your time that makes sense. And you can use all this in your campaign ad – you attacked Fani Willis. What have you done, sir? Nothing.”The committee has the power to amendGeorgialaw and create new legislation, but no power to sanction Willis directly.“We know what happened in this case,” said state senator Greg Dolezal, vice-chairman of the special committee on investigations and a Republican candidate for Georgia’s lieutenant governor. “We laid out a timeline today of coordination with the J6 committee through Nathan Wade’s billing.”Dolezal was referring to the House January 6 committee, which unanimously voted in 2022 to refer Trump and his lawyer John Eastman to the US Department of Justice for prosecution. Eastman was subsequently one of 19 people indicted in Fulton county in the election interference racketeering case.In previous testimony before the committee, Wade said he said that he had been in Washington while the January 6 committee met, and records of his billing note that he had met with the committee.Dolezal took note of Willis’s combative testimony, both during and after the hearing. “The DA wants to make this about everything other than the fact that they coordinated with the White House to bring lawfare against President Trump,” he said.From Willis’s perspective, the committee’s questions were connected to the inquiries of the House judiciary committee and Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, who began an inquiry into Willis’s prosecution of Trump, questioning its political motivation and alleging misuse of federal funds.Willis asked Dolezal mid-hearing: “Are you and Jim Jordan working together?” Dolezal said he had no contact with him.Committees in the US House and Senate have demanded documents from Willis’s office, which she has either ignored or resisted to date, although the end of the election interference case may change her legal calculus.Dolezal showed documents indicating that Wade had been paid from forfeiture money. Willis said her understanding was that he had been paid from professional services funds, but that she essentially “turned in a bill” to the county and let them sort it out.Dolezal then asked why she hired outside counsel for the Trump case.“Because we were drowning,” she replied. All her attorneys had major cases, with the prosecution of the murders of Kennedy Maxie and Secoriea Turner – two children – of the highest priority, she said. “It became obvious to me that I needed a lawyer that could manage this team,” she said.Nine attorneys were working on the case at the peak, Willis said.“But different people are needed for different things, and the people of Fulton County elected me to make those decisions,” she said.At times, Dolezal cut off Willis’s microphone and tried to silence the objections of former governor Roy Barnes, who sat beside her as her counsel.The White House has directed prosecutors to attack Trump’s perceived political enemies, with indictments attempted against Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, former FBI director James Comey and others this year. Dolezal said he has not spoken with federal officials about the state investigation, but “my guess is that they’re going to find this link to the January 6th commission relatively interesting and I think that they’re also going to probably look at the use of the grant funds”.Willis said she would be undeterred by threats.“I’m not Marjorie Taylor Greene,” Willis said. “I’m not going to quit in a month because someone threatened me.”Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaUS politicsDonald TrumpUS elections 2020newsShareReuse this content"

Someone on the boat bobbing at a distance offshore passes round a pair of binoculars and yes! – there it is. It’s a huge Mediterranean monk seal,one of the world’s rarest marine mammals, which at up to 2.8 metres and over 300kg (660lbs), is also one of the world’s largest types of seal.Piperi, where the seal has come ashore, is a strictly guarded island in the National Marine Park of Alonissos and Northern Sporades, Greece’s largest marine protected area (MPA) and a critical breeding habitat for the seals. Only researchers are allowed within three miles of its shores, with permission from the government’s Natural Environment and Climate Change Agency.With a global population of under 1,000 individuals,Monachus monachusislisted as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, reclassified from endangered in 2023, after decades of conservation efforts helped raise numbers. According to theHellenic Society for Protection of the Monk Seal (MOm), Greece is home to about 500 monk seals (up from 250 in the 1990s),half of the global population, so has a uniquely important role to play in the future of these rare mammals. This seems fitting given that seals were once thought to have been under the protection of mythical gods Poseidon and Apollo and so have a special place in Greek culture.Monk seals have been hunted in the Mediterranean since prehistoric times for their pelts, meat and blubber. While this threat has receded in Greece, others –entanglement in fishing gear,food depletion,pollutionandhabitat loss– have not. Now, according to conservationists, a very modern peril is growing exponentially and putting that fragile recovery at risk: Greece’s burgeoning marine leisure industry. Unregulated tourism ishaving a negative impacton a mammal that is sensitive to human disturbance, say wildlife groups.Aerial footage of a red boat and a seal swimming in clear blue-green waterA monk seal surfaces close to a research boat. Video: Joan Gonzalvo/Tethys Research InstituteThis summer several initiatives were implemented to turn this around, includingSeal Greece, a national education campaign. At about the same time, the islet of Formicula, a key seal habitat in the Ionian Sea, was shielded ahead of the busy summer season by a strict 200-metre no entry zone. In October, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, confirmed two large-scale MPAs are to go ahead. If properly managed (and so far the management structure is unclear), these MPAs could offer a lifeline to the species.Back on the waters around Piperi, Angelos Argiriou, a freelance warden and marine biologist, points as the boat passes a shore monitored by camera. “We often see the seals resting on this beach,” he says. “The fact that they feel safe enough to haul out [rest] here in the open is a really good sign that the protection measures are working.”View image in fullscreenA pup that was found orphaned is prepared for release at the Hellenic Society for Protection of the Monk Seal.Photograph: P. DendrinosSeals began to be protected in Greece in the late 1980s, with the Hellenic Society for Protection of the Monk Seal, which has rescued more than 40 orphaned or injured seals to date.“Our rehab centre has really helped the recovery of the species,” says Mom’s president, Panos Dendrinos. “Last year, we saw a rehabilitated female with a new pup. If you save one female, she might have 20 pups in her lifetime.”Monk sealsonce commonly gathered on beachesbut many moved into caves relatively recently because of human pressure. Although pupping caves might have provided shelter from people, they have often proved an unsuitable habitat in which to raise young – violent surf can smash them against rocks, drown them or sweep them out to sea. And caves no longer provide reliable hiding places. Once-remote coastlines are now accessible to everyone from day trippers on hired boats to private yachts anchored in the seals’ habitat.“A week after giving birth, monk seal mothers go fishing, leaving their pup alone for hours,” says Dendrinos. “If someone goes inside, the pup is liable to panic and abandon the cave; its mother is unlikely to find it.”View image in fullscreenAn adult female with her pup on Piperi. The island is in a marine park that protects seals so they can start to use beaches again.Photograph: P. DendrinosAfter 40 years of monitoring the Alonissos MPA, Dendrinos says his society “now see seals using open beaches systemically”.As another key habitat for seals, Formicula will be part of the new Ionian MPA. The islet is at the heart of one of the world’s busiest sailing grounds but unlike its better-known neighbours, Meganisi and Cephalonia, it did not appear much on the tourist radar until recently.Marine biologist Joan Gonzalvo fromTethys Research Instituteexplains how tourism has taken its toll on the area. “Six, seven, eight years ago we had encounters almost every day,” he recalls. “We would see five, six seals in the water at once, socialising, chasing each other.”But with the sightings came the tourists. “What was exciting at first quickly turned into a nightmare,” he says.The hordes came, looking for “seal experiences”, he says. Instead of studying the animals, Gonzalvo found himself recording humans chasing seals. On two occasions, people entered breeding caves, causing the separation of mothers from pups. In both cases, the pups disappeared. One day in August 2024, he says he recorded more than 50 boats around the islet’s tiny shoreline. “Nowadays,” he says, “we are lucky if we see only one or two individual seals.”View image in fullscreenSeals were once thought to have been under the protection of mythical gods Poseidon and Apollo and so have a special place in Greek culture.Photograph: Ugo Mellone/The Wild LineAs we are talking Gonzalvo spots a seal and takes out his camera. He recognises her immediately. “Mm17003,” he says, citing the number of one of more than 40 sealshe has catalogued online. As the seal rolls through the water, boats pull up and anchor in the new no-entry zones while tourists swim near the protected caves.Unlike the Alonissos MPA, there are no wardens patrolling Formicula and, although it is not his job, Gonzalvo politely points out to the boat’s skippers that they are in a forbidden area.‘Britain’s wildlife safari’: baby boom in Norfolk as seal colonies flourishRead more“It’s early days,” he says. “But the inactivity [the absence of patrols] worries me. We need serious investment on law enforcement.”In Greece, NGOs have repeatedly raised the issue of “paper parks”, with inadequate implementation.A studypublished last year by nine environmental organisations highlighted “only 12 (out of 174) marine Natura 2000 sites [EU protected areas] have a protective regime”, but even those were fragmented or temporary.The hope is that the new MPAs bring patrols. “The Natural Environment and Climate Change Agency needs more boats, more people, more authority,” Dendrinos says, adding that the wardens currently report to port police, “a process that is time consuming and ineffective”.At Formicula, Gonzalvo worries that time is running out. “If we are not capable of protecting this important habitat, a tiny drop in the middle of the Ionian Sea, for one of the most charismatic and endangered marine mammals on the planet, there is very little hope for anything else we want to protect in our oceans.”View image in fullscreenThe sight of the animals playing in the water drew crowds of tourists looking for ‘seal experiences’.Photograph: Marco-Colombo/The Wild LineExplore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansWildlifeMarine lifeGreeceOceansConservationEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their disappearance is being investigated by several police forces and the NationalWildlifeCrime Unit.The RSPB is offering a £10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction. Dr James Robinson, RSPB chief operating officer, said: “The RSPB is shocked with this news, so much so that we are offering an overall reward of £10,000 for information that leads to a conviction in these cases. Eagle tag-data is so precise that the point of death and any subsequent movement of the tag will be known to investigators, so we urge the public to come forward with information. Raptor persecution has no place in modern society, let alone threatening such an important UK government-backed reintroduction scheme like this.”The eagles have gone missing in Sussex, Wales andScotland. The chick, which hatched in the wild earlier this year in Sussex, was one of the first white-tailed eagles to fledge in England for hundreds of years.It is thought someone could have harmed or killed the birds, as the satellite trackers that allow the reintroduction team to track their location and movements had been cut off. Two of the eagles had their trackers cut off with a sharp instrument with the equipment found dumped near their last recorded location. In the third case, the tag stopped sending information on 8 November and no sighting of the bird has been recorded since.White-tailed eagles are Britain’s biggest bird of prey. They were driven to extinction in Britain in the early 20th century, after being shot and poisoned to protect shooting interests.Conservationist Roy Dennis and his foundation have been working with Forestry England to return the birds to England, and since 2019, 45 white-tailed eagles have been released. Several breeding pairs have formed, with six chicks hatching in the wild for the first time since the 1780s. Because the project is new, with few birds fledged, targeting them in this way puts the eagles’ reintroduction at risk.The conservationists leading the project are devastated by the news. Tim Mackrill, from the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation, said: “We monitor the satellite data, showing the bird’s minute-by-minute movements, on a daily basis and always investigate any suspicious or unusual data. It was devastating to find the stolen and dumped tags, particularly for the chick in Sussex, who fledged this summer and had only just begun its life.“So many people in the area had shared the joy of seeing these birds breed again after hundreds of years and our ongoing monitoring has shown how well they were fitting into the landscape. To have that destroyed just a few months later is deeply shocking.”The birds are sometimes killed illegally by those with game interests, because they are thought to predate on birds bred for shooting such as pheasants and partridges, say campaigners. Disturbing the birds or their nests is a criminal offence.Three police forces are working to solve the mystery of the missing birds. On 26 September, a satellite tag belonging to a fledged eagle chick was recovered from the River Rother, near Petersfield in Hampshire. It had been removed from the bird using a sharp instrument. Sussex police are looking for information from anyone who was in or around Harting Down and Petersfield on the evening of 20 September.On 13 September, a satellite tag belonging to a white-tailed eagle was recovered near Gwgia Reservoir, Tregynon, and Dyfed Powys police inWalesare asking anyone who was at or around the reservoir between 11am and 1pm or on access land near Bryn y Fawnog between noon and 3pm on 13 September to come forward.Another eagle’s tag stopped transmitting in the Moorfoot Hills area south of Edinburgh. The last transmission was sent on 8 November and Police Scotland are investigating.Steve Egerton-Read, the white-tailed eagle project officer for Forestry England, said: “We are returning this lost species to the English landscape and have had so much support from the public. These special birds are helping people connect with natural world and showing how with a little bit of help nature can thrive. We are asking the public to show this support again by encouraging anyone who has information that may help the police investigation to come forward.”Ruth Tingay, ofRaptor Persecution, said: “These reports are so depressingly familiar these days, we’ve pretty much come to expect them. Although there’s something particularly sickening about killing a white-tailed eagle, it’s no less a crime, in the eyes of the law, than killing a more common species like a buzzard or a sparrowhawk.“There’s no doubt whatsoever that at least two of these eagles were the victims of illegal persecution, given the clear evidence that their satellite tags had been cut off and crude attempts were made to hide them.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeEnglandWalesScotlandBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

The loopholes allow carmakers to sell more hybrids, which are more profitable for them, amid fierce competition from rivals, including from China.Referring to the changes to the rules introduced in the spring, McDonald said: “We’ve got to be responsible to the industry, and we’ve also got to be responsive to where the market is as well.”The government spokesperson said: “We have not brought forward the ZEV Mandate review. As previously committed, we will publish the review in early 2027 which means preparatory work will begin next year so stakeholders can be properly engaged.“Zero-emission vehicles are good for family finances and good for the environment – saving typical drivers as much as £1,500 a year on fuel and the transition to EVs is crucial to delivering jobs and growth, improved air quality, energy security, as well as quieter cleaner towns and cities.”McDonald was speaking as he visited Nissan’s factory in Sunderland, where the Japanese carmaker hasbegun production of its latest electric car.The launch of the third-generation Leaf, which was the first mass-market battery electric car to be built in the UK, is seen as a crucial step in the British car industry’s move away from petrol and diesel.Nissan has already produced more than 280,000 Leaf models at the plant in north-east England, which is Britain’s largest car factory.Electric car sales have increased rapidly in recent years. They represented more than a fifth of the UK market in July.However, carmakers previously overestimated demand for EVs, meaning they have had to lower their prices to attract buyers.Ministers said they would not weaken plans to ban the sale of new petrol or diesel cars from 2035, after theEU announcedplans to water down the timing of the phaseout of new combustion engine vehicles.The EU confirmed on Tuesday it would no longer require carmakers to ensure that 100% of cars and vans produced had zero emissions from 2035.After heavy pressure from the car industry and leaders of several EU member states including Germany and Italy, the European Commission has promised to reduce this requirement to 90%. This will allow 10% of production after 2035 to be plug-in hybrid electric cars, or even pure combustion engine vehicles.In a trade-off with industry, carmakers will have to compensate with other green measures on the factory floor, including the use of green steel made in Europe or use of biofuels in non-electric vehicles.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsManufacturing sectorEuropeEuropean UnionGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their miraculous spots do not indicate poison, as people sometimes assume, but are thought to be used as a mode of communication, according to Rajkumar K P, a Zoological Society of London fellow and researcher.In early 2020, he found seven members of the “magical” species inthe Western Ghats rainforestin India, but could not visit them during the Covid pandemic. When he went back later, the frogs had disappeared, according to a report from the ZSL.View image in fullscreenPhotographers are accused of breaking the logs that were home to the frogs.Photograph: Rajkumar K P/Zoological Society of London“The big beautiful fallen log that was there was completely broken and misplaced,” Rajkumar said. The vegetation was also trampled, and the frogs, whose homes had been destroyed, were nowhere to be found.At first he suspected brown mongooses of causing the damage, but they are not strong enough to overturn a log. Then he asked his tracker if he had seen anyone.“He mentioned there were a couple of photographers visiting that location. Several small groups. So later I contacted my other trackers, and they started telling me everything that had happened.”These nature photographers had been turning over logs in their search for the endangered species, according to the trackers. When they found them, they would capture and prop up the frogs for photos. But they didn’t wear gloves, even though these delicate creatures breathe through their skin and are incredibly sensitive.One tracker told Rajkumar that two small galaxy frogs had died after being handled for too long by photographers.“He said they would take the animal to some nice background or mossy log to take the photograph, relocating it from one place to another to get better photos. On that day they got five or six frogs and two of them died.”View image in fullscreenThe spots on the frogs’ skin are thought to be a mode of communication.Photograph: Rajkumar K P/Zoological Society of LondonSearching again and again at the site in the following months, Rajkumar could not find any more galaxy frogs. He felt “helpless” in the face of the injustice.“The forest department officers try to prevent these kinds of groups coming. But they use higher officials – politicians, high court judges, or something like that – to allow them to take photographs,” he said.“I fell in love with these frogs after seeing them. You feel like they’re jet black in colour, but when you put them under light you can find all the stars – like galaxies on their bodies. It’s just magical.”Dr Benjamin Tapley, ZSL’s curator of reptiles and amphibians, said the galaxy frogs are likely an “ancient”, “irreplaceable” branch on the tree of life.“I grimace every time I see a photo come up on my feed of a galaxy frog,” said Tapley. “I just wonder what happened? How was that taken? How was the habitat impacted?“We’re really hopeful that we can encourage people to act more ethically so that incredible species like the galaxy frog can continue to thrive for millions more years.”Explore more on these topicsAmphibiansIndiaSouth and central AsiaAnimalsZoologynewsShareReuse this content"

It is seeking permission to challenge the admission regulations.Daniel Stilitz KC, for the City ofLondon, said Sex Matters had “steamed in”, bringing a premature legal action at a time when its officials were actively consulting pond users on its entry rules.Public bodies are redrafting their policies on single-sex spaces in response to the supreme court’s ruling in April that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.Hampstead Heath has three swimming ponds: one for women, one for men and a mixed area. People who identify as transgender, including those who describe themselves as gender fluid or non-binary, have been allowed to swim in the ponds of their preferred gender since at least 2019, in accordance with guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission.In response to the supreme court ruling, the City of London concluded that the earlier EHRC guidance had misinterpreted the law. It withdrew its gender identity policy and embarked on aconsultation process, gathering more than 38,000 responses to a review aimed at assessing how best to design future admission policies for the ponds, the court heard.The results of the consultation are expected in January and a new policy is due to be published in March. In the interim, signs were erected outside the ladies’ ponds in July stating that the area could be used by women and those who identified as women. A sign outside the men’s pond explained that men and those who identified as trans men were welcome.Sex Matters argues that this interim position, allowing swimmers entry into the ponds on the basis of self-identification of gender rather than biological sex, is unlawful. The EHRC has prepared new advice about how public bodies should balance competing demands for single-sex services and trans inclusion but it has not been published.The charity included a list of complaints from female swimmers about the trans-inclusive policy in its legal submissions. The court heard details about the layout of the changing rooms in the ladies’ pond, which Tom Cross KC, acting for Sex Matters, said were mostly a communal space, with shared showers, involving full nudity.Although the trans-inclusive policy applies to the men’s and ladies’ ponds, Cross argued that the admission rules treated “women less favourably than men because an individual woman is at greater risk of suffering the detriment of her privacy, dignity or safety being compromised than is an individual man”.Stilitz KC said the application from Sex Matters was “busybodying” and “completely jumps the gun in circumstances where the admission arrangements for the ponds are currently under active review”.He told the court that 38,000 people had “contributed to that exercise” and “the report on the results of that consultation are due in less than a month”, adding: “All the Corporation of London has done is maintain the status quo for a brief period before it can properly and thoroughly reconsider the admission arrangements”.Segregating the ponds according to biological sex could be discriminatory to trans people, he said. “We have heard a lot about the risk of sex discrimination and nothing about the risk of gender reassignment discrimination, which is in play here,” he added.Stilitz noted that, as well as communal showers, the women’s ponds had a room with a lock, where people could shower and change in private.Mrs Justice Lieven said she would rule on whether Sex Matters should be given permission to have a full hearing to appeal against the City of London policy in January.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderLondonCity of LondonGenderSwimmingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Green party peer Jenny Jones later joined the protesters outside the jail warning that Zuhrah’s condition could be life-threatening.An ambulance eventually arrived to take her to hospital on Wednesday afternoon.Prisoners for Palestine said Zuhrah had reported severe chest pain, breathlessness and abdominal and lower back pain.It claimed her vital signs had been taken only intermittently and she had received inadequate electrolytes since returning from hospital on Friday, due to HMP Bronzefield reportedly running out of electrolytes.According toa letter sent by lawyers for the hunger strikers, the previous hospitalisation came after Zuhrah spent a night begging for an ambulance, having collapsed and drifted in and out of consciousness.She is one of two prisoners, along with Amy Gardiner-Gibson, also at Bronzefield, who have been refusing food for 46 days – the same amount of time as Martin Hurson when he became the sixth of 10IRA hunger strikersto die in 1982.The other prisoners taking part are Heba Muraisi (day 44), Teuta Hoxha (day 38), Kamran Ahmed (day 37) and Lewie Chiaramello (day 12), who has diabetes.All are being held for alleged involvement in Palestine Action protests and will have spent well over a year in jail –the pre-trial custody time limit is six months– before being tried. Their demands include immediate bail, endingthe ban on Palestine Actionand stopping restrictions on their communications.On Wednesday, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions whether he would meet representatives of the hunger strikers. Starmer declined, echoing the response of the justice minister Jake Richards when Corbyn asked him the same question 24 hours earlier.An HMP Bronzefield spokesperson said they could not provide information about specific individuals, but added: “Any prisoner refusing food receives regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, as well as being offered mental health support.”The spokesperson said prisoners were managed in line with policies and procedures governing the entire UK prison estate, including assessment of individual risks and security status, and that they could raise specific complaints directly with the prison.Central and North West London NHS foundation trust, which is responsible for commissioning healthcare within the prison, referred the Guardian to the Ministry of Justice.An MoJ spokesperson said: “Prisoners’ wellbeing is continually assessed, and appropriate action is taken, including hospital treatment where required.“His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has assured ministers that all cases of prisoner food refusal are being managed in accordance with the relevant policy, and with appropriate medical assessment and support – consistent with prisoner rights.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Essex police is also currently assessing the allegations.Nigel Farage told to apologise by 26 of his school contemporariesRead moreThe whistleblower, Richard Everett, a former Reform councillor and member of Farage’s campaign team, alleges the party’s official returns report came just £400 under the spending limit set by electoral law, and the undeclared spending would have put it above the cap.In her letter to the commission, Turley said: “If expenditure that ought to have been declared in Mr Farage’s return in Clacton has been included in Reform’s national spending return, or elements of national party expenditure have not been declared at all, there is a real risk that Reform’s party spending return is inaccurate or incomplete, which is a matter for the Electoral Commission.”Reform has strenuously denied the allegations, with a party spokesperson having said: “The party denies breaking electoral law. We look forward to clearing our name.”The spokesperson also described Everett as a “disgruntled former councillor”. Everett defected from the Conservatives to Reform last year, and has since left the party to sit as an independent.Richard Tice refuses to condemn Reform mayoral candidate’s comments about David LammyRead moreTurley has urged Farage to address the allegations personally, saying they are “incredibly serious” and claiming that he is “treating the British people with contempt by staying silent – he needs to urgently come out of hiding on this issue”.It was reportedlast weekthat Everett first made his complaint to the Metropolitan police.The force has previously said: “The Met received an online report on Friday 5 December relating to alleged misreported expenditure by a candidate in connection with the 2024 general election.”Later the same day, Essex police said: “We are assessing a report relating to alleged misreported expenditure by a political party in connection with the 2024 general election, following a referral to us by the Met police.”While neither police force named a party or a candidate, the Met said the transfer to the Essex force had come about “due to the location of the alleged offences”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageElectoral CommissionGeneral election 2024General electionsnewsShareReuse this content"

They issued a yellow warning across a large area of central and northernEnglandwhere the fog would be slow to clear, which remained in effect until 10am.Patches of particularly dense fog formed across the East Midlands and Cambridgeshire, where poor visibility was expected to lead to difficult travel conditions.View image in fullscreenPink fog enveloped the countryside at sunrise in Oxfordshire.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLike clouds, fog is caused by tiny water droplets suspended in the air. It can appear pink because the water droplets scatter short wavelengths of sunlight – the blues and greens – more than the longer red wavelengths, allowing the red to dominate.The pink colour is usually seen at the start and end of the day when the sun is low on the horizon and sunlight passes through more atmosphere than when it is higher in the sky.A Met Office spokesperson said: “Fog is essentially a cloud at ground level made up of tiny water droplets. When the sun is low on the horizon, its light travels through more of the atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths are scattered out, leaving the longer red wavelengths to dominate. When this filtered light shines through fog, it gives the fog a pink or rosy hue.”View image in fullscreenCobwebs covered with dewdrops as a pink fog enveloped the countryside at sunrise, Dunsden, Oxfordshire.Despite the surreal appearance, it is nothing more than the physics of light playing out at sunrise and sunset.“It’s important to note that pink fog is purely an optical effect,” the spokesperson said. “It does not indicate any unusual weather hazard beyond normal fog risks, such as reduced visibility.”The phenomenon has been spotted in the UK before. In 2019, the early morning sky turned pink as fog formed across parts of south-west England.View image in fullscreenBut Dr Claire Ryder, an associate professor at the University of Reading, said the effect was rare because multiple conditions had to be perfect for the pink colour to arise.“This effect is caused by a reddish sunrise being ‘filtered’ by the fog. The sunrise produces the red light, by removing the bluer colours, and then the small fog droplets scatter the light more, dimming the effect, giving it a muted pink glow,” she said.“It’s quite interesting and rare: you need the fog to occur at the exact sunrise or sunset time, and also for the fog to consist of a perfect thickness, or droplet concentration and droplet size, to get the right effect. Too thick a fog would block out all the light, and too thin a fog wouldn’t mute the sunrise colours very much.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The confirmation makes an advocate of Mars missions and an ally ofSpaceXCEOElon Muskthe space agency’s 15th leader.The vote on Isaacman, who Trump nominated, removed and then renamed for the post ofNasaadministrator this year, passed 67-30, two weeks after he told senators in his second hearing that Nasa must pick up the pace in beating China back to the moon this decade.Acting Nasa chief Sean Duffy, who also leads the US transportation department, congratulated Isaacman on Twitter/X, wishing Isaacman “success as he begins his tenure and leads NASA as we go back to the Moon in 2028 and beat China”.Duffy had been lobbying to move the space agency under the permanent purview of his own bureau, a fight he lost with Isaacman’s confirmation. Duffy’s consolidation efforts sparked conflict with Musk at about the same time that the transport secretary had said that SpaceX had fallen behind on its contracts with Nasa andlooked to the private company’s competitors, in particular Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, for alternatives.Isaacman’s nomination for the role was previously pulled back in May during a period when Musk and Trump were in a public feud. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that Isaacman’s donations to Democratic candidateswere the reasonsbehind the move. Isaacman re-emerged as a candidate in recent months, however, and,according to the Wall Street Journal, he tapped allies within the administration to promote his cause.Isaacman’s fortune came from founding a payment processing startup called Shift4, which now handles billions of transactions each year. He has flown on two SpaceX missions, both of which he funded himself and contained all-civilian crews. The most recentwas in 2024, a mission that involved the first spacewalk conducted by a private company.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationNasaSpaceSpaceXElon MuskUS politicsUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

However, my words did not reflect that respect – in this country I am a guest and I forgot to act like one.”He is thelatest British chefto land in hot water for insulting or meddling with national cuisines, includingJamie Oliver’s addition of chorizo to Spanish paella, Mary Berry adding white wine to spaghetti bolognese and Nigella Lawson putting cream in her carbonara.In Mexico, where food is considered a national treasure, the comments struck a particularly sensitive nerve.“Mexicans are very defensive of their culture and their traditions,” said Rodrigo Sierra, whose Instagram video reacting to Hart’s comments went viral. “I’m sure Richard Hart didn’t mean it maliciously or out of complete disrespect. What he did do was make a very ignorant comment, without considering the consequences.”The remarks come at a tense moment in Mexico City, where many have accused foreign arrivals of driving up rent for locals, a phenomenon that has led to furious and at timesviolent protests in the capital.Commentators took particular issue with Hart’s criticism of thebolillo,a white roll that is a staple of everyday Mexican food, whether for makingtortasor mopping up the remnants of traditional dishes.“Thebolillois a popular bread, a bread that has served most Mexicans, lower classes, middle class, upper class, but it’s a cheap bread because it has to be cheap, it’s a practical bread, it is an everyday bread,” said Sierra. “Classifying it as an ‘ugly’ bread just because it serves the needs of a population that can’t spend 100 pesos on the bread that this baker sells in his bakery seems to me like a very poor point of view.”The 93-year-old Englishwoman who is the rock star of Mexican cookingRead moreSierra noted that Mexico had more than 600 kinds of bread, includingpan de muerto,which is made for Day of the Dead celebrations and placed on altars honouring the deceased.“Bread is embedded in our culture … it’s an important part of a Mexican’s ritual,” he added. “You can’t say that bread doesn’t have a culture or that Mexicans don’t have a bread culture just because you’re referring to your type of bread.

The previous night, feminist campaigners had disrupted the show, shouting: “Abittan, rapist!”Macron, 72, asked Abittan how he was feeling. When he said he was feeling scared, she referred to the protesters as “sales connes”(stupid bitches) and said if they reappeared “we’ll toss them out”.Juliette Chapelle, a lawyer for the feminist groups who brought the case, toldFranceInter radio: “She’s France’s first lady, her words matter.”Chapelle said Macron had appeared to be “very engaged in causes for women, but in reality we can say there’s a disconnect between her public speeches and what she really thinks”.Magistrates terminated the investigation of the 2021 rape allegation against Abittan in 2024 due to a lack of evidence to bring it to trial. That decision was confirmed on appeal in January this year.The feminist campaign group who took part in the theatre protest, Nous Toutes (All of Us), said its activists had disrupted Abittan’s show to protest against what it described as “the culture of impunity” around sexual violence in France.“I am sorry if I hurt women victims,” Macron told the media outlet Brut this week, calling the remarks that were caught on video “private” comments.But, she added: “I can’t regret them. True, I am the wife of the president of the republic, but I am above all myself. And so when I am in private, I can let myself go in a way that is not totally proper.”The feminist groups who brought the legal complaint include Les Tricoteuses Hystériques (The Hysterical Knitters), which was founded in 2024 at the time of France’s biggest rape trial in which dozens of men wereconvicted of raping Gisèle Pelicot, who had been drugged by her ex-husband.A defence lawyer in that case called the women outside “hysterical” and “tricoteuses” – likening them to the women who watched and knitted as the guillotine fell during the French Revolution.The number of 343 complainants references a1971 petition for the legalisation of abortionin which 343 women said they had terminated pregnancies.Several celebrities have voiced support for the feminist campaigners insulted by Macron by adopting the insultwith the hashtag #salesconnes.The actor and directorJudith Godrèche, a leading voice in France’s #MeToo movement who has filed complaints accusing two film directors of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager, posted on social media: “Me too – I’m also a salle conne (dirty, stupid bitch) and I support all the others.”Explore more on these topicsFranceBrigitte MacronEuropeFeminismnewsShareReuse this content"

Carol Howle, BP’s head of trading, will run the company until O’Neill takes up the top job in April.Woodside boss says young people ‘ideological’ on fossil fuels while ‘happily ordering from Temu’Read moreThe incoming oil boss will be BP’s first female chief executive, and the first woman to head any of the world’s top five oil companies. Her appointment also marks the first time that BP has made an external hire to the top job at the company.The surprise appointment of BP’s third chief executive in five years emerged just weeks afterBP appointed Albert Manifold to chair the board. Manifold replaced Helge Lund who presided over the oil company’s failed attempt to adopt a green energy agenda.The shake-up will be taken as a sign that the British oil firm is seeking a renewed push to improve its business, with itsshares and earnings lagging behind competitorslike ExxonMobil and Shell for years as it pursued green energy projects at the expense of growing its oil and gas production.BP’s green strategy was set by its previous boss, Bernard Looney, who was appointed by Lund in 2020 to transform the business into an integrated energy company. However, the transition was undermined by a rise in global oil and gas prices, as well as theshock departure of Looney in 2023.Auchincloss blamed the company’s “misplaced” optimism over the speed of the energy transition earlier this year and promised shareholders that he would “fundamentally reset” BP by slashing billions in planned renewable energy initiatives and shifting its focus back to traditional oil and gas.Manifold, said: “Progress has been made in recent years, but increased rigour and diligence are required to make the necessary transformative changes to maximise value for our shareholders.”O’Neill, who has headed Woodside since 2021, previously spent 23 years at ExxonMobil. Under her leadership, Woodside merged with BHP Group’s petroleum arm to create a top 10 global independent oil and gas producer valued at $40bn (£30bn) and doubled Woodside’s oil and gas production.“With an extraordinary portfolio of assets, BP has significant potential to re-establish market leadership and grow shareholder value,” said O’Neill.Auchincloss will depart the company on Thursday. BP had not publicly announced a search process for his successor before it flagged his departure late on Wednesday evening.“This is clearly a high-profile hire, and probably some of the change that BP shareholders have been looking for,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners.Explore more on these topicsBPOilCommoditiesEnergy industryOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The inside story of the battle for Warner BrosRead moreWBDagreed to sellits storied movie studios, HBO cable network and streaming service to Netflix in a $82.7bn deal earlier this month, setting the stage for a seismic shift in Hollywood’s industrial landscape.But Paramount, which had privately bid for WBD before the Netflix deal was unveiled, swiftly countered with anall-cash offerand vowed to take it directly to shareholders. Unlike Netflix, Paramount – which is controlled by the billionaire Ellison family – bid for the entire company, which also includes the CNN news network.In a blunt letter to shareholders on Wednesday morning, WBD accused Paramount of having “consistently misled” investors by claiming its bid has a “full backstop” – a safety net to ensure it has sufficient funds – from the Ellisons.Paramount later reaffirmed its offer, saying that it had lined up “all necessary financing” to support a bid that it claimed offers “superior value and a faster, more certain path” to the Netflix deal.“Following a careful evaluation of Paramount’s recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer’s value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,” Samuel A Di Piazza Jr, chair of WBD’s board, said in a statement. “This offer once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated to Paramount throughout our extensive engagement and review of their six previous proposals.“We are confident that our merger with Netflix represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders and we look forward to delivering on the compelling benefits of our combination.”David Ellison, chair and chief executive of Paramount, said: “We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader.“I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries.”One media analyst likened the saga to a “real-life, far more consequential”episode of the HBO drama Succession. “If you think you know how this plot ends, think again,” said Mike Proulx, vice-president of research at Forrester.“WBD’s formal rejection of Paramount’s offer changes nothing,” he said. “The ultimate decision still rests with WBD’s shareholders and that vote is months away.What’s clear about Paramount’s bid are the growing eyebrow raises over its Middle Eastern financing. The same US officials and regulators who’vesounded alarms about China’s influence on TikTokshould be crying foul here.”Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive of Netflix, welcomed WBD’s response to Paramount. “The Warner Bros Discovery board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” he said in a statement to Reuters.“This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders, and the broader entertainment industry.”Netflix was already engaging with the justice department and European Commission, the company’s other co-chief executive, Greg Peters, told CNBC. He expressed confidence that the regulators would view the deal as “pro-consumer and pro-growth”.Questions were swiftly raised about how the Ellisons were funding their proposal, after a regulatory filing revealed it was backed by outside funders including Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund; and the Qatar Investment Authority.On Tuesday, it emerged Kushner’s Affinity Partners, a private equity firm, hadstepped back from the process.Di Piazza, the WBD chair, described the company’s decision to advise investors to reject Paramount as “not a hard choice” in an interview on Wednesday.“Netflix made a compelling offer – it was heavy in cash, certainty of close, a high termination fee, and they responded to the operating issues that we were concerned about,” Di Piazza told CNBC, the financial news network. “[Paramount] had every opportunity to deal with that broad range of issues, and they chose not to.”WBD accused Paramount of leaning on an “unknown and opaque revocable trust” to shore up its bid and tabling an “illusory” proposal that WBD shareholders should not rely on.In its letter to shareholders, WBD firmly denied that regulators were more likely to approve Paramount’s bid than its deal with Netflix, and warned of “significant additional costs” – including a $2.8bn termination fee to Netflix – if the Paramount offer was accepted.“None of these reasons will be a surprise to [Paramount] given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals,” WBD claimed in its letter to shareholders. “The terms of the Netflix merger are superior.”Trump has said he plans to be involved in deciding whether any deal will receive approval from regulators – and made clear that he views the future of CNN, which he has long criticized, as a key factor.“I think CNN should be sold, because I think the people that are running CNN right now are either corrupt or incompetent,” Trump said last week.Trump has also tried in recent days to distance himself from the Ellisons, using hislong-held grudgewith CBS – which is owned by Paramount – over its 60 Minutes show to reverse hisprevious warmth towards the family.“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” he wrotein a poston his Truth Social network earlier this week.Shares in WBD, which has a market value of approximately $71bn, fell 1% during early trading in New York on Monday.

Itpaid £490,000 in 2023after accidentally sending promotional push notification to customers who had signed up to exclude themselves from gambling, inviting them to bet on a football match.John Pierce, the Gambling Commission’s director of enforcement, said the fine reflected “the seriousness of the failings identified and the importance of meeting social responsibility and customer interaction standards”.“Our compliance assessment in 2024 uncovered examples where interactions fell far short of what is required. These failings should never have occurred,” he added.“While the licensees cooperated fully with the investigation, accepted the failings early, and implemented an action plan quickly, this immediate response is the minimum we expect from operators when serious shortcomings are identified.”A spokesperson for Flutter said the company took its safer gambling responsibilities seriously and firmly believed it led the industry in player protection.“Customer safety is our number one priority and there is no suggestion that any of the customers reviewed by the Gambling Commission experienced any harm,” they said.“Our controls have evolved significantly and we recently introduced a next-generation customer safety platform, with the vast majority of checks now happening in real-time.“As such, we are confident that the issues highlighted by the commission in its public statement would not be repeated today. We continue to invest in our technology and our people to raise standards in the regulated industry.”Explore more on these topicsPaddy PowerBetfairGamblingRegulatorsTravel & leisurenewsShareReuse this content"

City economists had forecast a modest drop to 3.5%.Strengthening the case for the Bank to cut borrowing costs for a sixth time, the slowdown in the headline rate to the lowest level since March was fuelled by falling pre-Christmas food prices and Black Friday discounts.Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said: “Lower food prices, which traditionally rise at this time of the year, were the main driver of the fall, with decreases seen particularly for cakes, biscuits, and breakfast cereals.“Tobacco prices also helped pull the rate down, with prices easing slightly this month after a large rise a year ago. The fall in the price of women’s clothing was another downward driver.”Analysts said a cut in the Bank’s base rate was “all-but nailed on” before its policymakers meeting on Thursday, as faltering economic growth and rising levels of unemployment bear down on inflationary pressures.“November’s drop in UK inflation is just the latest sign that price pressures are abating and that the Bank of England has more work to do. We expect a rate cut on Thursday and two more next year,” said James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING.The pound fell by 0.7% against the dollar on the currency markets. Trading in financial markets reflects a more than 90% chance of a quarter-point cut in the base rate from the current level of 4%. Government borrowing costs also fell.The latest reading showed inflation in food and drink prices slowed from 4.9% in October to 4.2%, with the cost of products such as cakes, biscuits and breakfast cereals falling this year after rising a year ago.Kris Hamer, the director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, said extensive discounting across Black Friday month had contributed to the decline, alongside big pre-Christmas promotions. “As a result, there were deals to be had, with bigger discounts seen for some meat products such as pork, lamb and chicken.”The price of some food products tumbled sharply compared with a year earlier, including a 16.2% drop in olive oil, a 6.1% decline in flours and other cereals, and a 4.2% drop in the price of pasta products and couscous.Further strengthening the case for a rate cut, core inflation – which excludes volatile items including energy and food, and is closely monitored by the Bank – also cooled from 3.4% to 3.2%.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made tackling the cost of living a major target of last month’s autumn budget, alongside£26bn of tax increasesto help repair the public finances and fund theend of the two-child benefit cap.The Bank has said it expects the chancellor’s measures – including relief on energy bills, prescription charges and fuel duty – could cut headline inflation byas much as half a percentage point next year.“Getting bills down is my top priority,” Reeves said. “I know families across Britain who are worried about bills will welcome this fall in inflation.”Despite the slowdown in November, the UK’s headline inflation rate remains significantly above the 2% target set by the government. Some economists warned that the UK still faced pressures from inflation that could limit the Bank from cutting interest rates much further in 2026.Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “While a fall in inflation is welcome, prices are still rising at well above the target rate, which will be deeply concerning for families.”Campaigners said consumer prices remained significantly higher than in 2021, before the inflation shock took hold. Chris Belfield, the chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation poverty charity, said 7 million households were heading into Christmas unable to afford essential items.“Meanwhile, more people are looking for work with unemployment figures up to pre-pandemic levels and real earnings are barely growing.”Explore more on these topicsInflationInterest ratesBank of EnglandEconomicsOffice for National StatisticsEconomic policyUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The show takes place 200 years into a post-nuclear apocalypse where most humans are scratching out an existence in a stricken wasteland California of sand dunes, outlaw gangs and mutated monsters. Resources are scarce. Life is cruel. Death is a constant. It should be terrifying. Instead, it’s often hilarious.A wicked sense of humour elevatedthe first seasonof Prime Video’s well-received, no-expense-spared adaptation ofthe long-running video game franchise. An early episode opened with one faction dumping newborn pups into an incinerator – in case you were wondering who the bad guys were – and those flashes of satirical glee gave Fallout an edge over gloomier post-apocalyptic shows such asThe Walking DeadorThe Last of Us.View image in fullscreenWalton Goggins as Cooper Howard in Fallout season two.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/Courtesy of PrimeIf the setting was outlandish and the violence often OTT, the core characters played things admirably straight. Lucy (Ella Purnell) was a wide-eyed ingénue who had experienced a literally sheltered upbringing in an underground vault. Witnessing her golly-gosh, can-do attitude collide with the lawless chaos of the surface as she searched for her kidnapped father Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) was a hoot. The similarly naive Maximus (Aaron Moten) was an orphan brought up in a militaristic religious cult who inherited a clanking mechanical battle suit after his unpleasant superior had a run-in with an irradiated bear.The world-weary contrast to these young innocents was the Ghoul, played by Walton Goggins with a startling CGI makeover that convincingly lopped off his nose. This durable mutant with a cowboy hat, ragged duster coat and saddlebag was every inch the drawling, sardonic gunslinger. But pre-cataclysm flashbacks shaded in the Ghoul’s previous existence as movie star and devoted family man Cooper Howard, navigating a red scare in Fallout’s heightened version of the 1950s.Season two continues the odd couple team-up between Lucy and the Ghoul as they pursue the discredited Hank, last seen yomping toward Vegas in chunky power armour to enact some awful, unspecified scheme. Lucy still says “fudge” rather than swearing but is quicker on the draw than she used to be. Her travelling companion remains impassive as she attempts to break though the crustiness and rekindle his sense of humanity. (“Empathy’s like mud: you lose your boots in that stuff,” grumbles the Ghoul when she rushes to help a stranger.)View image in fullscreenIf the suit fits … Aaron Moten, right, as Maximus in Fallout season two.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/Prime VideoThere is also much more of Goggins in dapper matinee idol mode as the 1950s thread tunnels deeper into who might have been responsible for the original atomic disaster. Cooper’s strained relationship with his wife Barb (Frances Turner), an exec at the blandly sinister Vault-Tec corporation, gives him some meaty material to get his teeth into, even if the retro-futurist production design of the flashbacks – all covetable curvy cars and Jetsons-style robotic mod-cons – is distractingly handsome.She may have left her vault life far behind but season two often cuts back to see how Lucy’s old and only slightly inbred underground crew are faring, notably her brother Norm (Moisés Arias) who is locked in a battle of wills with a brain in a jar. And we eventually catch up again with Maximus, who has returned to the bosom of his old brotherhood and is alternately sleepwalking through his duties and daydreaming about his time on the road with Lucy.Those are a lot of plates to keep spinning but Fallout has always had a hopscotching narrative structure, confident that audiences could keep up with its constant parade of weirdos and tangle of plotlines. Season two draws more directly from its gaming source material – notably 2010’s admiredFallout: New Vegas– but remains pleasingly dense with jokes, splatter and slapstick.Future episodes see attention-grabbing guest roles for Kumail Nanjiani and Macaulay Culkin; Nanjiani, in particular, seems to relish the chance to play a cocky heavy. But the most notable addition to the cast is Justin Theroux as the immaculately moustachioed Robert House, a reclusive Howard Hughes-esque founder of a robotics empire and would-be shaper of the future. Theroux’s barely restrained fervour and distinctive accent work – turning every “w” into a breathy caress – makes him stand out in a cast not exactly short on larger-than-life characters, even if his appearances are rather stingily rationed out.Season one launched last April as a bingeable box set but this time new episodes are releasing weekly. That might be intended to create space for obsessive fans to swap theories about Fallout’s various unfolding conspiracies. But that is perhaps to misunderstand its more visceral appeal. Thankfully for every shadowy corporate mystery in season two there are at least three exploding heads and a chance to hear Purnell skilfully finding another inflection on her adorable “okey-dokey!” catchphrase.Fallout season two is on Prime Video now, with new episodes weeklyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewScience fiction TVGamesFalloutreviewsShareReuse this content"

By the time Mickey topped the US charts 43 years ago this week, in 1982, Basil had already spent four decades in the entertainment industry. The deeper you go, the more places you realise she was. WhenElvis Presleysings “See the girl with the red dress on” in his 1964 movie Viva Las Vegas, and points across the dancefloor, the gyrating girl in the red dress is Basil. When Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper take LSD at the end of Easy Rider with two sex workers, one of them is Basil. When dance troupe the Lockers show​case their pre-hip-hop street dance moves on Soul Train in 1976, it’s six guys and … Basil. By the time of Mickey she had already worked with everyone from David Bowie to Tina Turner to Talking Heads, with more to come.Basil has been-there-done-that in so many places, for so long, and over the course of our two-hour conversation she’ll casually drop asides such as “… so I went to see Devo with Iggy Pop and Dean Stockwell” or “… me and Bowie had just come from dinner with Bob Geldof, Paula Yates and Freddie Mercury” or “I was just at Bette Midler’s 80th birthday party, what a bash!” She’s now 82 years old but on Zoom, from her dance studio in Los Angeles, she doesn’t look much older than she did in the video for Mickey – and she looked like a teenager inthat, even though she was 38 at the time. Her memory is perfectly sharp, too, and her energy levels are as high as ever, as she shares her packed life story with animated diction. If she has a secret to eternal youth, it’s that she has danced her whole life, and she still does, she says. “Dance is my drug of choice. You get high from it, and it gives you community.”View image in fullscreenBasil during a visit to Britain to perform ‘Mickey’ on Top of the Pops.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBasil’s brief pop career was, she explains, actually thanks to Manchester and the BBC. She signed to a British record label in 1979 to record her album Word of Mouth, which included a reworking of Kitty, an album track by forgotten British band Racey. Basil gave it a gender-switch, a new wave synth makeover and that unforgettable cheerleader chant – “I had tobegmy record company to let me record it,” she remembers. “They thought it was aterribleidea; they didn’t know what cheerleaders were.” She made little films for a few of the songs, singing and dancing. “This was a year before MTV,” she explains. By chance, a couple of BBC producers, Ken Stevenson and Alan Walsh, watched them playing in a record shop in Manchester, “and they saw in the credits that I had choreographed and directed it all.”They invited her to make a two-part special for the BBC, with more song-and-dance numbers and little comedy skits. The show plays like a lost time capsule of 80s kitsch: somewhere between punk, new wave and hip-hop; colourful, playful, subtly subversive, almost like an over-caffeinated kids’ cartoon. It was this that launched Mickey as a hit single – first in the UK (in March), then in Australia (a No 1 that July), then, after a new American recording contract and a new video (Basil wore her original high school cheerleader outfit), a No 1 in the US that December. “It took Britain, land of Boy George and the Beatles, to go, ‘Look at this. Let’s put this on television,’” she says. “In the US, they were like: ‘What is she thinking?’”Basil really did have showbiz in her Italian American blood. “It never occurred to me that I would do anything else,” she says. “My mother’s side of the family were vaudevillian stars, kind of acrobatic comedians.” Her father was an orchestra leader, first in Chicago, then at the Sahara hotel in Las Vegas. “I stood on the side of the stage from 1947 to 1957 seeing a show every weekend; everybody from Josephine Baker to Nat King Cole to Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland.”View image in fullscreenBasil in the ‘Mickey’ video.Photograph: Sipa Press/REX/ShutterstockShe was their only child. “They thought I was the centre of the earth. I was extremely spoilt. And I was really a good dancer. They saw what I had going, and they really pushed it.” Her teenage life was daily ballet classes and acting lessons, followed by go-go clubs every night, “dancing the pony, the mashed potato, all of that”. The tide was turning: the youth rebellion of the early 1960s was making older entertainers look stale and square. Basil was one of a handful of dancers who really knew what the kids were digging, so she soon picked up work dancing and choreographing. It sounds like a great time to be young, I suggest. “I think it’s always a great time to be young!” she replies.Given all this, Basil wasn’t particularly fazed to find herself standing in for Ann-Margret and teaching Elvis Presley dance steps when she was just 20. “Being nervous around Elvis? He was part of the show-business family. I mean, I appreciated it was Elvis Presley, but not in that crazy fan way.” Or hanging backstage during the 1964 concert movie T.A.M.I Show, which she also choreographed. “We were in the green room with the Rolling Stones and Smokey Robinson watching James Brown, and the Stones realised, ‘Oh shit, we gotta followhim?’” Likewise the Rat Pack movie Robin and the Seven Hoods, where she played a chorus girl. “I started out in the back line, and the next day I was in the centre line. By the third day, I was front and centre.” Basil even features in apromotional featurettefor the movie, chatting on set with Sinatra, Dean Martin and the gang. They were mostly gentlemen, she says. “Maybe Bing Crosby made a pass at me, but I don’t think I was so interested.” That seems to be another thing she was unfazed by: “I had directors making a pass at me, but it was never a pass that, if I was not reciprocal, I didn’t get the job.”By the late 60s the tide had turned again, and Basil was part of the counterculture. Her boyfriend at the time was the actor Dean Stockwell, which brought her into the orbit of Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda and artists such as Wallace Berman and Bruce Conner. Conner’s 1966 art filmBreakawayconsists of Basil dancing and singing the title song, which went on to become a sought-after northern soul track – Mickey was not her first rodeo.That’s how she came to be in Easy Rider, plus other counterculture classics such as the Monkees’ Head, Five Easy Pieces (with Nicholson), and Hopper’s infamously erratic The Last Movie. Hopper was usually the overbearing presence in this gang, it seems. His intensity filled the room, she says. “He either hated something or loved it, there was no in between, which was quite entertaining, but he could be mad as a hatter.”View image in fullscreenPerforming in the Monkees’ Head (1968).Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyAs for the drugs associated with this scene, Basil never really took to them. “Pot made me paranoid, to the point of passing [the joint] around and really not taking a toke out of it,” she says. “And at one point I was able to get some cocaine, which was pretty fabulous. I made a film in a week on cocaine! But it broke my skin out. So me with my vanity? Oh no!”By the time this scene fizzled out in the early 70s, Basil was already on to the next thing. Dance had moved on since go-go, so she asked a girlfriend: “Find me the best dancer and have him call me. I need some classes.” The best dancer turned out to be a kid called Lamont Peterson, who put her on to the straight Black club scene in south Los Angeles, and Don “Campbellock” Campbell, who was inventing a new style of dance that became known as “locking”. “It was the most spectacular dancing I had seen since James Brown,” says Basil. “He did a lot ​of arms,” she goes through the moves on camera: “wrist-roll, point, five, slap. There was something of communication; the dancer could have a conversation with the audience.” There were also athletic leaps, down on to the knees or into splits, even somersaults. This was an individual, club-based style but, drawing on her vaudevillian instincts, Basil formed a stage troupe with Campbell and four other dancers called The Lockers. This was still pre-hip-hop, in the mid-70s, but you can see it prefiguring later street dance styles – like body​ popping, “waacking” and breakdancing. The Lockers toured with everyone from Sinatra to Funkadelic. “We changed the face of dance,” she says. “We showed audiences that street dance was an art form.”View image in fullscreenBasil and Dennis Hopper attend the 1976 Cannes film festival.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty ImagesBasil was also building a career as a choreographer. Bowie invited her to London out of the blue in 1973 to choreograph his forthcoming Diamond Dogs tour. His vision for it was more like rock opera: complex moving sets, costume changes, theatre lighting, dance numbers. It was intense​; 13-hour days of rehearsals. “There was a lot of homework with Bowie.” She marvelled at his stamina. “David could do anything; as an actor, as a mover, he wasn’t a normal dancer – I mean, the guy didn’t even look normal, he just looked like this strange alien god. I always thought he should have been James Bond.”This is what connects all the most impressive people she’s worked with, says Basil: “Their work ethic is just obsessive: pre​-production, planning, rehearsals.” Turner was another. She approached Basil in the late 70s, when she was seeking to go solo. It was a vulnerable time for her, having effectively been in hiding since ending her infamously abusive marriage to Ike a few years earlier. After her high-energy moves with the Ikettes, Turner was after something more elegant, says Basil. But she certainly knew her stuff. In their first run-through Basil sat poised, ready to write down her feedback. “I watched the whole thing, and I realised I’d never put the pencil to the paper. It was just shocking to be in the same room with her, singing and dancing with the band. It was startling. And she does it all in high heels, and then, ​as soon as it’s over, she can hardly walk in the heels. But you’d never know it.” Basil worked with Turner right until her final 50th anniversary tour, in 2009. “She was an elegant queen, and yet she’s up in the girls’ dressing room, working on their weaves, fixing their hair.”Basil’s pre-MTV videos also caught the attention of David Byrne, of Talking Heads, who asked her to direct a promo for their songCrosseyed and Painless– which featured her street dancer friends and none of the band – then, a year later, their classicOnce in a Lifetime, for which she and Byrne researched films of people in trances and religious ecstasy to come up with his jerky, idiosyncratic dance style. “As a matter of fact, he was very hesitant about that,” she recalls. Before that, “I don’t think he really danced at all.”View image in fullscreenWith musician David Byrne, of Talking Heads, photographed in 1987.Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty ImagesBasil would go on to choreograph other acts, especially Midler, and films and TV shows, from American Graffiti to Sesame Street to Legally Blonde, right up to Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, for which she taught Margot Robbie and Leonardo DiCaprio their 60s moves. “She was the goddess of go-go,” Tarantino said of Basil, “She knows the era perfectly.” Perhaps better than he realised: Tarantino’s film harked back to the Manson family’s murder of Sharon Tate and her friends in 1969. “I knew Sharon and Roman [Polanski, her husband], we used to hang out,” she says. “I dated Jay Sebring!” Sebring, the celebrity hairstylist, was Tate’s friend and ex-partner, and was murdered alongside her that night. Basil dated him years before. “He and Gene Shacove were the two straight hairdressers in Hollywood. Straight hairdressers get laid as much as straight male dancers.”Basil never married but seemingly had quite a few celebrity liaisons over the years, not least with her collaborators. “I worked with them through it all.” She remains cryptic on the details. “I worked with Bowie through it all. I worked with Jerry Casale [of Devo, who contributed tracks to Basil’s Word of Mouth album] through it all. I worked with Byrne through it all. Our relationships have always remained, no matter what, creative.”View image in fullscreenStage troupe The Lockers in concert in 1973.Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty ImagesIs she saying these were purely creative relationships? “No.” She’s not minded to go into detail, though. “You’re the Guardian and I’m not talking about my sex life!” she says mockingly, then adds: “It’s extremely erotic when it’s creative and it’s sexual. Oh my God, there is nothing more spectacular. And if you deliver work that is also spectacular, you don’t mind losing the sex, but you don’t want to lose the creative connection.”Now she lives alone in “a wonderful house in Los Angeles” with her five cats and her dance studio next door. She still teaches students, judges street dance competitions globally and is regarded as a legend in the field. And she still hears Mickey echoing through the culture: in movies (most recently Die My Love), and in songs by the likes ofRun DMC(It’s Tricky), Gwen Stefani (Hollaback Girl), Taylor Swift (Shake It Off),Charlixcx (Speed Drive) and, most recently, Blackpink singer Rosé’s hit single with Bruno Mars,Apt. “It’s kind of an anthem now. Here in America, if you’re a little cheerleader, you’re dancing to it.”Her own taste of pop stardom might have been fleeting – follow-up singles to Mickey and a second album barely troubled the charts – but she doesn’t seem too bothered: “I never thought of it as anything but a time period. It was just a train ride. I was able to earn a living, I had fabulous, talented friends that were all doing something similar, but like Bowie, we all evolved.Dancestyles change, music changes, so if you keep up with the trend, you change.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleDanceDavid BowieBette MidlerElvis PresleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But those liberties are nothing compared with North by Northwest, The Manchurian Candidate or ThanksgivingStuart HeritageWed 17 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 02.01 ESTShareTo be able to enjoy Kate Winslet’s new Christmas movie, Goodbye June, you have to be able to do a couple of things. First, if you’ve ever suffered any form of bereavement, you may have to approach it slowly, since the film is explicitly about the death of a parent. But the other thing you need to do is not Google the age of any of the cast.This is for good reason. The titular June is played by Dame Helen Mirren, and her husband is played byTimothy Spall. Fine actors and national treasures, the pair of them. However, Mirren is 80 years old, and Spall is 68. Again, this is fine. You have undoubtedly met couples with bigger age gaps than this, and in all probability they are perfectly happy together.The problem, however, comes when you factor in the ages of their children. Goodbye June is about four siblings who have to push their differences aside in a moment of extreme familial crisis. One of the siblings is played by Toni Collette. Toni Collette is 53 years old, and you’re already way ahead of me here, aren’t you?View image in fullscreenAndrea Riseborough, Johnny Flynn, Kate Winslet and Timothy Spall in Goodbye June.Photograph: APIn order to square this circle, you have to accept that Mirren’s character must have been 28 years old when she had Collette, but Spall must have been just 15. And at no point during the film is this mentioned. Perhaps that’s wise – after all, a Christmas movie about a dying parent is heavy enough, so a Christmas movie about a dying parent of a woman who was herself the daughter of a literal schoolboy might be overegging the pudding a little – but it is nevertheless quite weird.But let’s not be too heavyhanded here. Since the dawn of cinema, actors have been playing older and younger than their actual age. Maybe – hopefully! – Timothy Spall is playing someone a decade older than he really is here. The bigger problem is that, when you start noticing this sort of thing, it’s everywhere.View image in fullscreenYoung at heart …  Renée Zellweger with Mila Jankovic and Casper Knopf in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy (2025).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyIn the most recent Bridget Jones film, the lead character (played by Renée Zellweger, 56) has a six-year-old. And in Lulu Wang’s Expats, Nicole Kidman (58) has a toddler. Again, wonderful for their characters, and having a baby later in life is great. It’s just weird that nobody mentions this, especially because it’s statistically so rare. Indeed, to return to Goodbye June for a moment, it may be worth mentioning that Collette’s character is also pregnant.While the number of women in the US over the age of 50 giving birth has grown dramatically over the last few decades – there were 144 recorded births in 1997, compared with 1,217 in 2023 – it still represents a vanishingly small slice of all births. Women over the age of 50 account for just 0.03% of births, so you’d think that something this rare would have at least been acknowledged in the plots.Things get a little muddier in Eli Roth’s 2023 horror Thanksgiving, since it’s revealed that the character played by Gina Gershon (61 at time of release) was pregnant. This isn’t completely unheard of – in 2019, 74-year-old Erramatti Mangayamma gave birth to twins after receiving IVF – but the pregnancy would almost certainly be the most significant thing about her character. Some forums have tried to explain this away by theorising that her character was never actually pregnant, and that the film’s obsessed villain was simply inventing it, but this is altogether too much thought spent on an Eli Roth film.View image in fullscreenGina Gershon and her baby scan in Thanksgiving.Photograph: Sony PicturesWhat’s the reason for this? In the case of Bridget Jones and Expats, it may be because the film-makers wanted to reflect the growing trend of women giving birth later in life, but then again it may be because Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger can both pass for younger than they really are.Then again, in the case of Goodbye June, it may be because Kate Winslet had access toHelen Mirrenand Timothy Spall and, when you have the possibility of casting actors of their magnitude, you’re willing to fudge the numbers a little.View image in fullscreenAngela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarIt’s distracting, but it’s no bad thing in itself. In fact, you could even see it as a corrective to years and years of Hollywood casting women to play the mothers of actors who aren’t all that much older than them. Jessie Royce Landis played Cary Grant’s mother in North by Northwest, for example, even though they were so close in age that she would have had to have him when she was eight.Similarly, Angela Lansbury would have had to have given birth to Laurence Harvey at the age of three for The Manchurian Candidate to make sense. And the less thought about Oliver Stone’s Alexandra (in which Angelina Jolie played the mother of Colin Farrell, who is just 362 days younger than her), the better. Compared with this, Timothy Spall was practically geriatric when he fathered Toni Collette for Goodbye June. Thank God Hollywood used to be so much creepier.Explore more on these topicsFilmHelen MirrenKate WinsletTimothy SpallBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyChildbirthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe because the idea of a holiday movie hadn’t yet ossified into routine, I’ve found that the versions of these films that came out in the 1940s tend to approach Christmas from more inventive, less neurotically obsessive angles. One of my favorite discoveries in sifting through 1940s Christmas comedies is It Happened on Fifth Avenue, a 1947 semi-romantic farce with a great starting hook: a cheerful vagrant Aloysius T McKeever (Victor Moore) winters in New York every year, because he knows a way into a particular Fifth Avenue mansion seasonally vacated by its enormously wealthy owner. One winter, Aloysius invites some new acquaintances to stay with him: veteran Jim Bullock (Don DeFore) and his military buddies, plus runaway Trudy O’Connor (Gale Storm) – who is secretly the daughter of the mansion’s owner. Eventually, the owner himself is forced to disguise himself as another vagrant and stay in the house, too, so Trudy can make sure Jim loves her on her own merits. This all takes place during the run-up to Christmas and into New Year’s, and director Roy Del Ruth gives the movie a found-family warmth that newer holiday movies have to labor two or three times as hard for, assembling a funny and lovable surrogate family in one of the city’s well-appointed empty spaces. Speaking of labor: It Happened on Fifth Avenue lands perfectly between class-conscious social picture about the importance of affordable housing and romantic urban fairytale.Jesse HassengerIt Happened on Fifth Avenue is available on Plex and to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaTokyo GodfathersI’m not big on anime, but I recently watchedSatoshi Kon’s 2003 tragicomedy Tokyo Godfathers and found it so fun, sad and thoughtful. It’s inspired by the John Wayne western, Three Godfathers, and we’re in good hands with director Kon (whodied at age 46and who both Guillermo del Toro and Darren Aronofsky havecited asan influence). On Christmas Eve in snowy Tokyo, a trio of homeless people – a middle-aged alcoholic, a transgender woman and a teenage runaway – find an abandoned baby girl under a mound of trash and decide to look for her parents. As hijinks ensue, the three of them are a delicious blend of pain and sass (“I’m eating for two,” Hana, the trans woman, tells a soup kitchen server, patting her belly and requesting an extra helping), and the movie doubles down on the best part of most holiday flicks: the magic – and significance – of coincidence. Throughout our eccentric heroes’ journey, the dots don’t just connect, they ram into each other, and we’re left wondering just how free-wheeling serendipity can get; here it leads to yakuza bosses, Latino immigrants, an angel, a shooting, a missing cat. It’s a dark and rollicking time in this world, and when paired with the cool-toned, cinematic animation style, it doesn’t feel saccharine to appreciate the idea of a Christmas miracle.Tammy TarngTokyo Godfathers is available on Tubi and Hoopla in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaMeet John DoeFrank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life rightly gets all the attention this time of year, but I love this lesser-known pick from the director’s oeuvre. Like the story of George Bailey, Meet John Doe revolves around a “forgotten man” – played by Gary Cooper, who may be the most handsome bum you’ll ever see on film. A plucky reporter (Barbara Stanwyck), gets fired after her publication is eaten up by a wealthy owner who has no clue how to run a newsroom (sound familiar?). As her final kiss-off, she writes a fake letter supposedly penned by a man who plans to jump off of a building on Christmas Eve to protest society’s ills. The public loves it, and our girl reporter has to find a man who can play her John Doe. Cooper’s Doe becomes a national hero, inspiring everyone to “be a better neighbor,” and the paper’s publisher tries to exploit all this goodwill for his own political ambitions. Heady at times, but uplifting in the end – and a brutal skewering of the ultra-rich that still rings true.Alaina DemopoulosMeet John Doe is available on Tubi, Pluto TV, Plex, YouTube TV and Hoopla in the US and Amazon Prime, Tubi and Plex in the UK and AustraliaThe Silent PartnerHorror films set during the festive period aren’t quite theprotest-causing outliersthey once were, if anything there’s now too many of them. So while we might be a little exhausted with the sight of Santa slicing and dicing, we’re less accustomed to him stealing and plotting, the subgenre of Christmas thriller still strangely underpopulated. It’s one of many reasons why little-seen 1978 gem The Silent Partner is such a novel surprise, its criminal Santa played by a wonderfully vile Christopher Plummer whose plan to rob a bank during its busiest period is disrupted by Elliott Gould’s odd, opportunistic teller. It’s a stylish, nasty and entirely unpredictable yarn (written by a young Curtis Hanson, who later returned to Hitchcockian territory on multiple occasions), pitting two different varieties of amoral oddball against each other, both testing their limits and each other’s. It was barely seen on release (Roger Ebertcalledit a “miracle” that no one saw coming) and has faded in the years since but if you prefer your Christmas films on the chillier side, this deserves to become a new tradition.Benjamin LeeThe Silent Partner is available on Kanopy and to rent digitally in the US and on SBS on Demand in AustraliaAlmost ChristmasIf you like your Christmases messy, Almost Christmas is a hoot. The cast alone – Danny Glover, Mo’Nique, JB Smoove – rivals any holiday tree for stars, and writer-director David E Talbert gives them plenty of latitude to clown around with his dysfunctional family reunion setup. Glover’s character isn’t much more than Sgt Murtaugh aged up another 15 years, a widower who on some level wishes his beloved wife were still around to deal with their wayward adult children. Five days under the same roof makes private problems harder to hide and puts a strain on family bonds – and the prospect of another funeral is slammed on the table when Smoove’s side chick (Keri Hilson) turns up at Christmas dinner and his wife (Kimberly Elise) pulls out a shotgun and starts firing off rounds. Of course it all works out in the end – especially for Mo’Nique, who was still on Hollywood time out after hitting out at Oprah, Tyler Perry and Lee Daniels. Which is to say: this is one holiday mess you can enjoy without squabbling over who’s cleaning up afterward.Andrew LawrenceAlmost Christmas is available on HBO Max and Peacock in the US, Amazon Prime and Now TV in the UK and Amazon Prime in AustraliaGoThough I was mildly obsessed with this 1999 movie – a sort of young-adult riff on Pulp Fiction’s crime-y interconnectedness – as a teenager, I hadn’t revisited it in many years out of fear that it would not stand the test of time. By some measures, that apprehension was proven right when I finally rewatched it recently. Doug Liman’s film can be noxious, a caustic parade of datedly edgy humor. But there are nonetheless many things to savor in this Christmastime caper: a coolSarah Polleyback when she used to act; 90s pinup Scott Wolff looking great as a semi-closeted soap star; and perhaps most impressive of all, a slinking Timothy Olyphant as a dangerous but not sadistic local drug dealer. He lopes off with the movie in each of his captivating scenes, shirtless with a Santa hat on.Richard LawsonGo is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaThe Miracle of Morgan’s CreekSomewhere between seasonal pillars like The Shop Around the Corner and It’s A Wonderful Life, Preston Sturges dropped his more outrageous wartime Christmas movie, The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek, which forgoes sentimentality in favour of cheeky bawdiness. Critics at the time were tickled over how the movie about an unplanned pregnancy, arising from a drunken night, got past the censors at the Hays office, what with Betty Hutton’s daft Trudy Kockenlocker struggling to remember who knocked her up. Luckily, she’s got Eddie Bracken’s Norval Jones simping over her to the point that he’s willing to step up as the father. It isn’t immediately apparent that this is a Christmas movie, since it takes approximately nine months before the plot climaxes on the holidays, at which point we realize Sturges essentially refashioned the nativity story. It’s the sort of playfulness we expect from Sturges, whose satires skewered rom-com tropes only to reinforce them with joy and cheer. In The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek, he does the same for Christmas.Radheyan SimonpillaiThe Miracle of Morgan’s Creek is available on Hoopla and to rent digitally in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaBetter Off DeadAs obscure Christmas movies go, they don’t get much more obscure than this 1985 teen comedy starringJohn Cusackin his all-smirking, super-knowing prime. Cusack’s Lane Myers has just been dumped at the start of the holidays by his girlfriend for the high-school skiing hunk – who goes by the unbelievably brilliant school bully name of Roy Stalin – and Lane’s big pitch to get her back is ... to ski down a mountain. This being the 80s, the whole movie is basically a trigger warning. Lane spends much of the running time trying to kill himself in increasingly “hilarious” ways (hence the title); he papers his room in Alan Partridge level stalker photographs of his ex; and there’s some slightly dubious-taste Asian-comedy-side characters – though unlike John Hughes’s Sixteen Candles, they are surreally funny (two Japanese drag-racing brothers who learned their English from Howard Cosell’s Wide World of Sports) rather than actively racist. Where this film scores highest is some amazing teen-movie dialogue from writer-director Savage Steve Holland; Lane’s girlfriend lets him down by saying: “I really think it’s in my best interests if I went out with someone more popular”; and Lane’s stoner sidekick Charles De Mar (played by Curtis Armstrong, later to achieve immortality in the Revenge of the Nerds series) is constantly on the search for drugs in their dead-end ski-resort town, drops to his knees on said mountain and cries ecstatically: “This is pure snow ... it’s everywhere ... do you have any idea what the street value of this mountain is?” This being the 80s, actual seasonal cheer is pretty incidental, but it is there occasionally; just avert your eyes from the New Year’s party inspired by a mail-order volume called How to Pick Up Trashy Women. Again ... the 80s. You literally couldn’t make a film like this now.Andrew PulverBetter Off Dead is available on HBO Max in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaHell’s HeroesHell’s Heroes, which could be subtitled three bad men and a baby, is an adaptation of a short story you may know from 1948’s Three Godfathers, starring John Wayne, or the Japanese animation Tokyo Godfathers from 2003. This 1929 western fable, made on the cusp of the sound revolution by William Wyler, is a parched, filthy desert story of redemption, based on Peter B Kyne’s Three Godfathers, already adapted for the screen three times. A trio of incorrigible outlaws, Bob, Barbwire and Wild Bill, flee a bank job across the desert, where they find a woman in labour. The birth kills her, but not before she makes them promise to take care of her baby … Will Hell’s Heroes warm the cockles of your heart at Yuletide? Not as much as you will sweat in sympathy with our sweltering, guilty protagonists. But the final scene with Charles Bickford’s Bob entering the church of New Jerusalem, is an emotional, and festive, tour de force.Pamela HutchinsonHell’s Heroes is available to watch on YouTubeSome of My Best Friends Are…While Some of My Best Friends Are …. certainly has its weak points as a film, the real appeal to this cinematic time capsule is the opportunity to get a glimpse of a gay bar before Pride was a thing, as well as the rare chance to see Candy Darling starring in a feature film not directed by Andy Warhol (she easily steals the show). An ensemble performance that’s much longer on atmosphere and camp than on plot and nuance, Some of My Best Friends Are ... takes viewers inside a post-Stonewall gay bar on Christmas Eve, and manages to recruit far more acting talent than one might expect. We’re still close enough to the bad old days that the establishment prominently sports a sign declaring that two men may not dance together unless in the presence of a lady, although there’s plenty of flamboyance and pride mixed in with self-repression and internalized hate. “Perfume Queen” Candy sticks out as othered and ostracized even within this relatively safe space, and the scene of “trans panic” that leads to her being beaten bloody is still shocking today, not to mention far too condoned by the mainstream culture. Watch it and imagine just what could have been if Candy had managed to live long enough to have an acting career equal to her beauty and screen presence.Veronica EspositoSome of My Best Friends Are… is available to watch on Amazon Prime in the US, UK and AustraliaChristmas, AgainHave yourself an indie little Christmas in Charles Poekel’s low-key slice-of-life about a somber Christmas tree salesman in Brooklyn who’s nursing a broken heart while managing a seasonal business on the thinnest of profit margins. Though the aptly named Noel (Kentucker Audley) doesn’t exactly radiate holiday cheer, there’s an insistent warmth and soul to Christmas, Again that flickers like the colored lights he’s wrapped carefully around his 24/7 pop-up stand. Shooting in a textured 16mm, Poekel gets the details of Noel’s vocation right – the care and maintenance of the stock, the different varietals from upstate (including the “Obama tree”), the onerous deal to pay for any trees he can’t sell – while sketching his relationship with a young woman (Hannah Gross) he finds passed out on a park bench. Though Poekel is allergic to traditional holiday sentiment, he extends enough good will toward his hero that the film feels like a cup of spiced apple cider against a bracing winter cold.Scott TobiasChristmas, Again is available on Mubi, Kanopy and to rent digitally in the US and in cinemas now in the UKExplore more on these topicsFilmChristmasFrank CapraChristopher PlummerSarah PolleyJohn CusackComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, in Chichester, Katy Rudd’s musical of a man’s Bunyanesque journey to visit a dying woman met that challenge with lo-fi eccentricity and folksy songs with a foot-stomping spirit (composed by Michael Rosenberg, AKA Passenger).In the West End from 29 January.Read the review9.The Railway ChildrenAs site-specific shows go, this adaptation of E Nesbit’s classic was hard to top. It began with a ride on a vintage stream train in West Yorkshire, depositing the audience in a disused engine shed at Oxenhope. The story was given an Anglo-Indian twist and Joanna Scotcher’s stupendous set design incorporated track lines. There was one monumental set piece after another, including a train chugging in.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenMonumental … The Railway Children, Oxenhope.Photograph: James Glossop/Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture8.Measure for MeasureEmily Burns excised all the comedy from her modern-dress RSC production to turn this problem play into an intense and dangerous drama about sexual coercion and hypocrisy. Tom Mothersdale was a darkly magnetic Angelo and Burns even resolved the jarring ending to give the heroine, Isabella, her much-deserved freedom.Read the review7.The MaidsJean Genet’s drama about two maids playing sub-dom games and enacting murderous fantasies about their overbearing mistress has never felt so fearlessly punkish. Adapted and directed by Kip Williams at the Donmar Warehouse, it used smartphone content, projected on to screens, to give a modern resonance of influencer culture and the compulsive pull of online image-making.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenFearless … Lydia Wilson and Phia Saban in The Maids.Photograph: Marc Brenner6.1536Ava Pickett’s award-winning debut play was set in rural Essex where three Tudor-era women (played by Tanya Reynolds, Liv Hill and Siena Kelly) banter, bicker, dream and confide, with a growing puritanism and Anne Boleyn’s execution in the air. Staged at the Almeida, it hasa West End run from May. A play filled with complex female characters and razor dread.Read the review5.Hot MessBeginning as a meet-cute between Humanity and Earth, this climate disaster romcom was the best musical at the Edinburgh fringe. It proved that a deeply weird idea can fly in the right hands – in this case, the super-talented duo Jack Godfrey (music and lyrics) and Ellie Coote (book and direction). Heaps of humour, intelligence and two remarkable performers in Danielle Steers and Tobias Turley.Read the review4.Animal FarmGeorge Orwell’s farmyard allegory of fascism has been dramatised umpteen times so how did Amy Leach’s touring production manage to make it freshly harrowing? Partly because of its talented cast but also because of the physicality of its staging and potent, lyrical use of British Sign Language.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenFreshly harrowing … Tianah Hodding and Tachia Newall in Animal Farm.Photograph: Kirsten Mcternan3.Much Ado About NothingJamie Lloyd’s celebrity casting paid off with a confetti-filled bang in this modern reworking of Shakespeare at Theatre Royal Drury Lane, with Hayley Atwell and Tom Hiddleston as the sparring, midlife singletons Beatrice and Benedick. As joyous as the most riotous kind of wedding, there were disco lights, pumping bass, plushy animal masks and enough chemistry to set the room alight.Read the review2.Return to PalestineThis charismatic tragicomedy by Jenin’s Freedom Theatre was devised almost a decade ago but could not have been revived at a more potent moment, at Theatro Technis in London. Taking place on a tiny strip of white cloth and based on stories collected from across Palestine, six performers used physical theatre, clowning and oud music to searing effect.Read the review1.StereophonicDavid Adjmi’s play about the creative pains of making music received a record-breaking 13 Tony award nominations when it ran on Broadway – and for good reason. It began quietly as an unnamed 1970s band arrive at a studio to record an album, then turned up the tempo with slow-burn magnificence to draw a profound, funny and vivid portrait of these musician-couples as they fought, flirted, cried, made up. And when the songs came (written by Will Butler of Arcade Fire) they were a hurricane of pure, skinless emotion, with every performance raising shivers. The set at the Duke of York’s theatre was constructed as a replica studio behind glass, complete with a console and two hippy engineers. A thunderbolt of a show.Read the review.Arifa AkbarView image in fullscreenRecord-breaking … Stereophonic.Photograph: Marc BrennerComedy10.Sam Nicoresti:Baby DoomerWhen she and her girlfriend wondered how to pay for their upcoming wedding, Sam Nicoresti had a brainwave. “It’s easy, I’ll just win the Edinburgh comedy award!” And so she did, with this big-hitting, bid-for-the-mainstream hour, packed with jokes about gender transition, Gollum and a farcical incident in a high street changing room.Read the review9.John Tothill: This Must Be HeavenHis first and second standup shows both nearly drove John Tothill to an early grave – one, when the drugs trial that funded it went wrong; the other, when its run fell foul of a critical bout of appendicitis. But the third, which related the latter misadventure, broke him – and his fizzy, scholarly but hedonistic comedy – into the big time.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenBreaking into the big time … John Tothill.8.Tim Key: LoganberryGoodness me, Tim Key was in masterful form with this latest idiosyncratic standup hour, premiering at the Edinburgh fringe and touring in the new year. An oddball spin on the midlife crisis show, toying with Key’s supposed angst about his age, self-worth, celebrity status and singledom, it revealed an act in complete command of his unlike-any-other style.Read the review7.Ayoade Bamgboye: Swings and RoundaboutsThe best newcomer award at the fringe has launched some big talents over the years – Tim Minchin, Sarah Millican, Harry Hill. You wouldn’t back against Ayoade Bamgboye joining their ranks after this super-bright, always surprising and tricksy tale of cultural crossover and coming of age. One of 2025’s most arresting debuts.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenBest newcomer … Ayoade Bamgboye.6.Simple TownSimple by name, slippery by nature, this comedy quartet from New York made quite the splash on the fringe, watering the arid local sketch-comedy landscape with smart-slacker vignettes forever dodging your efforts to pin them down. A welcome reminder of how joyful team comedy can be.Read the review5.Adam Riches and John Kearns ARE Ball & BoePremiering last Christmas (after annual “Best of” lists had already been compiled!), but revived this year, Kearns and Riches’ affectionate send-up of the crooning duo made for an utterly irresistible hour, exploring double-act dynamics and the art v commerce struggle in patently ridiculous fashion.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenIrresistible … Adam Riches and John Kearns ARE Ball & Boe.Photograph: Matt Stronge4.Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive ComedianCan you be sexyandfunny? Can you be funny about being sexy? And if the answer’s yes, then why the backlash against Aussie import Elouise Eftos’s fabulous provocation of a show? Eftos lays out her ideas, and the pushback against them, in character (or is she?) as the hottest woman in the room, in a fantastically teasing hour on our vexed relationship with good looks.Read the review3.John Early: The Album TourThere’s a brand of comedy that splays across the stage millennial solipsism in the age of social media, and its high priest is John Early. This rare UK appearance by the Search Party star, at Soho Theatre Walthamstow, was a 2025 highlight, a variety night of pop covers, character work and standup comedy laying himself, and his vexed generation, bare.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenLaid bare … John Early.2.Cat Cohen: Broad StrokesBroad Strokes told the story of what happened whenthe most neurotically self-absorbed act in cabaret-comedy, New Yorker Cat Cohen, experienced a stroke at 30 (“isn’t thatsocreative?”) The diametric opposite of “trauma comedy”, the result was playful, musical, whip-smart and deliciously coy with our expectations that Cohen take her material remotely seriously.Read the review1.Nick Mohammed Is Mr Swallow: Show PonyIt’s been a big year for actor-comedian Nick Mohammed – and not just because of The Celebrity Traitors. Had he gone nowhere near Ardross Castle, 2025 would have remained a big step forward for the 45-year-old, who delivered a career-best standup set, Show Pony. Most of his previous stage work shrouded Mohammed like a traitor’s cloak behind magic, memory tricks and his bumptious northern alter ego, Mr Swallow. Here, Mohammed gave us that beloved character, but more of himself too – or at least the version of himself our identity-obsessed age demands. So was this a coming-out party, or a satire on a culture that demands Mohammed play up the identity it ascribes to him? Intriguingly, hilariously, it was both – and much more besides.Read the review.Brian LoganView image in fullscreenBig year … Nick Mohammed.Photograph: Matt CrockettDance10.Ebony ScroogeA late entry into the Top 10 for a new Christmas show from ZooNation, experts in feelgood energy and putting a twist on classic titles. Choreographer Dannielle “Rhimes” Lecointe turned Dickens’ A Christmas Carol into a hip-hop fable, the dancers as tight as Scrooge’s accounting and a helluva lot more fun.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenFeelgood energy … Leah Hill as Ebony Scrooge.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian9.Akram Khan: ThikraOK, so you might have to forget about trying to work out the story – narrative clarity has never been Khan’s strong point – but the magicking up of an enveloping atmosphere and a strong eye for visual drama and design absolutely are. Thikra swirled around themes of life, afterlife, spirits and spirituality.Read the review8.Manuel Liñán: Muerta de AmorA show with all the emotions turned up to 11 – as you’d expect from flamenco – especially passion and desire. But with Liñán, it’s never in a trite way. The choreographer and his all-male cast dealt in neediness and vulnerability as well as coursing testosterone, with singer Mara Rey matching them for power.Read the review7.QuadropheniaA mod ballet powered by an orchestral version of the Who’s Quadrophenia album, as well as by the timeless frustration and alienation of youth and a wardrobe full of Paul Smith suits. Perhaps it shouldn’t have worked, but it did, thanks to strong designs, killer riffs and dancer Paris Fitzpatrick in the lead.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenMod rules … Paris Fitzpatrick and Serena McCall in Quadrophenia: A Mod Ballet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian6.We Should Have Never Walked on the MoonA very cool event. In a collab with Rambert dance company, French collective (La)Horde took over the whole Southbank Centre, with 80 performers appearing across multiple levels and spaces, inside and out. The result was a buzzy if often bleak take on the distractions of screen-filtered 21st-century life.Read the review5.Trisha Brown Dance CompanyThe late Trisha Brown was a titan of postmodern dance and this was a welcome chance to see 1985’s Working Title. Brown’s reputation is well known, but the revelation of this double bill was companion piece In the Fall, by French choreographer Noé Soulier: an immensely satisfying exercise in clarity.Read the review4.Nico Muhly’s Marking TimeThree new dance works set to the music of Nico Muhly and each one a corker. Jules Cunningham offered up their strongest work yet; Maud Le Pladec gave us sirens in sequins and Michael Keegan-Dolan stole the show with a wild ride featuring folk singer Sam Amidon and a clan of dancing skeletons.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenWild ride … Sam Amidon, top, in The Only Tune by Michael Keegan-Dolan, part of Marking Time.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian3.Royal Ballet: PerspectivesThere was beautiful partnering for the male leads William Bracewell and Matthew Ball in Cathy Marston’s world premiere, Against the Tide, inspired by Benjamin Britten’s Violin Concerto. This triple bill also saw the Royal Ballet’s first stab at a work by American Justin Peck, attacked with sunny energy and precision.Read the review2.Figures in ExtinctionYou have to admire choreographer Crystal Pite, not just for her craft – masterful as it is – but for the way she tackles real-world issues, like the precarious future of our natural world (and humanity itself) in this collaboration with Complicité’s Simon McBurney and Nederlands Dans Theater. Things seem more hopeful in Pite’s hands.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenPure pleasure … Thick & Tight: Natural Behaviour.Photograph: Rosie Powell1.Thick & Tight: Natural BehaviourAn utterly unique and eccentric duo – Daniel Hay-Gordon and El Perry – who somehow manage to be completely left-field and yet very accessible at the same time. This show, the format like a series of sketches, had satire, silliness and lip-syncing. It had thoughtful portraits of cultural icons and the warmth of community – with a host of guest dancers. It had the pure pleasure of moving to music and some moments of divine dancing. It also had Perry and Hay-Gordon dressed as an orange pantomime horse with Donald Trump’s face coming out of its bottom.

Normally this means clear-eyed fables of teenagers and twentysomethings living in difficult circumstances: nightmare parents, petty crime, drugs and jail. In a series of films between the mid-90s and early-10s, they twice won the Palme d’Or, plus the best screenplay and the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival for their distinctive brand of naturalist storytelling, employing a light-on-its-feet handheld travelling-camera style to deal with some seriously dark material. Then came bit of a wobble; perhaps their success opened up opportunities they couldn’t turn down. They found themselves working with an actual film star (Marion Cotillard) and then turned to hot-button issues –radical Islamism in Young Ahmed,illegal immigration in Tori and Lokita– which perhaps didn’t bring the best out of them.Well, all this is a preamble to saying that Young Mothers sees the Dardennes fully back in their comfort zone, with material and actors they know how to deal with. The subject, as the title suggests, is the young women who find themselves pregnant, or with very young children, and who are heartbreakingly ill-equipped to deal with the situation. Challenges range from basic techniques of baby care – one, for example, has to be reminded to take her phone off the baby changing mat – to the emotional storms of recalcitrant boyfriends, drug dependency and narcissistic and uninterested parents of their own.You could imagine the world’s most earnest (and hard to watch) documentary being carved out of this. But what the Dardennes have is an almost miraculous ability to make even the most rotten scenarios – a hapless adopted teenager stalking their birth mother to her crummy job, or an addict waking up in hospital after an overdose – live and breathe through the sheer power of empathy.It helps of course that the Dardennes are absolute masters at directing young actors, male and female; no one here puts a foot wrong or is anything other than fully identified with the role they play. The brothers juggle several strands effortlessly, and construct their narratives so precisely that even the existence of a bedroom window overlooking the Meuse river seems like a major moment of triumph.Part of what makes the Dardennes’ films work so well is the way they use the camera; almost entirely handheld, it is like an extra person in the room, or car, or on the street – and by extension it brings us, the viewers, directly into the scene. It’s a major point of contrast with Loach, who prefers a more classical, coverage-oriented style, where the camera (and us) sit back and watch what’s going on almost invisibly. Moreover, while the Dardennes don’t use anything as crass as point of view shots, their filming while walking and nervy pans get inside the anxious heads of their protagonists with tremendous effectiveness. Long may it continue.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest films UK 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Arts in the UK are underfunded and overburdened with bureaucracy to gain what little money there is in a contracting industry. It’s heartening, then, to see a major new charity step into the breach.Veteran London-based violin dealersJ&A Bearehave supported students and professional players with loan-instruments for nearly five decades. Now they up the ante with a new Cultural Trust, founded to supply masterclasses, scholarships and practical support for string players. A biennial mini festival, featuring Beare’s instruments and their international players, launched last night at a sold-out Cadogan Hall, with a second concert at the Wigmore Hall this evening.Talk about a supergroup. The sheer weight of star-power marshalled here was dizzying: violinists Janine Jansen, Ning Feng and Alexander Sitkovetsky; French quartet Quatuor Ébène; violists Timothy Ridout and Amihai Grosz; cellists Kian Soltani and Daniel Blendulf. But an army of musical generals needs serious musical terrain to conquer, and they got it in Schubert’s monumental String Quintet in C major – the composer’s 1828 farewell to chamber music and to life – and Schoenberg’s rule-breaking, harmony-bending 1899 sextet Verklärte Nacht. The opening sextet from Strauss’s Capriccio was a buffer zone between.View image in fullscreenGallic elegance: Quatuor Ébène with(far right)Kian SoltaniPhotograph: Simon Weir/Simon Weir - Classical MediaThe Schubert saw the Ébènes joined by Soltani; where Mozart and Beethoven added an extra viola to their quintets, Schubert chose a cello. The effect is anchoring, spacious, rooting a musical glimpse of heaven absolutely in earth. And it was Soltani who provided this guide-rope, the ghostly violin’s insistently corporeal double in the famous adagio, a defiant life-force in the fanfares of the scherzo, holding us fast through the convulsive dance of the finale. If the quartet’s instinct was to skate with Gallic elegance on the surface of this vast work, Soltani’s was to dig in. The resulting conversation, sometimes debate, was compelling.Where Schubert teeters on the brink of life, Schoenberg stands at the edge of harmony itself, one foot suspended over the void. When Jansen recorded it in 2013, she and her hand-picked group leaned hard into that extremity, underlining the musical melodrama of a narrative that sees a woman confess to her lover that she is pregnant by another man. The Dutch violinist’s approach has since audibly softened, her own moonlit tone – glinting high and sweet through the ensemble, silver to viola Grosz’s bronze warmth – drawing out the strange, transformative mystery of this “Transfigured Night”. Collegiate intimacy was uppermost here, letting the supple score find its own shape without undue intervention. It takes a lot of skill to wrestle Schoenberg’s score into submission, still more to surrender so completely to it.Beare’s Chamber Music festival concludes tonightat Wigmore Hall, LondonExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responsesGuardian readersWed 17 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 07.34 ESTShareAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached thehighest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a songthought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.With this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.‘There was one song I actually liked’I have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some peoplefall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content.Casey, 37, Chicago, US‘There’s no heart in music generated by AI’There’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.As for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website.Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland‘I’m happy with musicians using AI as a tool’I believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.But I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions.Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, SouthamptonView image in fullscreenLess than fab … AI-generated band Velvet Sundown.Illustration: Velvet Sundown‘It’s stopping creativity’AI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.If you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material.Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham‘It’s not a neutral tool ’When social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.Blatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void.Charlotte, student, CornwallMusicians are deeply concerned about AI. So why are the major labels embracing it?Read more‘I worry I would become dependent on the technology’In my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.I might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.Geoff Smith, 65, musician and retired headteacher, CornwallExplore more on these topicsMusicArtificial intelligence (AI)Pop and rockComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Happy Birthday hides a tale of corporate greed. And Putin uses Shostakovich’s Leningrad symphony as a call to arms. That’s why I put them in my soundtrack to the complexities of human existenceTom ServiceWed 17 Dec 2025 11.04 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 11.05 ESTShareThe idea was always a ludicrous one: to reduce millennia of human musical history – not to mention billennia of the Earth’s sonic geology – into a book of 50 pieces of music. And yet that’s the challenge I decided to take on. The most pressing question was: why? To which my answer was: the inevitable failures and gaps of the project are precisely where its interest lies.The next concern was how. Called A History of the World in 50 Pieces, the book is not a digested history of music, nor a list of my favourite songs, performances or recordings. Instead, it’s centred on the definition of a “piece of music”. This is a democratic principle – a belief that works don’t belong only to their creators but are shared and reinterpreted by generations of musicians at distances of time, geography and technology, in ways their original composers and performers could not imagine.The Nazis twisted 'all people should be brothers' to mean 'non-brothers should be exterminated'The point of a piece of music is not to exist in a definitive version – be it a recording, a single performance or even a fixed score – but to be continually remade in a cycle of transformation, in which the experience of the piece belongs to anyone who plays or hears it. This way of thinking throws up unexpected and serendipitous connections. Before writing the book, I wouldn’t have thought there were resonances between Beethoven, Mildred and Patty J Hill, and Shostakovich. Yet all have written music that reveals what happens when, whether by accident or design, you dream of musical utopias and write tunes for the whole world.Let’s take Beethoven first, and his Ninth (“Choral”) Symphony. The final movement is the moment when instrumental music alone cannot sustain the full power of Beethoven’s message. The Ode to Joy melody emerges first as a hymn for the cellos and basses to sing, before the tune takes over the whole orchestra – and ushers in the voices of Beethoven’s chorus. The Ode to Joy is Beethoven’s theme of themes, settingFriedrich Schiller’s proto-revolutionary text. It is a dream of universal compassion, a message of sublime connection conveying the essentially humanist philosophy of Beethoven’s music.View image in fullscreenSolidarity … Ode to Joy was the soundtrack to student protests in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on 4 May 1989.Photograph: Peter Turnley/Getty ImagesHis own sketches show how hard the composer worked to arrive at a tune that could be simple and satisfying enough for a new world to sing. And it worked. The success – and the curse – of The Ode to Joy melody is that Beethoven achieved his wish. The idea of “joy” may seem to be apolitical but, taken on its own, the melody can be attached to any ideology you want.The Ode to Joy was used to soundtrack the hopes for freedom and democracy in China’s Tiananmen Square in 1989, with students blasting it from makeshift speakers as the tanks rolled in. It was sung after the fall of the Berlin Wall the same year, with “Freude” (joy) changed to “Freiheit” (freedom).But the tune has also been made into an ode to hate, twisted by the Nazis to mean, as Beethoven’s biographer Jan Swafford puts it, not that “all people should be brothers” but that “nonbrothers should be exterminated”. Beethoven’s tune is the anthem of the European Union, but it was also the national anthem of apartheid Rhodesia. And, after one performance, Stalin declared: “This is the right music for the masses.” It’s not that Ode to Joy hasn’t worked as a song that everyone can sing – it’s that it’s worked too well. That is the problem with musical utopias: they can be all too easily mobilised for political propaganda, whatever the ideals of their creators.View image in fullscreenMake a wish … Happy Birthday was bought for $22m.Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStockAs for Mildred and Patty J Hill, the only utopia they were dreaming of when they wrote the tune we now know as Happy Birthday, was to compose a song for their kindergarten students to welcome the new day. The words were originally Good Morning to All, and were only changed on a whim when the sisters wanted to wish a friend happy birthday in a cabin in Kentucky in the 1890s. From that simple act of creative generosity, the Happy Birthday melody went on to become the planet’s most recognisable melody, the one tune that unites cultures, communities and families.Butthe story of Happy Birthdayisn’t only a celebration of how – thanks to printing, early broadcast technology, and sheer earworminess – a humble melody got into the world’s consciousness and stuck. It is also a story of corporate greed and courtroom drama. The Hill sisters wanted the tune to be part of our creative commons, but after 1933, when the melody appeared in Irving Berlin’s musical As Thousands Cheer, lawyers and publishers began to make claims for payment for its use.View image in fullscreen‘This music is about all forms of bondage’  … Dmitri Shostakovich during the siege of Leningrad in 1941.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesIn 1988, Warner Chappell became Happy Birthday’s legal custodians,having bought the rights for $22m(£16m). The music publisher made an estimated $2m (£1.5m) a year when the tune was used across public media and in places where music was licensed, including restaurants. It is only thanks to the film-maker Jenn Nelson, who won a case in 2016 that asserted the melody didn’t belong to the publisher but to all of us who sing it, that the tune and its words became legally as well as musically part of the world’s “common property”, as Patty J Hill put it. Where she and her sister always wanted it to be.But tunes that everyone can remember, that we can all hum or sing, aren’t always expressions of our common humanity. They can also represent the curdling of community into the violence of crowds; the virus of everyday evil growing unchecked to take over the whole of society.Shostakovich’s Seventh Symphony, “the Leningrad”, was performed in that besieged city in 1942, after arguably the world’s single most courageous act of orchestra-building, in the face of the Nazi onslaught.At this moment of seeming calm, Shostakovich’s symphony becomes a place of insidious terrorAfter a conventional enough opening, the music in the first movement dissolves to single lines of woodwind. And, at just this moment of seeming calm and tranquility, Shostakovich’s symphony becomes a place of insidious terror. In the distance is the tattoo of a militaristic rhythm on a side-drum, before a melody begins in the solo flute. The instantly memorable yet ordinary tune doesn’t do anything “symphonic”: it repeats and repeats, louder and louder, building eventually into a violent orchestral juggernaut.It is a satirical tune, deliberately stupid, based on music by Franz Léhar, who was a favourite of Hitler’s. The “we’re off to Maxim’s” melody, from Léhar’s frothy operetta The Merry Widow, seems to be attempting to steamroller the symphony out of existence, echoing what the Nazis were trying to do to Leningrad. But it’s more than that. Talking about this devastating passage of his symphony, Shostakovich said: “Music can never be literally tied to a theme. This music is about all forms of terror, slavery, the bondage of the spirit.” His piece wasn’t only about Nazism, “but about our [Russian] system, or any form of totalitarian regime”.View image in fullscreenOde to freedom … New Year’s Eve, 1989, at the Berlin Wall just after the fall of communism in East Germany.Photograph: Owen Franken/Corbis/Getty ImagesThis passage is a traumatic experience from which the rest of the symphony will try to recover. In its finale, the music vindicates the optimism of its opening moments in one of orchestral music’s most jaw-dropping spectacles of hard-won victory. That’s how this piece was played and interpreted by audiences all over the world during the second world war, when it was broadcast from London and New York, after the score had been microfilmed and flown in secret out of Russia.Yet the symphony finds itself in a contested position today. There’s Shostakovich the composer and freedom-fighter versus the Shostakovich used by Putin’s regime in the 2020s for nationalistic propaganda. In a speech in August 2022, six months after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin spoke at an 80th anniversary performance of the symphony by the Russian National Youth Symphony Orchestra: “Shostakovich’s Leningrad Symphony continues to evoke the strongest feelings in new generations,” he said. “It makes them share in the bitterness of loss and the joy of victory, love for the Motherland and readiness to defend it.”View image in fullscreen‘It continues to evoke the strongest feelings’ … Vladimir Putin delivers an address to concertgoers attending the 80th anniversary performance of Shostakovich’s Seventh.Photograph: AlamyPutin was enlisting Shostakovich’s symphony, and the young orchestral players who were performing it, as surrogate soldiers: part of the same war effort that sends Russia’s youth to the frontline. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, the symphony is performed to embody resistance to exactly the kind of autocracy and despotism represented by Putin’s Russia.War music: the humanity, heroism and propaganda behind Shostakovich’s Symphony No 7Read moreThese are tunes for the whole world, capturing our complex history. This collective music-making reflects the whole of humanity: it will not be limited to parts or readings that certain individuals may want to champion, however laudable and virtuous.

He’d arranged for eight “pseudo-patients” to attend appointments at psychiatric institutions, where they complained to doctors about hearing voices that said “empty”, “hollow” and “thud”. All were admitted, diagnosed with either schizophrenia or manic-depressive psychosis. They immediately stopped displaying any “symptoms” and started saying they felt fine. The first got out after seven days; the last after 52.Told of these findings, psychiatrists at a major teaching hospital found it hard to believe that they’d make the same mistake, so Rosenhan devised another experiment: over the next three months, he informed them, one or more pseudopatients would go undercover and, at the end, staff would be asked to decide who had been faking it. Of 193 patients admitted, 20% were deemed suspicious. It was then that Rosenhan revealed this had been a ruse as well: no pseudopatients had been sent to the hospital at all. Not only had doctors failed to spot sane people in their midst; they couldn’t reliably recognise the actually insane.Rosenhan’s gambit seized the public imagination. Were the men in white suits just quacks? Was mental illness even real? Two years later, the filmOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nestadded to the sense of reputational meltdown, and the psychiatric establishment responded with a major tightening up of diagnostic criteria, squeezing disparate symptoms into even tighter boxes. A freewheeling challenge to psychiatry ended up provoking a kind of counter-reformation, making the profession more medicalised than it had been for decades.The whole affair is a neat example of the ideological switchbacks Edward Bullmore maps in his fascinating, personally inflected history of psychiatric ideas. It is all the more mind-boggling – pun intended – when you find out Rosenhan’s paper was largely made up. Research by journalist Susannah Cahalan in 2019concluded thatmost of the pseudopatients were invented; one colleague remembered the psychologist as a “bullshitter”.Whether or not he lied, though, Rosenhan exposed a faultline that has run through the field almost since its inception. Bullmore, a professor of psychiatry, blames it on a bogus divide between the body and the mind. He calls this the “original schism”, bequeathed to us by Descartes, and before him Saint Paul. It falsely suggests that our thoughts and any psychological distress we experience exist in a separate domain, detached from the flesh. Diseases are either “organic” (like cholera or Alzheimer’s) or “functional” (like depression or schizophrenia), emerging mysteriously from an entirely healthy body.Practically speaking, this schism cleaves psychiatry from the rest of medicine, meaning the physical health of patients with mental illness is often badly neglected. But it also sets up a division within psychiatry itself, between what has been referred to glibly as the “mindless” tribe, which believes biology explains everything, and the “brainless” one, which ignores neuroscience and looks for answers in a person’s upbringing and way of relating to the world.The emerging picture marries biology and experience in a way that was always inevitable, since they are not really divided at allWe’re all familiar with Sigmund Freud, patron saint of the brainless contingent (though the founder of psychoanalysis started out as a neuroanatomist, and – unlike some of his disciples – found iteasy to imaginethat advances in biology might one day replace “the whole of our artificial structure of hypothesis”). But his mindless contemporary, Emil Kraepelin, is far less well-known, “the most important psychiatrist you’ve never heard of”, according to Bullmore.Kraepelin led a German school of thought that saw mental illnesses as manifestations of physical disease, and imagined that, as with tuberculosis, a causal factor or “germ” would surely one day be found to explain them. His focus – and Bullmore’s – is the pattern of symptoms we know as schizophrenia, which Kraepelin called dementia praecox (“early dementia”). For him, the contents of any given psychosis – delusions, paranoid fantasies – were only relevant insofar as they suggested a diagnosis. Interpreting them would not help.When, after Rosenhan’s antics, a new diagnostic manual was issued by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980, it was labelled “neo-Kraepelinian”. But before that, the pendulum had already swung several times – from the first murmurings of dissent by Freud and his followers, to the genocidal overreach of the German school under Nazism, to the “victory” of the refugee psychoanalysts in the aftermath of the second world war. Bullmore is excellent at showing how our understanding of mental illness has not blindly “followed the science”, patterning instead with the tides of history. The brainless tribe won the literal war – and, as a result, the intellectual one as well.But science does march on, and in the last four decades there has been loads of it, which Bullmore charts from his vantage point first at the Maudsley in London, where the tribes clustered in different parts of the canteen, and then at the University of Cambridge. One of his touchstones is Susan Sontag’s essay Illness As Metaphor, which showed how any “intractable and capricious” disease becomes a container for morbid fantasies until such time as we have a better explanation. Now we know that TB is a bacterial infection of the lungs, we don’t tend to think that sensitive poets are naturally more prone to it, as we once did.Schizophrenia may finally be on the cusp of that transformation – something truly momentous, given the puzzle this strange and brutal disease has posed for so long. As Bullmore carefully explains, advances in scanning, maths, genomics and immunology have piled up to give us a clearer understanding of the illness. It is probably caused by the abnormal development of brain networks in childhood and adolescence; this, the evidence suggests, happens under the influence of immune dysfunction, and the cause of that is variation in a broad range of genes, interacting in particular ways with the environment. Triggers can include infections, abuse, social stress or drug use.The emerging picture marries biology and experience in a way that was always inevitable, since they are not really divided at all – and offers promising new avenues for prevention. The task for the next generation is to translate the science into better outcomes in the real world. Given what we now know, prevention, including better health and social services for mothers and young children, should play a major role.And what about those colourful types, the anti-psychiatrists? In the 1960s, the shaman-like figure of RD Laing captured the zeitgeist with his idea that psychosis was simply a rational person’s attempt to “live in an unliveable situation” – of which the modern world provided plenty. Bullmore admits that the anti-psychiatrists “have a lot of the best tunes”. I imagine that many of Laing’s insights could survive the new model of schizophrenia as descriptions of social stress, but despite being sympathetic to him in a romantic kind of way, Bullmore doesn’t really make an attempt at salvage. Nor does he examine the adverse effects of powerful, chronically administered psychiatric medication, and how these might confound some of the evidence of biological differences in people with schizophrenia – something contemporary anti-psychiatrists will doubtless take issue with.But he is emphatic about the need to reckon with psychiatry’s dark past. When he started to research the Nazi programme to exterminate psychiatric patients, he was surprised to find “remarkably little” material in any language for him to consult. This is despite the fact that about 260,000 asylum inmates were murdered, something that followed directly from the theory of dementia praecox as a disorder of one or two defective genes that could be expunged from thevolk. This violence continues to cast its shadow, and he notes that most psychiatrists, regardless of tribe, would agree that “to recover from trauma it is important to talk about it, somehow, at some stage in the recovery process”.Bullmore’s writing has flair and occasional flashes of anarchic humour; as with his 2018 study of depression, The Inflamed Mind, this book is both intellectually exciting and highly readable. Like the best of his psychiatric forebears, he is far from the stern megalomaniac of caricature, animated instead by a desire to do right by his patients, to cut through the ideological commitments that slow down progress, and above all, to understand.The Divided Mind: A New Way of Thinking About Mental Health by Edward Bullmore is published by New River (£20).

And then, in the first person, there is an iron age teenage girl, the druid of her village, riding towards a Roman town with her brother Aesu and friend Crab: “I had been druid for two seasons at that point and everyone said I was doing very well.”Agnes has a post-doctoral fellowship in Manchester, from which she is summoned to the discovery of a body in a peat bog in Ludlow. The story shadows that of Lindow Man, found by peat harvesters in a bog near Wilmslow in 1984. In this novel, “Ludlow” is a town in which “the steel mill has closed down” leaving nothing but “[a] few shops, a Tesco, a Pizza Express”. It’s “the Gateway to the north” and a bus ride from Manchester. Novelists may of course invent time and place as they see fit, but it’s an odd choice to borrow the location of a bourgeois satellite town of Manchester and give it the name of a pretty medieval market town in the Welsh Marches, with a history that belongs to neither.Agnes’s weak social skills are balanced by joy in her academic specialism, which allows her to see immediately both that this body is 2,000 years old and that the young woman lived for weeks after her obvious injuries. Her knowledge and instinct for individual living and dead bodies is the strongest element of this uneven novel. She can read the way people move and keep still in ways she can’t read voices and faces, and she cares about particular lives in ways she doesn’t care for ecology or archaeology in general.North builds and sustains a material world vividly and with close attention to the bodily experiences of light, landscape and textilesPeople pile in after the discovery of the body: environmentalists who want to save the bog from developers, the niece of a woman whose husband confessed to killing her and dumping the body there 40 years ago, archaeologists seeing a career-making find, but Agnes is the only one primarily concerned with one ancient girl’s life and death. Her own backstory is well told, its American setting as solid as the present-day Manchester/Ludlow is wobbly.It’s likely that readers without much knowledge of iron age archaeology and bog bodies would find those sections comfortable enough. North builds and sustains a material world vividly and with close attention to the bodily experiences of light, landscape and textiles. The scene where the young druid encounters some of the power and goods of the Roman empire is memorable. But even from a position of amateur enthusiasm more than expertise, I’m distracted by oddities in this world: distinctly modern shame at a pregnancy outside “marriage”; archaeologists speculating that those who put the bodies in the bog intended them to be found later, when there is widespread evidence that many were taken from bogs, kept indoors and put back several times over centuries. There’s always an interesting question about the representation of historic and prehistoric speech and worldview, and no correct answer, but North’s solutions are unthinkingly modern in ways that Sarah Hall’s, for example, are not.The extent to which it’s possible for fiction to voice or represent the lives of plants and animals is important to many modern writers whose thinking includes environmental crisis. The risk is anthropomorphism, and the disclaimer at the top of each section that “a colony of moss does not” imagine/narrate/remember whatever it then goes on to do is not enough to avoid the error. North’s mossy chorus is little more than a projection of human eco-anxiety, in the same way that her iron age story doesn’t step far from the assumptions and traditions of 21st-century America, and her mash-up of English cities and towns doesn’t recognise the specificities of place and time. Bog Queen could be, and occasionally is, beautifully strange, but overall, imagination and research don’t reach far enough.Bog Queen by Anna North is published by W&N (£18.99).

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 17 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.43 ESTShareTheFalloutTV series returns to Prime Video today, and it’s fair to say that everyone was pleasantly surprised by how good the first season was. By portraying Fallout’s retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic US through three different characters, it managed to capture different aspects of the game player’s experience, too. There was vault-dweller Lucy, trying to do the right thing and finding that the wasteland made that very difficult; Max, the Brotherhood of Steel rookie, who starts to question his cult’s authority and causes a lot of havoc in robotic power armour; and the Ghoul, Walton Goggins’s breakout character, who has long since lost any sense of morality out in the irradiated wilderness.The show’s first season ended with a revelation about who helped cause the nuclear war that trapped a group of people in underground vaults for a couple of centuries. It also left plenty of questions open for the second season – and, this time, expectations are higher. Even being “not terrible” was a win for a video game adaptation until quite recently. How are the Fallout TV show’s creators feeling now that the first season has been a success?“We’ll take ‘not terrible’ – let’s get that on a poster,” says Jonah Nolan, the director who co-created the series with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. I’m speaking to them alongside Bethesda’s Todd Howard, director of the most recent Fallout video games. Ilast met with Nolan and Howardin 2024, before the first season premiered. Howard had been holding out a long time to make a Fallout adaptation, waiting for someone who seemed to really understand the series. Nolan, a lifelong player, was that person. Howard was poised with a red pen when he received the first script, but was relieved to find it was “fabulous”.“Going into the first season everyone’s like, ‘Just get it right’,” says Howard. “We’re over the moon with the reception to the show, so this time people are coming in with more excitement and different expectations.”View image in fullscreenA criminal paradise … Fallout: New Vegas.Photograph: BethesdaThe second season is set in New Vegas, the site of 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas, which had the best writing and characters of any game in the series, even if it was a bit broken. The post-nuclear Strip was a kind of decaying criminal paradise full of warring factions and down-and-out inhabitants having as good a time as they can, given the bleak circumstances. It was shot in the real-world Nevada desert, and all over California. “It’s more of a desert vibe, a Mohave vibe, that’s so essential to that game,” says Nolan. “That dusty, blasted-out Route 66 vibe of the game is so much fun to bring into the show.”In the show, a long time has passed since the events of the New Vegas game by the time Lucy and the Ghoul arrive in the city, but Howard says that it does reference the player’s journey. “When you’re doing a location that gamers know so well … honouring everyone’s journey through that game was a trick,” he says. “Time has moved on. What is New Vegas like now?… if you’re a fan of that game there’s so much to love in season two, visually and also with the factions and what’s going on with them.”The Fallout TV series has a tactile feel – its creators ensured real props and sets were built, echoing the cobbled-together nature of the settlements in the games, where everyone is building stuff out of trash and every town is shoved together from whatever anyone can find. “As a sci-fi fan, so many shows I watch, I’m aware that they’re all standing in front of a blue screen,” says Robertson-Dworet. “The whole point of an adaptation, especially of a video game, is to feel like it’s real … of course, we still augment with VFX but, wherever possible, actors are actually standing in front of locations I loved seeing in the game.”In fact, pretty much everything you see on-screen is real, even the infamously terrifying irradiated monsters, the Deathclaws. They were scary even as blobs of pixels in the original 90s Fallout games. In the show, they’re puppets, and apparently pretty frightening up close. “It was the closest look I’d ever gotten at a Deathclaw. In Fallout 4, whenever I saw one, it would instantly kill me,” laughs Nolan. “It was quite peculiar being able to stand there and stare at it.”“Even the radscorpion puppet was amazingly scary,” adds Robertson-Dworet. “It was sobig– the mama scorp, that is. The little ones were fine, they were like overgrown lobsters, but it was genuinely very scary when the puppeteer was charging the big one at me.”The Fallout series works because it’s made by talented film-makers who are also players and with the help of the people who created the actual games. Howard is replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment and resuming a long-dormant obsession with EA’s college (American) football games; Nolan has spent the summer playingZelda: Tears of the Kingdomwith his entire family; Robertson-Dworet is still working on scripts for the show, so she’s playing a lot of New Vegas (as is her husband).(Not everyone involved with the show is a gamer, though. In an interview withPC Gamer, Goggins the Ghoul said he had never played a Fallout game and had no intention of doing so. “No, I haven’t sat down to play the games. And I won’t. I won’t,” he said. “I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.” It’s OK, Walton, nobody is judging your gamer cred.)The second season is coming out weekly rather than in one binge-able batch of episodes, so we will all be experiencing it differently from last season – including Howard, Nolan and Robertson-Dworet, who will now be looking out for people’s reactions every week.“It has more depth, it’s bigger, it’s funnier, it has a lot of surprises,” says Howard. “I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.”What to playView image in fullscreenA folklore mystery … Year Walk.Illustration: SimogoSwedish developer Simogo made some of the most interesting iPhone and iPad games of the 2010s, from the unforgettable puzzle game Device 6 to the eerieYear Walk.

Tired of the fussy nature of console development, the pair would stake their claim on Apple’s App Store, which in 2010 was regarded as one of the most exciting frontiers in games. Mashing their names together to form a portmanteau, Flesser and Gardebäck became Simogo, and a consistently wonderful and forward-thinking games studios was born.Simogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years. Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.Thank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)And oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.Simogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s originon their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.Times have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.Simogo Legacy Collection is out now; £13.49Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

That might be an ever more unattainable ideal in our time of Punch and Judy politics, culture wars and artistic self-censorship. This is one of the reasons why Sam Grabiner’s play about a north London Jewish family eating dinner on Christmas Day feels so singularly outspoken.It begins lightly with humour (“You’re not Larry David, you’re from Hendon”), then builds to bickering and full-on fallouts, covering antisemitism, spirituality, belonging and how the Israel-Gaza war has shaped these Londoners’ sense of self. There is certainly no conflation of Israel and Jewishness but a deliberate foray into this highly charged and contested ground.View image in fullscreenEmotional … Samuel Blenkin in Christmas Day.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt is not a perfect play but an immensely courageous one. So is its programming by outgoing artistic director Rupert Goold. I have not seen a drama that deals with British Jewish identity with this much complexity. There are some manufactured rows between characters as a result, but they hold you, and emanate danger merely in their airing.In James Macdonald’s interval-free production, the dinner begins as father Elliot (Nigel Lindsay) visits his son, Noah (Samuel Blenkin), and daughter, Tamara (Bel Powley). They are living in an abandoned office cum squat and Miriam Buether’s set design gives it the slightly sinister gloom of an underground bunker. Various others drift in, including non-Jewish flatmate Maud (Callie Cooke), who carries the comic burden of explaining yuletide ritual, and Tamara’s ex-boyfriend Jack, returning from Israel and now called Aaron (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd). The word “genocide” causes the biggest explosion when Tamara uses it to describe the killings in Gaza.“Have you seen the news?” characters ask each other without naming the incident directly. It could be a reference to theBondi beach terror attacktargeting Hanukah celebrations; it might be the latest news of terror out of Gaza or equally, you feel, a terrible global event that has led this family into an underground refuge.The drama meanders, as if unfolding in real time. Sometimes its silences are reminiscent ofAnnie Baker; at other times they feel arid. The play throws curveballs that come to nothing, such as a doped-up flatmate who passes through, as does a drug dealer (both played by Jamie Ankrah). Too many plot revelations come after the central discussions and it enters a symbolic realm in the last moments, which include a dead fox and a ritualistic baptism of sorts. This is an arcane part of the play’s risk-taking that does not come off.But what is remarkable is that, despite the ideological gulfs between the characters, there is an underlying affinity that allows them to disagree. Tamara argues against occupation and Israel itself. Elliot, pained by her logic, has a more emotional response: “They [Palestinians] had their chance … It’s ours now.” This is stuff you don’t hear said aloud and it is handled with utmost respect for all the perspectives across the dinner-table divides.AtAlmeida theatre, London, until 8 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreJudaismreviewsShareReuse this content"

The deal will run until 2033.“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of theOscarsand our year-round Academy programming,” said the Academy CEO, Bill Kramer and Academy president Lynette Howell Taylor in a statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible – which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”Recent years have seen the Academy try to diversity its voting body, increasing international voters with 21% now from outside the US.Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, hopes the partnership will “inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy”. He also praised the Oscars as one of “our essential cultural institutions”.The deal will also include access to the Governors awards, the nominations announcement, the nominees Luncheon, the student Academy awards, Academy member and film-maker interviews, film education programs, podcasts and more.This year has seen YouTube achieve record viewership shares in the US, remaining the most-watched streamer as network television has struggled to compete. In September, the platform hosted its first ever live NFL game, reaching over 17m viewers.According to theHollywood Reporter, analysts are expecting YouTube TV to become the biggest pay-TV service in the US next year. As of April this year, it had 9.4m subscribers.The news comes after Disney’s ABC in the US scoreda slight increasein ratings for this year’s ceremony with 19.7m viewers. The night was dominated by wins for Sean Baker’s comedy drama Anora.The most-watched ceremony was in 1998 when James Cameron’s blockbuster Titanic swept the board with over 57m Americans tuning in.“ABC has been the proud home to the Oscars for more than half a century,” an ABC spokesperson said. “We look forward to the next three telecasts, including the show’s centennial celebration in 2028, and wish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences continued success.”In 2023, Netflix also picked up the rights to the Screen Actors Guild awards, now known as the Actor awards, moving them from broadcast to streaming. According toVariety, Netflix, as well as NBCUniversal, had also been in the mix as potential buyers for the Oscars.Disney was paying around $100m a year for broadcast rights and is believed to have also been a bidder this time. Last year saw the company stream the awards online for the first time on Hulu.The announcement is expected to create shockwaves in the industry. Puck’s Matthew Bellonipostedon X earlier today: “Academy member meltdown coming in 5….4….3….”Next year’s ceremony, which takes place in March, will feature the first Oscar for casting. Nominations will be announced in January with films such as One Battle After Another, Sinners and Hamnet predicted.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

Greene, who has died suddenly aged 60, brought his unnerving intensity to a handful of high-profile films in the 1990s, including Quentin Tarantino’s brash comic thrillerPulp Fiction(1994).Greene appears in the small but memorable role of a depraved security guard named Zed, who uses the eeny-meeny-miny-moe method to determine which of the two trussed-up captives in a pawn-shop basement – a gangster (Ving Rhames) or a boxer (Bruce Willis) – he should rape first.His eventual demise, after being interrupted during the assault, shot in the groin and left to be tortured by the gangster’s associates, makes possible a much-quoted line delivered by Willis: “Zed’s dead, baby. Zed’s dead.”Greene claimed to have initially declined the role for fear of embarrassing his parents. “Once they said: ‘No, go ahead,’ I said: ‘Fine.’”In the same year, he was a broader but no less menacing villain in the wickedly inventive comedy The Mask. Jim Carrey plays the ineffectual clerk who becomes a hyper-confident, indestructible, lime-faced whirling dervish whenever he dons an enchanted wooden mask. As a ruthless criminal, Greene gets to wear the mask himself during the climax. Unlike Carrey, it renders him not cartoonishly funny but grotesque, with burning red eyes and a forked tongue with which he laps at Cameron Diaz in her movie debut. He is finally flushed away in an ornamental pond that becomes a giant toilet. It’s that sort of film.The Mask took more than $351m, making it the fourth-highest grossing release of 1994. Between that andPulp Fiction, which grossed $213m worldwide, most cinemagoers that year would have been familiar with Greene’s face if not his name.View image in fullscreenPeter Greene, transformed by the mask, left, in The Mask, 1994.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockHe went on to make fleeting appearances in two other well-regarded thrillers,The Usual Suspects(1995) andTraining Day(2001). Christopher McQuarrie, who wrote the former, called him “a million-dollar day player” for his ability to spin gold out of the smallest role.None of those movies demonstrated the extent of Greene’s talent and commitment. That distinction belongs to Clean, Shaven (1993), an uncompromising expressionistic drama in which he plays a tormented man suffering from schizophrenia and searching for his estranged daughter.The first-time director Lodge Kerrigan shot it for just $60,000 over two years, halting production whenever he ran out of money. Though it was Greene’s movie debut, it took so long to make that it was beaten to cinemas by Laws of Gravity (1992), set among the petty thieves of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in which Greene acted alongside the future Sopranos star Edie Falco.Kerrigan recalled him arriving at the audition for Clean, Shaven: “He came in without a head-shot, without a resumé. He had such a high level of energy and a real presence.”View image in fullscreenPeter Greene and Adam Trese in Laws of Gravity, 1992.Photograph: The Shooting Gallery/Kobal/ShutterstockAlong with the film’s desolate cinematography, and the fractured sound design evoking auditory hallucinations, the actor’s jittery, hounded performance was instrumental in providing a small but valuable insight into the schizophrenic experience.Scenes of Greene appearing to gouge his scalp or remove his own fingernail with a pen-knife caused audience members at the Sundance film festival to faint or flee. Though little-seen, the picture was highly respected. The film-maker John Waters programmed it as part of a 2006 season for Here TV called Movies That Will Corrupt You. Another fan, Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Traffic), observed of Greene’s performance: “Even when he is in repose, there’s an enormous amount going on.”Enormous was also the word used by Kerrigan to describe Greene’s range. “It would be a shame if he gets typecast,” he said. But the actor’s CV was conspicuously short on country vicars and good Samaritans.Greene played a gangster in Judgment Night (1993), a terrorist in Under Siege 2 (1995), a mercenary-turned-crimelord in Coyote Run, AKA Sworn Enemies, and a blackmailer who is terrorising Halle Berry and in cahoots with Clive Owen in The Rich Man’s Wife (both 1996), a dealer who introduces a screenwriter (Ben Stiller) to crack cocaine in Permanent Midnight (1998), and a diamond thief who betrays the rest of his crew in the Martin Lawrence action comedy Blue Streak (1999).He was born in New Jersey as Peter Green, and later added an extra “e” to his surname to distinguish himself from a namesake in the Screen Actors Guild. He was educated at Montclair high school but dropped out before graduating. After working briefly as a busboy, clearing restaurant tables, he began delivering marijuana around New York on behalf of a sex worker. So began a hazardous period of his life spent dealing drugs. At one point, his home was fire-bombed by fellow dealers to whom he owed money.During spells of homelessness, he had sometimes slept in theatres and had somehow fallen in with the makers of what he called “Off-Off-Off, way-Off-Broadway” productions. A chance meeting with the acting coach Penny Allen changed the direction of his life. Allen, who described him as “the kind of actor that will walk the edge”, encouraged him to try out for auditions for independent films.Success exacerbated his drug use. “Many times when he’s shown up on film sets, he’s been completely loaded on drugs and/or alcohol,” reported Mark Ebner, a journalist and Greene’s former personal assistant, in aninterview published in Premiere magazinein 1996 with the actor’s consent. (He hoped that “some sick junkie gets well because of this story”.)The article referred to Greene’s “track-marked twig of an arm”, detailed his attempts to score heroin in downtown Los Angeles, and noted that he was found with a crack pipe on the set of Judgment Night.He was never short of admirers. Nick Gomez, who directed Laws of Gravity, compared him to Robert De Niro in his “intuitive, instinctive” approach. “Peter’s emotional life is so resonant, and so close to the surface, that he doesn’t know how to work any other way. That’s his strength as an actor, which at the same time is his weakness as an individual.”Amy Holden Jones, who made The Rich Man’s Wife, called him “a mercurial presence. The camera loves him. He does unexpected and wonderful things. And he’s scary as hell.”He continued to act throughout his life, though the films became markedly less interesting. One exception wasTesla(2020), an unconventional biopic directed by the avant-gardist Michael Almereyda, starring Ethan Hawke as Nikola Tesla and Kyle MacLachlan as Thomas Edison, and featuring deliberate anachronisms (laptops, Google searches).Films in which Greene had cameos tended to be the only ones of his that he could bring himself to watch. “You see the mistakes,” he said. “I went to The Mask premiere but I was sitting in the lobby.”At 20, Greene marrieda friend who needed a green card. Though they were estranged soon after, the marriage was never dissolved.He is survived by a son, Ryder, as well as by a brother, John, and a sister, Mary-Anne.Peter Greene, actor, born 8 October 1965; died 12 December 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmPulp FictionobituariesShareReuse this content"

The film-maker moved to Israel in 2023 andcalled himselfa “proud Zionist” on Instagram at the time. He is known to be a close friend of Benjamin Netanyahu.The trailer featuresDonald Trumpas Melania assists him on camera. “My proudest legacy will be that of peacemaker,” he says before she adds “peacemaker and unifier”.“Everyone wants to know, so here it is,” says Melania later in the footage.“The 20 days of my life, preceding the US presidential inauguration, constitutes a rare and defining moment – one that warrants meticulous care, integrity, and uncompromising craftsmanship,” she said toFox News, where the trailer was first exclusively shared. “I am proud to share this very specific moment of my life – 20 days of intense transition and planning – with moviegoers and fans across the globe.”Amazon reportedly spent $40m for the rights to the documentary, which the first lady originally conceived of in November 2024, and will also release a three-part docuseries on showing her life travelling between New York, Washington DC and Palm Beach.Ratner is also set to bring back his Rush Hour franchise after Trumpreportedly intervenedin order to get the fourth film financed. The film will be distributed by Paramount, a company recently bought by Skydance and backed by Larry Ellison, a friend of the president.In a bombshell exposé in theLos Angeles Times, six women including actors Natasha Henstridge and Olivia Munn, accused Ratner of sexual misconduct. Henstridge claimed he forced her to perform oral sex on him while Munn alleged that he masturbated in front of her in his trailer on the set of After the Sunset. Ratner denied the allegations.Melania will be released in cinemas on 30 January.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMelania TrumpDonald TrumpAmazon Prime VideonewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNesrine MalikWed 17 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 08.04 ESTShareIdon’t want to sound dramatic but, a few weeks ago, something happened that has completely changed how I view online material. I fell for AI-generated content. For someone who is constantly squabbling with older relatives about how little they question what they see online, this was a profoundly unsettling and humbling experience. And it made me think about how, during this holiday period, we could all use this as an opportunity to approach those conversations with the “WhatsApp aunties” more sensitively.From ‘WhatsApp Aunties’ to ‘AI Aunties’I think I have the perfect sample of WhatsApp aunties. Sadly displaced from Sudan due to war, a permanently online group of women, some direct aunts, some not, but all aunties nonetheless, sit in a control room of sorts in their different cities and send out daily broadcasts that simulate as much as possible the interactions and updates they would have shared had they still been living in the same place. They even have office hours. One can divine the start of the day in their respective locations as they clock in and the forwards begin: First, it is morning greetings, maybe an embellished picture of Quranic verses or a graphic of flowers, wishing you a good day.Then, the hardcore stuff. Snippets of videos from war zones back home, clipped debates between political antagonists, and sometimes entire YouTube episodes of interviews. After this news shift comes the lighter one (secretly my favourite): TikTok and Instagram reels of Arab celebrities with too much plastic surgery accompanied by scream emojis, footage from family and friend weddings across the world, captioned with love heart eyes. The stream is interspersed with the longest voice memos you will ever receive, asking how you are and telling you how they are with an introductory and concluding prayer session. It is sweet and relentless.AI AuntiesAll of this is dumped with an abandon that suggests no understanding of or respect for phone memory limitations. Whenever my mother casually mentions that her phone is acting up and mutters something about no space, my heart sinks. I know that hours and hours of deletions of grainy videos are upon me. But most galling is how much fake content it includes. The WhatsApp aunties have become AI aunties. This was frankly a problem even before AI became so sophisticated, but it is now much, much worse. There is the harmless stuff; cats hugging babies or penguins feeding themselves with cutlery. I try not to get too agitated by this or point out that it’s fake. But when it’s videos of Taylor Swift endorsing the pro-Palestine movement, it’s impossible to let it slide.View image in fullscreenThe harmless stuff … AI baby penguin eating, Ai fashion model, and cat with baby.Illustration: Guardian Pictures/Getty ImagesThe result is a series of exchanges that are both saddening and enraging. Aunties will either take it personally, like I am disrespecting them by implying they can’t tell what’s real or not, and double down. Or they will express genuinely innocent beliefs in the veracity of online content, imbuing the internet with the same standards of TV or radio they grew up with.Telling the aunties that something is entirely fake is like asking them to imagine a TV news broadcast is not real. Also, they areactuallyreceiving news broadcast clips on their phones that are not real. You end up sounding like the crazy one, trying to explain that a living, breathing, walking, talking person is just pixels generated from prompts.To argue or not to argueIn a recent episode of Subway Takes,comedian Ola Labib saidwe shouldn’t try to convince elders that AI content isn’t real. Her argument: Let them have their little comforts. I kind of get that, what harm is it doing really? But there is an emotional element to it as well. Policing elders’ content feels to me like a manifestation of a deep-seated fear that they’re losing it, that their faculties are waning, as they succumb to old age and the bewildering assaults of new tech and device addiction. I think it is truly distressing for people to see parents and relatives increasingly become addicted to their phones and become slightly addled, a window into a sort of premature senility.But there are social and political reasons too, for pushing back. Aunties (and, to a lesser degree, uncles) have a huge amount of disseminative power and a lot of free time. They wield a formidable authority, particularly in diaspora communities, both as enforcers of values, as organisers and sponsors of social events, and generally as gatekeepers of community interactions and upholders of norms. Collectively and individually, they are forces to be reckoned with, which makes disagreements even more challenging and fraught with risks of falling foul of powerful elders. But they are force multipliers in terms of spreading fake content that is politically inflammatory or conspiratorial, and when unchallenged, they contribute to the general degradation of the information ecosystem and its associated political fallout.How to help themSo, I would say talk to them, keep talking to them, but do it kindly, with time and explanation, rather than frustration and bewilderment. Maybe just acknowledge the content first before pointing out its fakery – a “really cool!” followed a little while later with a “actually, do you think that’s real? I’m not sure”. Also, furnish them with the “tells”: video glitches, lack of shadows, weird blinking. Bear in mind what the world looks like to them. It is a place that is changing too rapidly to assimilate how it is happening. Our elders are also, simply, getting older. With that comes all sorts of uncertainties and unsettlement; loneliness, loss of identity as work is retired from, and children age out of parenting. Exacerbating that are the vast distances that now often separate elders from their kin and peers. Online content and its constant exchange are about so much more than sharing information; it is a new language, almost phatic, for trying to connect.Remember that the tech is evolving so quickly that even the most savvy have to be vigilant. I now have to be on alert after admiring a song with album cover art, a music video, a richly talented singer and fantastic accompanying chorus. After days of trying to hunt down the artist, I was thunderstruck to find out it was all AI. It will happen to all of us. Welcome me to the aunties brigade. Please be kind.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.LED face masks are booming in popularity – despite being one of the most expensive at-home beauty products ever to hit the market. Many masks are available, each claiming to either reduce the appearance of fine lines, stop spots or calm redness. Some even combine different types of light to enhance the benefits.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it’s wise to be sceptical about new treatments that are costly and non-invasive, and to do your research before you buy. With this in mind, I spoke with doctors and dermatologists to find out whether these light therapy devices actually work.They’re not a miracle cure for deep-set wrinkles, but experts say the best light therapy masks can promote collagen production, improve elasticity and help smooth skin with sustained use. And while it might seem like a new technology,research dating back to the 90sshows the efficacy of light therapy in wound healing, acne treatment and skin rejuvenation.Red and infrared light are safe to use on all skin types, but be warned that blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones.I’ve tested some of the most popular devices on the market – including infrared masks – to narrow down my favourite LED face masks for treating a range of skin concerns.At a glanceBestLED face maskoverall:CurrentBody Series 2£399.99 at CurrentBodyBest budgetLED face mask:Silk’n LED face mask 100£99.99 at LookfantasticBest for targeting multiple skinconcerns:Shark CryoGlow£299 at John LewisBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin Solo£50.40 at AmazonBest LED mask for treating multiple areas:StylPro Wavelength Pro 5-in-1£249 at LookfantasticWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing health and beauty tech for the past four years. During this time I’ve witnessed many beauty fads come and go. Naturally tight-fisted and a bit of a sceptic, I was initially struck by the cost of these masks. How on earth can an elaborate LED light strip set you back over £300?But after testing multiple light therapy masks, I’ve come to understand the technology behind them, and sadly you won’t be able to engineer your own light therapy system with a costume mask and a set of LED string lights.I don’t have many fine lines or wrinkles to test on, but I can comment on how blue light treatment affects acne because I’ve suffered from it since I was a teenager – despite my mum’s assurances that it would clear up after puberty. The experts I spoke to agreed on the efficacy of red and infrared light for anti-ageing.Are LED face masks actually worth it?Light therapy masks are fantastic additions to a skincare routine, helping to smooth, firm and reduce blemishes. Since I started using one almost a year ago, my skin is calmer, less prone to redness, and has a more even tone.However, LED masks can be expensive, and if you’re not disciplined enough to use one regularly, you won’t see results. Before you jump in and splash between £100 and £400, keep in mind that light therapy masks are most effective when paired with a good skincare routine. It’s crucial to make sure skin is properly cleansed before treatment and protected from sun damage afterwards.If you don’t already have askincareroutine nailed down, don’t buy a light therapy mask just yet. Consider starting out using a gentle cleanser and moisturiser, with anSPFfor daytime. You could also incorporate targeted skincare serums, such asretinolandvitamin C, to help firm and brighten the skin without the need for an expensive light therapy mask.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 13 of the most popular light therapy masks.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSince LED treatments take a while to show visible results, it’s difficult to test multiple light therapy masks at once (at least, without spending a few years testing them), so I enlisted the help of dermatologists who were familiar with light therapy treatments long before they were commercially available.I spoke with Dr Barbara Kubicka, an expert in aesthetic medicine; Dr Derrick Phillips, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation; and aesthetic doctor Dr Priya Verma, an authority on the science of skin ageing.I asked the experts to identify which features of a light therapy mask – such as bulb quality and quantity, light wavelength and treatment time – matter the most, to inform my choices. They also outlined the suitability of light therapy for different skin types and its associated risks.Armed with their advice, I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 13 of the most popular light therapy masks and other targeted LED devices. Getting hands on with the masks allowed me to pinpoint any of the key features the experts recommended, as well as useful features I found helpful as a consumer.I’ve been using a light therapy mask regularly for the past 12 months, so I can identify a good mask from a bad one. My tests also included monitoring how well the treatments worked after four nightly sessions, with the obvious caveat that only very minimal results could be observed after such a short-term treatment. I then tested my favourite masks over several months, too, helping me to verify any unique treatment claims – as well as giving me plenty of opportunities to scare my boyfriend by sneaking up on him wearing each one.Only masks that use the brightest, flicker-free bulbs, fit comfortably and are easy to use made the final cut. After testing, I returned the masks sourced for this article to the manufacturers. Where that wasn’t possible, I cleaned the masks and donated them to theRedbridge Reach Outservice, a charity that supports anyone experiencing domestic abuse.The bestLED face masks in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest LED face mask overall:CurrentBody Series 2CurrentBodySeries 2from£399.99£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent facial coverage, comfortable to wear with deep near-infrared lightsWhat we don’t loveOnly one treatment plan and no screen to display treatment timePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonThis is the second red light therapy mask from CurrentBody, and it’s easily the brightest and best-fitting mask I’ve tested. If you want the most powerful red light mask money can buy, I believe this is worth the cost.The mask has 236 LED bulbs that blend red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 2 mask. Theoriginal mask, which is £100 cheaper, has only the former two light frequencies.The deep near-infrared lights penetrate deeper than the other two types of light, CurrentBody claims. This leads to more effective treatment where it’s needed most – the deep near-infrared bulbs are positioned under the eyes and around the lips to better target areas where ageing is more pronounced. Add surface-level red light and near-infrared light, and you’ve got a face mask that works harder than most.Why we love itI loved how simple the mask was to use. After attaching it to my head using the adjustable straps, I turned on the mask to activate a 10-minute treatment. It offered brilliant facial coverage, wrapping all the way under my chin. And its eye guards were highly effective, blocking any glare from the bright lights and allowing me to continue doing my daily activities – or endlessly scrolling – while wearing the mask.I used this mask for three months, and was pleased to notice my skin tone looking calmer and more even than usual, with less undereye inflammation. As it’s a red light mask, it didn’t have much effect on my acne, but it did help to reduce redness.If you have blemish-prone skin, CurrentBody does sell ablue light maskfor the same price. It has the same comfortable, high-coverage fit and high-quality bulbs, but uses blue and red bulbs (slightly fewer: 220) to target acne-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation.It’s a shame that …the mask offers only one treatment setting and there isn’t a screen displaying the treatment time. Neither is a dealbreaker, but it’s nice to be able to choose different treatments, and almost every other mask includes a countdown timer.Number of LEDs:236Number of settings:oneTreatment time:10minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm)Timer countdown:noCurrentBodySeries 2from£399.99£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent facial coverage, comfortable to wear with deep near-infrared lightsWhat we don’t loveOnly one treatment plan and no screen to display treatment timeBest budget LED face mask:Silk’n LED face mask 100Silk’nLED face mask 100from£89.99£89.99 at Lookfantastic£160 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveComfortable to use, good colour choices, accessible priceWhat we don’t loveFewer bulbs than higher-end models and no near-infraredPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99.99 at Lookfantastic£160 at Cult BeautyIf you want to try light therapy without remortgaging the house, the Silk’n LED face mask 100 is a good choice. It has 100 LED bulbs with good facial coverage, is comfortable to wear and offers a good range of light colours. It doesn’t have near-infrared lights like the pricier options, but it covers the basics at a decent price.Why we love itThis mask offers four colour modes: red, blue, yellow and purple. Red light helps stimulate collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines, while blue light helps to soothe breakouts. The purple light comes from mixing the aforementioned blue and red lights, combining the effects of both to boost the skin’s overall evenness.Although less widely researched (and with limited clinical evidence to suggest efficacy), the experts I spoke to said the yellow light treatment could help improve hydration levels in the skin. I didn’t notice a huge hydration hit when testing this feature, so if your skin is crying out for hydration, I recommend using the other light settings alongside ahydrating serum.Each colour can be selected individually for a 10-minute targeted session, or you can select automatic mode, which cycles through the colours over 15 minutes to provide all the benefits at once.I found the Silk’n light therapy mask simple to use and comfortable to wear. Its flexible silicone build didn’t feel quite as sturdy as more expensive options, but I didn’t really notice this when using the mask. The built-in eye shields weren’t as bulky as others, but they still blocked out the light and protected my eyes well.The automatic mode left my skin feeling completely comfortable, with a slightly glowier finish than usual – just what I’d expect from an entry-level mask like this one.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer and it has fewer than half the bulbs of the CurrentBody, with no near-infrared light treatment for effective collagen stimulation deeper in the skin. This means it’s better for light-touch anti-ageing, and for soothing, acne-busting blue light treatments.Number of LEDs:100Number of settings:5Treatment time:10 or 15minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), purple (463-633nm), blue (463nm), yellow (592nm)Timer countdown:noSilk’nLED face mask 100from£89.99£89.99 at Lookfantastic£160 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveComfortable to use, good colour choices, accessible priceWhat we don’t loveFewer bulbs than higher-end models and no near-infraredBest for targeting multiple skin concerns:Shark CryoGlowSharkCryoGlowfrom£299£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkWhat we loveIntuitive to use, good targeted treatments and soothing undereye coolingWhat we don’t loveHeavy mask that presses into the under eyes when recliningPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkMany will be familiar with Shark’s vacuum cleaners and hair-styling gadgets, but the brand’s latest venture is in skincare. The Shark CryoGlow is the only LED face mask to offer built-in undereye cooling alongside targeted light therapy for anti-ageing and acne repair.Why we love itThe CryoGlow offers three different wavelengths of light: blue, red and deep-infrared. It has three presets for “better ageing”, “blemish repair” and “skin sustain”. If these aren’t clear enough, the control screen explains exactly what each mode is designed to do, making it really user-friendly.I found the lights incredibly bright during my tests – though for safety they automatically dim when you remove the mask from your face – but I was happy with how the mask shielded my eyes.During every treatment, you can choose to switch on the cooling undereye patches, which aim to de-puff and soothe your skin. The cooling can also be used on its own, without the LEDs. There are three levels, the coolest of which felt startlingly cold at first but did a great job of calming down my eyes on a particularly bad hay fever day. Likewise, the blemish mode did a brilliant job of calming spots and redness with sustained use. I also liked using the skin sustain mode for a quick pick-me-up to brighten my skin before a night out.As you might imagine, using the cooling feature on full blast drains the battery more quickly. I performed two battery-rundown tests on the CryoGlow without cooling, and it managed 17 treatments. With maximum cooling enabled, however, this dropped to just seven. That’s still a decent number of treatments in between charges, but it’s something to bear in mind.It’s a shame that …since it’s made of plastic, it’s noticeably heavier than its silicone competitors. Thankfully, Shark has made the mask fit comfortably by using cushioned inserts at the forehead, brow and nose area.That’s when you’re sitting up, at least; when lying down, the metal cooling patches pressed into the delicate area under my eyes. Another unfortunate side-effect of the cooling is the whirring noise it makes – inaudible from far away, but pretty noisy when pressed on to your face.Number of LEDs:160Number of settings:fourTreatment time:4-8mins light therapy; 5-15mins under-eye coolingLight frequencies:red (630nm), infrared light (830nm), blue light (415nm)Timer countdown:yesSharkCryoGlowfrom£299£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkWhat we loveIntuitive to use, good targeted treatments and soothing undereye coolingWhat we don’t loveHeavy mask that presses into the under eyes when recliningBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin SoloLustreClearSkin Solofrom£50.40£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonWhat we loveTargeted blemish treatments in a portable packageWhat we don’t loveLeech-like appearance and extra running costPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonAcne can be a real pain, and many cosmetic treatments that target it leave skin feeling irritated, dry and flaky. These nifty adhesive LED patches from Lustre use blue light, which the company claims reduces acne-causing bacteria.Why we love itEach Solo patch has 15 pure blue LEDs at theproven wavelength for treating acne, 415nm. The patches cover a targeted area of skin about 2.5 x 5cm, which is perfect for treating problem areas such as the chin, cheeks and forehead. Since they’re rechargeable and far smaller than a typical LED face mask, they’re highly portable, making it easy to stay consistent with treatments wherever you are.I found the targeted treatments very effective for minimising breakouts in my chin area – somewhere I often struggle with spots. My skin was also quicker to heal, with fewer breakouts, the longer I continued with treatments.The patches come with a supply of double-sided adhesive to fix each one to your skin, allowing you to move around freely during treatment. This also means, unlike typical light therapy masks, they can be safely fixed anywhere on the body.If you’re worried that the adhesive will feel uncomfortable or be tricky to remove from breakouts, don’t be. The patches are so lightweight that the adhesive doesn’t need to be very strong. I found it easy and comfortable to peel off the patches after the recommended 20-minute treatment time.It’s a shame that …you need to buy the sticky patches when they run out. These cost£18 for a pack of 60, or 30p each. They also look a bit like leeches – only you can decide if that’s more palatable than the Hannibal Lecter look of the full-face LED masks.Number of LEDs:15Number of settings:oneTreatment time:20minsLight frequencies:blue (415nm)Timer countdown:noLustreClearSkin Solofrom£50.40£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonWhat we loveTargeted blemish treatments in a portable packageWhat we don’t loveLeech-like appearance and extra running costBest LED mask for treating multiple areas:StylPro Wavelength Pro 5-in-1StylProWavelength Pro 5-in-1from£249£249 at Lookfantastic£249 at AmazonWhat we loveAdjustable design and versatile settingsWhat we don’t loveLess close contact with the chin areaPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£249 at Lookfantastic£249 at AmazonThe neck and decollete are often the first places to show signs of ageing, as the skin is thinner in those areas. Consequently, expensive neck light therapy masks have started to flood the market – but rather than requiring additional expensive kit, this StylPro option can be adjusted to treat multiple areas.Whether your main concern is ageing on your face and neck or treating blemishes on your upper back, the Wavelength Pro can be used to treat it. It can also treat the scalp using red light, which research suggests canstimulate hair growth.Why we love itThis mask is incredibly versatile. It has red, deep red, near-infrared and blue light, which all combine into 11 programs to target different areas of concern on your body. The remote control has a huge screen, making it easy to select the desired program and treatment zone. This also displays the mask’s battery life and treatment time.In my tests, the straps did a great job of keeping the flexible silicone mask in place. Its eye shields were also brilliant at blocking out light, and the snap fasteners made it easy to adjust the mask between different treatment areas. To treat the back and neck area, I found you needed to lie down or sit up very straight to prevent it from slipping, but it was great to have the versatility.This is also the only mask I’ve tested that has a silver reflective surface behind the LEDs, and a negative meniscus lens over each of the 137 bulbs. This crescent moon shaped lens has a sharper curve on its concave surface, which causes the light to spread out. StylPro claims this helps to enhance the light dispersion, to get more even coverage, unlike the focused treatment spots you find in other light therapy masks. I didn’t notice this making a huge difference to my results, but it didn’t hurt either.It’s a shame that …when used in face mode, the mask hangs a few inches away from the chin area, which means the light has less direct contact there. Its eye guards also tended to gently pinch the bridge of my nose when worn.Number of LEDs:137Number of settings:11Treatment time:12-15minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), deep red (655nm) near-infrared (830nm), blue (415nm)Timer countdown:yesStylProWavelength Pro 5-in-1from£249£249 at Lookfantastic£249 at AmazonWhat we loveAdjustable design and versatile settingsWhat we don’t loveLess close contact with the chin areaThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘You can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face’: the Lustre ClearSkin Renew Pro Facewear.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianZkin light therapy maskZkinLight therapy mask£499£499 at ZkinWhat we loveIntuitive controls with comfortable eye guardsWhat we don’t loveIts price tag and limited availabilityPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£499 at ZkinBest for:anti-blemish and anti-ageing in a flexible maskIf the Shark CryoGlow listed above tempts you but you don’t want to use the noisy cooling patches, this mask from Zkin is a brilliant alternative. You may not recognise the brand, but it’s the brainchild of medical consultant Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme.The mask comes with the most widely researched red, blue and near-infrared light, with three modes: red, blue and combination. Whichever you choose, the mask uses near-infrared light tostimulate repair below the skin’s surface and boost circulation. Since it’s made from flexible silicone with removable eye inserts, I found it very comfortable to wear during testing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pretty expensive. You’d be better off buying the CurrentBody mask if you’re after very powerful red light treatment and coverage.

Its settings include anti-ageing (red light), repair (yellow), brightening (green) and acne care (blue and red), and you can choose to do a 10- or 15-minute treatment. These all use near-infrared rather than deep infrared light.The best thing about this mask is how comfortable it is. It has two straps that wrap around the top and bottom of your head, holding it to your face without the mask ever feeling weighty or digging in. Its eye shades fit like diving goggles and kept my eyes completely shaded from light during treatment (you can see how little light leakage there is in the haunting photograph from testing).It didn’t make the final cut because …for the cost, it has fewer bulbs than average and the bulbs don’t cover the bridge of your nose – not a likely problem area for wrinkles, but spots can be a problem there.

That doesn’t mean you need to remain tethered to a single spot, but it does mean there’s a remote that you have to carry around with you. This mask from Lustre, on the other hand, is controlled via a mobile app.It has two programs, called Energise and Revitalise, and uses blue, red and near-infrared light. Unusually, you can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face: forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks and chin. In my tests, I liked being able to treat spots on my chin with blue light while using red light on the rest of my face.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not very comfortable. Since the battery is on the mask itself, it’s a little top heavy, and the eye protectors don’t do a great job of shielding your eyes.

The Silk’n LumiLips has 30 LEDsconcentrated in the lip area, covering smile lines and the chin. It has five light frequencies – amber, red, dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared. The only other mask on this roundup offering deep near-infrared light is the CurrentBody 2 mask, which gives you a good idea of how much value it offers.The mask has two modes, both of which use dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light. The red-light mode claims to promote lip volume and firmness,while the second mode adds in amber light to reduce pigmentation and redness. I love that the mask requires only a five-minute daily treatment, making its less-than-comfortable mouthpiece slightly more bearable.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s built like an adult pacifier and feels like one too. You have to bite down on the mouthpiece to keep it in place, which is far less comfortable than just wearing a mask with a strap around your head.Number of LEDs:30;number of settings:two;treatment time:5mins;light frequencies:amber (605nm), red (633nm), dark red (660nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm);timer countdown:noSilk’nLumiLips LED lip maskfrom£79£79 at Lookfantastic£80 at BootsWhat we loveDeep near-infrared light and concentrated treatmentWhat we don’t loveLess comfortable to wear than a maskPeep Club heated eye wand LED+Peep ClubHeated eye wand LED+from£85£85 at Peep Club£85 at Victoria HealthWhat we loveDedicated, soothing treatment for eye areaWhat we don’t loveSmall LED light coveragePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£85 at Peep Club£85 at Victoria HealthBest for:reviving and soothing the undereyesLED face masks need eye guards to protect your eyes from the light, which means they neglect to treat the delicate skin underneath – an area particularly prone to fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.The Peep Club heated eye wand is a nifty little gadget that was designed in collaboration with optometrists, primarily as a hot compress to help with dry, tired eyes. The LED+ model includes a small LED light, which glows red to reduce fine lines and amber to decrease the visible blood vessels that cause dark circles. There’s also green light for soothing inflammation, although the evidence around green light is shaky.During testing, I found it soothed my irritated eyes after long days staring at a screen. The amber light setting seemed to reduce my dark circles, too, after a few weeks of consistent use. As recommended, I used it with thePeep Club coconut eye balmto give the wand a bit of slip, which avoided irritating the delicate skin under my eyes.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not as convenient to use as a dedicated mask, since you have to glide it over the skin. Its LED light is small, so you need to dedicate a lot of time to treatment to get the best results. While I love using the coconut eye balm and a 40ml tub lasts a long time, it leaves an oily slip on the skin after treatment, and the need for this extra running cost may be off-putting.Number of LEDs:not listed;number of settings:five, three with LED;treatment time:5mins;light frequencies: amber (605nm), red (633nm), green (525nm);timer countdown:yesPeep ClubHeated eye wand LED+from£85£85 at Peep Club£85 at Victoria HealthWhat we loveDedicated, soothing treatment for eye areaWhat we don’t loveSmall LED light coverageWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenSeveral LED colours are available, with each wavelength claiming to target a different skin concern.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianWhat is LED therapy, and how does it work?“LED (light-emitting diode) therapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate various cellular processes in the skin,” says aesthetic medicine expert Kubicka. “Depending on the colour or wavelength, LED light can target inflammation, promote collagen production, accelerate healing and even kill bacteria.”Light therapy is a great addition to your skincare routine – for me, it’s helped reduce breakouts, improve healing and reduce the appearance of my acne scars. LED face masks are quick, gentle and non-invasive, and suitable for most skin types (although as mentioned above, blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones, according to the experts I spoke with). The masks are effective and foolproof to use, and the daily treatments also force you to take a little time for yourself – perfect for a morning pick-me-up or an evening wind-down.Does red light help with anti-ageing?“Red-light therapy can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles through a process called photobiomodulation,” says consultant dermatologist Phillips. “It energises mitochondria, which are the batteries of the cells, powering the production of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts, the factories of the skin.”Elastin and collagen are “the building blocks of firm, youthful skin”, says Kubicka. Stimulating the production of these molecules can “improve skin density, elasticity and overall smoothness” as long as you complete treatments regularly.I have yet to develop fine lines or wrinkles, but I’m keen to avoid them by using red-light therapy for “preventive ageing”. However, “most of the clinical evidencefocuses on treating visible signs of ageing or repairing damaged skin, rather than long-term prevention in younger skin,” as aesthetic doctor Verma explains.Still, Verma reassured me my efforts wouldn’t be in vain. “Using LED light consistently and appropriately may help support overall skin health […] especially when combined with sun protection and a good skincare routine.”What different colours of light therapy are available?Several colours are available, with each wavelength claiming to target a different skin concern. These colours correlate to the visible light spectrum, and each can have a different effect on the skin.Red light has a wavelength of between 630 and 700nm and is the most widely known form of light therapy, loved for its non-invasive potential anti-ageing benefits. Near-infrared light above 700nm “penetrates the skin more deeply to support tissue repair and reduce inflammation”, according to Kubicka. Blue light therapy (415nm), on the other hand, has been proven to target acne-causing bacteria, leading to a reduction in breakouts over time. Kubicka also says blue light can help regulate oil production – another common problem for those with acne.The effect of some types of light on the skin are better researched than others.Near-infrared,red lightandblue lightare backed by scientific studies that identify the biological processes that each type of light triggers in the body.Meanwhile, research into green and yellow light is more limited. One study questions theefficacy of yellow lighttherapy and claims that a previous study may have been influenced by the placebo effect. Similarly, a study ongreen light therapysuggests that more research is needed to provide a solid recommendation for use as an anti-ageing treatment.How and when would you recommend using light therapy?The “how” is simple: always use light therapy masks on freshly washed, dry skin, before applying serums and creams. This will give the light the most direct access to the skin.Despite what some instruction manuals advise, don’t jump into daily treatments straight away – you may end up with slightly irritated skin. Start by introducing treatments two to three times a week, and monitoring the impact on your skin. If you don’t notice any sensitivity, you can incorporate more treatments, if permitted by the manufacturer’s guidelines.Once your skin is used to the treatment, “home devices should be used three to five times a week, for 10-20 minutes a session,” says Phillips. Don’t expect instant results, though. If you’re hoping to treat breakouts, you should “see a reduction in redness and the frequency of acne breakouts within two to four weeks”. Those using red light for anti-ageing benefits will need to wait a little longer: “It typically takes six to eight weeks to see visible changes.”Is light therapy safe for all skin tones?“LED light therapy is generally very safe when used correctly,” says Verma. This is because, unlike laser hair removal, it only uses low-level, non-thermal light. “The most common side effects are mild and temporary, such as slight redness, dryness or irritation.”“People with known photosensitive disorders or taking medications that make them more sensitive to light (eg certain antibiotics) should consult their doctor,” says Phillips. He also warns that those with darker skin tones should exercise caution when using blue light, since “some blue wavelengths have been associated with hyperpigmentation”. The Lustre ClearSkin Solo patches recommended above offer exclusively blue light, but the other masks on this roundup have blue-light-free settings if you do find that it causes sensitivity.How much should I spend on an LED therapy mask?There are hundreds of light therapy masks available at different prices, but the quality varies wildly. You may see results from a budget-friendly mask, such as the£100 Silk’n mask, but spending more will generally get you a larger quantity of bulbs that offer a greater range of wavelengths. You’re also more likely to get a mask with a better fit and coverage.The best mask for you will depend on your skin concerns and budget. Those hoping to invest in a mask with anti-acne properties will be able to spend less, since blue light is more widely available, but if you’re looking for the best anti-ageing deep near-infrared light therapy, you will need to part with more cash.High-end red light therapy masks can cost up to £500; if you spend that much, just make sure you use it regularly, or you won’t see results.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

So much so, in fact, that amateur wrestlers from across the UK and Ireland are gearing up for the first everBritish Isles Sumo Championships, due to be held in six weeks.It comes after sumo’s elite professionals captured hearts in October when they visited from Japan fora grand tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London.They were pictured wholesomely visiting Horse Guards Parade, enjoying Platform 9 ¾ at King’s Cross station and riding Lime bikes around London.View image in fullscreenFans greet sumo star Takayasu Akira as he exits the Royal Albert Hall after the final day of Grand Sumo Tournament in October.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe competition, only the second time it has taken place outside Japan, sold out immediately and fans were treated to bouts from the most famous wrestlers in the sport. This included two grand champions – oryokozuna– Japan’s Ōnosato Daiki and his rival, the Mongolian Hōshōryū Tomokatsu.“The last time the Grand Sumo [was] in the UK was 30 years ago and the same thing happened, it caused a little bit of sumo mania,” said Jonathan Templeton, who runs Sumo na hÉireann in Belfast, the first Irish club.“I think social media probably is playing a part [too]. People who like, for example, boxing or UFC or something, their algorithm might start feeding in a little bit of sumo content and I think it’s maybe growing that way as well.”Templeton, who began watching sumo when it was shown on Channel 4 in the 1990s, said: “It’s amazing. I watch a lot of sport, I watch a lot of martial arts and combat sports as well. And for me sumo’s the most fun to watch.“It’s the most spectator friendly, because each match lasts roughly 10 seconds or less, so it’s very consumable. You don’t need to invest 90 minutes or 60 minutes, just 10 seconds. Maybe that’s something to do with the popularity, with the short form media generation, YouTube and TikTok. It’s very TikTok-able.”The core of the sport is, in essence, “pushing somebody out of a circle”, Templeton said, though the moves themselves are complex and there are many ways to win.View image in fullscreenSumo wrestlers thank the crowd at the closing ceremony of the Grand Sumo tournament in London.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe UK is beginning to produce some of its own talent –earlier this year 15-year-old Nicholas Tarasenko became only the second Britonto join the professional sport in Japan, after winning amateur tournaments and demonstrating a commitment to learning Japanese – and more amateurs than ever are getting in on the action too.There has been a “huge increase in interest” over the past three years and even more so since the grand tournament, said Richard Riggs, the northern vice-president of the British Sumo Federation.“In that time we’ve trained new coaches and opened new clubs across the country, with more planned for 2026 and beyond. People from all walks of life, shapes and sizes are wanting to give sumo a go because of its unique ethos, which is heavy in Japanese shinto tradition but also fast paced, technically intricate and a hard-hitting wrestling style.“Sumo is probably one of the most inclusive martial arts and is open to anyone regardless of size, gender, background or ability,” he said.View image in fullscreenGrand champion Hōshōryū Tomokatsu walks from his hotel to get on the bus during the Grand Sumo Tournament.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe amateur competition is different from what we see on our screens. Firstly, there are weight classes, so anyone can compete with a similar-sized opponent.Templeton said: “I would be 85kg, that’s lightweight, and it goes right up to anything over 115kg, which is heavyweight.”This contrasts with the professional sport, where bigger is often better, leading to the enormous wrestlers that have come to be synonymous with sumo.Also, unlike the professional league, where the only competitors are men, women are welcomed. “There’s no change in pace between the women’s matches and men’s matches. It’s just the exact same kind of pace, it’s fantastic,” Templeton said.“Absolutely anyone can compete, but it is a very rough sport,” he warned. “If you’re there for a laugh and someone’s training for the next competition, you could find yourself getting thrown around.”Templeton said work was under way to get sumo included in the Olympic programme, but he added: “Our overall goal is to change the perception of sumo from the fat guys and nappies kind of stereotype, to show people that it’s for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsSumo wrestlingTikTokIrelandSocial mediaNorthern IrelandEnglandWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But suddenly 3,000 Mancunians were happy to help, giving me a whole new appreciation of my home townJack ChadwickWed 17 Dec 2025 01.55 ESTShareThe plane pushed through wall after wall of sleet on its descent intoManchester. I’d had a sinking feeling during the flight that only deepened as I shuffled through the terminal. I resented having to be back in the city where I had grown up, after living on the other side of the world for what had felt like a lifetime.After a few days, I headed out to get a haircut. My mind was miles away, back across an ocean, when I heard something hit the pavement. I looked down to see a pigeon on its back, spatchcocked, and twitching.The crash happened just as kids were filing out of the local primary school and so within minutes a small chorus of little ones had formed, flanked by their mums and dads. This circle of bemused faces stared down at the bird, unsure what to say or do. The kids were more definitive: “Daddy, she needs hospital, can we call an ambulance?” I took off my anorak, bent down and scooped the pigeon up into it. “Don’t worry, sweet, the nice man will look after her!” said one mum with a sigh of relief. I had become the ambulance for this pigeon that had just landed abruptly, against its will, as I had a few days before.I trudged home, arms ramrod straight, with the bird nestled inside the coat. Little did I know that my impromptu decision to medivac Belinda (the name I gave my patient) would lead me to a network of Mancunians sacrificing significant amounts of time to provide not only ambulances for feral pigeons but X-rays, respite care, and even “pigeon physio”.I found a shoebox for Belinda, lined it with an old T-shirt, and put her inside with an old T-shirt lining the bottom. Every 20 minutes or so, I’d lift the lid just long enough for us to awkwardly lock eyes.Those moments of mutual bewilderment punctuated my frantic search for what to do next. I called friends for advice and one suggested trying Facebook, where, to my surprise, I discovered theManchester Pigeon Rehabgroup, and submitted a request to join.Rehabbers each have their own finely honed specialities, whether setting broken wings or dressing woundsOver 3,000-strong, the group has an anarchic model: someone in Manchester stumbles across an injured pigeon, a pleading post is made, then a comment section “triage” ensues. If the bird is deemed in need of an X-ray, someone with a vet link can get it one; if it needs physio, a “rehabber” will volunteer to foster the bird. Rehabbers each have their own finely honed specialities, whether it’s setting broken wings or dressing wounds. Their momentous, collective effort for the pigeons of the city runs entirely on goodwill.Belinda was quickly diagnosed with neurological problems, likely a head injury, and assigned to a rehabber who would administer pain relief and a course of gentle physio. We never found out exactly what caused her to fall from the sky. I took up the role of pigeon ambulance once more, taking the tram across the city with Belinda in a shoebox on my lap so she could get the care she needed.After stumbling across this underground pigeon “NHS”, I began to feel much better about being back in my home town. I doubt any of the places I had lived in while away could boast anything remotely similar. It also dawned on me that this was not the first time I’d been involved in a pigeon rescue: almost 20 years earlier I’d seen one fall from the sky into the playground of my high school. Again, children circled the bird, but only one – my best friend at the time – had the gall to scoop it up and take it to safety.The friend in question has since died – one of four friends to lose their lives in the years before my departure from Manchester. I realised that this had been a big part of what had made returning home so hard.Pigeons have a history as “emotional support” animals, especially in the north of England.Miners started to keep the birdsbecause they gave them comfort and an excuse to gaze up at the heavens between long shifts of subterranean gloom. During the Depression, workers on the dole also found comfort in pigeons, but keeping them was considered a sign of “social malaise”.Nowadays, pigeons are often written off as stupid, diseased or a general nuisance. Before finding the rehab group, I had called a vet, who told me: “if you bring ithere, leave itin the car park and we’ll euthanise it.”It? Not our Belinda. Although unlikely to ever fly again, she has taken to her newly grounded life with aplomb in a volunteer’s spare bedroom. Each contented coo, often elicited by her favourite treat, frozen peas, feels like a lesson in adaptability and resilience – and I am forever grateful to her for showing me another side to the city I thought I knew.Caliban Shrieks by Jack Hilton, with an introduction byJack Chadwick, is available now (Vintage Publishing, £16.99).

And not just any baking, but baking for a crowd. So, with this in mind, here are two crowdpleasing recipes – a rich hazelnut “Nutcracker” creme brulee and a resplendent chocolate fondant bundt cake – with a few make-ahead and shortcut secrets to give you a head start.Chocolate fondant bundt cake (pictured top)Serve this rich, decadent dessert warm from the oven in the centre of the table, piled with ice-cream (and perhaps pouring cream, too – why not? It’sChristmas!). The batter can be made and kept in the fridge for up to 24 hours, then baked from chilled; add an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time if you do so, though.Prep5 minCook45 minServes8-10250g butter,plus extra for greasing6 large eggs150g caster sugar250g dark chocolate50g milk chocolate50g malt syrup100ml whole milk120g plain flour20g cocoa powder½ tsp fine sea saltIce-cream and/or pouring cream, to serveHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and generously butter a large bundt tin (or spray it with cooking spray). In a stand mixer (or with an electric whisk), beat the eggs and caster sugar on medium-high for five to seven minutes, until very pale, thick and tripled in volume.Meanwhile, melt the butter, both chocolates, malt syrup and milk in a heatproof bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of gently simmering water (or in short bursts in the microwave), then stir until smooth.With the mixer running on low, slowly pour the warm chocolate mixture into the whipped eggs, mixing it in until just combined.Sift the flour, cocoa powder and salt into a bowl, then gently fold into the batter until no streaks remain. Pour into the greased bundt tin and smooth out the top. Chill this until ready to bake, or bake immediately for 20 minutes, until the edges are just set and the centre still has a gentle wobble.Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then carefully turn out on to a platter and take to the table. Slice and serve warm with scoops of ice-cream and plenty of cream.Nutcracker hazelnut creme bruleeView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s hazelnut nutcracker creme brulee.Photograph: Rita Platts/The Guardian.

If you have a blowtorch, by all means, finish it off like a regular creme brulee, but I’ve devised a crunchy, nutty and sugary topping that can be made in advance and sprinkled on top of the set custards.Prep5 minCook1 hr, plus coolingChill3 hr+Makes690g whole roasthazelnuts, or hazelnut butter120ml whole milk360ml double cream90g light brown sugar3 large eggsA big pinch of saltFor the topping120gcaster sugar60groasthazelnutsHeat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1 and put six ramekins in a deep baking dish. If using whole hazelnuts, blend them with the milk (and a splash of the cream, if needed) until you have a smooth paste; if using hazelnut butter, simply whisk it into the milk.In a saucepan, combine the cream, milky hazelnut mixture and brown sugar and heat gently until steaming and the sugar has dissolved.Lightly whisk the eggs in a bowl, then slowly pour in the hot cream mixture, whisking continuously but gently (you don’t want to incorporate any air). Stir in the salt.Strain the custard into a jug, then divide it between the six ramekins. Fill the baking dish with hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, then bake for 30-40 minutes, until the custards are just set with a slight wobble in the centre. Remove, leave to cool to room temperature, then chill for at least three hours (or overnight).For the hazelnut caramel topping, line an oven tray with baking paper. Heat the caster sugar in a small pan until it melts and turns into a golden caramel, stir in the hazelnuts, then pour on to the tray and leave to cool completely. Once set and hardened, blitz into a fine crumb. Just before serving, sprinkle this generously over the chilled custards. Alternatively, for a classic brulee topping, sprinkle a thin, even layer of caster sugar over each custard and torch or grill until melted and caramelised. Leave for a minute or two to harden into a glassy crust, then serve.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.

The reason is our old arch enemy, date labels, which can cause confusion and trick us into thinking that perfectly safe yoghurt is not OK to eat. That’s one reason many supermarkets have scrapped use-by dates on the likes of yoghurt, but they still use best-before dates. Remember, if a product doesn’t have a use-by date, always dothe sniff testbefore throwing it away.Today’s recipe is a light, gelatine-free version of panna cotta that’s instead set with agar agar (a type of seaweed), which gives it a soft-set texture. It’s refreshing, deliciously sour and simple to make. I use brown sugar for flavour and micronutrients, but regular sugar, honey and other sweeteners will all also work well.Waste not ‘panna cotta’This vegetarian pannacotta is made with yoghurt instead of cream for a lighter, less rich and more refreshing take on the traditional Italian pudding; it’s also a delectable way to use up excess yoghurt or its non-dairy equivalents. It goes beautifully with mytea-soaked prunes from last week, especially with a little of their syrup drizzled over the top; it also goes well with jam, and with any poached seasonal fruit or compote. I like the soft texture of the set yoghurt just as it is, but if you want to add some crunch, scatter a few toasted nuts on top; pine nuts, for instance, have a delicious, sophisticated flavour that goes very well with the prunes.Serves42½ tbsp agar agar flakes– I usedClearspring, but if you have a different brand, you may need to alter the amount according to the manufacturer’s instructions50g brown sugar, or honey or maple syrup1 tsp vanilla extract300g live yoghurt, or a non-dairy alternativeTo serveTea-soaked prunes, jam, shortbreadPour 200ml water into a small saucepan and sprinkle the agar agar flakes on top, so they float. Turn on the heat, bring to a boil without stirring, then turn down to a simmer and stir for five minutes, until the agar agar dissolves completely. Take off the heat, add the sugar and vanilla extract, and stir again until that, too, has dissolved. Stir in the yoghurt until well combined. The agar agar will begin setting almost immediately, so quickly divide the mix between four tumblers, bowls or ramekins, then put in the fridge to set for at least four hours.Serve straight from the containers, or loosen the sides by giving the tumblers a gentle shake, then turn out on to plates and enjoy plain or with tea-soaked prunes or jam and shortbread.Explore more on these topicsDessertWaste notFoodFood wasteItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Discs of pistachio meringue are baked until crisp, then layered with pistachio cream and cherry compote. The meringue softens a little under the cream as it sits, giving it a pleasingly chewy, cake-like texture. A very good option if you’re after a Christmas dessert without chocolate, alcohol or dried fruit.Pistachio and cherry meringue cakeThanks to the viralDubai chocolate bar, pistachio creme is quite easy to come by in most supermarkets these days; it’s already sweetened and brings a lovely, soft green colour. You could use pistachio butter if you prefer, though the colour will be a bit more muddied and you’ll need to sweeten it a little to taste.Prep5 minCook2 hr 20 minServes12-16150g pistachiokernels, plus 50g extra, chopped, to finish50g icing sugar1 tsp cornflourA pinch of salt165g egg whites155g caster sugarFor the cherry compote350g frozen cherriesJuice of ½lemon60g caster sugarFor the pistachio cream600ml whipping cream60g pistachio cremeHeat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½. Line three baking trays with greaseproof paper, then use a 18cm plate or cake tin to draw a circle outline on each. Turn the paper upside down, so the pen marks don’t touch the meringue.Pulse the pistachios, icing sugar, cornflour and salt in a food processor until mostly fine – some chunkier pieces of pistachio are fine.Whisk the egg whites on medium in a large bowl until foamy, then turn up the speed to medium-high and whisk to soft peaks. With the mixer still running, add the caster sugar a little at a time until the meringue is thick, stiff and glossy.Fold in the pistachio mix, being careful not to knock out too much air, then spoon into a large piping bag. Snip off about an inch from the tip.Starting from the outside of each pencil template, pipe a meringue disc on to each tray and carefully smooth the surface with a palette knife. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the meringues are lightly browned and feel firm to the touch; they should peel away from the paper fairly easily. Remove and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, put all the compote ingredients in a saucepan and heat gently until the cherries release some liquid. Bring to a boil and cook for five or six minutes, until the cherries soften . Spoon the cherries into a bowl, leaving the juices in the pan. Bring the juices to a boil, reduce by just over half, then pour over the cherries and leave to cool.Make the pistachio cream bywhipping the cream and pistachio creme in a bowl until just thickened and smooth.To assemble, trim the edges of each meringue disc with a small serrated knife, using the 18cm plate or cake tin as a guide. Place one disc on a serving plate and top with some whipped cream. Make a slight 10cm-12cm-wide dip in the middle and spoon in some of the cherries (this will stop the juices spilling out). Top with another meringue disc and repeat with more cream and cherries, reserving a few for the top.Place the final meringue disc on top and cover the top and sides with more cream, using a palette knife or bench scraper to smooth. Pat the chopped pistachios on to the sides.Put any remaining cream into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe on top, add the reserved cherries and chill until ready to serve.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe sweet spotCakeFoodFruitNuts and seedsChristmasBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

Here his daughter, the Guardian journalist Amelia Gentleman, dispenses his invaluable adviceAmelia GentlemanWed 17 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 07.02 ESTShareWhen we were children, my father, the painter David Gentleman, never offered much advice to me or my siblings. If we wanted to draw, he would hand out pencils and let us get on with it. He was encouraging, but never gave us instructions. If we were enjoying ourselves, more paper was available; but if we wanted to go and do something else, that was fine too. The idea of teaching people how to do things still makes him uncomfortable, so his latest book, Lessons for Young Artists, has come as a surprise to us all. At 95, he has attempted to distil everything he has learned about working as a painter since the late 1940s into clear advice. These lessons are not aimed exclusively at art students, or even at older people who want to paint, but are for anyone wondering how to build a life and career as a creative person.I haven’t inherited his artistic talents, but I have picked up other important things from growing up with someone who has managed to spend the past eight decades earning a living from what he enjoys doing most. Over the past two years, as he wrote this book, I’ve spent hours in his Camden studio, talking about painting and drawing and helping him search for pictures to illustrate his ideas. Here are 10 things I’ve learned from a lifetime watching him work.Try to build a life doing what you wantView image in fullscreenDavid Gentleman with his wife, Sue, in their garden.Photograph: Andreas von Einsiedel/AlamyMy father’s parents were both painters who met at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1920s, so the idea of trying to make a living as an artist was not an alarming prospect. He has always managed to pay the bills by painting, drawing, designing book covers, murals, stamps and logos. He has developed a phenomenal work ethic, but this has come fairly easily because painting and drawing is all he really wants to do. As a child I would go to sleep listening to the creaking of the floorboards above my room, as he worked late into the night. I’ve taken a different path, but I always wanted to work as a journalist. I think I learned from him the importance of trying to find an occupation you feel enthusiastic about, so that work doesn’t feel like work.Don’t procrastinate or wait around for inspiration to strikeView image in fullscreen‘Starting can feel hard, but you have to get on with it’ … David Gentleman at his home studio in Camden, London.Photograph: Andreas von Einsiedel/AlamyThere has never been any discussion at home of muses, and no leisurely periods spent lounging around waiting for beautiful ideas to appear. Ideas come when you’re at a desk with a pencil in your hand. This is true for most work – starting can feel hard, but you have to get on with it. Pretty much every day of his adult life, my father has got up early, made himself a cup of tea, and got straight to work. Recently, the five flights of stairs up to his top-floor studio have become more challenging; occasionally two hands are required on the bannisters to pull himself up, but there has been no faltering in his commitment to continue working.But do seek out inspiration by getting out of the houseView image in fullscreen‘Time away from work is important’ … a watercolour of Liverpool Street station.Photograph: Courtesy of David GentlemanTime away from work is important. Most days my parents walk through Regent’s Park or Primrose Hill. These excursions are slightly less brisk than they were a few years ago, but going more slowly allows time to take photographs ofbrutally pollarded planetrees, oak leaves unfurling or interesting patterns in the bark.Appreciate the skyView image in fullscreenSteely grey tones … Suffolk fields, 2015.Illustration: Courtesy of David GentlemanA large proportion of the conversations I’ve had with my father over the years have involved standing outside, looking up at the sky, admiring the cloud formations, discussing the steely grey tones of advancing rain, staring at the shapes made by horse chestnut trees in the summer or the silhouettes of skeletal trees against a sharp blue winter sky. I’ve learned to share his annoyance at tall buildings eating up chunks of sky but also his love of the spindly cranes on the horizon, as the construction work progresses.Be organisedView image in fullscreenA book cover designed by Gentleman.Photograph: Courtesy of David GentlemanI’m always struck by the absence of artistic disarray in his studio. One drawer is full of sharpened pencils, meticulously organised. Spare tubes of watercolour paints are lined up in the next drawer down, sorted by colour shades (raw umber, burnt umber, yellow ochre, citrus yellow). Paintbrushes are arranged in teacups according to their sizes, rulers of different lengths hang from a huge pinboard, jars of Indian ink are lined up next to spare nibs in labelled boxes. Everything is instantly accessible; the surfaces are clear and ready for work to begin. Chaos is impractical. My room is a heap of books and papers; I’m still learning. Tidying it makes me feel instantly better.Painting is about more than creating beautiful imagesView image in fullscreenFinding inspiration in things that aren’t conventionally beautiful … a watercolour of gasometers seen from Regent’s Canal, 2018.Photograph: Courtesy of David GentlemanWhen I go upstairs to say hello, I never quite know if I will find him drawing calm, rural English landscapes or splattering sheets of paper with red paint, to conjure up bloodstains for anti-war protest banners. I’m impressed at his ability to find inspiration in things that aren’t conventionally beautiful, such as disused industrial gasometers or abandoned second world war military defence structures on the beach at Orford Ness in Suffolk.Stay curiousView image in fullscreenA set of postage stamps by Gentleman on ecology 1986, blocked by Margaret Thatcher.Photograph: Courtesy of David GentlemanYou can’t become world weary.Paintingrequires close observation and a capacity to remain excited by things and keep noticing them. I was surprised to meet my father, then in his 80s, out on the streets of Tottenham in 2011, in the aftermath of the August riots. I was there with a notepad reporting for the Guardian; he was there with his sketchbook, drawing burned-out cars and buildings along the High Road, unbothered by the crowds of police and protesters around him. Quick drawings made on the spot can be much more powerful than pictures laboured over in a studio.Don’t shy away from difficult projectsView image in fullscreenA massive undertaking … Gentleman’s murals at Charing Cross tube station.Photograph: Courtesy of David GentlemanI feel happy every time I go through Charing Cross tube station and see his murals of medieval workers building the Eleanor Cross along the platform; I recognise my mother’s face in some of the figures. This was a massive undertaking, turning tiny wood engravings into huge artworks for a public space. Challenging new commissions stretch your abilities even if they feel overwhelming to begin with.Lessons for Young Artists by David Gentleman review – secrets from the studioRead moreAppreciate blossomView image in fullscreenJoyful appreciation of the natural world … a foliage watercolour, 2010.Illustration: Courtesy of David GentlemanAs children, we were occasionally impatient at his daily attempts to make us share his joyful appreciation of the natural world. Yes, yes, a beautiful leaf. Yes, another bird. More fool me; I’m still hazy about the difference between starlings, swifts, swallows and house martins. For reasons I can no longer remember, his extreme love of blossom used to seem particularly hilarious. But with time, I’ve been infected with his excitement about spring, and have developed my own fascination with hawthorn and apple blossom. The start of the cow parsley season is particularly good for painters, transforming the muddy banks of London’s canals into a beautiful wilderness, which he draws every year.Keep experimenting and don’t be disheartened by mistakesView image in fullscreenA blood splat for an anti-war poster, 2002.Illustration: Courtesy of David GentlemanDon’t expect to be a genius; you get better by working hard.

Communication is keyView image in fullscreen‘It is important to set expectations around time, gifts and extended family early.’Photograph: urbazon/Getty ImagesIt is important to set expectations around time, gifts and extended family early. Depending on your circumstances, there are different approaches to take. Parent of two Lenine Bourke hasa “set and forget” arrangement. “I share my eldest onChristmasDay and we do the same thing every year, meaning that it isn’t a point of contention or something we need to constantly negotiate.”My co-parent is a chef and his busy schedule means that a fixed agreement wouldn’t work for us. We try to communicate openly and often on everything from who our son will spend time with to joint presents.A spokesperson from the Council of Single Mothers and their Children (CSMC) suggests asking children for their input on what they’d like to do during the festive season too.2. Centre the needs of childrenView image in fullscreen‘It’s more important for a child to have a low-stress, enjoyable time than for things to be rigidly adhered to,’ says Dr Ahona Guha.Photograph: Louise Beaumont/Getty ImagesPsychologist Dr Ahona Guha acknowledges the complexities of co-parenting while recommending focusing on children’s needs first. “Christmas can be a time of pressure. It can become a very stressful, very difficult time quite easily. But it’s more important for a child to have a low-stress, enjoyable time than for things to be rigidly adhered to.”This will, of course, depend on any court orders and the type of relationship you have with your co-parent, but putting children first might mean that a parent misses out on seeing their children on Christmas Day, or it might prevent travelling to see extended family. Whatever the decision, try to keep things in perspective and remember that it won’t be this way forever – children grow up quickly.3. Seek out low-stress opportunities for connectionIf you are on good terms with your co-parent, schedule in some shared, casual activities. Bourke recommends anything “fun and neutral”. What you’re aiming for are “low-stress ways to make memories together”.In the past I’ve celebrated the end of the school year with my co-parent and other families at parks and beer gardens. Group environments ensure that the focus isn’t on you and your co-parent getting along and these locations allow for movement and connection.Bourke suggests taking a walk together to look at Christmas lights (neutral and festive), going to the cinema (you won’t have to communicate too much), or meeting for something fun like dessert, rather than a whole meal.Doing something together, no matter how small, is an opportunity to celebrate wins. A spokesperson from the CSMC says: “If you have a functional co-parenting relationship, there’s been work put into creating that. It’s a nice time of year to celebrate that progress.”4. Create new ritualsRecognising that Christmas isn’t just a singular day, and not wanting to disrupt this festive flow for his children, Tim created “FunXmas” (pronounced Funks-mas). Tim, his two children and his partner celebrate FunXmas the week after Christmas, every second year when he doesn’t have the kids over the festive period. This new ritual has evolved into a week of alternative Christmas cheer, complete with a Father FunXmas who delivers gifts. On FunXmas Eve each member of the family opens one gift, and on the day itself they celebrate with a special breakfast and a Christmas-style lunch with extended family. There’s even a replica Boxing Day, treated like a public holiday and a day of relaxation.For Tim, this is about “creating our own rituals that aren’t secondary to Christmas”, which provide his children stability and a sense of belonging.My stepmother developed her own Christmas ritual when she was a single parent by placing a wrapped bottle of Cointreau, “from a secret admirer”, under the tree for herself each year, much to the delight of her two young girls. This “enduring strategy” continues to this day, with someone always making sure she has her special gift from a secret admirer.5. Prioritise balanceView image in fullscreenFactoring in frequent rest time is one way to keep large family gatherings manageable.Photograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesWhen my son was younger, he sometimes found large family gatherings difficult. He may have been overstimulated or just plain over it, but I also suspect that he found it challenging to spend time with nuclear families. We both benefited from factoring in frequent rest time.Tim has had similar experiences, saying “the philosophy between two homes can be quite different, so there needs to be a period of adjustment for everyone, almost like for shift workers”. Creating balance might mean saying no to some things and learning to recognise triggers around times of transition.For adults dealing with difficult family dynamics, try to prioritise balance and relaxation for yourself. Guha recommends naming difficult feelings and “making some emotional space” as well as scheduling in some self-care and fun activities for yourself.6. Embrace ‘flexibility and fluidity’No matter what you do, plans will be disrupted and conflict may arise. When things go wrong, Tim uses the mantra “be the river”.“Our natural instinct may be to feel frustrated when plans are changed. But it’s important to be able to move on. Don’t let the historical affect the current moment,” he says.Guha seconds this approach, reminding us that the holiday season, and life in general, is for living and pleasure. “Allow for a bit of flexibility and fluidity so people can actually enjoy themselves.”7. Look outwardsBourke recommends looking outwards as a means of alleviating some of the festive season pressure: “Even if you are struggling, you can reach out and help someone else.”Organising a secret Santa or meal drop-off with other single parents are ways of solidifying networks of support.Bourke also suggests making a joint donation from both households and involving older children where possible. “It’s a way of doing something meaningful and it helps build community and connection.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleChristmasFamilyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are sustainable, plentiful, nutritious and a fraction of the cost of meats such as steak and chicken.Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall are two of the faces of a drive to double the number of black, borlotti, butter, cannellini, fava, haricot and kidney beans eaten in the UK by 2028. The Bang in Some Beans campaign is also backed by many of the UK’s main supermarkets, which have committed to increasing the sale of legumes over the next three years.Ali Honour, a chef and the author of a new recipe book, Beans, says they are flexible enough to be used as a main course or in desserts, and offer significant savings over buying meat.“While meat prices float into the stratosphere, humble beans remain the quiet overachievers of the food world: cheap, filling, nutritious, and ready to save your dinner and your bank account,” she says.View image in fullscreenJamie Oliver (left) and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall are among the well-known faces promoting beans.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA“If steak is the loud showoff at the dinner table, beans are the kid in the corner doing everyone’s homework – quietly brilliant, wildly underrated, and ultimately the one you want on your side.”With planning, Honour says that swapping one or two meals a week will cut your food bill, as well as reduce your carbon footprint and improve your cooking. “Beans prove that great food doesn’t need to be expensive; it just needs to be thoughtful,” she says.Rebecca Tobi, the head of food business transformation at theFoodFoundation, says the rising price of meat means many households are looking at how to stretch their budget while also providing balanced meals.“We’ve got baked beans on toast, which is a British classic. Beyond that, people often aren’t that familiar with using beans. But when you look to other cultures and countries, beans are in a huge array of really tasty dishes. From Mexico you’ve got enchiladas, ranging right through to Asian cuisine where you have dals,” she says.“Beans are absolute powerhouses of nutrition. They contain no cholesterol. They’re naturally low in fat and they are absolutely packed full of fibre, which we don’t talk about enough in this country.”Expert tips on saving money on meat, from alternative cuts to the best butchersRead moreGo half and halfThe campaign encourages people to add beans to their existing recipes, so that they can reduce the amount of meat they use, and stretch their budget.In some cases, beans can offer a similar texture to meat, Tobi says, and they can be added easily into dishes that are family favourites.“For example, spaghetti bolognese, shepherd’s pie, chilli con carne,” she says.Prices continue to rise for a lot of meat, so for families looking to stretch their budget, an easy way to do that but keep the familiarity and taste they like is just to swap out a proportion of the meat they would ordinarily use in a recipe, she says.View image in fullscreenHomemade soup that includes beans.Photograph: Sergii Koval/AlamyA simple chilli con carne for a family of four could include a 400g can of kidney or black beans alongside 400g of beef, pork or chicken.For cautious children, the not-for-profit group Veg Power suggests you add small amounts of beans to dishes that they like and then build up the quantity over time. Soft beans such as butter, cannellini and haricot are best in creamy dishes such as mac ‘n’ cheese. Firm ones such as kidney beans, chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and black beans absorb flavour and are good for chilli, curry and rice dishes and stews.Save through switchingFigures from the Food Foundation show that a 400g can of red kidney beans (priced at 49p in Tesco) can give 36% of the recommended daily intake of protein for a woman and a quarter of the fibre. The cheapest chicken breast weighing 100g (costing 72p) gives 48% of the recommended protein intake but no fibre.Honour says that a 150g sirloin steak (priced between £6 and £8) would provide 25g of protein, while 200g of butter beans will give 14g of protein, at a cost of about 50p.“A pot of home-cooked beans averages 8p to 12p for each high-protein serving, cheaper than a single chicken nugget,” she says.View image in fullscreenRed kidney beans are an ingredient that can provide a cheap alternative to meat.Photograph: GordonBellPhotography/Getty Images/iStockphotoBulk buyHow you buy your beans will dictate how much you spend on them. Tinned and jarred beans are pre-cooked and can be used straight away, so they are good for convenience. Dried can be very low cost as they are available in large packages, but take more preparation when you want to use them.Jarred beans tend to be the most expensive of the three, says Tobi, and are typically more tender because of the processing that they go through.Honour says precooked beans, in jars or cans, are convenient and consistent. Home cooks using tinned ones should go for brands without salt added when possible. Tinned is best when it comes to butter beans, chickpeas, black beans, cannellinis and red kidney beans, she says.Dried beans, which need to be cooked, give better flavour and texture, she says, and are much better value. They multiply in weight once cooked with a rule of thumb that about 100g to 125g of them are equal to the contents of a 400g tin of beans.To illustrate the savings of dried over tinned, she says a tin of beans will work out at about £1.50 a kilogram, while dried beans will be between 70p and 90p after cooking.She recommends cooking one large pot every week and then freezing cooked beans in 250g portions. Freezing them in their cooking liquid will keep them plump, she says.Tobi says they can also be frozen when part of a dish involving a sauce: “If you’ve made a stew or a dal or soup and they contain beans, they can very easily be frozen and then defrosted.”View image in fullscreenButter Beans are a good source of protein.Photograph: Andy StJohn/AlamyDried beans should be stored in airtight jars and have long shelf lives.“Bulk-buying beans isn’t just budget-friendly, it’s inflation-proof,” Honour says, referring to the fact beans last so long.Find recipesMeals can work out at less than £1 a portion, Honour says. For example, “butter bean smash”, where two tins of butter beans are cooked with garlic, rosemary and thyme, is good served with crusty bread, she says. And bean burgers made with carlin peas (which are grown in the UK) are a good way to introduce people to meat alternatives.Veg Power suggests Prue Leith’s alternative to beans on toast, which involved mixing cannellini beans with chorizo. The chef Tom Aikens has abeans with a parsley crumb recipeusing flageolet beans, while the fitness trainer Joe Wicks has acurried cottage pie recipethat uses green lentils. The recipes are available on Veg Power’s website.Honour says desserts can also use beans – for example, with black beans in brownies or chickpeas in blondies. A chocolate bean spread she created uses creamy beans such as cannellini or butter beans and does not use any of the refined sugars or palm oil that feature in some shop-bought spreads.Explore more on these topicsBeans, pulses and legumesMoney hacksSaving moneyConsumer affairsFoodFood & drink industryMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to embrace the coldest and arguably most beautiful seasonRachel DixonWed 17 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 12.59 ESTShareStephanie Fitzgerald, a chartered clinical psychologist, used to dread winter. Like many, she coped by keeping busy at work and hibernating at home, waiting for the cold, dark days to be over. But this approach wasn’t making her happy. So she sought out the science that would help her embrace the winter months, rather than try to escape them. In her resulting book,The Gifts of Winter, she writes: “I fell deeply in love with winter … It is a captivating and truly gorgeous season.”How did she change her mindset – and can the 42% of us who say summer is our favourite season learn to love winter too?1. Treat seasonal affective disorder“I know what it’s like to not enjoy this time of year and feel out of control,” says Fitzgerald. It’s normal to have a mild case of the winter blues, but seasonal affective disorder is “so much more than that – it’s all-pervasive”. And it can develop at any age. “As a neuropsychologist, it’s a really embarrassing thing to admit, but I didn’t realise I had Sad,” she says. “I’d never really had any issue with winter until my mid-20s, but year on year, it was getting harder. Eventually, as soon as the summer solstice was over, I was starting to panic, thinking: the darkness is coming, my mood is going to change.”Warmers and Shelley to get through winterRead moreView image in fullscreenSad lamps can simulate sunlight during the cold months.Photograph: Posed by model; Daniel Wischenbarth/Getty ImagesShe thinks the name minimises the condition and makes people less inclined to seek help: “I didn’t feel ‘sad’, I felt really horrific.” After researching the subject, Fitzgerald now manages her symptoms from October to April by sitting in front of a Sad lamp for at least 60 minutes every morning, using a sunrise/sunset alarm clock, taking vitamin D, eating well, exercising and getting plenty of sleep. In her book, she writes: “I feel more balanced, stronger, better able to cope, less emotional and overall lighter.” She advises seeing a healthcare professional if you too are struggling with winter depression.2. Adjust your daily routineView image in fullscreenSleep hygiene is more important than ever.Photograph: Posed by model; Luis Alvarez/Getty Images“Even once I got my Sad under control, I realised I was doing winter really badly,” says Fitzgerald. “I rushed into it with my summer diet and exercise regime; I wasn’t making space for it. So I started thinking about living a bit more seasonally.” One of the main changes she has made was going to bed an hour earlier, in 15-minute increments. “As our lives get busier, the temptation is to stay up later and later – it’s known as ‘revenge bedtime procrastination’. Then I’d wonder why I always felt so exhausted. Now I pay attention to what I’m gaining by going to bed, rather than what I’m losing: rest and energy v TikTok and doomscrolling. I stay up later in summer, but I really need that extra rest in winter.” While consistency is the key to sleep hygiene day-to-day, she says, a modest seasonal variation aligns with nature’s rhythms.3. Rewrite the calendarView image in fullscreenIcy morning light can be a mood-booster.Photograph: Ian Wright/Getty ImagesIn Fitzgerald’s diary, New Year’s Day isn’t 1 January; it’s 1 April. She divides the year into roughly April to June (spring), July to September (summer), October to December (autumn) and January to March (winter). Fitzgerald lives in Warwickshire in the UK; an equivalent new year in the southern hemisphere would be 1 October.“My biggest piece of advice is: don’t combine autumn and winter into one big homogenous blob,” she says. “From October onwards, people think: ‘I hate winter.’ But the winter solstice isn’t until 21 or 22 December.Winterhas barely begun by Christmas and new year, and then we want spring. We’re setting ourselves up to fail.”She says everyone likes autumn because of the beautiful leaves, but often it’s actually the wettest, muddiest season. So while the bad news is that winter hasn’t even begun yet, there’s good news, too. “There’s so much beauty and joy in winter. January and February are actually quite dry, and March is a lovely transition month.”To feel the sun unexpectedly warm your bones on a winter’s day is a new level of happinessIf you consider the solstice as the first day of winter, she says, then every day brings more light. She writes: “Far from the associations with darkness, winter offers a gentle glow of light, which increasingly brightens throughout the season until it spotlights the start of spring.”For Fitzgerald, January to March is a “planning, restorative, reflective” time of year. “People start their new year resolutions on 1 January, but everything seasonally is saying ‘rest’. Most resolutions fail by the third week of January. We’re more likely to succeed if we realign with the seasons.” By April, she says, “We have all the daylight and warmth to spring into action.”4. Get out of survival modeView image in fullscreenWinter walks with a pet are a great way to embrace the colder months.Photograph: Posed by model; EyeEm Mobile GmbH/Getty ImagesThat doesn’t mean that winter is just a season to be endured. “The rhetoric around winter is about how to survive, how to grit your teeth and get through it. I used to just shut winter out. I spent no time with it at all,” Fitzgerald says. “The year I decided to be with winter, to really explore it, my mood lifted. I discovered all these gifts that I’d previously barged past. I saw unreal sunrises and sunsets; bare trees looking their most beautiful; buds and leaves forming ready for spring.” She admits that this change was forced upon her; she was looking after her father-in-law’s dog while he was in hospital. But she enjoyed their winter walks so much, she now has two dogs of her own.5. Use uplifting language“The words people use to describe winter include ‘bleak’, ‘dark’, ‘barren’, ‘cold’, ‘miserable’, ‘depressing’ … We can’t expect to keep this language and appreciate the joys of winter,” says Fitzgerald. “I felt it was important to offer people a different language to think about winter. For example, ‘prinkling’ is that feeling when you’ve been out in the cold and your hands and feet start to warm up.” She feels the spirit of the season is encapsulated by “‘yutori’, a Japanese word that means room to breathe, a sense of space, taking a moment to pause”. Her book highlights many more wonderful words that capture the unique joys of winter, such as “chibbly”: something crisp or crackly with frost. After reading it, I’ve found myself whispering “apricity” on gorgeous blue-sky days – a word that describes the warmth of the sun in winter. As Fitzgerald writes, “To feel the sun unexpectedly warm your bones on a winter’s day is a new level of happiness.”6. Keep socialisingView image in fullscreenMeet-ups with friends are essential.Photograph: Posed by models; SolStock/Getty Images“Winter is a really great time to have a mental health check-in. There aren’t as many distractions as there are in summer, and it’s a lovely reminder that we don’t need to be busy all the time,” says Fitzgerald. At the same time, humans don’t hibernate like bears, as much as we might want to, and we need to have things to look forward to. She has noticed that many people don’t make big plans until Easter, leaving their diaries bare for up to four months. “You can’t have an empty calendar and a full heart! Winter is traditionally a time to connect with the tribe, to share stories and camaraderie with others.” She says socialising is particularly important if you experience low mood in winter, as your brain is craving oxytocin, which comes from closeness and physical contact.Fitzgerald deliberately books meet-ups in January, February and March, from cups of tea with friends to comedy nights, and celebrates events such as the lunar new year and Valentine’s Day (even when single). “Choosing celebration in winter leaves us more fulfilled. Each day has more purpose,” she writes. “Winter can be barren, but only if we make it that way.” She says that winter is perfect for ambiverts – probably the majority of us – who sit somewhere between introverts and extroverts. There is time to go out and celebrate, and time to stay warm and cosy at home.7. Have a hygge dayView image in fullscreenHygge days can help us to slow down and readjust.Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Pankova/Getty ImagesOn which note, Fitzgerald “changes the energy” of her home in winter by getting out blankets, lighting candles and playing soft, relaxing music. She puts her wellies by the door, and her thick coat, hat and scarf on the hook. A similar five-minute effort, she says, will set you up for the months ahead. She writes: “It is a useful cue for our brains to slow down, reflect, reconsider and adjust to the season.”Suitably prepped, Fitzgerald hosts what she now calls a hygge day in the run-up to Christmas, or in the hush between Christmas and new year. “I designed them in my 20s, before I’d even heard of hygge [the Danish concept of cosiness, conviviality and contentment],” she says. “Christmas can be a stressful time of year and I wanted a space where my friends and I could just relax, with no obligations or expectations. A few friends come over to watch films, cook, eat, read, chat, sleep – whatever they want. Since then, I’ve seen people through different life stages, from having babies to dealing with health issues.” People turn up in their comfiest clothes, or even pyjamas, and take what they need from the day. One friend wanted some adult company when breastfeeding; another brought presents for wrapping away from her children; a third slept soundly for hours after surviving a tough year.8. Adapt your exercise regimeView image in fullscreenExercise boosts endorphins and helps regulate temperature.Photograph: Posed by model; Annapurna Mellor/Getty ImagesIn winter, 61% of people in Britain stop exercising completely, writes Fitzgerald. It’s not out of laziness, or (just) because of the cold and dark – it’s also down to the amygdala part of the brain. Fitzgerald describes this as “the alarm bell of the brain”. When we’re stressed, it can take over our decision-making, a state known as “amygdala hijack”. She writes: “Your amygdala doesn’t really care about future you; it only focuses on what feels good now. Whereas going for a run may benefit future you, the amygdala will counter that sitting on the sofa with some chocolate and ​­binge-​­watching a box set will feel better now.”Ironically, one way to calm down the amygdala down is by exercising, but the average Briton spends 42% more time being sedentary over winter – an extra six hours a day. “Continuing exercise is so important for your mood, especially if you get the winter blues,” Fitzgerald says. “Your brain needs the endorphins, and exercise also helps regulate temperature.”This sounds like a catch-22. How can we override our brains? “I really believe in a seasonal adjustment here too,” she says. For example, if you can’t face a run, a 20-minute walk is enough to reduce cortisol, resulting in a more positive outlook. If darkness is a barrier, she suggests walking with a friend, or joining a dance class. Swapping cardio for strength training will “improve mental agility and executive functioning, helping us with planning, organising and ​­decision-​­making”, while yoga can “reduce stress, anxiety, depression and chronic pain”. “Even just a few daily stretches are beneficial – you can do them in bed if you want,” she says.Whichever kind of exercise you choose, it will also improve your sleep. “It’s really important that we don’t see winter as a reason to stop.”9. Embrace slow cookingView image in fullscreenSoups, stews and curries all satisfy winter cravings.Photograph: Posed by model; Westend61/Getty ImagesWinter is Fitzgerald’s favourite time of year to cook. She believes that if we listen to our bodies, they crave what is in season. In UK winters, that is protein and root vegetables, which lend themselves to soups, stews and curries. “Winter food is such a gorgeous invitation to slow down and really savour the meal. It takes time to prepare and cook, slowly developing flavours and adding warming spices,” she says. This benefits our brains as well as our bellies. She writes: “Cooking can mindfully absorb us, and we feel good for doing it. Research shows that cooking can boost our confidence and ​­self-​­esteem and result in better mental clarity and focus.”10. Rethink your holiday plans“I’ve started taking my main holiday in winter, not summer. I’ve never understood why, when it’s more likely to be nice weather in the UK, we jet off to somewhere else,” says Fitzgerald. “Winter is a natural point in our seasonal energy to take a break. I was also really taken aback by how much cheaper it is.”That doesn’t mean flying long-haul to chase the sun, or necessarily travelling at all. “Just taking time off to be at home – what a perfect time not to be commuting, and to have a change in routine,” she says. If you’re tied to school holidays, even a micro-break can be beneficial. “Just a half-day off work, if that’s all you can manage, is such a restorative thing to do.”She suggests spending a morning off having a mini winter retreat. Go for a walk, watch a film, dance to your favourite songs or read a book – anything you enjoy that isn’t housework or life admin, and is a change from your usual routine. “It’s good for our brains to get into retreat mode by physically doing something different,” she writes.The Gifts of Winter: How to Uncover Seasonal Joy, Health and Happiness by Stephanie Fitzgerald (Penguin, £16.99).

Now that music and film lives in the cloud, we’ve turned to clothes as the new go-to gift. But choosing them for another person is a high-risk endeavour. How can we boost our chances of getting it right?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Because we do really, really want to get it right. Kids just want Santa to bring them the swag, but one of the things that happens when you become a grownup is that you care more about whether other people like the gifts you’ve given them than you do about what you receive. And fashion is more difficult to get right than many think. After all, if how to dress well was self-evident, then I wouldn’t have a job.Actually I take that back. If money were no object, then fashion gifting would indeed be simple. Next to no one would be disappointed to find a Dior handbag or diamond earrings under the tree. But that’s not the reality of Christmas shopping for most people. The search for desirable, appropriate gifts within budget constraints is hard work.Stick to slightly different versions of pieces you’ve seen them wear. Do they like a contrasting scarf? Do they always belt their jeans? Do they wear hoop earrings?Not to mention the fact that you are trying to tick 10 people off the list in the 90 minutes you’ve got free before you have to leave for the carol service. So I will cut to the chase with my pointers for successful fashion gifting.First, the basics. If you are buying clothes for someone else, stick to pieces that don’t really need to be tried on. This is why socks and ties are hardy perennials. But this category also includes most jumpers, jewellery and tights. Do not even think about jeans or a dress. Narrowing the categories down in this way will make shopping easier: decision fatigue is real.View image in fullscreenYou’ll be as well prepared as actor Jane Wyman in 1955.Photograph: Hulton Archive/GettySecondly: do not buy anything for someone else because you think it’s funny. Gift giving should always be about the recipient, not the giver, and it seems to me that the point of hilarious gifts (which are never actually hilarious anyway) is usually to showcase the wit of the gift-giver. If you must give an amusing gift, it has to be a joke that casts the recipient in a flattering light. A baseball cap with a smart, in-the-know funny phrase is fine (if they are a cap wearer), pyjamas with “Beware, Not a Morning Person” are not. Relatedly, avoid Christmas-themed socks, pyjamas or anything else. These might feel festive in the moment, but by Boxing Day they have all the magic of leftover sprouts.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: how to do the country look – without being a flat cap clicheRead moreDo you know this person’s taste, or just their style? I was recently introduced to this distinction, and I find it to be helpful in figuring out how confident I am that a gift will be well received. Taste and style are not the same. Your style is the mode in which you present to the world; your taste is what you consider beautiful. If you know someone really well, and are confident you understand their taste as well as their style, then you can be bold in your pick. But if you’ve never been inside someone’s home, you might know their style, but you don’t necessarily know their taste.Instead, stick to slightly different versions of pieces you have seen them wear. Do they like a contrasting scarf with a coat? Do they always belt their jeans? Do they wear hoop earrings? Don’t overthink it: pick something you are confident they will use. To play it safe, work within categories that are worn at home (a dressing gown) or outside (wellies, gloves) rather than those where sartorial standards are tougher and more complicated, like work or party wear. Monogramming their initials is a smart way to make a simple, no-fail present (a fluffy white robe, for example) feel special.Oh, and one last thing. You know what always goes down well? Tucking in the receipt. Not that I don’t back you to get it right. But this game is harder than it looks.Model: Imogen May at Milk.

I find mine particularly handy for when I can’t be bothered to do anything except scrape my hair into a ponytail – the fringe adds interest and makes the whole thing look more intentional.If your itch can only be scratched with scissors, there are ways of limiting fringe remorse. Luke Hersheson fromHershesonsis, in my view, the best cutter in the business, and he particularly excels at making fringes look tempting. He feels strongly that tears can be avoided by steering clear of graphic fringes that go too far into the temples, and opting instead for a curtain-like bang that sits barely above the eyebrow in the middle, gradually becoming longer towards the temples à la Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin, Rihanna and Goldie Hawn.This will look good for three to four months, growing seamlessly into your style, before you’ll need to decide whether you really want to roll again.Explore more on these topicsWomen's hairSali Hughes on beautyBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Final call for morning mass. I took a seat at the back of the modern church, built when the Abbey of Saint Maurice and Saint Maurus relocated to this hill in Clervaux, north Luxembourg, in 1910. Then the monks swept in – and swept away 1,000 years. Sung in Latin, their Gregorian chants filled the nave: simple, calming, timeless. I’m not religious and didn’t understand a word, but also, in a way, understood it completely.Map of Luxembourg with castles marked and neighbouring countries shownAlthough mass is held here at 10am daily, year-round, the monks’ ethereal incantations seemed to perfectly suit the season. I left the church, picked up a waymarked hiking trail and walked deeper into the forest – and the mood remained. There was no one else around, no wind to dislodge the last, clinging beech leaves or sway the soaring spruce. A jay screeched, and plumes of hair ice feathered fallen logs. As in the church, all was stillness, a little magic.Clervaux Castle looked Disney cute, fairy lights dripping from its white-washed turretsI’d come to Luxembourg by train, with the notion of finding a frozen fairytale. This tiny grand duchy, about the size of Dorset, has a ridiculous number of castles – as many as 130 (depending on your definition). It’s the legacy of being sited at the heart of western Europe, suffering centuries of incursions. Some of these castles have been restored for visitors; some are places you can stay at (with lower rates off-season). Add in rimy forests, chanting monks and the factall public transport is free– maybe the most magical thing of all – and my hopes Luxembourg would make an atmospheric winter break were being fulfilled.My walk ended atClervaux Castle. It dates from the 12th century, but was destroyed during the second world war’s desperate Battle of the Bulge, which played out in these cold forests in December 1944. The castle has since been rebuilt and now houses the 1950s Unesco-listed photo exhibition The Family of Man. It was almost empty as I moved between the 503 images, taken by the most prestigious photographers of the age, depicting normal people in all life stages, the ordinary rendered extraordinary. There are no captions or locations; each photograph is its own whole story, containing multitudes. It was incredibly uplifting.View image in fullscreenClervaux Castle perched on a rocky promontory above the city, was destroyed during the Battle of the Bulge in the second world war and then rebuilt.Photograph: Pixelbiss/AlamyYou can’t spend the night at Clervaux Castle, but 10 minutes away by (free!) bus isChateau d’Urspelt, where you can stay. When I arrived, this castle looked Disney-cute, fairy lights dripping from its white-washed turrets. Eighty years ago, it was quite different. The US 1st Battalion 110th Infantry had its HQ here in December 1944, before being overwhelmed by German forces. After the war, Urspelt fell further into ruin, until 2005, when a local entrepreneur decided to restore it and turn it into a smart hotel. I skipped the snazzy spa, and the ice rink sparkling in the courtyard, but relished a fruity Luxembourgish pinot noir in the low-lit bar, which hides like a speakeasy in the castle’s historic cellars.One of the country’s most impressive castles isVianden(less than an hour from Clervaux via a free bus), a beast of a bastion, lording over the River Our, on the German border. It was constructed between the 11th and 14th centuries on Roman foundations, altered multiple times, left to rot, then, from the 1970s, painstakingly restored to its medieval pomp. On a pallid winter’s day, it was crowd-free. I rattled around its vast state rooms and marvelled at the layered history visible in the visitor centre, which is built around past excavations.It’s not just the castle that gives Vianden its fairytale feel. There’s the winding river, the tight-pressed wooded hills and the village itself, with its remnants of 13th-century walls and pretty, cobbled main street. I opted to escape reality entirely in the Ancien Cinéma cafe, a former movie theatre where you can grab a coffee, sit on a couch and watch whatever’s on the big screen, surrounded by film paraphernalia.View image in fullscreenThe Sherlock room at Château de Clémency.Photograph: Sarah BaxterMy final stop was a castle unlike any other.Chateau de Clémency, close to the Belgian border, is a five-room guesthouse and the 2025 winner of Luxembourg Tourism’s Best Host award. Dating back to 1635, it was only ever a small residential retreat, with no military function. When Pascal Zimmer – former judoka, self-taught tailor and architect, and restorer of historic buildings – bought it 20 years ago, it was a proper mess, in need of either demolition or renovation. He saw the property’s true value and he liked the staircase – “You could say I spent €400,000 on some stairs …” he confessed, pointing out the stone pleasingly worn by 400 years of footfall.“When you think about castles, you think of Windsor or Versailles. But this is a Luxembourgish castle, not so expansive, not so well done; you can’t restore it in the same way.”I travelled the length and breadth of Luxembourg by bus – and it didn’t cost me a pennyRead moreSo, to that end, Clémency is Pascal’s own artistic vision. Each room has a different theme, from belle époque “Peggy’s” to the “Roaring 20s”. “Tribute” pays homage to the local steel industry on which Luxembourg’s wealth is built. “My father was a miner,” Pascal said. “He was a humble guy; he’d say all he wanted was a small, clean room. This is a small, clean room.” A patchwork blanket covers the bed, while the bathroom is black polished concrete, a nod to life underground. I stayed in “Sherlock”, a Holmesian fantasy suite; the lounge was a steam-punkish curiosity shop of moody portraits, scientific implements and stuffed cats.There isn’t much to do in the town of Clémency itself, although that hardly mattered. It was only 40 minutes by public transport (did I mention: all free!) into Luxembourg City, a capital perched on a precipitous rock, like something from a storybook. It was a shorter hop to Bascharage, where I got cosy in D’Braustuff, a gemütlich brewery-brasserie serving Luxembourgish classics – I tucked into a heartywäinzoossiss(traditional sausage). But when darkness fell, I was also content to stay in my castle with a book – the shelves were full of Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle – and enjoy an alternative winter’s tale.The trip was provided byLuxembourgtourismboardandByway, which can arrange bespoke itineraries including Eurostar tickets, Interrail passes and accommodation.Château de Clémencyhas doubles from €99.Château d’Urspelthas doubles from €174Explore more on these topicsLuxembourg holidaysPublic transport tripsEurope holidaysShort breaksCultural tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Composite: National Library of France / EPA / The Guardian / Guardian designBorder conflict has roots in colonial maps and long-standing ‘sibling rivalry’ByAshley Kirk,Lucy Swan,Oliver HolmesandAntonio VoceTue 16 Dec 2025 21.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 04.26 ESTShareThailand and Cambodia have beenlocked in a border disputefor more than a century, which exploded again in the summer of 2025. Peace efforts have had mixed results and fighting continues.A historical dispute over lines drawn on colonial maps is often used as a pretext for simmering nationalism. The two countries have had what one historian called a “sibling rivalry” for decades, fanned by competing claims to the region’s rich cultural heritage, including ancient temples in disputed areas.Competing territorial claims date back more than a century, when France occupiedCambodia, which was part of French Indochina.Map showing the expansion of French Indochina in the 1900s led to a larger modern CambodiaCompared with today, the border betweenThailand– then known as Siam – and Cambodia – then part of French Indochina – lay further to the south. As a result, Cambodia was smaller than it is now.Beginning in the early 20th century, a series of Franco-Siamese treaties pushed the frontier northwards and expanded Cambodia’s territory. The 1904 treaty first redefined parts of the border, using a natural ridge-line as a key geographical marker.A subsequent1907 treatydelivered a more substantial shift, with Siam ceding the provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap and Sisophon to French Indochina. These agreements helped establish much of the modern Cambodia-Thailand border and significantly expanded Cambodia’s territory to the north and north-west.This means that the border region is now dotted with ancient Khmer stone temples that are cherished by both sides.Map of three temples on the disputed borderMoving the border north to follow the Dangrek escarpment – a ridge-line that also runs alongside a watershed dividing river systems flowing into Cambodia and Thailand – meant that several important temples came to lie close to the border.But the treaties left their exact ownership open to interpretation with different historic maps being referenced by both sides.This means that three disputed temples run along this disputed escarpment: Prasat Ta Moan Thom, as it is called by the Thais; in Khmer, it is Ta Muen Thom; Prasat Ta Khwai (Prasat Ta Krabey in Khmer) and Preah Vihear.View image in fullscreenPreah Vihear temple on the border of Cambodia and Thailand.Photograph: Craig Ferguson/LightRocket/Getty ImagesWhile all three are disputed, Preah Vihear has long been the focal point of the dispute. The 11th century Hindu temple, known as Khao Phra Viharn in Thailand, has been controlled at different times by both sides. The temple pre-dates Cambodia’s more famous Angkor Wat temple complex by 100 years. It sits on the edge of the escarpment.The modern dispute stems from a 1907 French-produced map, known as theAnnex I map, which placed Preah Vihear on the Cambodian side. This contradicted the Franco-Siamese treaty’s instruction that the border follow the natural watershed of the Dangrek range.Shane Strate, associate professor at Kent State university, Ohio, who specialises in south-east Asian history, said that the boundary line on the map was largely drawn along the watershed. Yet when it reached Preah Vihear, “it veers off course to enclose the ancient temple within French colonial territory before returning to the watershed line once again”.TheAnnex I mapshows a hand-drawn border line (marked with crosses) running north of the ridgeline but south of the watershed.Annex I map establishing the modern borderSiam did not formally object at the time, but the map’s deviation later became central to rival sovereignty claims. During the second world war, Siam briefly occupied the temple before relinquishing control.MapTensions resurfaced after Cambodia gained independence in 1953, leading to a legal case at the world court, the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ). TheICJ decided in 1962that the temple itself belonged to Cambodia.The fact that Siam did not formally object to the Annex I map in 1907 underpinned Cambodia’s 1962 victory at the ICJ.However, the ruling failed to clarify the ownership of the larger contested area around the temple, resulting in arguments persisting until today.The dispute turns on Thailand’s argument that the border should follow the watershed line referenced in the original Franco-Siamese treaties, even though those agreements did not include detailed maps defining it. Keeping surrounding territory would allow Thailand to maintain easy road access for tourists, who have previously visited the temple via the Thai side.Thailand maintains that the watershed puts Preah Vihear and nearby territory on its side of the frontier, in conflict with the 1907 Annex I map used by Cambodia to assert its claim.The map below shows the complexities of the varying claimed boundaries around the temple.Map showing how Thailand’s government claims the border lies south of the established boundaryWith Thailand and Cambodia continuing to rely on differing historical documents and interpretations of the same rugged border, Preah Vihear and its neighbouring temples are likely to remain flashpoints.Chris Baker, a historian based in Thailand, said older maps and treaties were often exploited by neighbouring governments that have competing political and economic agendas.“While the varying maps are in existence and can be invoked in these disputes, I don’t think this dispute is about the border,” said Baker.“The other factor is the longstanding sibling rivalry of the two countries, so fierce precisely because they are so similar.”Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaShareReuse this content"

Perhaps a dozen video feeds come through to his screen on an increasingly hot section of the front, running roughly from Pokrovske to Huliaipole, 50 miles east of Zaporizhzhia city.Dmytro, 33, is with the 423rd drone battalion, a specialist unit only formed in 2024. He cycles through the feeds, on Ukraine’s battlefield Delta system, expanding each in turn. The grainy images come from one-way FPV (first person view) drones; clearer footage, with heights and speed, from commercially bought Mavic drones; at another point there is a bomber drone, available munitions marked in green.View image in fullscreenDmytro, 33, on duty at one of the field command points of the 423rd unmanned systems ‘Scythian Griffins’ battalion.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt is a common sight across Ukraine’s front, though as Dmytro and his commander, Kostya, a captain, point out, the terrain below is distinctive. This is not the more defendable Donetsk, with its towns and slag heaps. It is flat, farming land punctuated by destroyed villages, the meeting point of the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.Ukraine mapWhile Vladimir Putin’s most recently stated goal is to take all Donetsk, by diplomacy or force, it is near here that the line yielded in November. The geography makes it tricky to defend, Kostya observes: “There are a lot of fields and if we lose a height advantage, we have to retreat for kilometres.”An opportunistic Russian attack east of Huliaipole caught the Ukrainian defenders short. The area had been held since 2022 by a war-weary 102nd territorial defence brigade, soldiers from Ivano-Frankivsk in the west, but they could not withstand the sudden pressure. A battalion gave way completely. In November about six miles was lost.View image in fullscreenDa Vinci Wolves battalion training centre, where new recruits are learning how to fly different types of drones.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe difficulties were caused partly by Ukraine’s intense defence to the east, said Serhii Kuzan, the chair of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre. “Because of the big concentration of forces in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, the reserves were exhausted and that’s why this offensive was possible.” Troops from the 225th assault regiment, were redeployed to stabilise the situation by the end of the month.Though the Ukrainian Mavic drones have an extraordinary reconnaissance ability, with experienced pilots able to pick out movement from a couple of hundred metres away, the Russian invaders have been able to exploit frequent late autumn fog. “They take advantage of our lack of visibility because of the weather,” Kuzan says, and allying it with 250kg glide-bomb strikes.The Russian airforce still operates about 300 jets and can launch the munitions from 50 to 75 miles away, beyond the range of Ukrainian air-to-air missiles. Though planes and missiles can be tracked on radar, the defenders only have four minutes’ notice. Electronic countermeasures can divert their path, a process that Ukrainian soldiers estimate is effective 70% of the time.When the weather is clearer, the drone crews work on an unceasing defence. Russian soldiers head forward in ones or twos to pre-assigned points, to try to avoid deadly drones above, often with little food and water, and sometimes even without arms, the weapons to be picked up later if they can survive. But if the weather is clear, the flat terrain and the lack of foliage means that it is not difficult to spot the infiltrators.View image in fullscreenMaksym, 24, at the training field with FPV pilots of the 423rd unmanned systems ‘Scythian Griffins’ battalion.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianMaksym, 29, and Serhii, 24, have just returned from five days on the front, part of a mixed crew of FPV and Mavic pilots. Now they are resting, one playing a video game, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, a post-apocalyptic shooter set in the exclusion zone surrounding the destroyed nuclear power plant – raising the obvious question of whether there is any similarity to their frontline work.“It helps us do our job,” Maksym says, smiling. “If you are flying a jet in one of the battlefield games, it’s basically the same as flying a Mavic. It’s good practise.”Rest for pilots in position depends on the level of Russian activity. “You can always have enough [time] to sleep 15 minutes and you are OK,” Maksym claims. Both FPV and Mavic drones have up to 20 minutes of battery life, and they can be deployed one after the other if needed, striking at up to 9 miles (15km) – and farther, to 18 miles if an FPV is launched from a second “mother drone”, which also acts as a re-transmitter.View image in fullscreenFPV crew after they returning from frontline positions.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe pilots struggle to recall their most recent deployment, but Maksym brightens and says “on the previous time there was one day when we killed seven Russians and wounded three”, which was “a regular, normal good day”. What does it feel like to kill Russians? “We feel joy because you killed your enemy,” he says, such is the reality of the war.The statistics make stark reading. In November, the 423rd battalion reported it had killed 418 Russian soldiers, in line with other specialist Ukrainian drone units, their casualty totals publicly reported, part of an established points system, where extra supplies are given to those with the most enemy killed.Russia’s military suffered an estimated 1,033 casualties a day in November, and 382,000 during 2025,according to British estimates. Drones account for 60% of Russians killed and wounded, Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s chief military commander, said, with the country’s pilots flying 10,000 combat missions a day in November.Vitaliy Hersak, the commander of the unit, speaking from a large bunker near Zaporizhzhia, emphasises that the battalion was created last November, such is the relative novelty of drone warfare. His claim that “we are destroying one and half battalions of the enemy a month” may be a slight exaggeration, but it is not far off the mark. The problem is that Russia seems to have “infinite numbers” while Ukraine is “basically out of infantry” making sectors of the line harder to hold.View image in fullscreenVitaliy Hersak, the commander of the 423rd unmanned systems ‘Scythian Griffins’ battalion.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianFarther east along the front, two experienced drone pilots from the Da Vinci Wolves battalion, in Dnipropetrovsk region, wonder how long they can keep defending with the intensity required. How many of the enemy they have killed? Each wonders if it could be as many as 1,000, though they have no idea, and on an official count the unit’s most successful pilot has more than 400 kills. “I think I could do it for another six months, that’s it,” says one, although the war may well last longer.There is little sign of any desire to stop resisting, though maintaining an active defence will require new pilots and longer breaks from the frontline. Sasha, whose call sign is Lego, because he was a 3D artist and student, is 23, and learning how to fly FPV drones. He signed up three months ago, telling his father “just before I was going to jump on the train” because he wanted to avoid an extended family conversation.View image in fullscreenSasha (right) learning how to fly FPV drones.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe softly spoken young man does not know how he will fare. “I haven’t been on a position yet,” he says, but reasons he has to try: “There was a moment when I realised: I can’t sit and do nothing and just live.” Sasha is also reluctant to comment on the ongoing peace negotiations, arguing he has no right to do so, because has had never been in the front. Instead he says, simply, that for Ukraine “the first thing is just survive”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaDrones (military)featuresShareReuse this content"

The drop marks dramatic turnaround for a country that has long pegged its economic growth to immigration.New estimates released on Wednesday by Statistics Canadashowed that Canada’s population fell by 0.2% in the third quarter to stand at 41.6 million, down from 41.65 million on 1 July.It was the only other quarterly decline on record came in 2020, and was attributed to Covid-19 border restrictions.The recent decline, however, is driven largely by a drop in the number of international students studying in Canada after Ottawa pledged to tamp down on the number of study permits issued.13:00Why is anti-immigrant sentiment on the rise in Canada? – videoCanada’s Liberal party, which oversaw record-levels of immigration under the tenure of former prime minister Justin Trudeau, has shifted course quickly after mounting pushbackover what many saw as unsustainable migration.In the third quarter of 2023, Canada’s quarterly population growth was the highest ever since 1957, with 420,000 people added to the country over that three-month span.Non-permanent residents make up roughly 6.8% of the total population, down from 7.3% last quarter. The current prime minister Mark Carney has pledged to reduce the number of non-permanent residents in Canada to 5 per cent of the total population by the end of 2027.Part of that plan involves cutting the number of international student permits in half, from a target of 305,900 new arrivals for 2025 to 155,000 in 2026, and 150,000 in each of 2027 and 2028. At the same time, the federal government plans to gently increase the number of permanent residents admitted into Canada compared with its previously announced immigration plan. It anticipates admitting 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026, and 365,000 in 2027.The finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, recently told reporters Canada had “exceeded our capacity to welcome” and provide services to immigrants in recent years.With his immigration bill, Canada’s prime minister is bowing to Trump | Tayo BeroRead moreRobert Kavcic, an economist at Bank of Montreal wrote in a note Wednesday that a “major population adjustment is well under way and it remains one of the biggest economic stories” in Canada.“In order to hit the non-permanent resident target share, we’ll need to see population growth run barely above zero through 2028, before settling back into a longer-term run rate of just under 1%.”“We’ve argued all along that the explosion in population growth – to nearly 1.3 million people within a year at one point – was playing a major role in many economic issues Canadian policymakers have been struggling to deal with,” he wrote adding he’s seen a “significant weakening” of the rental market, less pressure on services inflation and growth in real gross domestic product per capita are among the potential impacts he sees as a result of the decline.The new figures show that every province and territory reported population decreases, apart from Alberta and Nunavut, both of which had increases of 0.2%.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But when she was spotted with two cubs of roughly the same age last month, they realized they were witnessing an exceedingly rare case of adoption.“Female polar bears are really good moms and so they’re just primed for looking after and caring for their offspring,” said Evan Richardson, a research scientist with Environment and Climate ChangeCanada. “We think if there’s a little cub that’s bawling on the coast and has lost its mother, these females just can’t help themselves but to take them on and look after them. It’s a really curious behaviour and an interesting aspect of polar bear life history.”Changes to polar bear DNA could help them adapt to global heating, study findsRead moreThe mother, known to scientists as bear X33991, and the cubs are part of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation, which is among the most studied in the world, with scientists documenting their feeding habits and movements for nearly half a century. Of the 4,600 bears studied over the years, the adoption is only the 13th ever witnessed in the population.“Polar bear adoptions are very rare and unusual and we don’t know why they happen,” said Alysa McCall, of Polar Bears International, calling it an “amazing” sight to witness.The two cubs, which appear healthy and well-nourished are believed to be 10 or 11 months old and are expected to stay with their mother for another 1.5 years.GPS data show the three bears are already on the sea ice. The cubs will rely on their mother to catch seals and often share in the food she provides or teaches them to eat. They will stick close by and gradually learn the skills needed to survive in a harsh but at times bountiful environment.A winter spent on the ice hunting for prey – and months in the summer without any food – are a difficult existence for even the hardiest bears. Half of all cubs born won’t make it to adulthood.8:40How scientists capture a polar bear – videoBut experts say having a mother now gives the adopted cub a far greater chance of surviving. Still of the 13 cases documented over 45 years, only three have survived.Researchers plan to study genetic samples from the cub to determine if the mother is known to them, and could still be alive. In some previous adoption cases, biological mothers were still alive and a “switching of litters” had occurred, rather than the cub being orphaned.“We might never know what happened to the mother,” said McCall. “When we confirmed this was an adoption, I had a lot of mixed feelings. But it’s just another reason why this species is so incredible and why they’re so fascinating and interesting. It gives you a lot of hope when you realize that maybe, polar bears are looking out for each other.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Washington has already moved thousands of troops and nearly a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier, to the region.Trump wrote that Venezuela was “completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America”, warning that it would “only get bigger” and “be like nothing they have ever seen before”.Why is Trump taking aim at Venezuela?Trump has used social media to publicly accuse Maduro’s government of using “stolen” oil to “finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping”.The White House has repeatedly accused the country of facilitating the drug trade. The US military has killed at least 90 people since September in strikes on boats in the Pacific and Caribbean that Washington claims were carrying illegal narcotics to the US.However, the Trump administration has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying fentanyl, which is mainly produced in Mexico, or cocaine, which is typically produced in neighbouring Colombia and shipped to the US via various routes.Trump has also made unsubstantiated claims that Maduro is “emptying his prisons and insane asylums” and “forcing” inmates to migrate to the US. Close to 8 million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country’s economic crisis and repression since 2013 and Maduro was sworn in for a third term of office in Januaryafter an election widely viewed as fraudulent.Maduro has strongly denied all these accusations and in turn has accused the US of using its “war on drugs” as an excuse to topple his government and lay claim to the country’s oil.How important is Venezuela to global oil supplies?Venezuela is home to the world’s largest oil reserves but produces about 0.8% of the world’s output because of struggles in the wider economy and its state-owned oil company.It exports about 900,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly to buyers in China, a fraction of the almost 22m barrels of oil produced by the US. Still, oil is the main source of foreign revenue, with profits from the sector financing more than half of the government’s budget.Market analysts at Goldman Sachs said the loss of Venezuelan crude exports owing to Trump’s blockade could cause the market to tighten slightly in the short-term, which would lead to higher prices. But in the longer-term, a political upheaval that would allow for an influx of western oil companies into the country could mean an increase in oil exports and greater supplies in the market.How has this affected the global market?The blockade prompted a sharp rise in the international oil price as traders factored in the growing possibility of disruption to global supplies.The price of Brent crude shot up by 1.5% to reach almost $60 a barrel on Wednesday afternoon, after the pricefell below $60 a barrelfor the first time since 2021 earlier this week.Wednesday’s jump put an end to the steady slide in the global oil markets throughout the month as political leaders inched towards a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine that could lead to the full return of Russian oil barrels to the market.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpAmericasNicolás MaduroOilCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “Since I moved to Mexico, I fell in love with the people and this city. However, my words did not reflect that respect – in this country I am a guest and I forgot to act like one.”He is thelatest British chefto land in hot water for insulting or meddling with national cuisines, includingJamie Oliver’s addition of chorizo to Spanish paella, Mary Berry adding white wine to spaghetti bolognese and Nigella Lawson putting cream in her carbonara.In Mexico, where food is considered a national treasure, the comments struck a particularly sensitive nerve.“Mexicans are very defensive of their culture and their traditions,” said Rodrigo Sierra, whose Instagram video reacting to Hart’s comments went viral. “I’m sure Richard Hart didn’t mean it maliciously or out of complete disrespect. What he did do was make a very ignorant comment, without considering the consequences.”The remarks come at a tense moment in Mexico City, where many have accused foreign arrivals of driving up rent for locals, a phenomenon that has led to furious and at timesviolent protests in the capital.Commentators took particular issue with Hart’s criticism of thebolillo,a white roll that is a staple of everyday Mexican food, whether for makingtortasor mopping up the remnants of traditional dishes.“Thebolillois a popular bread, a bread that has served most Mexicans, lower classes, middle class, upper class, but it’s a cheap bread because it has to be cheap, it’s a practical bread, it is an everyday bread,” said Sierra. “Classifying it as an ‘ugly’ bread just because it serves the needs of a population that can’t spend 100 pesos on the bread that this baker sells in his bakery seems to me like a very poor point of view.”The 93-year-old Englishwoman who is the rock star of Mexican cookingRead moreSierra noted that Mexico had more than 600 kinds of bread, includingpan de muerto,which is made for Day of the Dead celebrations and placed on altars honouring the deceased.“Bread is embedded in our culture … it’s an important part of a Mexican’s ritual,” he added. “You can’t say that bread doesn’t have a culture or that Mexicans don’t have a bread culture just because you’re referring to your type of bread.

The tanker was thought to be loaded with about 2m barrels of Venezuela’s heavy crude, according tothe New York Times. The Venezuelan government accused the US of “blatant theft” and described the seizure as “an act of international piracy”, further heightening tensions between the two countries.In a post on social media on Tuesday night announcing the blockade, Trump alleged Venezuela was using oil to fund drug trafficking and other crimes and vowed to escalate the military buildup.Venezuela accuses Trinidad and Tobago of taking part in US seizure of oil tankerRead more“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. “It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before … today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela.”It is unclear how the Trump administration will impose the blockade against the sanctioned vessels, and whether he will turn to the Coast Guard to interdict vessels like he did last week. The administration has moved thousands of troops and nearly a dozen warships – including an aircraft carrier – to the region recently.Maduro, speaking at an event on Tuesday evening before Trump’s post, said: “Imperialism and the fascist right want to colonize Venezuela to take over its wealth of oil, gas, gold, among other minerals. We have sworn absolutely to defend our homeland and in Venezuela peace will triumph.”Venezuela’s government said it rejected Trump’s order of a blockade as a “grotesque threat”, Reuters reported.“The president of the United States intends to impose, in an utterly irrational manner, a supposed naval blockade on Venezuela with the aim of stealing the riches that belong to our homeland,” the government said in a statement.Texas congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, called the blockade “unquestionably an act of war”.“A war that the Congress never authorized and the American people do not want,” Castro said onsocial media.Oil market participants said prices were rising in anticipation of a potential reduction in Venezuelan exports, although they were still waiting to see how Trump’s blockade would be enforced and whether it would extend to include non-sanctioned vessels.There has been an effective embargo in place after the US seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, with loaded vessels carrying millions of barrels of oil staying in Venezuelan waters rather than risk seizure.Since the seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply, a situation worsened by a cyberattack that knocked down the administrative systems of PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-run oil company, this week.While many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country’s oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned, and some companies, particularly the US’s Chevron, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorized ships.For now, the oil market is well supplied and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload. If the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.Trump has ratcheted up actions against the country in recent months. On Tuesday, the Pentagon said it had carried out strikes on three boats it accused of trafficking drugs in the Pacific, killing eight people. Since 2 September, more than 20 strikes have killed at least 95 people, most off the coast ofVenezuela.Several lawmakers have called on the administration to release video footage showing a 2 September attack, but defense secretary Pete Hegseth has refused to do so, calling the video “top secret” and claiming that releasing it to the public violates “longstanding Department of War policy”.The Trump administration has defended its efforts as a success, saying it has prevented drugs from reaching American shores, and pushed back on concerns that it is stretching the bounds of lawful warfare.The administration has also said the campaign is about stopping drugs headed to the US, but Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles appeared to confirm in a Vanity Fair interview published Tuesday that the campaign is part of a push to oust Maduro.Wiles said Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaUS militaryUS politicsUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He was seriously injured in a subsequent shootout with police and his father, Sajid, 50, was shot dead.Australian police have also charged Naveed with one count of committing a terrorist act, which investigators allege may have been “inspired by” Islamic State after indications that the pair were radicalised in some way before the attack.An IS flag was allegedly found in the car they used to travel to Bondi from a short-term rental they were living in elsewhere in Sydney, and Naveed’s prior connections with radical Islamists in Sydney were investigated by Australia’s spy agency, Asio, leading to suggestions that they sought instruction or training in the Philippines during their stay, from 1-28 November.Sajid travelled to the country on an Indian passport while his son used his Australian passport.Map of PhilippinesHowever, Philippine police visited GV Hotel in Davao City on Wednesday afternoon and found that the pair stayed in the same room from 1-28 November – the entire duration of their visit to the country. Police also interviewed hotel staff who had interacted with them.One hotel worker, Jenelyn Sayson, told the Guardian the Akrams did not behave suspiciously during their stay.They initially booked a seven-night stay online but requested extensions on arrival and continued to extend their stay until checking out on 28 November, according to Sayson, a front desk staff member who served them during their stay. The two arrived carrying one big piece of luggage and a backpack, she said.They rarely left the hotel and only for about an hour at a time, apparently staying in Davao City, which lies in the southern province of Mindanao.“They would just go out and come back. Just the two of them …. We never saw them talk to any visitors,” said Sayson, who regularly saw the father and son come in and out of the lobby.She recognised them from the media coverage of the attack, although she said Naveed’s hair was longer when he was in the Philippines.They were not chatty, but the son occasionally greeted front-desk employees. “Naveed asked one of the hotel staff where they could buy durian. The hotel staff told them they could buy those in Magsaysay and Bankerohan, but they later told the hotel staff that they were not able to buy durian,” she said.9:39Ten minutes of terror: how the Bondi mass shooting unfolded in real time – videoHousekeeping staff would find rubbish from fast food chains in their bins. They did not leave behind papers or documents. “We thought they probably had business here in the city since they would go out and just come back again,” she said.They did not have their own vehicle. “We would see them cross the street and walk towards the next block. We never saw them take a ride or saw anyone pick them up here at the hotel.”The Philippines national security adviser, Eduardo Año, said the father and son were believed to have remained in the city. “No evidence that they went outside Davao. Our investigation is still ongoing,” Año said.He dismissed reports that they had undergone training in the Philippines and travelled to Marawi City, the site of an Islamic State-linked siege in 2017.Reasons for Bondi suspects’ Philippines trip remain unclear, but Islamic State is active thereRead more“A mere visit does not support allegations of terrorist training, and the duration of their stay would not have allowed for any meaningful and structured training,” Año said, adding that the Philippines was coordinating with counterparts in Australia to determine the purpose of their visit.A spokesperson for the president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, rejected what he called a “misleading characterisation of the Philippines as an Isis training hotspot” following a report that the attackers underwent “military-style” training in the country.The Philippine military said the number of IS-linked militants was down to about 50, distributed in provinces in Mindanao. There has been no record of foreign terrorist activities in recent years, its spokesperson said. “That’s why we cannot see the credibility of reports that the gunmen … underwent training here,” said Gen Romeo Brawner.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackPhilippinesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

And no matter who was in office at different times, I have confidence in the way decisions were taken.”The quiet bricklayer, his father and a leave of absence: the duo accused of killing 15 people in BondiRead moreIt comes as the Jewish community in Bondi is preparing for another day of funerals for the15 people killed, including a service for 10-year-old Matilda, theyoungest person killed in the attack. The first two funerals, for rabbis Eli Schlanger and Yaakov Levitan, were held on Wednesday.Seventeen of the 38 people injured in the shooting remain in hospital, including one in a critical condition.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said overnight that he had spoken to Schlanger’s father-in-law, Rabbi Yehoram Ulman, and the chairman of the Israel-Australia Jewish Council, Arsen Ostrovsky, who was wounded in the attack. In a translated post on the social media site X, he said “these heinous acts are a direct result of rampant antisemitism, which is fuelled by a flaccid policy of authorities in the country and of the Australian government”.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Netanyahu said the Australian prime minister,Anthony Albanese, was to blame because his government’s decision to recognise the Palestinian state had encouraged Islamist extremism and attacks on Jewish targets in Australia, an accusation Albanese has rejected.At a multi-faith memorial service at St Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney on Wednesday night, Albanese said what happened at Bondi was “pure evil” and called for Australians to pull together.“Our nation is stronger than the cowards who seek to divide us … we are braver than the people who try to make us afraid,” he said in an address to the crowd.He called for all Australians to “wrap our arms around the Jewish community and, with our words and deeds, make it clear that you are Australian, and all Australians stand with you, no matter which faith we worship or whether we have no faith at all, we stand with Jewish Australians.“You have every right to worship and study and work and live in peace and safety. You have every right to be proud of who you are and proud of the remarkable contribution that your community has made to Sydney and to modern Australia over generations.”Meanwhile, authorities in the Philippines confirmed on Tuesday that Akram and his 50-year-old father, Sajid, who was shot dead by police on Sunday, travelled to the south-east Asian country between 1 November and 28 November. They listed Davao, in the country’s south, as their final destination in the Philippines.Davao is the capital of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. The island’s more remote regions, west of Davao, havebeen a centre of resistancefor the country’s pro-Islamic State and Islamist militant groups. Philippine police and hotel stafftold the Guardianthe pair spent their entire four-week visit in Davao city, rarely leaving the hotel for more than an hour at the time.Burke said he could not publicly reveal whether Asio continued to monitor Akram after the six-month examination six years ago, or whether the duo’s trip to the Philippines in November triggered a movement alert list, saying the alert list was “very vast” and those who came to Asio attention “generally stay there for a very, very long time”.He was also asked whether the Albanese government’s decision in 2022 to move Asio and the Australian federal police from the home affairs department to the attorney general’s department – a decision reversed this year – had hampered intelligence.The minister said it was his decision to return the agencies to home affairs to assist with “seamless” information-sharing.John Howard’s dog-whistle intervention in gun debate all but dashes any hope of meaningful reformRead moreBurke added they both had enough resources to monitor politically motivated and religiously motivated extremism: “I’ve confirmed with the Australian federal police and with Asio again in the last 24 hours that they both have more resources than they have ever had, and believe they get a fair hearing whenever they put a resources case to government.”Asio’s director general, Mike Burgess,drew comparisonsbetween Islamist political group Hizb ut-Tahrir and the neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network, warning their “anti-Israel rhetoric is fuelling and normalising wider antisemitic narratives”.“The organisation’s condemnation of Israel and Jews attracts media attention and aids recruitment but it deliberately stops short of promoting onshore acts of politically motivated violence,” Burgess said.TheUK banned Hizb ut-Tahrirfrom recruiting or holding protests and meetings in 2024, joining countries such as Germany and Indonesia.Burke said he would list the group once it met the threshold, which he said it had yet to.“My view for a very long time has been, and as soon as I came into home affairs, I asked again, I’ve continued to ask, ‘Do they meet the legal threshold?’ Because the moment they meet a legal threshold, I see them causing nothing but harm in the community,” he said.– With Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian security and counter-terrorismNew South WalesAnthony AlbaneseTony BurkeLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

His comments come amid fracturing bipartisanship on the response to the shooting, with his former Coalition colleagues demanding federal parliament be urgently recalled to toughen immigration rules.While the federal Labor government has focused its immediate response to the terror shootingon potential gun reforms, leading Coalition figures have rejected calls to restrict firearms, claiming Albanese was seeking to “distract” from antisemitism.“Our governments have failed every Australian when it comes to fighting hate and antisemitism. Our prime minister, our government, has allowed Australia to be radicalised on his watch,” Frydenberg said in an emotional address at the Bondi Pavilion site.“It is time for him to accept personal responsibility for the death of 15 innocent people, including a 10-year-old child. It is time our prime minister accepted accountability for what has happened here.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailShortly after Frydenberg’s speech, Minns announced his government’s plan to further restrict protests after a terrorism designation, expanding grounds upon which police can reject applications for public demonstrations. State parliament will be recalled next week, with the laws expected to be rushed through.Australia’s constitution includes an implied right to freedom of political communication, and Minns acknowledged potential constitutional issues in the proposal, saying the new law had to be “drafted in a particular way”. He could not confirm how long protest restrictions would stay in place after a terror designation.Minns said that, after speaking with Jewish community members, large protests “would rip apart our community”, voicing concern about “a combustible situation and community harmony”.But while raising particular alarm about “protests about international events”, Minns said the legislation would not be targeted at any one group.Minns’ government had previously rejected a permit for Sydney’s Palestine Action Group to march across the Harbour Bridge in August, a decision later overturned by the supreme court.“When you’ve got a terrible situation when people are killed, mowed down in great number just because of their religious faith, I think it would be a horrible situation to see a mass demonstration,” Minns said on Wednesday.Until recently, Chris Minns courted the Shooters party. Now he wants tougher gun lawsRead moreFederal parliament is not scheduled to sit until February, but while there are no current plans to urgently recall MPs, government sources did not rule out potentially returning to Canberra early if needed. The federal Coalition is demanding parliament sit before Christmas to legislate parts ofantisemitism envoy Jillian Segal’s report; the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, specifically called for urgent action on a recommendation around increased screening for migrants for extremist or antisemitic views.Frydenberg, who lost his Victorian seat of Kooyong at the 2022 election, demanded the government “ban hate preachers”, prosecute people chanting “from the river to the sea” and brandishing Hezbollah or Hamas flags at protests, and generally ban pro-Palestinian protests he claimed had become “incubators of hate”.The former Liberal MP also demanded greater investment in antisemitism and Holocaust education, more stringent immigration checks for migrants, and a royal commission into antisemitism and the Bondi attack. He also criticised Labor for allowing migrant arrivals from Gaza.There is no indication at this time of any link between pro-Palestine protests and the alleged Bondi terror shooters. Sajid Akram came to Australia from India in 1998, when John Howard was prime minister, while son Naveed was born in Australia. Guardian Australia has reported the processing time for arrivals from Gaza wasmuch longer than Coalition members had claimed.The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said he respected Frydenberg’s views, but said Labor had taken action on antisemitism, and would continue to do so.“The government takes the evil of antisemitism seriously, and we’ve taken some significant steps already. But we’ve all acknowledged that more steps need to be taken and more steps will be taken. We will consider any reasonable suggestions for those additional steps,” he said.“[Frydenberg], like a lot of Australians, is mourning and is grieving. And we will take suggestions from him or from other members of the community very seriously.”Albanese on Wednesday condemned the alleged “terrorist ideology” behind the attack, criticising “this perversion of Islam that leads them to support Islamic State”.“It is indeed, as you identify, hard to legislate against such massive hatred,” he told a press conference.In an address to a multifaith memorial in Sydney on Wednesday night, Albanese repeated his description of the attack as “pure evil” but said it could “never overcome the courage, decency, compassion and kindness of Australians that is central to the character of who we are”.Albanese again emphasised the need for gun reforms and moving faster to respond to Segal’s report. The government has not said which parts of her recommendations it would endorse or reject, but the Coalition is calling for its implementation in full.Littleproud and other Coalition members have rejected or questioned the need for gun reform measures, urging instead a focus on antisemitism, while some in the opposition are also urging tighter rules on migration.“Well, the current gun laws were not the problem. It was the people who were using the guns and using the bombs,” Littleproud told the ABC.Michael McCormack, the former Nationals leader, told Sky News: “I don’t think the firearms laws need changing.”However, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said the Coalition would examine any proposals, conceding there were “issues to be addressed” while downplayingnational cabinet’s gun reform blueprintas a “plan for a plan”.“We cannot let gun control be an excuse for the issue here … because if you have Jewish hatred in your heart, you will find an instrument of terror,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackJosh FrydenbergAnthony AlbaneseSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

The loopholes allow carmakers to sell more hybrids, which are more profitable for them, amid fierce competition from rivals, including from China.Referring to the changes to the rules introduced in the spring, McDonald said: “We’ve got to be responsible to the industry, and we’ve also got to be responsive to where the market is as well.”The government spokesperson said: “We have not brought forward the ZEV Mandate review. As previously committed, we will publish the review in early 2027 which means preparatory work will begin next year so stakeholders can be properly engaged.“Zero-emission vehicles are good for family finances and good for the environment – saving typical drivers as much as £1,500 a year on fuel and the transition to EVs is crucial to delivering jobs and growth, improved air quality, energy security, as well as quieter cleaner towns and cities.”McDonald was speaking as he visited Nissan’s factory in Sunderland, where the Japanese carmaker hasbegun production of its latest electric car.The launch of the third-generation Leaf, which was the first mass-market battery electric car to be built in the UK, is seen as a crucial step in the British car industry’s move away from petrol and diesel.Nissan has already produced more than 280,000 Leaf models at the plant in north-east England, which is Britain’s largest car factory.Electric car sales have increased rapidly in recent years. They represented more than a fifth of the UK market in July.However, carmakers previously overestimated demand for EVs, meaning they have had to lower their prices to attract buyers.Ministers said they would not weaken plans to ban the sale of new petrol or diesel cars from 2035, after theEU announcedplans to water down the timing of the phaseout of new combustion engine vehicles.The EU confirmed on Tuesday it would no longer require carmakers to ensure that 100% of cars and vans produced had zero emissions from 2035.After heavy pressure from the car industry and leaders of several EU member states including Germany and Italy, the European Commission has promised to reduce this requirement to 90%. This will allow 10% of production after 2035 to be plug-in hybrid electric cars, or even pure combustion engine vehicles.In a trade-off with industry, carmakers will have to compensate with other green measures on the factory floor, including the use of green steel made in Europe or use of biofuels in non-electric vehicles.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsManufacturing sectorEuropeEuropean UnionGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Belgium has voiced concerns about the legality of the scheme and says it will only agree if it has guarantees Euroclear will be reimbursed in full if Russia successfully sues for its money.Russia has publicly warned that utilising the assets would amount to theft and its central bank said it is seeking $230bn in damages from Euroclear in a case brought in the country’s courts. But it is understood the intimidation campaign has been focused on key individuals.Threats have been directed at Valérie Urbain, the chief executive of Euroclear, and other senior executives at the financial services group.View image in fullscreenRussia’s central bank (pictured) said it was seeking $230bn (£170bn) in damages from Euroclear.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesEuroclear declined to comment: “Any potential threats are treated with the utmost priority and investigated deeply, often with the support of authorities as appropriate.”An investigation earlier this month by the news site EUobserverreferenced threats made to Urbainin 2024 and 2025, and that she asked for Belgian police protection. This was denied and she and other companies executives then hired first a Belgian, then a French security firm to provide bodyguards, according to the report.A profile interview of Urbain by Le Monde in November reported that she had beenaccompanied by a bodyguard for more than a year, though she did not comment directly on her security.In early December, Bart De Wever, Belgium’s prime minister, said in an onstage interview withLa Libre newspaper: “And who believes that Putin will calmly accept the confiscation of Russian assets? Moscow has let us know that in the event of a seizure, Belgium and I personally will feel the effects for eternity.”Asked to explain these comments earlier this month, the prime minister’s office referred to previous remarks made by De Wever, describing the legal and financial risks facing western companies.At a press conference in October, De Wever had said: “Moscow has told us that if we touch the money, we would feel the consequences until eternity,” and went on to evoke Russian countermeasures, including confiscation of western money frozen in Russian banks, seizure of western companies and similar decisions from Moscow-friendly jurisdictions.The spokesperson on Wednesday declined to comment on the reported threats against Belgian government ministers or the head of Euroclear, citing safety reasons.A spokesperson for Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, who is also deputy prime minister and has been involved in talks on the reparations loan, said they had “no such information” about threats to him.The UK, which is believed to hold €27bn of Russia’s frozen assets, supports the move to use immobilised funds for Ukraine. Belgium has also been insisting that other countries holding Russian assets, estimated to be worth €290bn worldwide, take similar actions to show solidarity and reduce the legal risk.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, told the businessman Roman Abramovich to release £2.5bn of proceeds from the sale of Chelsea football club in 2022 within 90 days or face legal action. Britain wants all the money to be given to Ukrainian war victims, but the billionaire has said he also wants Russian victims to benefit.Ukrainian officials and experts acknowledge the EU loan is central to maintaining the country’s war effort for the next couple of years. Nataliia Shapoval, the head of the KSE Institute, a Kyiv based economic thinktank, said Ukraine required $50bn in external financing in 2026, but only half of which had already been committed.The economist described the need for fresh international financing as “absolutely critical”. In particular, Ukraine’s defence ministry needed predictable flows of cash to ensure that it could buy weapons at the rates needed and so its armaments industry could make capital investments for the future.Though Ukraine could get through the first quarter of the year without the additional support from the EU, “big problems would arise from quarter two and even more in the second half of the year”, with Kyiv likely forced to cut defence budgets and make difficult trade-offs with social expenditure.Ukrainian officials hope that an EU funding deal could put Russia under medium-term financial pressure. Next year, 38% of Russia’s state budget will go on funding its military, while it is expected to end this year with a budget gap of about $70bn (£52bn), according to Shapoval.Explore more on these topicsRussiaBelgiumUkraineEspionageEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The previous night, feminist campaigners had disrupted the show, shouting: “Abittan, rapist!”Macron, 72, asked Abittan how he was feeling. When he said he was feeling scared, she referred to the protesters as “sales connes”(stupid bitches) and said if they reappeared “we’ll toss them out”.Juliette Chapelle, a lawyer for the feminist groups who brought the case, toldFranceInter radio: “She’s France’s first lady, her words matter.”Chapelle said Macron had appeared to be “very engaged in causes for women, but in reality we can say there’s a disconnect between her public speeches and what she really thinks”.Magistrates terminated the investigation of the 2021 rape allegation against Abittan in 2024 due to a lack of evidence to bring it to trial. That decision was confirmed on appeal in January this year.The feminist campaign group who took part in the theatre protest, Nous Toutes (All of Us), said its activists had disrupted Abittan’s show to protest against what it described as “the culture of impunity” around sexual violence in France.“I am sorry if I hurt women victims,” Macron told the media outlet Brut this week, calling the remarks that were caught on video “private” comments.But, she added: “I can’t regret them. True, I am the wife of the president of the republic, but I am above all myself. And so when I am in private, I can let myself go in a way that is not totally proper.”The feminist groups who brought the legal complaint include Les Tricoteuses Hystériques (The Hysterical Knitters), which was founded in 2024 at the time of France’s biggest rape trial in which dozens of men wereconvicted of raping Gisèle Pelicot, who had been drugged by her ex-husband.A defence lawyer in that case called the women outside “hysterical” and “tricoteuses” – likening them to the women who watched and knitted as the guillotine fell during the French Revolution.The number of 343 complainants references a1971 petition for the legalisation of abortionin which 343 women said they had terminated pregnancies.Several celebrities have voiced support for the feminist campaigners insulted by Macron by adopting the insultwith the hashtag #salesconnes.The actor and directorJudith Godrèche, a leading voice in France’s #MeToo movement who has filed complaints accusing two film directors of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager, posted on social media: “Me too – I’m also a salle conne (dirty, stupid bitch) and I support all the others.”Explore more on these topicsFranceBrigitte MacronEuropeFeminismnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKatherine Butler, associate editor, EuropeWed 17 Dec 2025 11.15 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 11.16 ESTShareDonald Trump may rage about Europe being a multicultural hell facing “civilisational” collapse. As a proud real estate guy, however, he must be impressed by one feature of European life: the house prices, and the extent to which even progressive governmentshave abandoned housingto the markets.Since 2010, average sale prices in the EU have surged by close to 60%. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, house prices have doubled in a decade. Rents, meanwhile, have increased by almost 30% on averagein the last 15 years. The rent average masks dramatic spikes experienced in some countries: 208% in Estonia, 177% in Lithuania, 108% in Ireland and 107% in Hungary. If property has been a lucrative bet for wealthy investors, the cost of a home is a financial ordeal for millions of people whose incomes have been outpaced.Younger Europeans are bearing the brunt, with many barely able to rent independently or with any security, let alone afford a mortgage, even when they are in work. New research by the EU agency Eurofound (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions) reported extraordinary levels of housing precarity:30% of 25- to 34-year-olds in the EU live with their parents. (In Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Poland, the rate is almost 50%).Young Europeans spend almost one-third of their income on housing.Rents have inflated so much in Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Bulgaria that a worker between 18 and 34 has to spend more than 80% of their wage on a two-room flat.No wonder Jaume Collboni, the mayor of Barcelona, says housing poses a threat to the EUas big as Russia. The price of a home in his city has risen by almost 70% in the past decade.A range of factors is driving the affordability crisis, including a post-pandemic surge in construction costs. But the biggest structural issue, say experts, is “financialisation” – where homes are treated as a market asset whose value is expected to keep rising to generate profits for investors, rather than a basic human right. In a shift dating back to the 1980s, many European governments have disengaged from direct social housing provision. Home ownership has slumped, even in countries where it used to be an ingrained part of the culture.The resulting crisis is not just a downer for young people still sharing a kitchen with their “full nester”parents– it is an economic drag. Employers can’t attract workers to the fastest-growing cities because this is where housing prices have escalated most.Essential workers are being priced out, undermining public services. Ireland has had to recruit thousands of healthcare workers whose jobs often require them to be close to hospitals. “We are now completely dependent on non-EU workers in our [healthcare] professions,” Phil Ní Sheaghdha, president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, told a Eurofound conference in Dublin last month. “What we don’t tell them is that when they get here, they will have no place to live, or if they do, that 70% of their wages, if they are working as a nurse, is going to be spent on rent.”Housing inequality is, in some countries,feeding the successof far-right parties that peddle a narrative of zero-sum competition between migrants and locals for scarce resources. In that sense, housing has become Europe’spolitical timebomb, say experts.However, that risk of even more voters being drawn to the extremes is finally stirring action from the EU. On Tuesday, the European Commissionunveiled its first-ever affordable housing strategy, which gives governments more leeway to subsidise affordable housing. Current rules, for example, have blocked authorities in the Netherlands from helping low-income households with housing. These are “the missing middle”, who are not poor enough to qualify for social housing yet can’t afford to buyorrent.The new EU strategy takes aim too at short-term rentals, with new EU legislation expected to be framed by the end of 2026. This could allow local authorities in areas of “housing stress” to limit rentals.The demand from Collboni and other mayors for €300bn a year in extraordinary Covid-style joint EU funds to construct affordable housing has not been taken up. Nor is there any radical move against speculation.European governments have the real power at national level. They are under mounting pressure to disrupt the “asset” model and reinvest directly in social housing on a scale not seen since after the second world war, and extend eligibility beyond just the poorest groups. The fact that the EU is stepping in shows at least an awareness of what is at stake.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeHousingCommunitiesRenting propertyYoung peoplenewslettersShareReuse this content"

Their miraculous spots do not indicate poison, as people sometimes assume, but are thought to be used as a mode of communication, according to Rajkumar K P, a Zoological Society of London fellow and researcher.In early 2020, he found seven members of the “magical” species inthe Western Ghats rainforestin India, but could not visit them during the Covid pandemic. When he went back later, the frogs had disappeared, according to a report from the ZSL.View image in fullscreenPhotographers are accused of breaking the logs that were home to the frogs.Photograph: Rajkumar K P/Zoological Society of London“The big beautiful fallen log that was there was completely broken and misplaced,” Rajkumar said. The vegetation was also trampled, and the frogs, whose homes had been destroyed, were nowhere to be found.At first he suspected brown mongooses of causing the damage, but they are not strong enough to overturn a log. Then he asked his tracker if he had seen anyone.“He mentioned there were a couple of photographers visiting that location. Several small groups. So later I contacted my other trackers, and they started telling me everything that had happened.”These nature photographers had been turning over logs in their search for the endangered species, according to the trackers. When they found them, they would capture and prop up the frogs for photos. But they didn’t wear gloves, even though these delicate creatures breathe through their skin and are incredibly sensitive.One tracker told Rajkumar that two small galaxy frogs had died after being handled for too long by photographers.“He said they would take the animal to some nice background or mossy log to take the photograph, relocating it from one place to another to get better photos. On that day they got five or six frogs and two of them died.”View image in fullscreenThe spots on the frogs’ skin are thought to be a mode of communication.Photograph: Rajkumar K P/Zoological Society of LondonSearching again and again at the site in the following months, Rajkumar could not find any more galaxy frogs. He felt “helpless” in the face of the injustice.“The forest department officers try to prevent these kinds of groups coming. But they use higher officials – politicians, high court judges, or something like that – to allow them to take photographs,” he said.“I fell in love with these frogs after seeing them. You feel like they’re jet black in colour, but when you put them under light you can find all the stars – like galaxies on their bodies. It’s just magical.”Dr Benjamin Tapley, ZSL’s curator of reptiles and amphibians, said the galaxy frogs are likely an “ancient”, “irreplaceable” branch on the tree of life.“I grimace every time I see a photo come up on my feed of a galaxy frog,” said Tapley. “I just wonder what happened? How was that taken? How was the habitat impacted?“We’re really hopeful that we can encourage people to act more ethically so that incredible species like the galaxy frog can continue to thrive for millions more years.”Explore more on these topicsAmphibiansIndiaSouth and central AsiaAnimalsZoologynewsShareReuse this content"

Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive.‘We are reclaiming that light’: Hanukah celebrations tinged with sadness at Heaton Park synagogueRead more“We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as ‘globalise the intifada’ and those using them at future protests or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action.“Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed – words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.“Frontline officers will be briefed on this enhanced approach. We will also use powers under the Public Order Act, including conditions around London synagogues during services.”The police chiefs added: “It is possible to protest in support of Palestinian people without intimidating Jewish communities or breaking the law.”The biggest protest marches have been organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC). Its director, Ben Jamal, condemned the police plan as “political repression of protest for Palestinian rights” and said uttering the word “intifada” was not a call for violence.The Met in particular has been criticised for being too lax with protests, and also for being too severe.The CPS, which prosecutes cases in England and Wales, was unable to say whether the new approach would hold water in the courts.The Guardian understands Met chiefs believe they are taking undue criticism because footage from protests has shown chants that some object to, but officers have not taken action as they believe there is no prospect of conviction.One person with knowledge of discussions said: “We get all the flak for it. The community only see the inaction. It’s not realistic we change nothing and keep plugging on with the same approach.”Intifada literally means uprising or resistance, and is the term used by Palestinians for uprisings against Israel. The first intifada started in 1987, the second in 2000. For Palestinians it means resistance against oppression, but some Israelis – arguably a majority – associate it with violence, including suicide attacks.Jewish groups say chants of intifada on British streets are seen as a call for new violence against those of their faith. Ultimately, it may be for magistrates and juries to decide what was meant and what the criminal offence was, if any.The leading group working for the safety of Jewish people in Britain, the Community Security Trust, welcomed the move: “This announcement comes not a moment too soon. In particular, given the wave of terrorism against Jews around the world, it is intolerable that a call for a global ‘intifada’ should be allowed on our streets.“We welcome the news that this behaviour will now be met with arrests. This is a necessary and important first step to turning back this tide of violent incitement and we hope that police across the country, and the CPS, will follow suit.”However, Campaign Against Antisemitism’s chief executive Gideon Falter said: “After two years of repeatedly excusing calls to ‘globalise the intifada’, police chiefs are only now waking up to the fact that people who call for death to Jews like this should be locked away. But banning this one chant is a useless token measure … Unless the marches are banned altogether, it is hard to see how they will possibly enforce this ban.“There is a great deal of catching up for police chiefs to do if we are going to restore law and order in this country. We pray that more Jews don’t need to die on their watch before they do.”Jamal of the PSC said: “The implication that slogans used to support the liberation of the Palestinian people are only open to interpretation by groups who have maintained complicit support for Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people and denial of their rights is deeply problematic.“It is worth noting that many of the groups who have been pressing for such action have urged the police to consider even the chant ‘Free, free Palestine’ to be a call for genocidal slaughter of Jewish people.“We have also seen organisations like the Board of Deputies [of British Jews] make the claim that calling for a boycott of Israel in protest at its violations of international law and Palestinian rights is inherently antisemitic.”He added: “The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia, should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country.“We need to condemn all racist violence – that directed against Jewish people gathering to celebrate their faith and culture on a beach, and the systemised racist violence of apartheid and genocide that Israel employs against Palestinians. You are not an anti-racist unless you stand fully against both.”Lionel Idan, the CPS’s hate crime lead, said the service was working closely with police and communities to “identify, charge and prosecute antisemitic hate crimes and we will always look at ways we can do more”.The CPS statement made no mention of the term “globalise the intifada” being banned, and Idan said: “We carefully consider each antisemitic hate crime case referred to us for charging decision or early advice to see whether it can be taken to court.“Some offences can be context specific and where the evidence is not sufficient, we will work with police to identify what more can be done to meet the threshold for charging.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceProtestIsrael-Gaza warGreater ManchesterMetropolitan policeLondonManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

The Green party peer Jenny Jones later joined the protesters outside the jail warning that Zuhrah’s condition could be life-threatening.An ambulance eventually arrived to take her to hospital on Wednesday afternoon.Prisoners for Palestine said Zuhrah had reported severe chest pain, breathlessness and abdominal and lower back pain.It claimed her vital signs had been taken only intermittently and she had received inadequate electrolytes since returning from hospital on Friday, due to HMP Bronzefield reportedly running out of electrolytes.According toa letter sent by lawyers for the hunger strikers, the previous hospitalisation came after Zuhrah spent a night begging for an ambulance, having collapsed and drifted in and out of consciousness.She is one of two prisoners, along with Amy Gardiner-Gibson, also at Bronzefield, who have been refusing food for 46 days – the same amount of time as Martin Hurson when he became the sixth of 10IRA hunger strikersto die in 1982.The other prisoners taking part are Heba Muraisi (day 44), Teuta Hoxha (day 38), Kamran Ahmed (day 37) and Lewie Chiaramello (day 12), who has diabetes.All are being held for alleged involvement in Palestine Action protests and will have spent well over a year in jail –the pre-trial custody time limit is six months– before being tried. Their demands include immediate bail, endingthe ban on Palestine Actionand stopping restrictions on their communications.On Wednesday, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions whether he would meet representatives of the hunger strikers. Starmer declined, echoing the response of the justice minister Jake Richards when Corbyn asked him the same question 24 hours earlier.An HMP Bronzefield spokesperson said they could not provide information about specific individuals, but added: “Any prisoner refusing food receives regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, as well as being offered mental health support.”The spokesperson said prisoners were managed in line with policies and procedures governing the entire UK prison estate, including assessment of individual risks and security status, and that they could raise specific complaints directly with the prison.Central and North West London NHS foundation trust, which is responsible for commissioning healthcare within the prison, referred the Guardian to the Ministry of Justice.An MoJ spokesperson said: “Prisoners’ wellbeing is continually assessed, and appropriate action is taken, including hospital treatment where required.“His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has assured ministers that all cases of prisoner food refusal are being managed in accordance with the relevant policy, and with appropriate medical assessment and support – consistent with prisoner rights.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.Our teenage son was targeted by a sextortionist online – here’s what we didRead moreSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, whereMetaPlatforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”The lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.It states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.How can parents protect their children from sextortion?Read moreAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.The suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.It also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.Whilefour British parents are suing TikTokfor the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.Cases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.Earlier this year,the Guardian reportedthat children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.The Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.View image in fullscreenMurray Dowey took his own life in December 2023.Photograph: UNPIXS/BBCReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”As well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.Ros said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”Mark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”Instagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.Meta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.In June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.A spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they sign up for Instagram, which means they have to approve any new followers.“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”In the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Something has to move.She added: “Acas has confirmed they are ready and willing to help, but they can only act when both parties agree to take part. We call on the BMA and government to make that agreement now.”It remains uncertain if Acas will become involved. The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it had not received any proposal from Acas to act as an arbitrator, contradicting Rowan’s initial statement.“There has been no offer from Acas regarding the BMA’s dispute with government. All our focus is on mitigating the impact of strike action on patients and staff,” a spokesperson said.The BMA also appears unlikely to take up Acas’s offer. Dr Jack Fletcher, the chair of its resident doctors committee, tweeted that: “[Neither] I, nor any of the resident doctor negotiating team, have spoken to Acas.“We are aware of mediation services like Acas but at this stage we do not believe mediation is a route we need to consider.”The resident doctors’ legal mandate to strike expires on 6 January. The BMA has already opened a new ballot of its 55,000 resident doctor members which, if enough vote in favour, would allow them to undertake a fresh series of strikes for six months, likely starting in February or March.Thousands of resident – formerly junior – doctors began their latest strike at 7am on Wednesday and will continue until 7am on Monday next week.Speaking at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons, Keir Starmer denounced the strike as “dangerous and utterly irresponsible” given theNHSwas already battling a wave of flu that had hospitalised more people for the time of year than ever before.Fletcher said that resident doctors felt they had to withdraw their labour because ministers had not done enough to meet their demands on pay and training places.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsHealthHospitalsTrade unionsIndustrial actionNHSEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Emergency services were called to Lime Close shortly before 6.10pm.The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared at Bristol magistrates court on Wednesday charged with her murder. During a brief hearing, he spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.He was remanded into youth detention accommodation before a hearing at Bristol crown court on Friday.The boy was arrested in nearby Worle a short time after the girl was found in Lime Close.On Wednesday, Supt Jen Appleford said: “This remains an incredibly difficult time for Aria’s family, who we continue to support and update around our investigation. It is impossible to adequately describe how traumatic the past 36 hours have been for them and we’d like to reiterate in the strongest possible terms their request for privacy.“The tragic loss of such a young girl has caused a huge amount of shock and upset, with there being a profound sense of loss felt throughout the community. We are working closely with partner agencies and schools across the Weston area to make sure those affected receive access to any support they need.“We are grateful to local residents for the patience shown while we have been carrying out inquiries in the area. This work will need to continue over the next few days, but if anyone has any issues then please do not hesitate to speak to officers on the cordon, who will be happy to help.”Simon Marriott, the chief executive of the Kaleidoscope multi-academy trust, said: “Our school and trust community are devastated and upset by the news of the tragic death of one of our pupils, Aria Thorpe.“We are working with professional agencies to ensure that support is provided to our children, staff and families as they come to terms with what has happened. Our thoughts are with Aria’s family at this very difficult time.”Catherine Gibbons, the deputy leader of North Somerset council, said: “I have been shocked and deeply saddened by the news of Aria’s death. On behalf of everyone at North Somerset council, I offer our sincerest condolences to Aria’s family, friends and the school community.“The pain of losing a child in such tragic circumstances is unimaginable. We are working closely with partner agencies, including schools across the Weston-super-Mare area, to make sure those affected have access to the support and advice they need.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Citing eight people briefed on his account, the outlet said Bongino would not be returning to the bureau’s headquarters this month.Those individuals also told MS Now that Bongino, the No 2 official at the FBI under Patel, considered announcing his departure on Friday. Bongino did not confirm his plans to the outlet, but said: “Print whatever you’d like. No one believes you anyway. Thanks.”Bongino, also a former NYPD officer, has hosted several shows in his career, including guest-host stints on The Sean Hannity Show and The Mark Levin Show. He later launched the Bongino Report and The Dan Bongino Show.In May, Bongino cried during anappearanceon Fox News where he complained about the sacrifices he made to take up his role as FBI deputy director.“I gave up everything for this. I mean, you know, my wife is struggling … I stare at these four walls all day in DC, you know, by myself, divorced from my wife. Not divorced, but I mean, separated. And it’s hard,” he said.In 2018, Bongino, who has frequently perpetuated conspiracy theories of a so-called deep-state plot against Trump, said: “My entire life right now is about owning the libs.”He has also called for Barack Obama to“be locked up”; Hillary Clinton“a freaking criminal”;and argued that California senator Adam Schiff“should be in prsion”.Earlier this month, Bongino tried to walk back from conspiracy theories of the FBI being allegedly complicit in planting pipe bombs near the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee prior to the January 6 riots in 2021.Before becoming FBI deputy director, Bongino hadclaimed,without evidence, that the FBI “knew” the identity of the bomber and that the bombs were planted to “create narrative that crazy Maga people are trying to assassinate Kamala Harris”.However, upon being asked about his previous claims by Fox News host Sean Hannity, Bonginosaid:“I was paid in the past for my opinions, that’s clear, and one day I’ll be back in that space, but that’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts.”He went on to say: “We’re going to be guided by the facts as this thing goes forward.”The FBI declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFBITrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

To the east, the Eaton fire devastated the neighborhood of Altadena, with 19 confirmed deaths. More than9,400 structureswere destroyed across Altadena and neighboring Pasadena and Sierra Madre.The findings, which were released in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, are part ofa research projecton the short- and long-term impact of the fires on human health.Cedars-Sinai medical center is located approximately 10 and 20 miles from the epicenters of the Palisades and Eaton fires, respectively.“What we saw during the wildfires was an excess of respiratory illness showing up in our ER that matched the worst years of Covid,” Cheng said. “And that was striking.”While some increased respiratory illness was expected due to the effects of wildfire smoke,Cheng said she was surprised not only by the percentage of increase, but also by the jump in heart attack incidences and blood test abnormalities.“For a very large number of people, the January wildfire exposures led to a biochemical or metabolic stress on the body that likely affected, not just one, but multiple organ systems,” she said.The blood test data came from patients who reported physical symptoms that did not have a clear diagnosis, such as dizziness without clear signs of dehydration or chest pains without other signs of a heart attack. Cheng noted that the patients’ blood tests revealed subtle abnormalities.“The blood tests could show their electrolytes were a little bit off, like sodium, potassium, or there’s a slight imbalance in their protein levels,” she said. “Or there’s a slight change in markers of kidney and liver function.”The Palisades and Eaton fires were particularly harmful to human health due to their classification as a “wildland-urban interface fire (WUI)”. This type of fire spreads more easily than a wildfire-only or urban-only fire, burning a combination of organic materials and industrial fuels, such as plastic, batteries, and electronics.While the data collected by Chang and her colleagues is a start, there are still many questions left to be answered on the long-term effects of January’s fires on human health. “There’s a lot of work to do,” she said. “We’re still working hard to put the pieces together.”This story was amended on 17 December 2025 to correct a misprint in the journal study. The was a 118% increase in blood-test abnormalities after the January wildfires.Explore more on these topicsUS newsLos AngelesWest CoastWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

The inside story of the battle for Warner BrosRead moreWBDagreed to sellits storied movie studios, HBO cable network and streaming service to Netflix in a $82.7bn deal earlier this month, setting the stage for a seismic shift in Hollywood’s industrial landscape.But Paramount, which had privately bid for WBD before the Netflix deal was unveiled, swiftly countered with anall-cash offerand vowed to take it directly to shareholders. Unlike Netflix, Paramount – which is controlled by the billionaire Ellison family – bid for the entire company, which also includes the CNN news network.In a blunt letter to shareholders on Wednesday morning, WBD accused Paramount of having “consistently misled” investors by claiming its bid has a “full backstop” – a safety net to ensure it has sufficient funds – from the Ellisons.Paramount later reaffirmed its offer, saying that it had lined up “all necessary financing” to support a bid that it claimed offers “superior value and a faster, more certain path” to the Netflix deal.“Following a careful evaluation of Paramount’s recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer’s value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,” Samuel A Di Piazza Jr, chair of WBD’s board, said in a statement. “This offer once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated to Paramount throughout our extensive engagement and review of their six previous proposals.“We are confident that our merger with Netflix represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders and we look forward to delivering on the compelling benefits of our combination.”David Ellison, chair and chief executive of Paramount, said: “We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader.“I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries.”One media analyst likened the saga to a “real-life, far more consequential”episode of the HBO drama Succession. “If you think you know how this plot ends, think again,” said Mike Proulx, vice-president of research at Forrester.“WBD’s formal rejection of Paramount’s offer changes nothing,” he said. “The ultimate decision still rests with WBD’s shareholders and that vote is months away.What’s clear about Paramount’s bid are the growing eyebrow raises over its Middle Eastern financing. The same US officials and regulators who’vesounded alarms about China’s influence on TikTokshould be crying foul here.”Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive of Netflix, welcomed WBD’s response to Paramount. “The Warner Bros Discovery board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” he said in a statement to Reuters.“This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders, and the broader entertainment industry.”Netflix was already engaging with the justice department and European Commission, the company’s other co-chief executive, Greg Peters, told CNBC. He expressed confidence that the regulators would view the deal as “pro-consumer and pro-growth”.Questions were swiftly raised about how the Ellisons were funding their proposal, after a regulatory filing revealed it was backed by outside funders including Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund; and the Qatar Investment Authority.On Tuesday, it emerged Kushner’s Affinity Partners, a private equity firm, hadstepped back from the process.Di Piazza, the WBD chair, described the company’s decision to advise investors to reject Paramount as “not a hard choice” in an interview on Wednesday.“Netflix made a compelling offer – it was heavy in cash, certainty of close, a high termination fee, and they responded to the operating issues that we were concerned about,” Di Piazza told CNBC, the financial news network. “[Paramount] had every opportunity to deal with that broad range of issues, and they chose not to.”WBD accused Paramount of leaning on an “unknown and opaque revocable trust” to shore up its bid and tabling an “illusory” proposal that WBD shareholders should not rely on.In its letter to shareholders, WBD firmly denied that regulators were more likely to approve Paramount’s bid than its deal with Netflix, and warned of “significant additional costs” – including a $2.8bn termination fee to Netflix – if the Paramount offer was accepted.“None of these reasons will be a surprise to [Paramount] given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals,” WBD claimed in its letter to shareholders. “The terms of the Netflix merger are superior.”Trump has said he plans to be involved in deciding whether any deal will receive approval from regulators – and made clear that he views the future of CNN, which he has long criticized, as a key factor.“I think CNN should be sold, because I think the people that are running CNN right now are either corrupt or incompetent,” Trump said last week.Trump has also tried in recent days to distance himself from the Ellisons, using hislong-held grudgewith CBS – which is owned by Paramount – over its 60 Minutes show to reverse hisprevious warmth towards the family.“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” he wrotein a poston his Truth Social network earlier this week.Shares in WBD, which has a market value of approximately $71bn, fell 1% during early trading in New York on Monday.

Whistleblowers allege cost-cutting tactics have endangered the elderlyGeorge JosephWed 17 Dec 2025 12.50 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 12.52 ESTShareThree nursing home residents died because employees of the American healthcare giantUnitedHealth Grouphelped delay or deny them critical hospital care, two pending lawsuits and a complaint to state authorities have alleged.The three cases involve a UnitedHealth partnership initiative that places medical staff from the company’s direct care unit, Optum, inside nursing homes to care for residents insured by the company’s insurance arm.UnitedHealth says one of the initiative’s goals is to protect patients by reducingunnecessaryhospital admissions. Those are admissions the insurance giant would otherwise have to pay for.In Georgia, the family of a woman named Cindy Deal filed a lawsuitallegingthat the 58-year-old died because Optum and her nursing home failed to hospitalize her for hours after she started foaming at the mouth and appeared to be having a seizure.In Ohio, the family of a retiree named Mary Grant filed a lawsuitclaimingthat the 70-year-old died after Optum and Grant’s nursing home failed to send her to the hospital, though she had suffered a traumatic head injury and began vomiting.View image in fullscreenMary Grant’s daughter browses photographs of her mother on her phone.Photograph: Maddie McGarveyIn New York, a physician’s assistant named Christopher Bieniek alleged in a complaint to state authorities that a 63-year-old nursing home resident died due to “gross negligence” by an Optum employee. The employee refused to hospitalize the man, despite his kidney failure, according to text messages Bieniek says he shared with state investigators.Citing patient privacy rules and pending litigation, UnitedHealth’s public relations team did not directly respond to specific questions about the three cases, but said that many of the claims were unsubstantiated or based on incomplete or embellished information.The company haspreviouslydeniedthe Grant and Deal families’ claims in court, and attorneys representing UnitedHealth disputed some of Bieniek’s claims.“We remain confident in our transparency, our compliance and our steadfast commitment to patient-centered care,” the company said. “We will not legitimize a one-sided and misinformed narrative by further engaging with it. Our focus continues to be where it belongs: delivering high-quality care for our members and standing with the clinicians and care teams who devote themselves every day to improving patients’ lives.”The three cases highlight the dual role that UnitedHealth has taken on for thousands of nursing home residents across the country: medical insurer and provider of direct care.Like many American health insurers, UnitedHealth has expanded across the healthcare sector and no longer limits itself to simply paying or denying its members’ medical bills.In nursing homes, for example, the conglomerate deploys its ownarmyof nurse practitioners and physician assistants from its medical services arm, Optum, to care for seniors covered by its insurance arm, UnitedHealthcare. During the day, these medical professionals listen to heart sounds, decide on new diagnoses, and address dangerous complications for insured residents at their nursing homes. At night and on weekends, other Optum employees on hotlines weigh in on their care from afar.View image in fullscreenOptum headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA.Photograph: JHVEPhoto/AlamyUnitedHealth insures more than 55,000 long-term nursing home residents through what are known as institutional special needs plans (I-SNPs), which are funded through the federal government’s Medicare Advantage program. While other insurers also employ their own medical providers, UnitedHealth is by far the biggest player in theI-SNP market, covering almost as many residents as all of its rivals combined.UnitedHealth says this hands-on nursing home model provides an “extra layer of caring support” that helps reduce unnecessary hospital trips for long-term residents at more than 1,900 nursing homes in 29 states across the US. “United works with the nursing facility, primary care physicians, and specialists to deliver appropriate care for members in the most appropriate setting,” the company said in an email, noting that a nonprofit called the National Committee for Quality Assurance recently awarded its care model a 98.75% score.Hospitalizations, the company notes, can lead to serious issues for nursing home residents, such as delirium, falls and pressure injuries.They can also lead to major expenses for the insurance giant, a financial arrangement thatlawmakersand corporate whistleblowers have framed as a potential conflict of interest incentivizing the conglomerate to discourage necessary hospitalizations too.Under Medicare Advantage, the government pays insurers like UnitedHealthcare a set amount of money based on the expected healthcare needs of each senior enrolled in their insurance plans for long-term nursing home residents. The less insurers spend on residents’ care, the more they have left over in taxpayer funds for potential profit.In addition to the complaints from the families and the outside medical provider, UnitedHealth’s nursing home initiative has been the subject of at least four whistleblower complaints from former employees. The whistleblowers allege that employees from Optum, UnitedHealth’s direct care subsidiary, engaged in unethical tactics that sought to curb costly but critical hospital care, or violated federal rules meant to protect nursing home residents from predatory insurance sales tactics.Two of the whistleblowers, both former Optum nurse practitioners, filed declarations with Congress, alleging that company managers improperly pressured them to reduce hospital transfers for nursing home seniors, and to get residents onto medical directives, such as “Do-Not-Resuscitate” orders, that could pre-empt costly emergency room care. The declarations also allege that supervisors pushed them to creatively code patient diagnoses to increase federal payments for the company.UnitedHealth said it categorically rejected any suggestion that its employees engage in practices that endanger patient safety or violate ethical standards. It said that the suggestion that its employees prevented hospital transfers was false, and that its permission is not required for nursing home residents to go to the hospital.The company added that “the insinuation that the desire to decrease unnecessary hospitalizations is motivated solely by financial considerations ignores well established evidence of the harm unnecessary hospitalizations can cause.”Policy experts say reducing unnecessary hospitalizations is important to cutting wasteful expenditures and protecting frail nursing home residents, but caution that these efforts must allow medical providers to follow their genuine clinical judgments.“You don’t want to then overcorrect and basically align the incentives so that people are never sent to the hospital when they really need to go to the hospital for appropriate care,” said Gretchen Jacobson, vice-president of Medicare policy at the Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare research nonprofit.Medical researchers have found that a sizable portion of hospitalizations of nursing home residents may be unnecessary. Astudypublished in July in the medical journal JAMDA, for example, found that one-third of hospital admissions among thousands of “severely impaired” nursing home residents appeared to be “potentially avoidable hospitalizations”.But while there has been research on the benefits of avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations for nursing home residents, there has been less study on how such efforts may have “overcorrected” and “resulted in less access to care generally”, according to Jacobson.“We need to take a fresh look to make sure that programs like this are balancing the incentives correctly, and we don’t know if that balance is right,” she said.In June, UnitedHealth sued the Guardian alleging defamation for a previous story about UnitedHealth’s efforts to reduce hospitalizations among nursing home residents.The lawsuit from the healthcare giant, which brought in more than $400bn in revenue last year, was the latest in a series of aggressive tactics aimed at quieting its critics, the New York Timesreported.In the wake of the suit, the Guardian stood by its story, and continued its reporting process, which identified the three allegations of wrongful deaths.These allegations, as well as details from four whistleblower complaints about United Health’s I-SNP nursing home program, have never previously been made public by the press or government agencies.“We are disappointed the Guardian has continued a pattern of biased and misleading reporting that does not reflect the value of the I-SNP clinical model or the benefits we provide to our members,” UnitedHealth said in a statement. “The inaccuracies have been so persistent and harmful we have pursued legal action – an extraordinary step we take to protect the integrity of our work, our care teams and the people we serve.”After the Guardianpublished its first storyon UnitedHealth’s nursing home initiative, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren held abriefing with UnitedHealthabout its nursing home program and decided tolaunchan investigation seeking company documents.“Nursing home residents and their families should not live in fear of a for-profit health care company withholding care when it is most critical,” the senators wrote in a letter to the company.A whistleblower’s complaintWhen Maxwell Ollivant first started working as a nurse practitioner for UnitedHealth’s nursing home program, he believed in his company’s care model.View image in fullscreenMaxwell Ollivant.Photograph: George Joseph/The GuardianAs an employee of UnitedHealth’s direct care subsidiary, Optum, Ollivant’s job was to visit and check on dozens of seniors at three nursing homes in the suburbs of Tacoma, Washington. The goal: to identify medical complications early and address them, protecting residents from needless hospitalizations.Ollivant was excited to work in geriatric care. When he was young, his grandfather had supported him after the shock of his parents’ divorce. Now he would be able to care for seniors like him.Less than a year into the new job, however, the nurse practitioner, a committed Christian, started to have concerns that his company was going too far, inserting itself into nursing home emergencies and effectively delaying or discouraging necessary hospitalizations, according to the lawsuit and congressional declaration he later filed.When Ollivant visited his assigned nursing homes, he saw images with large red STOP signs in his patients’ charts, according to the declaration Ollivant filed in May with Congress as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Washington state attorney general. The signs instructed nursing home staff to call UnitedHealth’s Optum unit first, rather than their independent primary care doctors, when a patient’s condition worsened, the declaration said.If a nursing home did send a patient to the hospital without first contacting Optum and following various protocols, Ollivant and his colleagues “were instructed to chastise the nursing facility staff”, the declaration said.Such scrutiny could even follow a hospitalization for an emergency situation, as one Optum email stemming from Ollivant’s litigation indicates.In that case, nursing home staff sent a resident to the hospital because she was found drooling, unresponsive and with a “slant to the side”, the email said.Thesymptomspointed to a possible stroke, an emergency that requires rapid treatment, and the woman was subsequently admitted to a hospital’s intensive care unit for “intrabrain bleeding”, alife-threateningtype of stroke, according to the email.But after the transfer, Ollivant’s manager emailed her team that the nursing home had sidestepped the company’s protocol, failing to take the time to first call a hotline operated by Optum’s off-site medical staffers.“This is by pass,” the manager wrote, referring to Optum’s term for when nursing home staff skipped over its intermediary clinicians to hospitalize a resident. “Nursing did not call Optum on call.”The manager then met with the nursing home’s director of nursing services and scheduled an in-service training to re-educate the facility’s nurses, the email shows.UnitedHealth did not directly respond to questions about this email.Four months later, Ollivant went to UnitedHealth’s HR team with concerns about his company’s response to another emergency, involving a patient of his, public records from the Washington state attorney general show.One Sunday earlier in September, the 66-year-old nursing home resident had been found with potential stroke symptoms, but his transfer to a hospital was delayed after his nursing home contacted UnitedHealth’s on-call hotline, instead of an independent doctor, according to Ollivant’s lawsuit, which referred to the man by his initials, “M.T.”For Ollivant, the incident showed the danger of Optum’s involvement in emergency cases, according to the congressional declaration he later filed.In its defamation suit and in statements to the Guardian, UnitedHealth maintained that it repeatedly pushed for M.T.’s transfer and faulted its nursing home partner for failing to hospitalize the retiree earlier.Days after Ollivant reported his concerns about M.T. to UnitedHealth’s HR department, the company began investigating the nurse practitioner himself, records released by the company to the Guardian show. It concluded that Ollivant had failed to properly care for M.T. during a second incident which the nurse practitioner had also complained about, according to the company records.Ollivant submitted his resignation that February – just over three weeks after he filed his internal complaint.The nurse practitioner later sued UnitedHealth, then voluntarily dismissed his suit after the US Department of Justice declined to intervene in the case. In early May, with the assistance of the legal advocacy organization Whistleblower Aid, Ollivant submitted his declaration to state and federal authorities expanding on his previous claims.In a statement, UnitedHealth said that Ollivant was “not in a position to assess the effectiveness of our programs”, claiming he “lacks both the necessary data and the expertise”.“Our position is supported by peer-reviewed studies and measurable outcomes,” the company said. “In contrast, the criticisms being raised are based on anecdotes.”Between July 2024 and June 2025, long-term nursing home members covered by UnitedHealth experienced 38,000 transfers to the ER and 16,000 hospital admissions, the company said. Of those admissions, it said, nearly half were ordered by skilled nursing facilities or primary care physicians without Optum’s involvement.UnitedHealth also said that the Department of Justice investigated the whistleblower claims, interviewing witnesses and obtaining thousands of documents that “demonstrated significant factual inaccuracies in the allegations”. UnitedHealth previously told the Guardian that the Department of Justice found the allegations to be “meritless” and “found no evidence of wrongdoing”.UnitedHealth did not respond to requests from the Guardian that it provide evidence for this claim.‘The goal is to treat in place’Mary Grant, the nursing home resident in Ohio, never made it to the hospital.View image in fullscreenPhotographs of Mary Grant in a family album.Photograph: Maddie McGarvey/The GuardianOne evening two years ago, when a nurse at her facility in Cleveland found the 70-year-old low on oxygen and covered in pinkish chunks of vomit, she called the care hotline operated by UnitedHealth’s Optum subsidiary, instead of an independent doctor, according to nursing notes and an Optum audio recording released through litigation.The day before, a nursing home employee had accidentally rammed a cart into Grant, knocking her out of her wheelchair, according to a lawsuit that her family filed in state court in Ohio and was later moved to federal court. Her head, protected only by strands of thin, gray hair, hit the concrete floor, leaving a bump on her forehead, patient records released through discovery and the lawsuit assert.Now Grant was experiencing nausea and vomiting –signsof potential bleeding inside her head, according to a doctor who later filed an affidavit as part of the lawsuit. To assess whether Grant was bleeding internally and needed surgery, she needed to go to a hospital and get a CT or MRI scan, the suit claimed.But the Optum hotline employee that the nursing home nurse called for instruction “did not order” Grant’s transfer to the hospital, according to the suit. After hearing about the fall and head bump from Grant’s daughter and Grant’s vomiting and low oxygen levels from the nurse, the Optum liaison determined that a transfer was not yet necessary, according to a UnitedHealth call log disclosed in response to the suit.“The goal is to treat in place,” a log from the Optum employee noted later that evening, using languagereflectingthe company’s efforts to curb unnecessary hospital transfers. “But if condition worsens, send to Soft Point [sic] hospital.”View image in fullscreenYalonda Phillips looks at a photo from her wedding day with her mother, Mary Grant.Photograph: Maddie McGarveyThe Optum employee told the nursing home to continually check Grant’s vital signs, order a chest X-ray at her facility, and give her medicine and oxygen, company logs and audio recordings released through discovery in the suit show.This plan of care that Optum coordinated with its nursing home partner failed to reckon with the possibility that Grant had suffered a traumatic head injury that was causing a growing pool of blood to compress the tissue in her brain, according to court filings by her family.The next day, nursing home stafffound the retiree dead in her room,according to nursing home notes released through litigation.In August, attorneys Michael Hill and Matthew Mooney filed a lawsuit on behalf of Grant’s family alleging that the off-site nurse practitioner for UnitedHealth’s Optum unit was not acting “as an independent and objective medical professional” on the company’s hotline, but instead as “an insurance adjuster” so that the healthcare giant could “preemptively deny Mary Grant necessary medical care”.In a court filing, UnitedHealth denied the Grant family’s allegations.UnitedHealth’s public relations team did not directly respond to questions about the Grant case, but said in a statement: “Where litigation is ongoing, we are limited in what we can share, but we contest inaccuracies and will vigorously defend ourselves.”Allegations of upcoding and changing medical orders toincrease federal dollarsThe other former Optum employee who filed a whistleblower declaration with Congress submitted it while still working at the company. Like Ollivant, the clinician – who has chosen to remain anonymous – said they were initially supportive of UnitedHealth’s nursing home initiative.Once on the job, however, the nurse practitioner discovered that their team was under pressure to reduce hospitalizations while inserting questionable diagnosis codes into patients’ charts in order to increase federal payouts to UnitedHealth, according to the declaration provided to state and federal agencies.“It felt so unprofessional and bizarre, based on other medical facilities I worked in, to have managers challenge well-established critical interventions in cut-and-dry cases,” the whistleblower wrote.Bonuses went to nurse practitioners who rarely transferred residents to the hospital and who mined colleagues’ charts for lucrative diagnosis codes they could use to bill the federal government, the nurse practitioner wrote.Staff went through training to learn how to deploy diagnosis codes for weak foot pulses and minor skin spotting, and would be re-educated by company coding specialists if their coding was deemed insufficient, the declaration alleges.“These changes in codes did not change the treatment plan, but they did generate higher Medicare Advantage payments for UnitedHealthcare,” according to the declaration.UnitedHealth did not directly respond to a question on the allegations about its employees coding patient diagnoses to increase federal dollars. But the company said in an email that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave UnitedHealth’s nursing home plan a 4.5 star rating.The declarations from the anonymous whistleblower and Ollivant also alleged that UnitedHealth’s Optum unit pushed to get nursing home residents to consider medical directives, such as “Do-Not- Resuscitate” and “Do-Not-Hospitalize” orders, which can limit access to life-saving interventions and pre-empt costly hospitalizations.UnitedHealth pointed out that advanced care planning has a positive impact on the quality of residents’ end of life care and said that the company tracks residents’ care preferences “to align the care provided with the patient’s health and care goals”.In the declaration, the anonymous whistleblower acknowledged that advanced care planning is “very necessary”. But Optum staff, the nurse practitioner wrote, sometimes convinced patients to agree to orders limiting their care through counseling that failed to make clear that some of their ailments may be reversible, and that patients with chronic conditions might still benefit from hospitalization for less serious complications.“This resulted in what seemed to be a de-escalation of care,” the whistleblower wrote, for patients “who desired to live longer without extraordinary measures but still sought treatment for manageable conditions”, such as heart failure, urinary tract infection, or acute kidney injury.In his declaration, Ollivant echoed these concerns, describing the conglomerate’s “push” for “Do-Not-Resuscitate” and “Do-Not-Hospitalize” orders as an “unconscionable measure” that sought to reduce UnitedHealth’s costs while increasing its profits.UnitedHealth denies these claims.The company said Optum clinicians are trained to have high quality conversations about advance care planning to allow members and families to make the most informed decisions possible. The company said that it has never encouraged or pushed a member to sign a “Do-Not-Hospitalize” or “Do-Not-Resuscitate” order.“Our health care providers are ethically bound to respect patient autonomy and support informed decision-making,” UnitedHealth said in an email.UnitedHealth’s June lawsuit criticized the Guardian’s previous reporting on allegations about its advanced care planning practices. Company whistleblowers, however, were not alone in questioning its discussions with patients and their families about such care directives.More concerns about UnitedHealth’s end-of-life planning pushIn August of 2023, Christopher Bieniek, a physician assistant working for an independent medical group in upstate New York, filed a complaint with state authorities alleging that “gross negligence and incompetence” by an Optum nurse practitioner working at a nursing home alongside him “resulted in the death” of a resident experiencing congestive heart failure and kidney failure.According to the complaint, the 63-year-old resident was complaining of dizziness and had very low blood pressure. But when Bieniek pushed for the resident to go to the hospital citing his kidney failure, the Optum employee simply responded “no”, according to text messages Bienek says he showed to investigators from New York’s office of professions, the state’s licensing authority.View image in fullscreenScreenshot of a text message that Christopher Bieniek said he showed to state authorities.Photograph: Christopher Bieniek“No? He has symptomatic hypotension with end organ dysfunction,” Bieniek replied on the text chain, noting that the man needed rapid IV fluid injections which he could not receive at the nursing home. The 63-year-old’s medical orders form “says to send to hospital when medically necessary”, Bieniek pointed out.Instead of helping to get the man to the hospital where he might have received costly but life-saving care, Bieniek alleged in his complaint, the Optum employee “talked the family into changing” his care goal to comfort care – an end-of-life approach – “despite the condition being readily treatable and probably reversible even at that late stage”.The nursing home resident died soon thereafter, according to Bieniek’s complaint, which specifically pointed to UnitedHealth’s financial stake in his patient’s care.“There is also significant conflict of interest at play as the patient in his decompensated state would have likely required hospitalization and higher cost of medical care which in working for the insurance company would conflict with their goals,” Bieniek wrote.The Optum employee, Bieniek continued, had on more than one occasion “talked a family into changing goals of care to palliation when the patient has an easily treatable and reversible condition such as an acute infection”.Bieniek said he was interviewed by state investigators, but never heard what happened to the case afterwards.Rachel Connors, a spokesperson for the New York State Education Department, which oversees the office of professions, declined to comment on the case, citing confidentiality requirements.The Optum employee did not respond to requests for comment.In response to questions about Bieniek’s complaint,Jered Edeand Thomas Clare, attorneys representing UnitedHealth, said that the Optum employee had been nominated for an excellent service award by the nursing home that year. The attorneys also said the resident’s family had asked for palliative care and that the Optum employee “did nothing except ensure the patient was cared for in the way the family wanted”.Dr Ferdinando Mirarchi, an expert onadvance care directives, told the Guardian that he was invited by a nursing home in Erie county, Pennsylvania, to review the medical orders of residents living there, including some covered by UnitedHealth.Between 2017 and 2018, Mirarchi interviewed over one hundred patients there, covered by multiple insurers, and found that some of their paperwork did not align with the care goals they described to him.When residents covered by UnitedHealth plans told him that they wanted fewer future medical interventions, the doctor helped them to amend their care orders and got no pushback, he recalled. But Mirarchi said that when he did the opposite – changing residents’ medical orders because residents “wanted to go to the hospital” or “wanted to be resuscitated” – UnitedHealth’s Optum team “got annoyed” and sometimes complained to nursing home administrators or families that he was meddling.View image in fullscreenDr Ferdinando Mirarchi.Photograph: Daniel Lozada/Photo by Daniel Lozada for The GuardianA few months into his review, Mirarchi said, tensions boiled over at a meeting in which he told Optum staffers that he didn’t want the company’s lower-level providers altering his orders after he had identified errors in patients’ files.“I’m a physician. I got a hell of a lot more training and experience than those they have assigned to come in there and have conversations with patients,” Mirarchi, who has authored more than a dozen medical journal articles on advance care planning, told the Guardian. “And they’re trying to tell me I’m doing wrong.”UnitedHealth said its training on discussing potential medical orders with patients comes from “gold-standard materials developed by the Harvard School of Public Health and Ariadne Labs, ensuring patients and families are supported through these decisions”.In a letter, attorneys representing UnitedHealth noted that more than half of the patients whose medical orders Mirarchi helped to correct voluntarily chose to de-escalate their care. The attorneys also pointed out to apast statementfrom Mirarchi that discussions about people’s end-of-life wishes should not be a “one-and-done” practice.Allegations about UnitedHealth sales practicesWhen Brook Gonite first started pitching UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage plans in nursing homes across Georgia, the salesman believed his team was in compliance with guidelines intended to protect vulnerable seniors, according to a federal whistleblower lawsuit he later filed.Gonite, an employee of UnitedHealth’s Optum unit, would sit in the common rooms of nursing homes with his colleagues, wait to be approached by residents or their families, and offer them contact authorization forms to sign, the lawsuit claims.But this approach, Gonite alleges in the suit, became impossible to maintain once a new manager took over his team and ratcheted up its monthly sales goals.View image in fullscreenBrook Gonite.Photograph: A former colleague of Gonite’sAt one early meeting, the lawsuit claims, the manager told subordinates that he didn’t care how they made their Medicare Advantage enrollment numbers “as long as you make me look good”.Gonite’s lawsuit alleges that his sales team violated multiple federal rules – cajoling nursing home staff to leak them seniors’ confidential medical records, cold-calling seniors without required contact authorization cards, and offering nursing home operators payments if they helped market the healthcare giant’s plans.Nursing homes that contracted with UnitedHealth could earn monthly fees for every new member that joined UnitedHealth’s long-term nursing home plan, giving them part of the company’s Medicare Advantage revenues,according toGonite’s suit. Nursing homes that helped the insurer reduce hospitalizations could get quarterly “premium dividend” bonuses, or other incentive payments that offered them a percentage of UnitedHealth’s savings on medical expenses, according to Gonite’s lawsuit, internal company documents and documents released through public records requests.At one meeting with a nursing home near Georgia’s border with South Carolina, Gonite’s manager told the facility’s staff they needed to get 40% of the home’s residents onto UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage plan if they wanted to move forward with the contract, the suit alleges. (The manager declined an interview request and did not respond to detailed requests for comment for this story.)Following the manager’s instructions, the nursing home’s director of clinical evaluations handed over lists with the names of all his residents – as well as their ages, Medicare ID numbers and other personal information – so that Gonite’s team could solicit seniors and their families, according to the lawsuit. At least 16 residents at the nursing home joined UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage plan, Gonite’s complaint alleges.In court filings, UnitedHealth has characterized Gonite as a “disgruntled, terminated employee” and denied that any of the company’s payments to nursing homes amounted to illegal kickbacks.In a statement, UnitedHealth denied that it imposed enrollment thresholds on nursing homes or offered financial incentives to nursing homes to enroll residents. Its payments, the company said, incentivize improvements in patient care quality and reimburse “member services”.UnitedHealth claimed that Gonite was fired for his own unethical conduct, claiming the company caught him falsifying enrollment materials and fraudulently enrolling residents at several nursing homes into its Medicare Advantage plans. All of this, a company spokesperson said, “was done without the company’s knowledge and in violation of company policy”.The UnitedHealth spokesperson said the company’s firing of Gonite was an example of its “decisive corrective action” when learning of “improper sales tactics”, and noted that the Department of Justice had declined to pursue Gonite’s allegations against the company.UnitedHealth’s defamation lawsuit accuses the Guardian of irresponsibly relying on Gonite and other “facially unreliable sources”.Tom Clarkson, Gonite’s attorney, declined to comment on UnitedHealth’s allegations against his client, but noted that the federal judge overseeing the lawsuit had allowed the case to proceed.In April, federal judge Marc Treadwell ruled that Gonite’s complaint “plausibly alleges” that UnitedHealth violated HIPPA, the federal law that protects the confidentiality of patients’ medical information, as well as federal rules aimed at protecting vulnerable nursing home residents from aggressive sales tactics.Alleged pressure to cut cornersIn court documents, UnitedHealth’s attorneys reject Gonite’s allegations and refer to his boss as a “purportedly rogue sales director”.But last year, Abbi Mathis, the other former Optum sales employee turned whistleblower, made similar allegations in a lawsuit filed in Iowa state court, claiming that her boss at Optum also used nursing home residents’ confidential medical records to solicit signups, and barged into one resident’s room without permission to try to sell them a Medicare Advantage plan.In another instance, Mathis alleges in her complaint, her boss tried to approach a nursing home resident, who was unable to speak and simply bobbed his head and smiled in response to his entreaties.Mathis believed the man had a traumatic brain injury and wasn’t capable of consenting to an enrollment with UnitedHealth, the suit claims. The suit alleges that when she objected to these tactics, her supervisor told her: “It’s not our job to decide whether someone is able to be self-responsible or not.”Mathis left the job after filing a human resources complaint about her boss, according to her lawsuit against Optum. She settled the lawsuit this year, according to court documents and her attorney.Asked for comment about the allegations, Mathis’s former boss said in a brief phone call that he did not “want to be involved”. He did not provide answers to specific questions the Guardian subsequently sent him about his former subordinate’s claims.A UnitedHealth spokesperson said it trains its sales agents on ethical practices and that when it learns of improper sales tactics, it takes decisive corrective action, including terminating employees for violating company policy.Attorneys representing UnitedHealth told the Guardian that Mathis’s claims “were never substantiated or corroborated”, but that the company terminated the supervisor “as soon as it corroborated other allegations that the supervisor may have violated marketing guidelines and company policy”.Two wrongful death lawsuitsIn 2022, the family of Cindy Deal, the Georgia nursing home resident, filed a suit alleging that UnitedHealth’s care subsidiary Optum and its nursing home partner failed to promptly hospitalize her after she suffered an apparent seizure and started foaming at the mouth one evening.Though Deal was unresponsive, her nursing home nurse consulted with an Optum nurse practitioner, who directed her to give Deal medicine, instead of ordering her to transfer Deal to the hospital, according to an affidavit filed by a medical expert who reviewed health records from the incident on behalf of her family.Deal continued to gasp and struggled to breathe and it took until 1.30am – nearly three hours after she was found foaming at the mouth – for the nursing home to receive an order to call 911, the affidavit alleges. According to an amended complaint filed by Deal’s family in November, the authorization for that ambulance call came from another Optum nurse practitioner starting her shift.Five minutes later, EMS responders found Deal laying in bed unconscious with pale skin, large open pupils and discolored lips, the affidavit states. Deal was pronounced dead shortly after she arrived at the hospital at 2.07am, according to the affidavit.Deal’s symptoms indicated she was “experiencing a potentially life ending medical emergency”, the expert, Dr Bruce Charash, wrote. “Based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability,” he wrote, Deal died from cardiopulmonary arrest because the nurse and nurse practitioners involved in her care “failed to appreciate the significance associated with Cindy Deal’s declining health and promptly request medical transport to a hospital”.Darren Penn, an attorney for Deal’s family, said he reviewed notes from an Optum nurse practitioner involved in the case, which were released through discovery in the lawsuit. In an interview with the Guardian citing the notes, Penn alleged that the Optum employee specifically told the nursing home hours before Deal’s death that it did not need to transfer her to the hospital.Deal’s nursing home initially denied the family’s claims in court, then settled the case last year for an undisclosed amount.Optum remains a defendant in the case. In court records, attorneys for Optum have denied the family’s allegations and asserted that its nurse practitioner “met or exceeded the applicable standards of care”. The attorneys did not respond to a request from the Guardian for comment.The other wrongful death lawsuit against UnitedHealth was filed by Yalonda Phillips, the daughter of the Ohio nursing home resident, Mary Grant.View image in fullscreenYalonda Phillips outside of her home in Cleveland, Ohio, in September.Photograph: Maddie McGarveyOn the night of 18 August 2023, Phillips received a call from an off-site Optum employee about her mother vomiting, an escalation in symptoms after her fall from her wheelchair, which resulted in a bump on her head the day before.Though the caller identified herself as an employee of Optum, UnitedHealth’s care subsidiary, Phillips said in an interview that she thought she was speaking to someone from the nursing home. She didn’t realize, she said, that she was speaking to a representative of a company tied to her mother’s insurer.During the call, Phillips told the Optum employee that her mother had a bump on her forehead, which she described as “sensitive to the touch”, a company recording of their conversation released in discovery shows.The Optum employee, a nurse practitioner who had not examined the 70-year-old in person, assured Phillips that it didn’t “seem as if” her mother was in “any acute distress”, citing a prior conversation with a nursing home supervisor, the recording continues. If Grant’s condition got worse they would send her to the hospital, the off-site clinician promised, according to the recording.At about 10pm that evening, the Optum employee called a doctor and reported: “She has a knot on her forehead, but it doesn’t sound like a hematoma or anything.” The doctor then OK’d continuing to treat Grant at the facility after speaking to the Optum employee for less than two minutes, according to a recording of their conversation.Because Grant was kept at the nursing home, the suit claims, the 70-year-old never received an MRI, which would have allowed surgeons to figure out whether she had internal head bleeding and proceed tosurgeryif warranted.The Optum employee did not respond to questions for this story.No autopsy was performed after Grant’s death, and in her death certificate the nursing home’s medical director later attributed her passing to various years-old conditions that did not refer to the head injury, according to the family’s lawsuit.In an affidavit, Dr Timothy Klein, a medical expert hired by Grant’s family, said the knot on her forehead was likely a hematoma pointing to internal head trauma. Grant’s vomiting and nausea the next day were likely the symptoms of that traumatic head injury, caused by blood spurting out inside her head and pooling up outside her brain, according to the affidavit.Lying in her bed alone in the final hours before her death, Grant likely experienced an “intense headache as pressure built up within her skull, compressing her brain”, the affidavit says. As the pressure inside her head eroded her body’s ability to function, Klein wrote, Grant’s lungs were also likely being filled with stomach fluids – a process that would have caused her “intense pain” as she was in essence “drowning in her own vomit”.At 12.06pm on 19 August 2023, the day after Grant had begun vomiting, a nursing home nurse once again called the Optum hotline.It looked like the senior had vomited again and now she was not breathing, the nurse reported on the recorded line. She could not get a pulse.A remote Optum employee offered to call Grant’s daughter. The nurse agreed, saying, “I’m like a wreck right now.”By the time Phillips rushed to the nursing home, it was too late, the recordings show. The daughter was not able to comfort her mother as she passed away.“Working dx [diagnosis]: Cessation of life,” the Optum log from 12.09pm noted.Eight minutes later Grant was officially pronounced dead, according to company records.In court documents, Optum denied the Grant family’s allegations."

Tricolor filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in September,heightening scrutinyof private credit and its influence in the global economy.“As alleged in the indictment, CEO Daniel Chu was the leader of an elaborate scheme to defraud creditors of Tricolor,” said Jay Clayton, a US attorney, in a statement. “At his direction, Tricolor repeatedly lied to banks and other credit providers, including by falsifying auto-loan data and ‘double pledging’ collateral.“Fraud became an integral component of Tricolor’s business strategy. The resulting billion-dollar collapse harmed banks, investors, employees and customers.”The scope of the alleged fraud was revealed this summer, when lenders confronted executives including Chu about Tricolor’s collateral, according to the indictment, which alleges that Chu “concocted plans to conceal or explain away the fraud” in a series of secretly recorded phone calls.After such efforts failed, Chu extracted over $6m from the company, the indictment said, adding that Tricolor later filed for bankruptcy because it owed over $900m to the company’s largest lenders, the indictment said.Chu received two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25m, according to the indictment, which claims that he used some of this money to buy a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsNew YorkLaw (US)InvestingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.OpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.As a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal thatvalued OpenAI at $500bn.OpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.Other deals struck by OpenAI this year includeOraclespending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.In anothertransaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.OpenAI announced on Tuesday that it hadhired the former UK chancellorGeorge Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whoseupdate of its Gemini AI toolgave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.The Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.OpenAI declined to comment.

The deal will run until 2033.“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of theOscarsand our year-round Academy programming,” said the Academy CEO, Bill Kramer and Academy president Lynette Howell Taylor in a statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible – which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”Recent years have seen the Academy try to diversity its voting body, increasing international voters with 21% now from outside the US.Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, hopes the partnership will “inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy”. He also praised the Oscars as one of “our essential cultural institutions”.The deal will also include access to the Governors awards, the nominations announcement, the nominees Luncheon, the student Academy awards, Academy member and film-maker interviews, film education programs, podcasts and more.This year has seen YouTube achieve record viewership shares in the US, remaining the most-watched streamer as network television has struggled to compete. In September, the platform hosted its first ever live NFL game, reaching over 17m viewers.According to theHollywood Reporter, analysts are expecting YouTube TV to become the biggest pay-TV service in the US next year. As of April this year, it had 9.4m subscribers.The news comes after Disney’s ABC in the US scoreda slight increasein ratings for this year’s ceremony with 19.7m viewers. The night was dominated by wins for Sean Baker’s comedy drama Anora.The most-watched ceremony was in 1998 when James Cameron’s blockbuster Titanic swept the board with over 57m Americans tuning in.“ABC has been the proud home to the Oscars for more than half a century,” an ABC spokesperson said. “We look forward to the next three telecasts, including the show’s centennial celebration in 2028, and wish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences continued success.”In 2023, Netflix also picked up the rights to the Screen Actors Guild awards, now known as the Actor awards, moving them from broadcast to streaming. According toVariety, Netflix, as well as NBCUniversal, had also been in the mix as potential buyers for the Oscars.Disney was paying around $100m a year for broadcast rights and is believed to have also been a bidder this time. Last year saw the company stream the awards online for the first time on Hulu.The announcement is expected to create shockwaves in the industry. Puck’s Matthew Bellonipostedon X earlier today: “Academy member meltdown coming in 5….4….3….”Next year’s ceremony, which takes place in March, will feature the first Oscar for casting. Nominations will be announced in January with films such as One Battle After Another, Sinners and Hamnet predicted.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

City economists had forecast a modest drop to 3.5%.Strengthening the case for the Bank to cut borrowing costs for a sixth time, the slowdown in the headline rate to the lowest level since March was fuelled by falling pre-Christmas food prices and Black Friday discounts.Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said: “Lower food prices, which traditionally rise at this time of the year, were the main driver of the fall, with decreases seen particularly for cakes, biscuits, and breakfast cereals.“Tobacco prices also helped pull the rate down, with prices easing slightly this month after a large rise a year ago. The fall in the price of women’s clothing was another downward driver.”Analysts said a cut in the Bank’s base rate was “all-but nailed on” before its policymakers meeting on Thursday, as faltering economic growth and rising levels of unemployment bear down on inflationary pressures.“November’s drop in UK inflation is just the latest sign that price pressures are abating and that the Bank of England has more work to do. We expect a rate cut on Thursday and two more next year,” said James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING.The pound fell by 0.7% against the dollar on the currency markets. Trading in financial markets reflects a more than 90% chance of a quarter-point cut in the base rate from the current level of 4%. Government borrowing costs also fell.The latest reading showed inflation in food and drink prices slowed from 4.9% in October to 4.2%, with the cost of products such as cakes, biscuits and breakfast cereals falling this year after rising a year ago.Kris Hamer, the director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, said extensive discounting across Black Friday month had contributed to the decline, alongside big pre-Christmas promotions. “As a result, there were deals to be had, with bigger discounts seen for some meat products such as pork, lamb and chicken.”The price of some food products tumbled sharply compared with a year earlier, including a 16.2% drop in olive oil, a 6.1% decline in flours and other cereals, and a 4.2% drop in the price of pasta products and couscous.Further strengthening the case for a rate cut, core inflation – which excludes volatile items including energy and food, and is closely monitored by the Bank – also cooled from 3.4% to 3.2%.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made tackling the cost of living a major target of last month’s autumn budget, alongside£26bn of tax increasesto help repair the public finances and fund theend of the two-child benefit cap.The Bank has said it expects the chancellor’s measures – including relief on energy bills, prescription charges and fuel duty – could cut headline inflation byas much as half a percentage point next year.“Getting bills down is my top priority,” Reeves said. “I know families across Britain who are worried about bills will welcome this fall in inflation.”Despite the slowdown in November, the UK’s headline inflation rate remains significantly above the 2% target set by the government. Some economists warned that the UK still faced pressures from inflation that could limit the Bank from cutting interest rates much further in 2026.Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “While a fall in inflation is welcome, prices are still rising at well above the target rate, which will be deeply concerning for families.”Campaigners said consumer prices remained significantly higher than in 2021, before the inflation shock took hold. Chris Belfield, the chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation poverty charity, said 7 million households were heading into Christmas unable to afford essential items.“Meanwhile, more people are looking for work with unemployment figures up to pre-pandemic levels and real earnings are barely growing.”Explore more on these topicsInflationInterest ratesBank of EnglandEconomicsOffice for National StatisticsEconomic policyUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Not simply to win, but to win so cleanly that dissent collapses on contact. Sohis retirement announcement on Tuesdaydidn’t feel like a sudden fade-out so much as the closing of a file: tidy, decisive, signed in his own hand. Three months after scaling two weight divisionstooutclass Canelo Álvarez in Las Vegasand become the undisputed super-middleweight champion, Crawford says he is stepping away “on his own terms”. In the cruellest sport, that is rarer than a perfect record.Boxing is purpose-built to keep you in. To lure you back with one more payday, one more belt, one more chance to settle a score that only exists because the promoters or the public insist it should. The hurt business has never been conducive to happy endings. The preferred vernacular is violent or sad or compromised: a stoppage you don’t see coming, a dubious decision, a diminished version of yourself preserved forever in high definition.The 38-year-old Crawford, undefeated in 42 professional fights with 31 wins by knockout, is leaving with no such asterisks. No late-career survival acts. No sense of erosion. He exits while still clearly the best fighter in the world – only Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk are in the conversation – fresh off the biggest win of his career, with opportunity still rapping loudly at the door.Plenty of champions have gone out on top in theory. Very few have done so in practice when they’re at the height of their earning power. Almost none have done so like this: as the best pound-for-pound fighter alive, unchallenged across five weight classes, without a single fight that left observers leaning forward in the late rounds and wondering whether the moment had finally arrived. With no judge having even once scored in favour of an opponent during his career. Not Gene Tunney. Not Rocky Marciano. Not Lennox Lewis. Not Joe Calzaghe. Not Floyd Mayweather Jr. Not Andre Ward. With Crawford, the question was never if a fight would tilt, only when.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford takes the fight to Canelo Álvarez in September 2025.Photograph: David Becker/APTo tell his story properly, you have to start in Omaha, because Omaha never leaves the frame. The kid from North 33rd Street, where options narrowed early and the gym became a kind of moral architecture. Long before boxing gave Crawford a livelihood, it gave him a structure. Chin tucked. Hands high. Elbows in. Keep your word. He would switch stances from orthodox to southpaw just to see how it felt.When he broke his right hand in a school fight, he kept showing up for training anyway, drilling left-handed until it felt natural. He never moved his centre of gravity to the coasts or reinvented himself as a brand. Even as the money started pouring in, Omaha remained home – a place he fought for, returned to and built around, even on the rare occasions it didn’t love him back.There is also the moment that sounds like myth until you remember it happened to a real body in a real car: the 2008 dice game, the winnings accounted for,the gunshot through the rear window, the bullet grazing beneath his ear. Crawford drove himself to the hospital, recovered, and kept the course. In another fighter’s story, it would be assigned a deeper meaning. In his, it remains a prelude to the work ahead.That work made him boxing’s most reliable problem-solver. Crawford didn’t overwhelm opponents immediately; he dismantled them methodically from an orthodox or southpaw stance with equal menace. He downloaded information in the early rounds, probed reactions with the jab, catalogued habits, then altered the geometry of the action. Angles shifted. Distance dissolved. Fights that appeared competitive early became organised, then inevitable. Opponents did not simply lose; they realised, gradually, that the room had been rearranged around them.The titles followed as proof of concept. First at lightweight. Then 140lb, where he became the division’s first undisputed champion of the four-belt era. Then welterweight, where the long-awaited Errol Spence Jr fight endednot in drama but in demolition. Then higher still, until September’s victory over Canelo transformed the argument and lifted him from generational talent into the all-time realm of lionhearted weight-jumpers such as Harry Greb, Henry Armstrong, Roberto Durán and Manny Pacquiao.By the end, the résumé read like a lockbox. Only the sixth male fighter in history to win world titles in five divisions, joining Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Mayweather and Pacquiao. Only the third to claim lineal championships in four, alongside Mayweather and Pacquiao. Only the second man to become an undisputed champion in three weight classes after Armstrong in 1938.These feats once guaranteed household fame. Crawford accomplished them in an era fragmented by paywalls, promotional stalemates and the expectation that greatness must also arrive with theatrics attached. He refused that script. He trusted the older logic: keep winning, and eventually the world will have to reckon with you. Now it has. And he is leaving anyway.View image in fullscreenCrawford lands a left on Errol Spence Jr.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesThat may be the most radical part of all. Many great champions walk away because they no longer want to suffer for their craft. Crawford does not look like a man escaping the grind. He looks like a man who has already finished the work. He leaves without visible decline, without a rival pressing him, without the sense of a question left unanswered.There is still a paradox here. The same discipline that allows Crawford to step away cleanly is what makes the door behind him feel slightly ajar. He did not say he is done fighting. He said he is stepping away from competition. He framed it as winning “a different type of battle”. That sounds less like a farewell than a man protecting his peace.If he never returns, his legacy is secure and agency intact. Every era produces a small handful of fighters whose contemporaries insist – stubbornly, forever – that no one could have beaten them.Terence Crawfordis now one of those fighters. The argument alone is a kind of immortality. And if he does come back, it will not be because boxing demanded it. It will be because, somewhere in his mind, a new problem arose – and he decided he still wanted to solve it.Explore more on these topicsTerence CrawfordBoxinganalysisShareReuse this content"

The Indiana Pacers, a team that will no doubt go down as having one of themost compelling Cinderella storiesin modern NBA history, had other plans.But this year, the East is more open than ever (though Knicks guardJalen Brunson insistshe’s “not a fan” of the narrative of a wide open conference). The Detroit Pistons have made a remarkable turnaround from being at the bottom of the East standings a few years ago to the top of them, but the Knicks’ showing in Cup play,ultimately hoisting the trophyin the third year of the contest, has shown what many believed heading into this season: they’re the team to beat.Brunson continues to be every bit the superstar his franchise needs, Mikal Bridges is having a fantastic season, and (knocks on wood)they’re as healthy as they’ve been in ages. New head coach Mike Brown appears to be just the breath of fresh air the doctor ordered after things had gotten stale with Tom Thibodeau, getting more creative with the offense and going deeper with rotations, and theNBA Cupchampion Knicks will certainly be heard from come April.View image in fullscreenVictor Wembanyama excelled in his return from injury.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesF your dynastyThe stage was set for Oklahoma City this weekend: on a tear, bulldozing every team in the league, and practically yawning their way to a 24-1 record, they were poised to make that 25-1 on Saturday night in theNBACup semif-inals.Victor Wembanyama and theSan Antonio Spurshad other plans. Wembanyama, the 7ft 5in french wunderkind who possesses an all too rare combination of zenmaster off-court tendencies with a healthy dose of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan-esque psycho on the hardwood, clearly took being a heavy underdog personally heading into Saturday’s semi-final matchup. The game marked his first appearance in several weeks due to a calf strain, and the Spurs, presumably due to Wembanyama’s minutes restriction, sat him out the entire first quarter.As Sudan burns, the NBA’s embrace of the UAE shows how sport enables atrocityRead moreThe difference in the entire Spurs team as soon as Wembanyama checked into the game was staggering: it wasn’t just the renewed clarity of the offense, his unmatched defensive skill set, or his looming presence in the paint, which clearly spooked any Oklahoma player who dared to venture beyond the free throw line. It was the confidence: palpable, notable, and coursing throughout the entire Spurs roster. I remarked to the colleague sitting next to me during the contest that it felt like someone’s older brother had shown up to a fight at recess: suddenly chests were puffed out.There was a moment in the second quarter of the Cup Championship where Wembanyama blocked four or five Knicks shot attempts at the rim in a row, and didn’t appear to even really break a sweat in the process. It’s hard to put a finger on whatitis when it comes to the next face of the league, the next NBA superstar to carry the sport into the future. But whatever itis, Wembanyama has it in spades. It’s hard not to think about “greatest of all time” potential for the Frenchman if his body can cooperate, potential south-of-the-Mason-Dixon-line dynasties be damned.The rise of the CupAlthough it has been met with mixed reactions from fans and NBA players alike (and evoked plenty of confusion from both), the NBA Cup is clearly starting to find its stride. I mentioned inmy takeawaysfrom this event last year that it inevitably takes time for something like this to matter. Gravity doesn’t form overnight, and while the merits of throwing a wrench into the rhythm of the NBA regular season are debatable, the event is clearly starting to carry some level of gravitas and cache: the proof is in the highly competitive games all weekend long. There were bodies colliding while diving for loose balls, roughly a million offensive rebounds, and nary a blowout. It took a couple of years (and a hefty investment from Amazon) but the cup is here to stay.View image in fullscreenShai Gilgeous-Alexander goes for a shot over San Antonio Spurs guard Dylan Harper in the first half of an NBA Cup semifinals.Photograph: Ronda Churchill/APThe Oklahoma City avalancheWhile the formidable freight train that is the 2025-2026 Oklahoma City Thunder was eliminated in a nailbiter againstl’étrangerand company in the Cup semi-finals, the loss only sent them to a still-staggering 24-2 on the season: and much of that record was accomplished with their second option, Jalen Williams, cheering on the bench with a wrist injury.There were plenty of flashes throughout the game that showed why they are still, NBA Cup champion-lessness notwithstanding, in a class completely their own in the league. For starters, the nearly un-guardable Shai Gilgeous-Alexander seems to be well on his way to a second consecutive league MVP award (and, potentially, a second consecutive Finals MVP, too). His whole offensive skill set was on full display in the Cup semi, from the gasp-inducing craftiness and control, to the slinky smooth footwork, to, yes, the foul grifting (one can hardly blame him when he’s so damned effective at it).Cooper Flagg sets NBA record for points by an 18-year-old, besting LeBron JamesRead moreBut the Thunder’s most impressive characteristic was their defense. It was, as always, swarming and overwhelming, tireless. I can’t imagine how demoralizing it must be to be on the receiving end of a flurry of steals and forced turnovers, looking up at a scoreboard that broadcasted a single digit deficit mere moments before, only to watch it swell to 12 or 13 in the blink of an eye. Oklahoma City is relentless: they keep coming, and they come in tidal waves. Just when you think it’s safe to go back in the water … the tenacious Thunder prove why you simply cannot catch your breath around them. Wembanyama and the Spurs certainly pulled off an impressive upset on Saturday night, but make no mistake: the Thunder should still strike the fear of God in every team.Honorable mention: Keep an eye on the MagicI couldn’t wrap up the weekend in Vegas without a quick shout out to the Orlando Magic, who are starting to really round into form as a formidable Eastern Conference dark horse. They had a gritty, impressive showing in the Cup semis, and Desmond Bane is finally starting to look worth the haul of draft picks he commanded.Explore more on these topicsNBANBA CupBasketballUS sportsNew York KnicksSan Antonio SpursfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our focus is obviously to win the next three games, but in particular – like I told the players – we are focused on beating the Bengals, so that is the motivation.“Zach will be backing him up, and Tua will be the emergency third.”When asked what his thinking was for having Tua serve as the emergency quarterback, McDaniel said, “I think it was the best for all parties involved, Quinn, Zach and Tua.”View image in fullscreenQuinn Ewers, a seventh-round pick from Texas in this year’s draft, will start against Cincinnati.Photograph: David Richard/APMcDaniel didn’t stop there, however. “All three quarterbacks … I think they understood that my intent and motivation is concretely to do the best thing for the team.“Starting with Tua, it wasn’t easy for him to hear.

Judon, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, appeared in 13 games with Miami. The 33-year-old had zero sacks and was credited with just nine total pressures this season by Pro Football Focus, which would rank in the bottom five of the 112 outside linebackers graded by the site.The Dolphins acquired Tagovailoa with the No 5 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. Ewers was a seventh-round pick in the 2025 draft out of Texas.“Quinn, his disposition, understanding that it’s uncharted territory as a rookie starting, but his relationship with his teammates and the motivation,” McDaniel added. “I think our team with him starting at the quarterback position gives us the best opportunity to beat the Bengals.”Ewers, 22, made his only NFL appearance on 19 October in mop-up duty in a 31-6 loss at Cleveland.

Fifa this week announced a limited number of discount tickets for fans of participating countries.Fifa announces limited amount of $60 tickets for 2026 World Cup after fan furyRead moreAfter a meeting of the Fifa Council in Doha, Fifa said $727m would be shared among its member nations “as a result of the Fifa World Cup 2026™”. Of that figure, $655m would be prize money distributed among qualifying nations. The runners-up will get $33m and those ranked between “33rd and 48th place” in the expanded contest will receive $9m each.

Flamengo fell just short of a global title just weeks after securing the Copa Libertadores crown.PSG initially thought they had taken the lead in Doha when Fabián Ruiz finished after a poor clearance by keeper Agustin Rossi – but VAR ruled that the ball went out of play in the buildup. The breakthrough came in the 38th minute as Desiré Doué's cross was half-cleared by Rossi, allowing Kvaratskhelia to convert.Flamengo nearly levelled before the interval when Erick Pulgar headed narrowly wide from a corner, but got a golden chance to level when Marquinhos tripped Giorgian De Arrascaeta in the box. Jorginho sent Safonov the wrong way with the resulting penalty to equalise in the 62nd minute.João Neves and Doué had chances as PSG pushed for a second, while Flamengo offered a threat on the break. Marquinhos missed a late chance to atone for conceding a penalty, but miskicked from close range. PSG dominated extra time but were held off by the Brazilians, only to prevail on penalties.ReutersPhotograph: Noushad Thekkayil/EPAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In a previous revision to its projections, Fifa said it anticipated record revenues over the four-year cycle that ends in next year’s World Cup. The governing body expects to take in $13bn between 2022 and 2026, up from $7.5bn over the four years to 2022 (itself an increase from $6.4bn over the previous cycle). Much of the growth was attributed by Fifa to the expansion of the World Cup and the men’s Club World Cup which took place in the US last summer.Fifa announced on Tuesday that$60 (£45) tickets would be made availablein the allocations national associations sell to their most loyal fans, after widespread criticism of Fifa’s initial pricing.However, only 10% of tickets within this allocation will be available at this price. For the England v Croatia match, for example, it would benefit about 400 out of the more than 4,000 fans able to buy tickets through the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) allocation. For the remainder, tickets will start at £198 for that opening match, and at £3,120 for the final.The chair of the Football Supporters’ Association in England, Tom Greatrex, said the size of the prize fund proved Fifa had scope to cut ticket prices for fans. “More teams, bigger stadia, a greater number of commercial partners – [it shows] there is no need to charge extortionate ticket prices to the supporters who bring the vibrancy to the World Cup finals. It is not too late for Fifa to avoid the catastrophic error of all but killing what is special about the World Cup. They should act now.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsFifaFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

After 56 years without a trophy before glorious victory at Wembley in March Newcastle were never going to let go of theCarabao Cupwithout a fight, but few of the impressionable children walking up Barrack Road for a pre-Christmas treat imagined their heroes having to hang on to the silverware this grimly before Lewis Miley’s stoppage-time winner.The Magpies had dominated without often threatening the killer blow, with the constant threat of their own doubt undermining them after the miserablederby defeat at Sunderlandthat cast a cloud of gloom over St James’ Park well before the Wednesday afternoon rain set in.Manchester City await over two legs in January’s last four; “always the most difficult [team] to prepare for,” as Eddie Howe put it, but the manager was more focussed on his team’s power of recovery than projecting too far forward. “There are so many positives,” he said, with particular reference to “outstanding” match winner Miley.Reaching the semi-finals, for the third year in four of his tenure, of a competition that has given him and the club so much is a much-needed fillip. “We loved last year,” Howe said. “We loved everything about the experience we went through, and the two-legged semi-final makes it unique.”Manchester City into Carabao Cup semis as Cherki and Savinho see off BrentfordRead moreHowe may hope much of this struggle will eventually be minor detail. Yoane Wissa marked his long-awaited first start for the club with a goal inside 10 minutes, tapping in the first even half-chance that came the home side’s way after Benjamin Lecomte could only push out Jacob Murphy’s cross, but it did little to steady Newcastle – or to suggest thatFulhamwould eventually be beaten on this ground for the second time in less than two months. “A difficult one to take, another one,” as Marco Silva lamented.Tension had lingered in the air at kick-off. Instances of genuine anger with manager and team have been as rare as hen’s teeth in the four years of Howe, but the loss to Sunderland invoked feelings reminiscent of some of the indignities of the latter days of Alan Pardew or the Steve Bruce era for many.Bruno Guimarães had acknowledged in his programme notes that “we know that it will take time to put it right for you” and even if the manager had disagreed with some of his captain’s post-match virulence, he was candid after victory. “Sunday happened and we were devastated at ourselves,” he admitted, saluting the home fans who chanted his name. “Support for me is really support for the players, and I can’t thank them enough.”To continue in the Carabao Cup – the cup, their cup, as it has become under Howe – was of paramount importance. Yet with the prevailing mood and the current rash of defensive injuries, with Miley filling in at right-back – “We did a lot of work with him [on it] this morning,” Howe said of the last-ditch nature of using his midfielder there – it was a tentative opening from the home side.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa scores his first Newcastle goal.Photograph: Lee Keuneke/Every Second Media/ShutterstockWissa’s strike failed to settle them with Fulham continuing to look more poised, and the lead lasted barely five minutes. Antonee Robinson delivered an inviting cross from the left for the onrushing and unfettered Sasa Lukic to pummel a header past Aaron Ramsdale, his second leveller at St James’ this season after October’s in the Premier League.The teeming rain relented and after Fulham’s fast start Newcastle began to find some fluency, intermittently bringing Miley and Tino Livramento into midfield to master possession. Eventually Guimarães cut through the patient passing and bludgeoned an effort at goal, with Lecomte punching away unconvincingly and Wissa nearly snaffling a second in the aftermath. Murphy then had a shot charged down by Sander Berge from close in as Howe’s team knocked on the door.The weight of Newcastle’s heavily stocked substitutes’ bench (“It’s a different reality,” said Silva) hung over proceedings as the second half began cagily, with the game begging to be broken open. Who would be the solution, and when? Lecomte’s unsteady hands again suggested they might be the answer as they spilled a grass-cutter from Harvey Barnes, fortunately only resulting in a home corner. Silva’s largely well-organised side further flirted with self-destruction when Joachim Andersen walked Murphy’s low cross into his own net, but the winger had raced on to Guimarães’ slide-rule pass too early and was flagged offside.Quick GuideCarabao Cup semi-final drawShowChelsea v ArsenalorCrystal PalaceNewcastle United v Manchester CityFirst legs, hosted by Chelsea and Newcastle, will be played w/c 12 January.Return legs w/c 2 February.

A scramble in the box offered what seemed like a last chance to Miley, whose shot finally brought the best out of Lecomte. Yet the 19-year-old local hero had more, rising to head in the resulting corner from Sandro Tonali to finally lift the post-derby blues.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Luke Humphries and Martin Lukeman are two promising young throwers making their way on the ProfessionalDartsCorporation’s second-tier tour, dreaming of the big time. But there’s one problem.Humphries has styled himself “Cool Hand”, based on the 1967 Paul Newman film that to date he has still never watched. Lukeman, meanwhile, has decided to call himself “Cool Man”: less catchy, doesn’t really scan, but still just about works. And though the pair are firm friends, when the draw in Wigan pits them against each other, they decide that this best-of-nine match will settle matters once and for all. Winner gets the nickname. Loser has to think of something else.Cameron Menzies cracks in the cauldron as darts faces an uncomfortable truthRead moreHow different might the undulating paths of these two men have been had Lukeman and not Humphries won that match? Of course, Lukeman has had a perfectly fine career: finalist in the Grand Slam last season, a couple of promising runs in the other majors. But the man they now call “Smash” has also struggled for consistency at the highest level. He goes on a hot streak and then fades for months. What he so sorely lacks – in those big pressure moments – is a little coolness.By contrast, Humphries and his nickname have proven a perfect fit for each other: a stage identity and a sporting identity that have fused together so perfectly that they may as well be one and the same. He’s unflappable, unerring, keeps his calm under pressure, keeps plugging away on that 60-bed. “It was fate,” he later remembered of the Lukeman game. And perhaps the lesson here is that in a sport so built on persona and self-projection, there is often a lot more to a darting nickname than a little coloured thread on the back of a shirt.When new players register with the Professional Darts Players’ Association before their first tournament, among the details they are asked to enter is the nickname they will carry with them into their careers. And look, quite a few appear to have gone with the first thing that came to mind as they were filling out the form. Ross Smith is “Smudger”, Luke Woodhouse “Woody”, Josh Rock “Rocky”. Mervyn King is “The King”. Ryan Meikle, a barber, is known as “The Barber”. Which is fine. Not everyone has to be an all-singing, all-dancing brand.There are the inevitable puns: Darren “Ice Cold” Beveridge, “Beau and Arrow” Greaves, Jan “Double” Dekker. There are the players whose have carried their nicknames into darts from a previous life. Jonny Clayton has been known as “The Ferret” ever since his days as a jackalling scrum-half for Pontyberem. Chris Dobey got the name “Hollywood” from his mates in Bedlington because of the way he dressed.For players from the more peripheral countries of the darting universe, their inevitable fate is to be assigned a name based on their nationality. Krzysztof Ratajski, “The Polish Eagle”. Antonio Alcinas, “El Dartador”. Nitin Kumar, “The Royal Bengal”. Xiaochen Zong of China is known as “The Panda Man”, which probably isn’t going to date that well.3:00‘From pubs to the Palace’: Jonathan Liew at the World Darts Championships – videoBut the most catchy and consequential nicknames are very often the product of a more polished and collaborative process. When new players arrive on tour they and their agents will often meet with the PDC’s publicity department to discuss how they want to be branded and marketed. Nicknames and walk-on songs will be thrown around the room to see what sticks. Daryl Gurney’s nickname “Superchin” was a suggestion from his agent. He still doesn’t like it. But he’s stuck with it now.Broadcasters will often have a say as well: it was a Sky Sports production manager called Peter Judge who came up with the idea of calling Phil Taylor “The Power” after hearing the song of the same name by Snap! on a CD. The commentator Dan Dawson dubbed Dirk van Duijvenbode “the Aubergenius” due to his previous job on an aubergine farm. Which brings us neatly to the final category: the nicknames deemed too hot for television.Earlier this year the Australian player Tim Pusey got a sternly-worded communique from the PDC that his long-standing nickname of “The Magnet” would no longer be acceptable to a global family audience. The same fate befell the young Devon player Owen Bates, whose attempt to dub himself “The Master” were also kiboshed by the fun police.All guffawing aside, the perfect darting nickname is more than a catchy jingle. For Peter “Snakebite” Wright and Eric “The Crafty Cockney” Bristow, for Ted “The Count” Hankey and Andy “The Viking” Fordham, it was an entire personality, a source of power, a character expressing to the world – and their opponents – how they wanted to be perceived.For modern players like Stephen “The Bullet” Bunting and Luke “The Nuke” Littler, it has become an intrinsic part of their commercial armoury, used to sell everything from replica shirts to children’s lunchboxes to pet bandanas. Increasingly we live in an age where the professional athlete is a kind of personal brand. In this respect – as in so many others – darts was ahead of the curve.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was also roasting hot out in the middle – 35C on the mercury – and when the toss went against Ben Stokes and his embattled England players, they could easily have melted.Instead, despite some sloppiness and Alex Carey’s magical century on the ground he calls home, the tourists kept plugging away with the fight that Stokes called for at 2-0 down. At stumps Australia were 326 for eight from 83 sapping overs – runs on the heritage-listed scoreboard, granted, but short of ambitions when the returning Pat Cummins got the choice first thing.England consider formal complaint after Snicko error costs Carey’s wicketRead moreAmong the reasons diagnosed for England’s precarious position in this Ashes series has been the lack of an attack leader but here one stood up. Jofra Archer’s figures of three for 29 from 16 overs were a strong riposte to some of the criticism this past week: he averaged 88mph on the speed gun, offered Stokes precious control and was a threat to Australia throughout.There was generosity from the hosts, however. Having bounced out Jake Weatherald first thing, Archer wiped out Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green inside his first three balls after lunch via a couple of tepid chips to midwicket. Green’s duck was also a bump back to earth, less than 24 hours after trousering a £2.06m (A$3m) deal to play in the Indian Premier League.Carey’s day was comparatively priceless, peaking at 4.48pm when he drove Stokes through the covers for three and the crowd rose with a roar. Fresh from that virtuoso outing with the gloves at the Gabba, his counterattacking 106 from 143 ensured that the early afternoon wobble to 94 for four was not a full-blown crisis. The 34-year-old is a serious cricketer these days.However, England ​t​hought they had removed Carey on 72 when he feathered behind off Josh Tongue, only for it to be given not out. Stokes reviewed but with Snicko showing a spike before any possible impact, the third umpire stayed with the on-field call. Carey later admitted he probably got ​some bat on it and BBG, the company that owns the technology, released a statement confirming user error was likely to blame.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer celebrates after dismissing Cameron Green for a duck.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesTongue did snare a wicket on his first day of overseas Test cricket, Josh Inglis bowled via a limp defensive shot on 32 after tea. But despite some promising deliveries, he and Brydon Carse did not match the excellence of Archer. Carse, who claimed two for 70 from 13, was particularly shoddy with the new ball first thing, overstepping five times and flattered by a sparkling one-handed catch from Zak Crawley at cover that removed Travis Head for 10.That wicket ushered in the other standout batter for Australia on the day, albeit one who was not supposed to be playing at all. Before the emotional tributes to the victims of the Bondi terrorist attack ahead of play – including a stirring rendition of True Blue by John Williamson – came the news that Steve Smith was ruled out with dizziness and nausea, so Usman Khawaja was back in.A day short of turning 39, and with many fancying his omission from the XI meant the end of his international career, Khawaja finessed a classy 82 from 126 balls, flicking and guiding 10 fours along the way. Having walked out at 33 for two in the 10th over, the left-hander’s calming experience anchored stands of 61 with Labuschagne then 91 alongside Carey.That said, England should have removed Khawaja on five when Harry Brook grassed a diving catch at second slip. It was a poor miss given the batter-friendly conditions. Gone was the bounce of the first two Tests, just a bit of nibble when seamers found the right length. From the outset it was clear that fewer chances would be flying to the cordon in this match.View image in fullscreenBrydon Carse was again expensive in intense heat on day one.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was a bit of grip for Will Jacks to work with and, though figures of two for 105 from 20 overs underlined the struggle for control of his length, the all-rounder managed to remove Khawaja and Carey. The balls that did misbehave will only have encouraged Nathan Lyon on his return to Australia’s attack, however, and England’s left-handers are likely to be challenged.Perhaps they can take a leaf out of Carey’s book, the wicketkeeper having defended with certainty, used the slog sweep well, and put the odd one that beat him out of his mind. This is the South Australian’s backyard, of course, and more broadly he showed the value in targeting the shorter square boundaries, driving and cutting with laser-like precision.Carey also got some valuable ­support from Mitchell Starc, who, after Carse removed Cummins for 13 in the evening session, put on 50 for the eighth wicket and was unbeaten on 33 at stumps. This third Test at Australia’s most attractive ground may have a different feel to the first two but Starc being an impediment to England’s progress remains a ­consistent theme.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamJofra ArcherThe AshesCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

We did that,” said the Chelsea manager, Sonia Bompastor.“The performance was tough, especially in the first half. We were under pressure because Wolfsburg came at us with a lot of physicality. That made it difficult for us to perform. In the second half we did enough to score two goals and win the game.“We need to stay focused until the end.

The ECDC, whose master plan does not include room for a football stadium, secured unanimous approval from Hammersmith and Fulham council last month.UK gives Abramovich final warning to transfer £2.5bn to Ukraine fundRead moreSuggestions that Tuesday’s development has in effect ended the chance of Chelsealeaving Stamford Bridge for Earl’s Courtare understood to be wide of the mark. Chelsea, whose owners recognise that Stamford Bridge’s capacity of 40,343 is not big enough, have held talks with various figures who have a say over the future of the 17.8 hectare (44 acres) site. Those discussions are yet to advance but the ECDC receiving planning permission does not stop other suitors from bidding for the land.Yet it is understood that resounding local support for the ECDC will make it harder politically and financially for Chelsea to change the direction of travel. A key figure inLondonpolitics said that it was time for Chelsea to “put up or shut up” and make clear whether they are serious about Earl’s Court. The estimated value of the land is expected to rise from £500m to £750m with planning permission in place.The ECDC does not yet have financial backing, meaning that construction cannot begin, but it could receive government support or investment from private companies. Sovereign wealth funds and international developers are likely to be interested in lucrative real estate in west London, potentially leaving Chelsea in an auction with wealthy competitors.Chelsea are considering their options but declined to comment. They have identified the Lillie Bridge depot as the area within the Earl’s Court site on which to build a stadium. Jason Gannon, the club’s chief executive, has met Transport for London, one of the partners that looks after the site, and the real estate developer Delancey. APG, the Dutch pension fund, is another stakeholder. But there is frustration that Chelsea did not make a formal and public declaration of their interest by bidding for Earl’s Court before the ECDC plans were approved.There has previously been plenty of private political goodwill for Chelsea. It is felt that a multiuse football stadium would benefit the local economy and there would still be the potential to build affordable housing on the site.There had been concerns over the cost of the ECDC’s plans but these have diminished in recent months. The site’s future has been one of the most contentious land issues in London. It is significant that there was no opposition to the ECDC’s plans at either council meeting, with a source saying this is the scheme that has garnered support from London politicians. Work is under way to secure funding.View image in fullscreenChelsea have played at Stamford Bridge since the club’s foundation in 1877.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will soon be asked to endorse the plans. It is unlikely he will reject a proposal including 4,000 new homes, with 35% of the housing designed to be affordable. His endorsement would be another main complication for Chelsea. There would be no room for a stadium if the ECDC construction begins.Chelsea need to act before construction contracts are in place. Building a bigger ground has been a key priority for the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership but little progress has been made. Tensions between Boehly and Clearlake, the majority shareholders, have been described as a major obstacle to overcome.Chelsea retain interest in Earl’s Court but do not want to be pressed into a deal and want to be sure that it is financially and logistically viable. The club’s position is they would need a business partner who could take on the project of building housing on the parts of the land away from the stadium.Chelsea may be forced to reassess their reluctance to buy all of the land. However, sources are confident that the club would not find it difficult to cover their costs if they secured a whole or majority interest. It has been stressed that partners would line up to work with them. A more pressing issue for Chelsea would be convincing the local community that a stadium would boost the economy and raise investment in London.Chelsea count cost of Club World Cup as report puts Europe-wide injury bill at £3bnRead moreFigures familiar with the issue believe Chelsea moving to Earl’s Court is the most realistic solution for the club. There is no other site available in west London and redeveloping Stamford Bridge is feasible but challenging, not least because the ground is next to a railway line. A stand-by-stand rebuild is unattractive and a complete demolition would mean Chelsea having to play at a temporary home for up to seven years. But Chelsea have not ruled out redeveloping Stamford Bridge and made space for such a project after buying a0.48 hectare site next to their ground from Stoll, a housing charity for veterans.Moving home for good would require Chelsea to strike an agreement with Chelsea Pitch Owners, which holds the freehold of Stamford Bridge stadium. The club will seek the approval of the CPO before bidding for land elsewhere. The risk of doing nothing is that Chelsea fall behind rivals with bigger stadiums with more potential for corporate and entertainment opportunities.Explore more on these topicsChelseaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Sunday’s final markeda third loss in successionforthe new manager, Wilfried Nancy. Three became four defeats on Wednesday night when Celtic lost 2-1 at Dundee United in the Scottish Premiership.Lawwell, previously Celtic’s chief executive, and fellow directors have come under fierce criticism from fans. Errors in the transfer window, which triggeredthe exit of Brendan Rodgers, have fuelled frustration in the stands. Celtic were knocked out of the Champions League in the qualifying phaseby Kairat Almaty. The club have also been in regular conflict with the Green Brigade ultras group.Brendan Rodgers confirmed as head coach of Saudi Pro League club Al-QadsiahRead moreLawwell has announced he will leave Celtic at the end of December. “I believe that my 18 years as chief executive and three years as chairman at the club have shown my ability to meet and overcome challenges on many fronts,” he said. “But abuse and threats from some sources have increased and are now intolerable.“They have dismayed and alarmed my family. At this stage in my life, I don’t need this. I cannot accept this and so I leave the club I have loved all my life. The motivations and aims of these detractors can be investigated by others. I prefer to look back on my career at Celtic with deep gratitude and satisfaction.”Soon after Nicholson told Celtic TV: “I think he’s made the decision for himself and for his family because of the abuse and because of the threats that were directed towards him. Those are behaviours that we’ve seen from perhaps a very small minority of the Celtic support, but those are behaviours that are completely unacceptable. Most recently, we had a situation where three of our colleagues were assaulted at Celtic Park on Sunday night after the match.“ As I say, these behaviours and conduct are completely unacceptable. For me, they’re not Celtic. They don’t sit with the values of Celtic supporters and the Celtic family. This is a sad day for Celtic. The abuse and threats directed towards Peter, and the impact on his family, are completely unacceptable.”Nicholson added that the board’s backing for Nancy is “absolutely solid” despite his difficult start, which continued at Tannadice on Wednesday night.View image in fullscreenThe Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy watches his side miss a host of chances before losing 2-1 to Dundee United.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAThe Frenchman’s nightmare intensified as Dundee United’s second-half comeback consigned the Hoops to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time since 1978. Two goals in three minutes from Krisztian Keresztes and Zac Sapsford saw United claim their first win in eight Premiership games as they beat the champions 2-1 at Tannadice.Daizen Maeda had opened the scoring early on and Celtic could have had the game out of sight in the first quarter of an hour as they missed a series of chances. But United turned the game on its head in the second half and some of the visiting fans turned their anger towards Nancy during the latter stages, as well as Nicholson following the resignation of Lawwell.They also chanted for Martin O’Neill, who won seven out of eight games in interim charge before the new manager’s arrival from Columbus Crew sparked a dramatic collapse in form.Explore more on these topicsCelticScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday Keith Andrews’ team will train at their facilities and the two managers will enjoy coffee. This is before the Bees’ trip to Wolves on Saturday yet zero niceties were present in City’s professional passage into the semi-finals, where they will play Newcastle, with the first leg at St James’ Park.Guardiola cites how his team must grow during the season and with each outing greater control and composure is suggested. A sparkling Rayan Cherki scored first, then Savinho followed, only a second goal by the inconsistent 21-year-old this season.Lewis Miley heads dramatic late winner as holders Newcastle edge FulhamRead moreGuardiola offered a mixed message regarding Cherki. “Close to the 18-yard box of the opponent he is an exceptional player, it was a fantastic goal,” he said. “It is not necessary to be a journalist or a manager to realise he is a fantastic player. After that he didn’t play very well.”A City side featuring only Nico González, Nico O’Reilly, Tijjani Reijnders and Cherki fromSunday’s win at Crystal Palacefired salvos from Cherki and Oscar Bobb early on before calamity struck the latter.“He complained of a muscular problem,” said Guardiola. The Norwegian youngster was forced off on 18 minutes to be replaced by Phil Foden, who flitted about in pockets in front of Andrews’ back five.Quick GuideCarabao Cup semi-final drawShowChelsea v ArsenalorCrystal PalaceNewcastle United v Manchester CityFirst legs, hosted by Chelsea and Newcastle, will be played w/c 12 January.Return legs w/c 2 February. Final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.City’s big gun had entered just after James Trafford beat away a Mathias Jensen free-kick, claimed when Abdukodir Khusanov brought down Kevin Schade as the No 9 ran away from him.The centre-back was booked by Sam Barrott meaning he had to be wary. Andrews was not happy. “One I think they didn’t get right – a red card is a big advantage for us,” said the Irishman, who shared a prolonged post-game handshake with Guardiola. Asked if all was OK between them, Andrews said: “Everything is fine as far as I know. We are staying up to focus on the game so we might grab a coffee.”Guardiola responded pithily to Andrews’ claim Khusanov should have been sent off. “Tomorrow at the training ground, I invite him to the cafe and we will discuss,” he said.The opener came from direct play. Savinho burned down the left, popped the ball over and a corner was claimed. Divine Mukasa swung the kick in, the ball came to Cherki on the D and, after dummying an onrushing Mikkel Damsgaard, he launched a rocket into the top-right corner.View image in fullscreenSavinho lets loose to make it 2-0 to the hosts in the second half.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Danehouse/Getty ImagesJoy for Guardiola who turned to the bench to share the emotion. City continued to camp in the visitors’ territory except for sporadic moments of weakness that heartenedBrentford. These were down the flanks where Guardiola’s unit is often vulnerable, and when Damsgaard slipped Vitaly Janelt in through an inside-right lane, a scramble ended with Rico Lewis cleaning up, just as he had previously along Brentford’s left.Andrews drilled his men to close in on City high up for the obvious reason beyond attempting to nick possession: the nearer the game was to the hosts’ goal the further away it was from theirs. But City are masters of escaping any press.A scan of Guardiola’s XI had suggested Nathan Aké as the “father ­figure” he declared would be included to avoid the error of the Bayer Leverkusen defeat when 10 changes were made and City lost, 2-0. The 30-year-old had started in that Champions League loss but, as a treble-winner, was the senior player sent out to face the Bees, as signified by him being named City captain for the evening. There could be no arguments regarding the manager’s selection.Quick GuideIntercontinental Cup: PSG deny Flamengo in final shootoutShowParis Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov [pictured] saved four penalties in a dramatic shootout as the European champions claimed the Intercontinental Cup title after a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Flamengo in the final.Luis Enrique's team had taken the lead through Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the first half, only for Jorginho to level for the Brazilian side with a penalty shortly after the hour. Safonov denied Saul Niguez, Pedro, Leo Pereira and Luiz Araujo as PSG won the shootout 2-1 despite Ousmane Dembélé and Bradley Barcola's misses.Victory in the annual tournament previously known as the Club World Cup secured PSG's sixth title in 2025, having already won Ligue 1, the French Cup, the French Super Cup, the Champions League and the European Super Cup. Flamengo fell just short of a global title just weeks after securing the Copa Libertadores crown.PSG initially thought they had taken the lead in Doha when Fabián Ruiz finished after a poor clearance by keeper Agustin Rossi – but VAR ruled that the ball went out of play in the buildup. The breakthrough came in the 38th minute as Desiré Doué's cross was half-cleared by Rossi, allowing Kvaratskhelia to convert.Flamengo nearly levelled before the interval when Erick Pulgar headed narrowly wide from a corner, but got a golden chance to level when Marquinhos tripped Giorgian De Arrascaeta in the box. Jorginho sent Safonov the wrong way with the resulting penalty to equalise in the 62nd minute.João Neves and Doué had chances as PSG pushed for a second, while Flamengo offered a threat on the break. Marquinhos missed a late chance to atone for conceding a penalty, but miskicked from close range. PSG dominated extra time but were held off by the Brazilians, only to prevail on penalties.ReutersPhotograph: Noushad Thekkayil/EPAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Keep-ball is a central tenet of Guardiola’s tactics so he will have been delighted. In separate phases those in sky blue moved upfield in waves.One culminated in a Savinho burst and a shout – turned down – from the Brazilian for a penalty when Kristoffer Ajer challenged him. Another featured an O’Reilly shot that was easy for Hákon Valdimarsson to gather; another a foray into the area from Savinho, now operating on the right.How might Brentford respond? A dipping Janelt effort from range that Trafford flew to his right to save was a first answer. A Schade dart down the middle, which Khusanov this time stymied masterfully, the second.Just as accomplished was a slick Foden chestdown and snapshot, which bounced off the turf. Valdimarsson’s reflexes were equal to it.Guardiola then made a triple change – Josko Gvardiol for O’Reilly, Bernardo Silva for Cherki, and Matheus Nunes for González – but it was a player who remained, Savinho, who doubled the lead: released down the left he sprinted in on goal and beat Valdimarsson with a deflected finish that chipped the Iceland international. City’s near-stranglehold remained until the end.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupManchester CityBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Olivia Smith, Beth Mead and a Saar Janssen own goal helped Renée Slegers’ team end the league phase in fifth place.Slegers was delighted with her side’s maturity in front of a raucous crowd at the Den Dreef as they earned their fourth win of the campaign against the plucky hosts.“Bravery was important tonight and doing everything together,” the Arsenal manager said. “I’m really happy with how we wanted to go into the game and how that played out.Chelsea fight back to seal WCL quarter-final spot, Manchester United sink JuveRead more“In our planning, we could see a difference in how Leuven do things in the first half compared to the second – where they come out strong, aggressive, more opportunistic, create more chances and score more goals in the second half. They had that spell but we managed that. It was a team performance because when new players come on, we got new energy and new ideas … It’s not an easy place to come. We have seen how that’s been for the other teams. I’m really happy with how we maintained our intensity and quality.”The similarities between the last two European campaigns for Arsenal are striking. Last Christmas, they secured qualification in their penultimate group game in Oslo, a result that kickstarted their run tolifting the coveted trophy in Lisbonback in May. Slegers’ side have mirrored that journey this year, albeit via the new Champions League format; wrapping progression up with a game to go despite faltering in the league, leaving only their finishing position up for grabs.Despite the possibility of finishing in the top four still available, there were few nerves among the buoyant Arsenal fans. Around 1,000 were expected to gather in Leuven – 950 of whom had made the journey from England – and they appeared to be making the most of the famous Christmas market before kick-off. The atmosphere carried over into a sold-out Den Dreef, a record crowd for a women’s club match in Belgium.The confidence of the Gunners support was justified after an upturn in form. This transformation has been aided significantly by the return of Kim Little. Slegers made just two changes fromthe win over Evertonwith Taylor Hinds and Smith coming in, while Leah Williamson’s return is still being managed from the bench.View image in fullscreenOlivia Smith opens the scoring for Arsenal.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/ReutersThe holders came into this encounter as clear favourites, yet Arno Van den Abbeel’s team are a disciplined, industrious unit and have proved themselves to be no pushovers in their first ever Champions League appearance.Arsenal controlled proceedings from the start but were having to be patient in their buildup as they tried to tease Leuven’s defence out of position. The hosts were helped by the performance of their goalkeeper Lowiese Seynhaeve who made a series of smart saves.The breakthrough did, however, feel inevitable and with 18 minutes on the clock, the visitors made their pressure count. Smith’s initial effort was stopped by a big glove from Seynhaeve but the ball rebounded back into Smith’s path to rifle home.They made their lead comfortable shortly after when Mead struck her third goal in Europe this season. The England international is in a rich vein of form and as soon as she received the ball from Alessia Russo in the box, there was only going to be one outcome – a sweeping low finish into the far corner. It could have been more going into half-time but Mariona Caldentey, Mead and Lotte Wubben-Moy were all denied by the impressive goalkeeper.A double change from Van den Abbeel re-energised the hosts with the youthful Kadhiya De Ceuster bringing fresh impetus into the attack. The Belgian side started to increase their possession as they tried to progress up the field. Their best chances came after a corner created confusion but Sara Pusztai had two efforts blocked successively.Despite Leuven gaining more influence, Arsenal were always a threat. They found their third just two minutes after Slegers had rung the changes. Caitlin Foord was one of the three to enter the fray and was chief instigator, sending in the ball that Janssen unwittingly turned into her own net. Initially ruled out for offside, a fairly lengthy VAR check eventually confirmed that it should stand.View image in fullscreenSaar Janssen looks to the sky after her own goal gives Arsenal a 3-0 lead.Photograph: Omar Havana/APIt was a comfortable victory in the end for Arsenal who will discover their playoff opponents in Thursday’s draw.

The 21-year-old was driving back from the club’s National League North match against Bedford on Tuesday night when the incident occurred close to junction 15 on the M1.Macclesfield said in a statement: “[It is] with the heaviest of hearts and an overwhelming sense of surrealism that Macclesfield FC can confirm the passing of 21-year-old forward Ethan McLeod. Travelling back from Bedford Town last night, Ethan was involved in a car accident on the M1 which tragically took his life.“Ethan was an incredibly talented and well-respected member of our first-team squad who had his whole life ahead of him. But, more than that, Ethan’s infectious personality endeared him to everyone that he came into contact with. News of Ethan’s passing has devastated our entire club and no words can convey the immense sense of sadness and loss that we feel now.“The deep mental scars elicited from Ethan’s passing will undeniably never heal – but, one thing is for sure, and that is Ethan’s vibrant legacy will never fade, no matter how much time passes in the future. Ethan will live in our hearts and minds forevermore and, no matter what the future holds, his unique smile that mesmerised us all will never be forgotten.“Our deepest sympathy goes out to Ethan’s family and friends at this deeply traumatic time, together with an assurance that we will provide as much support as we can to those who need it. May you rest in peace Ethan – you will forever be a Silkman.”McLeod signed for Macclesfield this summer after a trial, having spent a decade in the Wolves academy before leaving last season. He made his debut for Macclesfield in their league game against Chorley in September and had scored two goals in four appearances.Wolves paid tribute to McLeod in a post on X and announced they will hold a minute’s silence at Saturday’s Premier League match against Brentford.Explore more on these topicsMacclesfieldWolverhampton WanderersnewsShareReuse this content"

He was given not out on the field and the third umpire, Chris Gaffaney, felt he did not have enough evidence to overturn the decision despite a spike showing up on the review.Alex Carey’s sparkling century helps Australia recover from early England Ashes onslaughtRead moreThe issue in this instance was that the spike came before any possible contact on the replay, whereas ­similar occurrences earlier in the series have seen it come afterwards and are ­factored into the umpiring protocols.With Carey later admitting he thought he had hit the ball – he said he would have reviewed in hope had it been given out on the field – BBG, the company that owns Snicko, owned up to the mistake, which came with Australia on 245 for six.In a statement to BBC Sport, BBG said: “The only conclusion that can be drawn from this, is that the Snicko operator at the time must have selected the incorrect stump mic for audio processing. In light of this, BBG Sports takes full responsibility for the error.”The technology uses audio from the stump microphones and in this instance it is believed the feed from the one at the non-striker’s end may have been used in error.Crowe has since reinstated one of England’s reviews after McCullum, their head coach, and Wayne ­Bentley, the team manager, met with him after the close. The ICC is also set to ­investigate the issue further.Speaking after stumps, the ­England bowling consultant, David Saker, said: “The boys were pretty ­confident he hit it. I think the ­calibration of the Snicko is out quite a bit and that has ­probably been the case for the series. There’s been some things that don’t really measure up.View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue appeals for a decision against the Australia batter Alex Carey.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images“At that stage it was a pretty ­important decision. Those things hurt, but you get through it. In this day and age you’d think the technology is good enough to pick things up like that. There have been concerns all series. We shouldn’t be talking about this after a day’s play, it should be better than that.”While technology is mandatory in the World Test Championship, the Real Time Snicko product used by Fox Sports, the host broadcaster in Australia, is considered inferior to the Ultra-Edge system used by Sky Sports in England.Carey said: “I thought there was a bit of a feather or some sort of noise when it passed the bat. It looked a bit funny on the replay, didn’t it, with the noise coming early? If I was given out, I think I would have reviewed it – probably not confidently though. It was a nice sound as it passed the bat.“Snicko obviously didn’t line up, did it? That’s just the way cricket goes sometimes. You have a bit of luck, and maybe it went my way today.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketThe AshesAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m just happy to win and move forward.”The night’s action began with the AmericanAdam Sevadaovercoming Canada’s Matt Campbell 3-1 and ended with 13th seedMartin Schindlerbeating England’s Stephen Burton by the same score.Burton had threatened to spring a surprise after winning set two without reply to level the match, only for Schindler to reply with six legs in a row – aided by an impressive tally of seven 180s.“It was definitely a good performance,” said Schindler, who is tipped by some as a dark horse to go far at Ally Pally. “I don’t feel any pressure on my shoulders, because I’m here for myself.”“I’m aware that fans and pundits are looking at me and they want me to win, but I need to perform and do my job, and that’s the most important thing,” added the German No 1, who will face Keane Barry or Tim Pusey in the last 32.Thursday’s schedule includes eight first-round matches, with Michael van Gerwen starting his campaign against Japan’s Mitsuhiko Tatsunami, while Dave Chisnall takes on “Queen of the Palace” Fallon Sherrock.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

Crawford had also held the WBC super middleweight belt, but wasstripped of it earlier this monthafter a dispute over sanctioning fees.Speaking in his video, Crawford said his career had been driven by a desire to keep “proving everyone wrong”. “Every fighter knows this moment will come, we just never know when,” Crawford said.“I spent my whole life chasing something. Not belts, not money, not headlines. But that feeling, the one you get when the world doubts you but you keep showing up and you keep proving everyone wrong. I fought for my family. I fought for my city. I fought for the kid I used to be, the one who had nothing but a dream and a pair of gloves. And I did it all my way. I gave this sport every breath I had.”Crawford’s career straddled three decades, with the southpaw making his professional debut in 2008 and rapidly becoming one of boxing’s brightest talents.

Global technology editorWed 17 Dec 2025 08.16 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 15.14 ESTShareHackers have accessed the search history and viewing habits of premium users of Pornhub, one of the world’smost popular pornography websites.A gang has reportedly accessed more than 200m data records, including premium members’ email addresses, search and viewing activities and locations. Pornhub is a heavily used site and says it has more than 100m daily visits globally.The hack was reportedly carried out by a western-based group called ShinyHunters, according to thewebsite BleepingComputer, which first reported the incident. The site reported that the data included premium members’ email addresses, search and viewing activity and location. The data consists of 201m records related to premium members.The website added that the Canadian-owned Pornhub had received an extortion demand from ShinyHunters about the hack. The Reuters news agency on Wednesday also claimed to have spoken to a ShinyHunters member in an online chat who was demanding a payment in bitcoin to prevent the publication of data and delete it.Pornhub said in a statement on its website that premium users had been affected by an attack on Mixpanel, a company that had provided data analytics to the publisher. Pornhub said a “select” number of users had been affected and that it had stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021, indicating the data is not recent.“It is important to note this was not a breach of Pornhub Premium’s systems. Passwords, payment details and financial information remain secure and were not exposed,” said the pornography service.Pornhub added that an “unauthorized party” had been able to extract a “limited set of analytics events for some users”. Other types of data taken include video URL, video name, keywords associated with the video, and the time the event occurred, according to BleepingComputer.In a statement Mixpanel said it was “aware” of the alleged data theft but said it had found no indication that it was related to a cyber-attack on the business last month.Sophos, a cybersecurity firm, told the Guardian it had seen no evidence of Pornhub data being released on so-called leak sites – part of a hacking group’s armoury for extracting payments – or in online chat platforms linked to the ShinyHunters group.Sophos said the ShinyHunters group was generally comprised of native English speakers in their late teens to early 20s and was part of a broader community of cyber criminals dubbed The Com, short for The Community. The Com is the same community from which the English-language speaking Scattered Spider group emerged, and which has beenstrongly linkedwith hacks against M&S, the Co-op and Harrods.Pornhub and Mixpanel have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHackingPornographyInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNesrine MalikWed 17 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 08.04 ESTShareIdon’t want to sound dramatic but, a few weeks ago, something happened that has completely changed how I view online material. I fell for AI-generated content. For someone who is constantly squabbling with older relatives about how little they question what they see online, this was a profoundly unsettling and humbling experience. And it made me think about how, during this holiday period, we could all use this as an opportunity to approach those conversations with the “WhatsApp aunties” more sensitively.From ‘WhatsApp Aunties’ to ‘AI Aunties’I think I have the perfect sample of WhatsApp aunties. Sadly displaced from Sudan due to war, a permanently online group of women, some direct aunts, some not, but all aunties nonetheless, sit in a control room of sorts in their different cities and send out daily broadcasts that simulate as much as possible the interactions and updates they would have shared had they still been living in the same place. They even have office hours. One can divine the start of the day in their respective locations as they clock in and the forwards begin: First, it is morning greetings, maybe an embellished picture of Quranic verses or a graphic of flowers, wishing you a good day.Then, the hardcore stuff. Snippets of videos from war zones back home, clipped debates between political antagonists, and sometimes entire YouTube episodes of interviews. After this news shift comes the lighter one (secretly my favourite): TikTok and Instagram reels of Arab celebrities with too much plastic surgery accompanied by scream emojis, footage from family and friend weddings across the world, captioned with love heart eyes. The stream is interspersed with the longest voice memos you will ever receive, asking how you are and telling you how they are with an introductory and concluding prayer session. It is sweet and relentless.AI AuntiesAll of this is dumped with an abandon that suggests no understanding of or respect for phone memory limitations. Whenever my mother casually mentions that her phone is acting up and mutters something about no space, my heart sinks. I know that hours and hours of deletions of grainy videos are upon me. But most galling is how much fake content it includes. The WhatsApp aunties have become AI aunties. This was frankly a problem even before AI became so sophisticated, but it is now much, much worse. There is the harmless stuff; cats hugging babies or penguins feeding themselves with cutlery. I try not to get too agitated by this or point out that it’s fake. But when it’s videos of Taylor Swift endorsing the pro-Palestine movement, it’s impossible to let it slide.View image in fullscreenThe harmless stuff … AI baby penguin eating, Ai fashion model, and cat with baby.Illustration: Guardian Pictures/Getty ImagesThe result is a series of exchanges that are both saddening and enraging. Aunties will either take it personally, like I am disrespecting them by implying they can’t tell what’s real or not, and double down. Or they will express genuinely innocent beliefs in the veracity of online content, imbuing the internet with the same standards of TV or radio they grew up with.Telling the aunties that something is entirely fake is like asking them to imagine a TV news broadcast is not real. Also, they areactuallyreceiving news broadcast clips on their phones that are not real. You end up sounding like the crazy one, trying to explain that a living, breathing, walking, talking person is just pixels generated from prompts.To argue or not to argueIn a recent episode of Subway Takes,comedian Ola Labib saidwe shouldn’t try to convince elders that AI content isn’t real. Her argument: Let them have their little comforts. I kind of get that, what harm is it doing really? But there is an emotional element to it as well. Policing elders’ content feels to me like a manifestation of a deep-seated fear that they’re losing it, that their faculties are waning, as they succumb to old age and the bewildering assaults of new tech and device addiction. I think it is truly distressing for people to see parents and relatives increasingly become addicted to their phones and become slightly addled, a window into a sort of premature senility.But there are social and political reasons too, for pushing back. Aunties (and, to a lesser degree, uncles) have a huge amount of disseminative power and a lot of free time. They wield a formidable authority, particularly in diaspora communities, both as enforcers of values, as organisers and sponsors of social events, and generally as gatekeepers of community interactions and upholders of norms. Collectively and individually, they are forces to be reckoned with, which makes disagreements even more challenging and fraught with risks of falling foul of powerful elders. But they are force multipliers in terms of spreading fake content that is politically inflammatory or conspiratorial, and when unchallenged, they contribute to the general degradation of the information ecosystem and its associated political fallout.How to help themSo, I would say talk to them, keep talking to them, but do it kindly, with time and explanation, rather than frustration and bewilderment. Maybe just acknowledge the content first before pointing out its fakery – a “really cool!” followed a little while later with a “actually, do you think that’s real? I’m not sure”. Also, furnish them with the “tells”: video glitches, lack of shadows, weird blinking. Bear in mind what the world looks like to them. It is a place that is changing too rapidly to assimilate how it is happening. Our elders are also, simply, getting older. With that comes all sorts of uncertainties and unsettlement; loneliness, loss of identity as work is retired from, and children age out of parenting. Exacerbating that are the vast distances that now often separate elders from their kin and peers. Online content and its constant exchange are about so much more than sharing information; it is a new language, almost phatic, for trying to connect.Remember that the tech is evolving so quickly that even the most savvy have to be vigilant. I now have to be on alert after admiring a song with album cover art, a music video, a richly talented singer and fantastic accompanying chorus. After days of trying to hunt down the artist, I was thunderstruck to find out it was all AI. It will happen to all of us. Welcome me to the aunties brigade. Please be kind.

I’ve now read their “what we do” section four or five times, and I have a problem – I can’t figure out what they do. There are two possibilities here. One: they don’t know what they do. Two: what they do is so pointless and embarrassing that they dare not spell it out in plain English. “We forge marketing systems at the forefront of the online wellness space” translates to something like “we use ChatGPT to sell dodgy supplements”.But understanding what so many businesses actuallydois the least of my worries. I’m currently among the5% of Britswho are unemployed. In my six months of job hunting, my total lack of success has begun to make me question my own existence. Just like when you repeat a word over and over until it loses all meaning, when you apply repeatedly for jobs in a similar field, the semantics of the entire situation begin to fall apart like a snotty tissue. About one in five of my job applications elicit a rejection email, usually bemoaning the sheer number of “quality applicants” for the position. For the most part, though – nothing. It’s almost like the job never existed in the first place, and it’s possible that it didn’t.In 2024,40% of companies postedlistings for “ghost jobs”, nonexistent positions advertised to create the illusion that the company is doing well enough to take on new employees. And this seems like an all-too-easy way to lie about your success. Regulation of job ads is mostly the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, which – in all its might – has the power to … have a misleading job ad taken down. So with no particularly harsh consequences for employers, why not go on a pretend hiring spree?Ethics in the job marketseem to have gone out the window, and the idea of wasting the time of thousands of hapless jobseekers doesn’t seem to matter much.Even if the job you’re applying for exists, next comes the hurdle of the AI HR bot. While it’s difficult to find any hard data on just how many employers are using AI to filter applications (sometimes favouring men over women, if a now-scrappedalgorithm used by Amazonis anything to go by),articlesandReddit threadsabout how to game the bots and get in the right “key words” now abound. According to anAtlantic articlefrom earlier this year: “Young people are using ChatGPT to write their applications; HR is using AI to read them; no one is getting hired.” And let’s say your CV and cover letterdomake it past the robot gatekeepers, it’s possible that your interview will beconducted by yet another bot. Although I haven’t had the pleasure of an interview, AI or otherwise, since I began my latest job search, the possibility of not coming into contact with a single human during most of the process to becoming the dodgy supplements social media marketing manager looms large and dreadful.While this scramble for jobs is mostly being framed as a problem forgraduates, I can confirm – as someone who graduated 15 years ago bang into a recession – not only is this the worst job market I’ve ever seen, but it’s also impacting people like me with many years’ experience. During my last period of job hunting, about three years ago, I was at least getting interviews. Interviews with humans, to boot.Given all the skilled people I know who can’t seem to land interviews for even entry-level positions, I’m certain that I’m not an outlier. I’m also convinced that we’re facing a crisis in which middle-class jobs have mutated into rare and disturbing beasts.When, according to its job ad, an indie pet food company called something like Flopsies is looking for a “rock star” and a “unicorn” to revolutionise its social media presence, you know that the job market has become high on its own farts. Ill-defined franken-jobs, requiring everything from SEO expertise to video-editing skills (all for a salary of £27,000 and free protein bars that taste like hay) require cult-like dedication. First, you must convince the fine people at Flopsies that it has been your dream since exiting your mother’s birth canal to sell pet food. You would cut off your own hands for the privilege, and quickly learn to write copy for them by smashing your face into a keyboard. You will convey this in a 400-word cover letter, written in your own blood. This cover letter will then be redirected into the ether by an AI filter, because you didn’t use the phrase “optimising algorithmic relevancy” in it. You will never hear from Flopsies again. You will start this process again and repeat it until you are seen fit for an interview in which you have a few minutes to convince a bot that you’re fit for purpose as both a worker and a human being.The hiring process has become so mechanised, both figuratively and literally, that it’s hard to believe that the people who end up being hired aren’t merely the best at gaming the system. And frankly, all power to them. It’s no skin off my nose if the dodgy supplement or pet-food jobs go to people who are incredible at creating the illusion that they live and breathe pet food and/or dodgy supplements. But in this oh-so-streamlined process, what happens to those of us who can’t or won’t play the game? Of all the applications I’ve sent out recently, I wonder how many have been looked at by humans. There’s only so much shouting into the void about your ability to use a CMS you can do before you give up and start Googling things like: “Can I sell a kidney on Vinted?”Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and DivaExplore more on these topicsUnemploymentOpinionWork & careersArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.OpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.As a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal thatvalued OpenAI at $500bn.OpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.Other deals struck by OpenAI this year includeOraclespending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.In anothertransaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.OpenAI announced on Tuesday that it hadhired the former UK chancellorGeorge Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whoseupdate of its Gemini AI toolgave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.The Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.OpenAI declined to comment.

In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.But his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister,Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.Starmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.Not done, Huang called to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.This week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn ChatGPT maker, Open AI,hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.He was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.They followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that, butsaid he was paid “extremely well”.Meanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.TBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.The Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”Jobs with the biggest US AI companies could be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also required comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing, as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.Selling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.Britain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.The revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield, the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco startup incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.Civil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year tooka senior director general rolein the government’s digital service.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)George OsborneLobbyingNvidiaOpenAIKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.LED face masks are booming in popularity – despite being one of the most expensive at-home beauty products ever to hit the market. Many masks are available, each claiming to either reduce the appearance of fine lines, stop spots or calm redness. Some even combine different types of light to enhance the benefits.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it’s wise to be sceptical about new treatments that are costly and non-invasive, and to do your research before you buy. With this in mind, I spoke with doctors and dermatologists to find out whether these light therapy devices actually work.They’re not a miracle cure for deep-set wrinkles, but experts say the best light therapy masks can promote collagen production, improve elasticity and help smooth skin with sustained use. And while it might seem like a new technology,research dating back to the 90sshows the efficacy of light therapy in wound healing, acne treatment and skin rejuvenation.Red and infrared light are safe to use on all skin types, but be warned that blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones.I’ve tested some of the most popular devices on the market – including infrared masks – to narrow down my favourite LED face masks for treating a range of skin concerns.At a glanceBestLED face maskoverall:CurrentBody Series 2£399.99 at CurrentBodyBest budgetLED face mask:Silk’n LED face mask 100£99.99 at LookfantasticBest for targeting multiple skinconcerns:Shark CryoGlow£299 at John LewisBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin Solo£50.40 at AmazonBest LED mask for treating multiple areas:StylPro Wavelength Pro 5-in-1£249 at LookfantasticWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing health and beauty tech for the past four years. During this time I’ve witnessed many beauty fads come and go. Naturally tight-fisted and a bit of a sceptic, I was initially struck by the cost of these masks. How on earth can an elaborate LED light strip set you back over £300?But after testing multiple light therapy masks, I’ve come to understand the technology behind them, and sadly you won’t be able to engineer your own light therapy system with a costume mask and a set of LED string lights.I don’t have many fine lines or wrinkles to test on, but I can comment on how blue light treatment affects acne because I’ve suffered from it since I was a teenager – despite my mum’s assurances that it would clear up after puberty. The experts I spoke to agreed on the efficacy of red and infrared light for anti-ageing.Are LED face masks actually worth it?Light therapy masks are fantastic additions to a skincare routine, helping to smooth, firm and reduce blemishes. Since I started using one almost a year ago, my skin is calmer, less prone to redness, and has a more even tone.However, LED masks can be expensive, and if you’re not disciplined enough to use one regularly, you won’t see results. Before you jump in and splash between £100 and £400, keep in mind that light therapy masks are most effective when paired with a good skincare routine. It’s crucial to make sure skin is properly cleansed before treatment and protected from sun damage afterwards.If you don’t already have askincareroutine nailed down, don’t buy a light therapy mask just yet. Consider starting out using a gentle cleanser and moisturiser, with anSPFfor daytime. You could also incorporate targeted skincare serums, such asretinolandvitamin C, to help firm and brighten the skin without the need for an expensive light therapy mask.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 13 of the most popular light therapy masks.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSince LED treatments take a while to show visible results, it’s difficult to test multiple light therapy masks at once (at least, without spending a few years testing them), so I enlisted the help of dermatologists who were familiar with light therapy treatments long before they were commercially available.I spoke with Dr Barbara Kubicka, an expert in aesthetic medicine; Dr Derrick Phillips, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation; and aesthetic doctor Dr Priya Verma, an authority on the science of skin ageing.I asked the experts to identify which features of a light therapy mask – such as bulb quality and quantity, light wavelength and treatment time – matter the most, to inform my choices. They also outlined the suitability of light therapy for different skin types and its associated risks.Armed with their advice, I tested the fit, comfort levels and usability of 13 of the most popular light therapy masks and other targeted LED devices. Getting hands on with the masks allowed me to pinpoint any of the key features the experts recommended, as well as useful features I found helpful as a consumer.I’ve been using a light therapy mask regularly for the past 12 months, so I can identify a good mask from a bad one. My tests also included monitoring how well the treatments worked after four nightly sessions, with the obvious caveat that only very minimal results could be observed after such a short-term treatment. I then tested my favourite masks over several months, too, helping me to verify any unique treatment claims – as well as giving me plenty of opportunities to scare my boyfriend by sneaking up on him wearing each one.Only masks that use the brightest, flicker-free bulbs, fit comfortably and are easy to use made the final cut. After testing, I returned the masks sourced for this article to the manufacturers. Where that wasn’t possible, I cleaned the masks and donated them to theRedbridge Reach Outservice, a charity that supports anyone experiencing domestic abuse.The bestLED face masks in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest LED face mask overall:CurrentBody Series 2CurrentBodySeries 2from£399.99£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent facial coverage, comfortable to wear with deep near-infrared lightsWhat we don’t loveOnly one treatment plan and no screen to display treatment timePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonThis is the second red light therapy mask from CurrentBody, and it’s easily the brightest and best-fitting mask I’ve tested. If you want the most powerful red light mask money can buy, I believe this is worth the cost.The mask has 236 LED bulbs that blend red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light, the latter of which is exclusive to the Series 2 mask. Theoriginal mask, which is £100 cheaper, has only the former two light frequencies.The deep near-infrared lights penetrate deeper than the other two types of light, CurrentBody claims. This leads to more effective treatment where it’s needed most – the deep near-infrared bulbs are positioned under the eyes and around the lips to better target areas where ageing is more pronounced. Add surface-level red light and near-infrared light, and you’ve got a face mask that works harder than most.Why we love itI loved how simple the mask was to use. After attaching it to my head using the adjustable straps, I turned on the mask to activate a 10-minute treatment. It offered brilliant facial coverage, wrapping all the way under my chin. And its eye guards were highly effective, blocking any glare from the bright lights and allowing me to continue doing my daily activities – or endlessly scrolling – while wearing the mask.I used this mask for three months, and was pleased to notice my skin tone looking calmer and more even than usual, with less undereye inflammation. As it’s a red light mask, it didn’t have much effect on my acne, but it did help to reduce redness.If you have blemish-prone skin, CurrentBody does sell ablue light maskfor the same price. It has the same comfortable, high-coverage fit and high-quality bulbs, but uses blue and red bulbs (slightly fewer: 220) to target acne-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation.It’s a shame that …the mask offers only one treatment setting and there isn’t a screen displaying the treatment time. Neither is a dealbreaker, but it’s nice to be able to choose different treatments, and almost every other mask includes a countdown timer.Number of LEDs:236Number of settings:oneTreatment time:10minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm)Timer countdown:noCurrentBodySeries 2from£399.99£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent facial coverage, comfortable to wear with deep near-infrared lightsWhat we don’t loveOnly one treatment plan and no screen to display treatment timeBest budget LED face mask:Silk’n LED face mask 100Silk’nLED face mask 100from£89.99£89.99 at Lookfantastic£160 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveComfortable to use, good colour choices, accessible priceWhat we don’t loveFewer bulbs than higher-end models and no near-infraredPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99.99 at Lookfantastic£160 at Cult BeautyIf you want to try light therapy without remortgaging the house, the Silk’n LED face mask 100 is a good choice. It has 100 LED bulbs with good facial coverage, is comfortable to wear and offers a good range of light colours. It doesn’t have near-infrared lights like the pricier options, but it covers the basics at a decent price.Why we love itThis mask offers four colour modes: red, blue, yellow and purple. Red light helps stimulate collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines, while blue light helps to soothe breakouts. The purple light comes from mixing the aforementioned blue and red lights, combining the effects of both to boost the skin’s overall evenness.Although less widely researched (and with limited clinical evidence to suggest efficacy), the experts I spoke to said the yellow light treatment could help improve hydration levels in the skin. I didn’t notice a huge hydration hit when testing this feature, so if your skin is crying out for hydration, I recommend using the other light settings alongside ahydrating serum.Each colour can be selected individually for a 10-minute targeted session, or you can select automatic mode, which cycles through the colours over 15 minutes to provide all the benefits at once.I found the Silk’n light therapy mask simple to use and comfortable to wear. Its flexible silicone build didn’t feel quite as sturdy as more expensive options, but I didn’t really notice this when using the mask. The built-in eye shields weren’t as bulky as others, but they still blocked out the light and protected my eyes well.The automatic mode left my skin feeling completely comfortable, with a slightly glowier finish than usual – just what I’d expect from an entry-level mask like this one.It’s a shame that …there’s no timer and it has fewer than half the bulbs of the CurrentBody, with no near-infrared light treatment for effective collagen stimulation deeper in the skin. This means it’s better for light-touch anti-ageing, and for soothing, acne-busting blue light treatments.Number of LEDs:100Number of settings:5Treatment time:10 or 15minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), purple (463-633nm), blue (463nm), yellow (592nm)Timer countdown:noSilk’nLED face mask 100from£89.99£89.99 at Lookfantastic£160 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveComfortable to use, good colour choices, accessible priceWhat we don’t loveFewer bulbs than higher-end models and no near-infraredBest for targeting multiple skin concerns:Shark CryoGlowSharkCryoGlowfrom£299£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkWhat we loveIntuitive to use, good targeted treatments and soothing undereye coolingWhat we don’t loveHeavy mask that presses into the under eyes when recliningPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkMany will be familiar with Shark’s vacuum cleaners and hair-styling gadgets, but the brand’s latest venture is in skincare. The Shark CryoGlow is the only LED face mask to offer built-in undereye cooling alongside targeted light therapy for anti-ageing and acne repair.Why we love itThe CryoGlow offers three different wavelengths of light: blue, red and deep-infrared. It has three presets for “better ageing”, “blemish repair” and “skin sustain”. If these aren’t clear enough, the control screen explains exactly what each mode is designed to do, making it really user-friendly.I found the lights incredibly bright during my tests – though for safety they automatically dim when you remove the mask from your face – but I was happy with how the mask shielded my eyes.During every treatment, you can choose to switch on the cooling undereye patches, which aim to de-puff and soothe your skin. The cooling can also be used on its own, without the LEDs. There are three levels, the coolest of which felt startlingly cold at first but did a great job of calming down my eyes on a particularly bad hay fever day. Likewise, the blemish mode did a brilliant job of calming spots and redness with sustained use. I also liked using the skin sustain mode for a quick pick-me-up to brighten my skin before a night out.As you might imagine, using the cooling feature on full blast drains the battery more quickly. I performed two battery-rundown tests on the CryoGlow without cooling, and it managed 17 treatments. With maximum cooling enabled, however, this dropped to just seven. That’s still a decent number of treatments in between charges, but it’s something to bear in mind.It’s a shame that …since it’s made of plastic, it’s noticeably heavier than its silicone competitors. Thankfully, Shark has made the mask fit comfortably by using cushioned inserts at the forehead, brow and nose area.That’s when you’re sitting up, at least; when lying down, the metal cooling patches pressed into the delicate area under my eyes. Another unfortunate side-effect of the cooling is the whirring noise it makes – inaudible from far away, but pretty noisy when pressed on to your face.Number of LEDs:160Number of settings:fourTreatment time:4-8mins light therapy; 5-15mins under-eye coolingLight frequencies:red (630nm), infrared light (830nm), blue light (415nm)Timer countdown:yesSharkCryoGlowfrom£299£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkWhat we loveIntuitive to use, good targeted treatments and soothing undereye coolingWhat we don’t loveHeavy mask that presses into the under eyes when recliningBest LED device for acne-prone skin:Lustre ClearSkin SoloLustreClearSkin Solofrom£50.40£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonWhat we loveTargeted blemish treatments in a portable packageWhat we don’t loveLeech-like appearance and extra running costPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonAcne can be a real pain, and many cosmetic treatments that target it leave skin feeling irritated, dry and flaky. These nifty adhesive LED patches from Lustre use blue light, which the company claims reduces acne-causing bacteria.Why we love itEach Solo patch has 15 pure blue LEDs at theproven wavelength for treating acne, 415nm. The patches cover a targeted area of skin about 2.5 x 5cm, which is perfect for treating problem areas such as the chin, cheeks and forehead. Since they’re rechargeable and far smaller than a typical LED face mask, they’re highly portable, making it easy to stay consistent with treatments wherever you are.I found the targeted treatments very effective for minimising breakouts in my chin area – somewhere I often struggle with spots. My skin was also quicker to heal, with fewer breakouts, the longer I continued with treatments.The patches come with a supply of double-sided adhesive to fix each one to your skin, allowing you to move around freely during treatment. This also means, unlike typical light therapy masks, they can be safely fixed anywhere on the body.If you’re worried that the adhesive will feel uncomfortable or be tricky to remove from breakouts, don’t be. The patches are so lightweight that the adhesive doesn’t need to be very strong. I found it easy and comfortable to peel off the patches after the recommended 20-minute treatment time.It’s a shame that …you need to buy the sticky patches when they run out. These cost£18 for a pack of 60, or 30p each. They also look a bit like leeches – only you can decide if that’s more palatable than the Hannibal Lecter look of the full-face LED masks.Number of LEDs:15Number of settings:oneTreatment time:20minsLight frequencies:blue (415nm)Timer countdown:noLustreClearSkin Solofrom£50.40£63 at Lustre£50.40 at AmazonWhat we loveTargeted blemish treatments in a portable packageWhat we don’t loveLeech-like appearance and extra running costBest LED mask for treating multiple areas:StylPro Wavelength Pro 5-in-1StylProWavelength Pro 5-in-1from£249£249 at Lookfantastic£249 at AmazonWhat we loveAdjustable design and versatile settingsWhat we don’t loveLess close contact with the chin areaPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£249 at Lookfantastic£249 at AmazonThe neck and decollete are often the first places to show signs of ageing, as the skin is thinner in those areas. Consequently, expensive neck light therapy masks have started to flood the market – but rather than requiring additional expensive kit, this StylPro option can be adjusted to treat multiple areas.Whether your main concern is ageing on your face and neck or treating blemishes on your upper back, the Wavelength Pro can be used to treat it. It can also treat the scalp using red light, which research suggests canstimulate hair growth.Why we love itThis mask is incredibly versatile. It has red, deep red, near-infrared and blue light, which all combine into 11 programs to target different areas of concern on your body. The remote control has a huge screen, making it easy to select the desired program and treatment zone. This also displays the mask’s battery life and treatment time.In my tests, the straps did a great job of keeping the flexible silicone mask in place. Its eye shields were also brilliant at blocking out light, and the snap fasteners made it easy to adjust the mask between different treatment areas. To treat the back and neck area, I found you needed to lie down or sit up very straight to prevent it from slipping, but it was great to have the versatility.This is also the only mask I’ve tested that has a silver reflective surface behind the LEDs, and a negative meniscus lens over each of the 137 bulbs. This crescent moon shaped lens has a sharper curve on its concave surface, which causes the light to spread out. StylPro claims this helps to enhance the light dispersion, to get more even coverage, unlike the focused treatment spots you find in other light therapy masks. I didn’t notice this making a huge difference to my results, but it didn’t hurt either.It’s a shame that …when used in face mode, the mask hangs a few inches away from the chin area, which means the light has less direct contact there. Its eye guards also tended to gently pinch the bridge of my nose when worn.Number of LEDs:137Number of settings:11Treatment time:12-15minsLight frequencies:red (633nm), deep red (655nm) near-infrared (830nm), blue (415nm)Timer countdown:yesStylProWavelength Pro 5-in-1from£249£249 at Lookfantastic£249 at AmazonWhat we loveAdjustable design and versatile settingsWhat we don’t loveLess close contact with the chin areaThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘You can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face’: the Lustre ClearSkin Renew Pro Facewear.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianZkin light therapy maskZkinLight therapy mask£499£499 at ZkinWhat we loveIntuitive controls with comfortable eye guardsWhat we don’t loveIts price tag and limited availabilityPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£499 at ZkinBest for:anti-blemish and anti-ageing in a flexible maskIf the Shark CryoGlow listed above tempts you but you don’t want to use the noisy cooling patches, this mask from Zkin is a brilliant alternative. You may not recognise the brand, but it’s the brainchild of medical consultant Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme.The mask comes with the most widely researched red, blue and near-infrared light, with three modes: red, blue and combination. Whichever you choose, the mask uses near-infrared light tostimulate repair below the skin’s surface and boost circulation. Since it’s made from flexible silicone with removable eye inserts, I found it very comfortable to wear during testing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pretty expensive. You’d be better off buying the CurrentBody mask if you’re after very powerful red light treatment and coverage. It also has fewer bulbs than masks of a similar price.Number of LEDs:122;number of settings:three;treatment time:10mins;light frequencies:blue (460nm), red (630nm and 660nm), and near-infrared (850nm);timer countdown:yesZkinLight therapy mask£499£499 at ZkinWhat we loveIntuitive controls with comfortable eye guardsWhat we don’t loveIts price tag and limited availabilityFlikeze PhotonMask QuintFlikezePhotonMask Quintfrom£159.99£179.99 at Flikeze£159.99 at AmazonWhat we loveComfortable to wear and a good range of coloursWhat we don’t loveNo nose coveragePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£179.99 at Flikeze£159.99 at AmazonBest for:a comfortable fitThe Flikeze light therapy mask offers a wide range of light colours: red, near-infrared, blue, green and yellow. Its settings include anti-ageing (red light), repair (yellow), brightening (green) and acne care (blue and red), and you can choose to do a 10- or 15-minute treatment. These all use near-infrared rather than deep infrared light.The best thing about this mask is how comfortable it is. It has two straps that wrap around the top and bottom of your head, holding it to your face without the mask ever feeling weighty or digging in. Its eye shades fit like diving goggles and kept my eyes completely shaded from light during treatment (you can see how little light leakage there is in the haunting photograph from testing).It didn’t make the final cut because …for the cost, it has fewer bulbs than average and the bulbs don’t cover the bridge of your nose – not a likely problem area for wrinkles, but spots can be a problem there. It also looks particularly disconcerting when worn.Number of LEDs:92;number of settings:four;treatment time:10-15mins;light frequencies:red (660nm), near-infrared (850nm), blue (415nm), green (532nm), yellow (590nm);timer countdown:yesFlikezePhotonMask Quintfrom£159.99£179.99 at Flikeze£159.99 at AmazonWhat we loveComfortable to wear and a good range of coloursWhat we don’t loveNo nose coverageLustre ClearSkin Renew Pro FacewearLustreClearSkin Renew Pro Facewearfrom£224.99£224.99 at Boots£225 at LustreWhat we loveApp control for personalised treatmentsWhat we don’t loveLess comfortable to wearPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£224.99 at Boots£225 at LustreBest for:wireless controls and customised treatmentMost light treatment masks have wired controls. That doesn’t mean you need to remain tethered to a single spot, but it does mean there’s a remote that you have to carry around with you. This mask from Lustre, on the other hand, is controlled via a mobile app.It has two programs, called Energise and Revitalise, and uses blue, red and near-infrared light. Unusually, you can choose which kind of light you want to use in four areas of your face: forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks and chin. In my tests, I liked being able to treat spots on my chin with blue light while using red light on the rest of my face.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not very comfortable. Since the battery is on the mask itself, it’s a little top heavy, and the eye protectors don’t do a great job of shielding your eyes.

The Silk’n LumiLips has 30 LEDsconcentrated in the lip area, covering smile lines and the chin. It has five light frequencies – amber, red, dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared. The only other mask on this roundup offering deep near-infrared light is the CurrentBody 2 mask, which gives you a good idea of how much value it offers.The mask has two modes, both of which use dark red, near-infrared and deep near-infrared light. The red-light mode claims to promote lip volume and firmness,while the second mode adds in amber light to reduce pigmentation and redness. I love that the mask requires only a five-minute daily treatment, making its less-than-comfortable mouthpiece slightly more bearable.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s built like an adult pacifier and feels like one too. You have to bite down on the mouthpiece to keep it in place, which is far less comfortable than just wearing a mask with a strap around your head.Number of LEDs:30;number of settings:two;treatment time:5mins;light frequencies:amber (605nm), red (633nm), dark red (660nm), near-infrared (830nm), deep near-infrared (1,072nm);timer countdown:noSilk’nLumiLips LED lip maskfrom£79£79 at Lookfantastic£80 at BootsWhat we loveDeep near-infrared light and concentrated treatmentWhat we don’t loveLess comfortable to wear than a maskPeep Club heated eye wand LED+Peep ClubHeated eye wand LED+from£85£85 at Peep Club£85 at Victoria HealthWhat we loveDedicated, soothing treatment for eye areaWhat we don’t loveSmall LED light coveragePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£85 at Peep Club£85 at Victoria HealthBest for:reviving and soothing the undereyesLED face masks need eye guards to protect your eyes from the light, which means they neglect to treat the delicate skin underneath – an area particularly prone to fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.The Peep Club heated eye wand is a nifty little gadget that was designed in collaboration with optometrists, primarily as a hot compress to help with dry, tired eyes. The LED+ model includes a small LED light, which glows red to reduce fine lines and amber to decrease the visible blood vessels that cause dark circles. There’s also green light for soothing inflammation, although the evidence around green light is shaky.During testing, I found it soothed my irritated eyes after long days staring at a screen. The amber light setting seemed to reduce my dark circles, too, after a few weeks of consistent use. As recommended, I used it with thePeep Club coconut eye balmto give the wand a bit of slip, which avoided irritating the delicate skin under my eyes.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not as convenient to use as a dedicated mask, since you have to glide it over the skin. Its LED light is small, so you need to dedicate a lot of time to treatment to get the best results. While I love using the coconut eye balm and a 40ml tub lasts a long time, it leaves an oily slip on the skin after treatment, and the need for this extra running cost may be off-putting.Number of LEDs:not listed;number of settings:five, three with LED;treatment time:5mins;light frequencies: amber (605nm), red (633nm), green (525nm);timer countdown:yesPeep ClubHeated eye wand LED+from£85£85 at Peep Club£85 at Victoria HealthWhat we loveDedicated, soothing treatment for eye areaWhat we don’t loveSmall LED light coverageWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenSeveral LED colours are available, with each wavelength claiming to target a different skin concern.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianWhat is LED therapy, and how does it work?“LED (light-emitting diode) therapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate various cellular processes in the skin,” says aesthetic medicine expert Kubicka. “Depending on the colour or wavelength, LED light can target inflammation, promote collagen production, accelerate healing and even kill bacteria.”Light therapy is a great addition to your skincare routine – for me, it’s helped reduce breakouts, improve healing and reduce the appearance of my acne scars. LED face masks are quick, gentle and non-invasive, and suitable for most skin types (although as mentioned above, blue light can worsen hyperpigmentation on darker skin tones, according to the experts I spoke with). The masks are effective and foolproof to use, and the daily treatments also force you to take a little time for yourself – perfect for a morning pick-me-up or an evening wind-down.Does red light help with anti-ageing?“Red-light therapy can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles through a process called photobiomodulation,” says consultant dermatologist Phillips. “It energises mitochondria, which are the batteries of the cells, powering the production of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts, the factories of the skin.”Elastin and collagen are “the building blocks of firm, youthful skin”, says Kubicka. Stimulating the production of these molecules can “improve skin density, elasticity and overall smoothness” as long as you complete treatments regularly.I have yet to develop fine lines or wrinkles, but I’m keen to avoid them by using red-light therapy for “preventive ageing”. However, “most of the clinical evidencefocuses on treating visible signs of ageing or repairing damaged skin, rather than long-term prevention in younger skin,” as aesthetic doctor Verma explains.Still, Verma reassured me my efforts wouldn’t be in vain. “Using LED light consistently and appropriately may help support overall skin health […] especially when combined with sun protection and a good skincare routine.”What different colours of light therapy are available?Several colours are available, with each wavelength claiming to target a different skin concern. These colours correlate to the visible light spectrum, and each can have a different effect on the skin.Red light has a wavelength of between 630 and 700nm and is the most widely known form of light therapy, loved for its non-invasive potential anti-ageing benefits. Near-infrared light above 700nm “penetrates the skin more deeply to support tissue repair and reduce inflammation”, according to Kubicka. Blue light therapy (415nm), on the other hand, has been proven to target acne-causing bacteria, leading to a reduction in breakouts over time. Kubicka also says blue light can help regulate oil production – another common problem for those with acne.The effect of some types of light on the skin are better researched than others.Near-infrared,red lightandblue lightare backed by scientific studies that identify the biological processes that each type of light triggers in the body.Meanwhile, research into green and yellow light is more limited. One study questions theefficacy of yellow lighttherapy and claims that a previous study may have been influenced by the placebo effect. Similarly, a study ongreen light therapysuggests that more research is needed to provide a solid recommendation for use as an anti-ageing treatment.How and when would you recommend using light therapy?The “how” is simple: always use light therapy masks on freshly washed, dry skin, before applying serums and creams. This will give the light the most direct access to the skin.Despite what some instruction manuals advise, don’t jump into daily treatments straight away – you may end up with slightly irritated skin. Start by introducing treatments two to three times a week, and monitoring the impact on your skin. If you don’t notice any sensitivity, you can incorporate more treatments, if permitted by the manufacturer’s guidelines.Once your skin is used to the treatment, “home devices should be used three to five times a week, for 10-20 minutes a session,” says Phillips. Don’t expect instant results, though. If you’re hoping to treat breakouts, you should “see a reduction in redness and the frequency of acne breakouts within two to four weeks”. Those using red light for anti-ageing benefits will need to wait a little longer: “It typically takes six to eight weeks to see visible changes.”Is light therapy safe for all skin tones?“LED light therapy is generally very safe when used correctly,” says Verma. This is because, unlike laser hair removal, it only uses low-level, non-thermal light. “The most common side effects are mild and temporary, such as slight redness, dryness or irritation.”“People with known photosensitive disorders or taking medications that make them more sensitive to light (eg certain antibiotics) should consult their doctor,” says Phillips. He also warns that those with darker skin tones should exercise caution when using blue light, since “some blue wavelengths have been associated with hyperpigmentation”. The Lustre ClearSkin Solo patches recommended above offer exclusively blue light, but the other masks on this roundup have blue-light-free settings if you do find that it causes sensitivity.How much should I spend on an LED therapy mask?There are hundreds of light therapy masks available at different prices, but the quality varies wildly. You may see results from a budget-friendly mask, such as the£100 Silk’n mask, but spending more will generally get you a larger quantity of bulbs that offer a greater range of wavelengths. You’re also more likely to get a mask with a better fit and coverage.The best mask for you will depend on your skin concerns and budget. Those hoping to invest in a mask with anti-acne properties will be able to spend less, since blue light is more widely available, but if you’re looking for the best anti-ageing deep near-infrared light therapy, you will need to part with more cash.High-end red light therapy masks can cost up to £500; if you spend that much, just make sure you use it regularly, or you won’t see results.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responsesGuardian readersWed 17 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 07.34 ESTShareAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached thehighest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a songthought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.With this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.‘There was one song I actually liked’I have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some peoplefall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content.Casey, 37, Chicago, US‘There’s no heart in music generated by AI’There’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.As for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website.Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland‘I’m happy with musicians using AI as a tool’I believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.But I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions.Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, SouthamptonView image in fullscreenLess than fab … AI-generated band Velvet Sundown.Illustration: Velvet Sundown‘It’s stopping creativity’AI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.If you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material.Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham‘It’s not a neutral tool ’When social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.Blatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void.Charlotte, student, CornwallMusicians are deeply concerned about AI. So why are the major labels embracing it?Read more‘I worry I would become dependent on the technology’In my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.I might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.Geoff Smith, 65, musician and retired headteacher, CornwallExplore more on these topicsMusicArtificial intelligence (AI)Pop and rockComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By portraying Fallout’s retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic US through three different characters, it managed to capture different aspects of the game player’s experience, too. There was vault-dweller Lucy, trying to do the right thing and finding that the wasteland made that very difficult; Max, the Brotherhood of Steel rookie, who starts to question his cult’s authority and causes a lot of havoc in robotic power armour; and the Ghoul, Walton Goggins’s breakout character, who has long since lost any sense of morality out in the irradiated wilderness.The show’s first season ended with a revelation about who helped cause the nuclear war that trapped a group of people in underground vaults for a couple of centuries. It also left plenty of questions open for the second season – and, this time, expectations are higher. Even being “not terrible” was a win for a video game adaptation until quite recently. How are the Fallout TV show’s creators feeling now that the first season has been a success?“We’ll take ‘not terrible’ – let’s get that on a poster,” says Jonah Nolan, the director who co-created the series with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. I’m speaking to them alongside Bethesda’s Todd Howard, director of the most recent Fallout video games. Ilast met with Nolan and Howardin 2024, before the first season premiered. Howard had been holding out a long time to make a Fallout adaptation, waiting for someone who seemed to really understand the series. Nolan, a lifelong player, was that person. Howard was poised with a red pen when he received the first script, but was relieved to find it was “fabulous”.“Going into the first season everyone’s like, ‘Just get it right’,” says Howard. “We’re over the moon with the reception to the show, so this time people are coming in with more excitement and different expectations.”View image in fullscreenA criminal paradise … Fallout: New Vegas.Photograph: BethesdaThe second season is set in New Vegas, the site of 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas, which had the best writing and characters of any game in the series, even if it was a bit broken. The post-nuclear Strip was a kind of decaying criminal paradise full of warring factions and down-and-out inhabitants having as good a time as they can, given the bleak circumstances. It was shot in the real-world Nevada desert, and all over California. “It’s more of a desert vibe, a Mohave vibe, that’s so essential to that game,” says Nolan. “That dusty, blasted-out Route 66 vibe of the game is so much fun to bring into the show.”In the show, a long time has passed since the events of the New Vegas game by the time Lucy and the Ghoul arrive in the city, but Howard says that it does reference the player’s journey. “When you’re doing a location that gamers know so well … honouring everyone’s journey through that game was a trick,” he says. “Time has moved on. What is New Vegas like now?… if you’re a fan of that game there’s so much to love in season two, visually and also with the factions and what’s going on with them.”The Fallout TV series has a tactile feel – its creators ensured real props and sets were built, echoing the cobbled-together nature of the settlements in the games, where everyone is building stuff out of trash and every town is shoved together from whatever anyone can find. “As a sci-fi fan, so many shows I watch, I’m aware that they’re all standing in front of a blue screen,” says Robertson-Dworet. “The whole point of an adaptation, especially of a video game, is to feel like it’s real … of course, we still augment with VFX but, wherever possible, actors are actually standing in front of locations I loved seeing in the game.”In fact, pretty much everything you see on-screen is real, even the infamously terrifying irradiated monsters, the Deathclaws. They were scary even as blobs of pixels in the original 90s Fallout games. In the show, they’re puppets, and apparently pretty frightening up close. “It was the closest look I’d ever gotten at a Deathclaw. In Fallout 4, whenever I saw one, it would instantly kill me,” laughs Nolan. “It was quite peculiar being able to stand there and stare at it.”“Even the radscorpion puppet was amazingly scary,” adds Robertson-Dworet. “It was sobig– the mama scorp, that is. The little ones were fine, they were like overgrown lobsters, but it was genuinely very scary when the puppeteer was charging the big one at me.”The Fallout series works because it’s made by talented film-makers who are also players and with the help of the people who created the actual games. Howard is replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment and resuming a long-dormant obsession with EA’s college (American) football games; Nolan has spent the summer playingZelda: Tears of the Kingdomwith his entire family; Robertson-Dworet is still working on scripts for the show, so she’s playing a lot of New Vegas (as is her husband).(Not everyone involved with the show is a gamer, though. In an interview withPC Gamer, Goggins the Ghoul said he had never played a Fallout game and had no intention of doing so. “No, I haven’t sat down to play the games. And I won’t. I won’t,” he said. “I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.” It’s OK, Walton, nobody is judging your gamer cred.)The second season is coming out weekly rather than in one binge-able batch of episodes, so we will all be experiencing it differently from last season – including Howard, Nolan and Robertson-Dworet, who will now be looking out for people’s reactions every week.“It has more depth, it’s bigger, it’s funnier, it has a lot of surprises,” says Howard. “I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.”What to playView image in fullscreenA folklore mystery … Year Walk.Illustration: SimogoSwedish developer Simogo made some of the most interesting iPhone and iPad games of the 2010s, from the unforgettable puzzle game Device 6 to the eerieYear Walk.

Tired of the fussy nature of console development, the pair would stake their claim on Apple’s App Store, which in 2010 was regarded as one of the most exciting frontiers in games. Mashing their names together to form a portmanteau, Flesser and Gardebäck became Simogo, and a consistently wonderful and forward-thinking games studios was born.Simogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years. Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.Thank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)And oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.Simogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s originon their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.Times have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.Simogo Legacy Collection is out now; £13.49Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The email struck a polite, bureaucratic tone, thanking her for her service and offering an upbeat rationale for a new “focus on children’s health”.It omitted the fact that,according to a Harvard Crimson source, Bassett had been asked to resign just two hours earlier and instructed to vacate her office by the end of the year. The decision was not a routine administrative transition. It was the culmination of a year of escalating pressure on the Center for Health and Human Rights for its work on the health and human rights of Palestinians. Powerful figures inside and outside Harvard, including the former Harvard president andnow thoroughlydisgracedeconomist Larry Summers,condemned this work and claimedit “foments antisemitism”. A leading public health scholar whose career has been defined by work on racial justice, poverty, HIV, and global inequality appears to have been removed not because her commitments shifted, but because the political costs of applying those commitments to Palestinians became too great for Harvard to tolerate.Bassett’s ouster from the center, sincedenouncedby hundreds of Harvard faculty and students, is not an isolated institutional failure. It exposes a deeper crisis in three intertwined domains often treated as guardians of modern moral universalism: human rights institutions, global public health organizations, and American universities. All have long claimed to speak for everyone. All have repeatedly insisted that their missions transcend partisanship, borders, racial and gender differences, class, and interest groups. And all – when confronted with the political pressures surrounding Palestine – have shown how conditional their commitments have always been.Universalism that never wasGlobal public health and human rights institutions often present themselves as frameworks rooted in the simple idea that every life holds equal value. But as historians such asSamuel Moynhave shown, the modern concept of universal human rights emerged in a geopolitical landscape dominated by powerful Euro-American states and has been regularly used to launder, rather than confront, the inequalities of the postcolonial order. Their universalism was – and remains – in fact thoroughly selective and particular in practice. Countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany – all of which have styled themselves as leaders of “the free world” and beacons of the Enlightenment – have often condemned abuses by geopolitical rivals while overlooking or rationalizing atrocities committed by their own leaders, citizens and allies.Global health bears a similar imprint. Itsmodern institutionsgrew from colonial medicine, cold war politics, and philanthropic ventures – think theGates Foundation, which today dominates global public health – that position wealthy countries as benevolent benefactors and poorer countries as recipients of their expertise and good will. Still today, global health initiatives operate primarily by extending the reach ofprofit-oriented medical technologieswithout redistributingthe political or economic power that determines who becomes ill and who receives care. For decades, they have treated structural violence as a technical problem andobscured the asymmetriesthat structure ill health around the world.Harvard appears to think all Jews support Israel. That is discriminatory | Barry Trachtenberg, Victor Silverman, Atalia Omer, Raz Segal, Rebecca T AlpertRead moreElite universities have played an integral role in sustaining these contradictions. They call for universal access to knowledge and the fearless pursuit of truth, yet their political horizons have always been tightly circumscribed by their relationships to donors, governments, and the economic order they help reproduce. American universities market themselves as neutral spaces above conflict, even as such claims to neutrality are quite clearly deployed as a strategy for protecting the status quo. Harvard has cultivated a reputation as a steward of global leadership and moral seriousness while consistently deferring to the sensitivities of powerful constituencies – from billionaire donors to political leaders like Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu – at the expense of vulnerable ones.In each of these realms – human rights, global health, and elite academia – universalism has been not a historical reality or even a genuinely motivating ideal but instead a self-flattering, inequality-obscuring and power-reproducing story.These frameworks nonetheless remain valuable – not because they tell the truth, but because they express a demand and a dream to expand the circle of concern and rights-bearing groups beyond their inherited boundaries. Their ethical force is in their capacity to enable critique, to expose oppressive power, and to insist that exclusions be acknowledged, dissected and corrected.The danger today is not that these projects have been revealed as imperfect – that has long been known to any who cared to see past the veneer of Ivy-League claims. The danger is that, confronted withPalestine, these institutions and their leaders are increasingly retreating from even the pretense of or aspiration to universality.The Palestine exception and the collapse of credibilityUnder Bassett’s leadership, the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights actually did what human rights and global health institutions routinely only claim to do: it examined the health consequences of political violence and structural inequality, regardless of whether it pleased donors, administrators, or government officials. Its partnership with Birzeit University in the West Bank produced research on early childhood development under occupation and documented the public health effects of Israel’s decades-long policies in Palestine.After 7 October 2023, however, the Center became a target for those seeking to obscure, rationalize and enable Israeli war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Larry Summersdenouncedthe Birzeit partnership and called for itsimmediate dissolution. The Trump administration demandedan external auditandfroze federal fundingwhen Harvard refused itslist of demands. Aninternal sham antisemitism taskforcecriticizedthe center’s programming.By spring, Harvard had suspended the Birzeit partnership entirely.I’m an Israeli professor. Why is my work in Harvard’s antisemitism report? |Read moreOver the last year, Harvard has publicly positioned itself as the nation’s chief defender of academic freedom against the Trump administration’s unprecedented demands that universities restructure governance and hiring, perform program audits, and curb campus speech, including bysuingthe administration after the government froze over $2.2bn in federal research funding. But as critics – includinghundreds of faculty signatoriesto criticism’s of Harvard’s preemptive concessions and self-censorship – have noted, Harvard’s public “resistance” has coincided with myriad quiet changes that have curtailed programming on Palestine, censored faculty and students, suspended key partnerships and academic initiatives, and reflected a systematic erasure of scholarship critical of Israeli state violence and US support for it. On the issues where academic freedom and institutional integrity aremost under attack and where genuine resistance matters most, Harvard has increasingly simply capitulated to power.Bassett’s removal, which comes after she personally published essays (includingtwowith me),peer-reviewed scientific research, and madecourageous public statementsin which she named and condemned Israeli crimes against Gaza’s health systems, medical workers, and patients, is the clearest concession yet to growing reactionary forces at Harvard. It signals that the university’s celebrated commitments to academic freedom and human rights evaporate when the political costs rise and when oppressive power is challenged and named for what it is. The same institution that teaches students to interrogate structures of domination and to analyze the social determinants of health has apparently demoted a scholar for doing precisely that when and where it is most urgent. (Bassett will, for the time being, remain a professor in the School of Public Health’s behavioral and social sciences department.)This “Palestine exception” is not unique to Harvard. Across the US, medical and public health professionals who speak about Gaza’s devastation face institutional reprimand, social ostracism, andthreats to their employment. Hospitals havefired cliniciansfor naming genocide or simplystating that Palestinians should live. Non-profits haveavoided public statementsin support of Palestinians. Universities that long invoked analysis of decolonization and apartheid in their course catalogues now police speech about Israeli state violence against Palestinians and the history of illegal Israeli settlements and land theft with extraordinary zeal.These responses are not simply inconsistencies. They expose how much of the universalist rhetoric surrounding human rights, global health and elite academia has depended on a tacit understanding: the universal holds unless it threatens powerful interests. Palestine has become the defining site where that understanding is most violently enforced, presenting a microcosm of a much broader reality.But what is unfolding in Gaza cannot be made to fit within these institutional silences. More than90% of Gaza’s hospitals have been damaged or destroyed. Medical workers have been killed invast numbers. Famine and disease now spread through a trapped population deprived of electricity, clean water and basic medical care. These conditions are not incidental to war; they are the architecture of a genocide via a deliberately constructed public health catastrophe. To forbid scholars of health and human rights from naming these realities is to demand that global public health and human rights efforts abandon their foundational premises and offer themselves as nothing but instruments for whitewashing imperial violence.What makes this moment particularly stark is that human rights and global health initiatives have long been criticized – correctly – for their selective morality. Yet now, rather than confronting this history and expanding their commitments, US institutions appear determined to contract them further. The choice is no longer between a flawed universalism and a more honest one; it is between flawed universalism and none at all.What must survive this momentGiven the histories at play, some might argue that human rights and global health projects do not deserve rescue. If these frameworks have always served the interests of powerful states and individuals at the expense of those they have dispossessed and exploited, why defend them now? Why mourn their erosion at Harvard, of all places?Because even a compromised universalism provides a vocabulary for demanding equality that authoritarian politics cannot tolerate. Because institutions that acknowledge their failures can correct them, while institutions that deny their obligations altogether cannot. And because abandoning universalism under pressure from governments, donors and political actors would confirm the most cynical assessment of American power: that our ethical commitments from within US institutions can only ever extend as far as strategic alliances allow.The way universities can survive the Trump era? Band together in an alliance | David KirpRead moreBassett’s removal demonstrates what happens when institutions choose short-term protection over intellectual and ethical integrity. But it also clarifies what remains worth fighting for. A public health field that cannot describe the destruction of Gaza’s health system forfeits its credibility on every other question of justice and claim to truth. A human rights discourse that excludes Palestinians cannot credibly defend anyone. And a university that punishes scholars for naming political violence does not merely betray its ideals; it becomes a malign force in the world it claims to seek to redeem and to carry forward into a better future.Human rights, global health and elite universities have never lived up to their universalist claims. But their value has always depended on the possibility of doing better. Their legitimacy requires the courage to widen their moral horizon, not shrink it. That work begins by refusing to treat Palestinians as an exception and, in recognition of the pressure to do so, to instead insist upon fighting for Palestinian rights as the vanguard of any genuine claim to ethical legitimacy.Mary Bassett’s removal is an act of cowardice amid fascist pressure. It also provides what should be a galvanizing moment of reckoning. It underlines that universal rights to health, freedom and safety are not a stable inheritance but are instead necessarily practices that must be chosen, fought for, defended, and continually repaired against the violence enacted in the interests of powerful actors and by their functionaries like university deans, presidents and board members. The power of ideals of universality lies not in their origins, which have never been pure, but in their potential to expose their own limits and the malign forces behind them while propelling us to condemn their hypocrisy, depose them, and build something new in their place.Eric Reinhartis a political anthropologist, psychiatrist and psychoanalystExplore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityOpinionPalestineHuman rightsHigher educationUS universitiesGazaUS educationcommentShareReuse this content"

A potential disaster for the corporation and the UK, but a good day’s work for this presidentWed 17 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.20 ESTShareLove Actually may be a terrible movie, but it provides one speech that’s hard not to wish into reality this Christmas. Keir Starmer, the actual, nonfictional UK prime minister, needs to channel the one played by Hugh Grant – and stand up to an absurd US presidentnow bullying the BBC with a $10bn lawsuit.Just imagine for one moment that Starmer decided to make Donald Trump’s claim against the BBC the final straw for a special relationship that is increasingly special only in a bad way. That would not be outlandish, for not only has Trump taken aim against a British broadcaster, but earlier this week it seemed that hispromise of an AI “prosperity deal”(bought, let’s not forget, with gurning invites to Windsor Castle) is set to evaporate. As the fictional Love Actually PM once said: “A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend … Since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger.”Others see this for what it is. Starmer’s own health minister, Stephen Kinnock, as well as rivals such as Ed Davey, are already among those urging him to make a stand. But in their heart of hearts they must know that, here in the real world, the chances of Starmer calling Trump a bullying narcissist – who uses lawsuits and threats at a time when the BBC is already under immense pressure andnow facing a charter review– and all to divert attention away from his own failings, is less likely to happen than Hugh Grant standing for office.So it now remains to ask how on earth the BBC is going to fight his wildly inappropriate case. So far, its instincts are sound: it says it will fight and in the first instance – on a variety of legal and factual grounds –will seek to have the case dismissed, before the portentous costs spiral.And that must be right, for anyone struggling with the appropriateness or otherwise of this should firstly remember that this is a US president suing a news organisation paid for by all British citizens, over mistakes made in a 12-second clip not actually available in Florida, where he decided to file his 33-page complaint.It’s hard even to see what the lawsuit’s jurisdictional basis is, given the fact that the BBC has no right to show or distribute its content in the US. Trump’s suit could try to use the possibility of the show being seen on the video-on-demand streaming serviceBritBox, although experts have alreadypretty much demolishedthat line of argument. Lawyers are likely to have a lucrative field day arguing about whether or not Floridians would need a VPN to do this.Trump has also claimedthat the BBC inflicted “extensive reputational harm” as well as “overwhelming reputational and financial harm” with the dodgy documentary. Yet he went on to win the US election a week after the Panorama programme was first aired, while his share of the vote in Florida increased.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant as the British prime minister and Billy Bob Thornton as the US president in Love Actually (2003).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyMore bizarrely, his speech may have been badly spliced by the BBC editors, but the fact remains thatTrump was indicted by a US grand juryon four charges for his conduct over the Capitol attack, the subject of the Panorama programme. Even the lawsuit cannot claim that he never said the words in the video, just “this sequence of words”.Most normal politicians would not want to remind anyone of this episode, but, of course, Trump is no normal politician. His frequent wild statements – most recently suggesting the acclaimed director Rob Reiner hastenedhis own death with his criticism of Trump– may do nothing to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, but they both entertain them and distract a news media flailing in the torrent of online slurry.For the BBC, it’s a lose-lose situation. AsChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the Trump-supporting US network Newsmax, said on the Today programme, the case is likely to cost between $50m and $100m to fight, not least because of the burden of discovery prompted by Trump’s lawyers demanding access to every email that mentions him in a bid to find bias. Suggesting a figure of about $10m, Ruddy urged the BBC to settle, like so many US news organisations including ABC and CBS News have already done, in response to this year’s threat. But how can the BBC settle when the case is, by most reasonable measures, absurd?This first reality TV president seems determined to make the world an absurdist farce. Yet the reality is a tragedy for those dependent on fearless, independent news organisations trying to hold the most powerful to account. It doesn’t have to make sense; it just has to make news and do damage. On those grounds, the president already has everything he wants.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

We have to prove him wrongRafael BehrThe Russian strategy of exporting chaos to provoke extremism only works if liberals succumb to cynicism and despairWed 17 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 04.46 ESTShareIonce spent an exasperating week showing a Russian friend around London. He insisted on seeing everything and admiring nothing. Museums, monuments, shops – all compared unfavourably with St Petersburg and Moscow. This got tiresome after a few days, so I asked my friend if there was anything at all about Britain that impressed him. “The stability,” he said without hesitation. “You canfeelthe stability.”That was a different world; the late 1990s. I don’t remember the year, but I remember knowing what my friend was talking about because I had felt the same culture shock in reverse when first visiting Russia.It was the decade of degenerate democracy under Boris Yeltsin. The Soviet Union had collapsed. It was not obvious where the unravelling would stop. Criminal violence was endemic. The drunk president was propped up by a lawless oligarchy,pillaging state assetsand calling it privatisation. No one who witnessed Russia’s trauma in that period was surprised that it engendered nostalgia for the pre-democratic era. Soviet power was unaccountable but at least predictable.Vladimir Putin is as crooked as everyone else who rose to the top in Yeltsin’s entourage. But he restored order and national self-esteem, which mattered more to most Russians than the slow suffocation of political freedom.It is not a familiar dilemma to British voters because democracy and stability have not seemed mutually exclusive. Our multiparty system allows peaceful rivalry between different political and economic interests. The opposition can become the government without bloodshed. The defeated regime yields without fear of retribution. Under conditions of rules-based competition, democracies can accommodate dissent before it turns to revolution. That makes them innovative and resilient. It is how free societies outperformed tyrannies and won the 20th century. Vengeful dictatorship wants a rematch. Putin thinks he can turn the west’s strength into its greatest vulnerability.An authoritarian megalomaniac sees merit in a political system if it raises no obstacle to the leader’s will. He therefore sees liberal democracy as stupid and weak. It submits its rulers to the contradictory caprices of dumb voters. It follows that the way to acceleratedemocracy’s failureis to amplify those contradictions, nurture division, accelerate polarisation, shrink the available space for compromise so that representative government grinds to a halt.The theory originates in Soviet-era tactics, but the old KGB was constrained by the unwieldy analogue logistics of recruiting agents and meddling in politics abroad. The digital age makes it cheaper and scalable.Traditional methods of subversion are still practised. Reform UK’s former leader in Wales, Nathan Gill, isnow in jailafter pleading guilty to bribery charges dating from his time as a Ukip and Brexit party MEP. He accepted tens of thousands of pounds to boost pro-Russian interests in the European parliament. He offered to recruit colleagues to do the same, but there is no suggestion that he did so.The case has prompted the government toset up an inquiryinto foreign influence in UK politics. The terms of reference cover the post-Brexit landscape, not because Kremlin meddling is a recent phenomenon but because excavation of more historic interference – perhaps contaminating the democratic credentials of the Brexit campaign – is deemed too socially and politically fissile.Back in 2016, the Kremlin obviously had a preference for Britain to harm itself and the EU by burning their mutually beneficial alliance, just as Putin had aclear interest in Donald Trumpbeating Hillary Clinton in that year’s US presidential election.But the method isn’t confined to specific geopolitical goals. All divergence of opinion is ripe for radicalisation via the enraging algorithms of social media. A 2018 US senate committee investigation found thatRussian troll accountswere posting messages in support of Black Lives Matter and cheering Confederate flags in different digital silos.Anything to inflame the connective social tissue that holds multicultural societies together counts as a successful attack on the democratic immune system. And that was before AI entered the scene as an info-weapon of mass destruction, flooding the arena with synthetic news slop and terrifyingly plausible deepfakery.This is one of the challenges identified by Blaise Metreweli, thenew director of MI6, in a speech earlier this week. She characterised the current national security environment as a “space between peace and war”. Russia was not the only antagonist to be named, but in the eyes of Britain’s spy chief, Putin is the pre-eminent menace. His method is “the export of chaos”.That could involveneedling incursionsover Nato borders with drones, ships and submarines. It features cyber-attacks on infrastructure, arson and sabotage. Such provocations are alarming but counterproductive if they alert public opinion in the target country to a threat that would otherwise be largely invisible.The more insidious threat is pollution of democratic discourse. It blurs the distinction between knowing service to a hostile government and unwitting collaboration; between active treason and gullible dogmatism. Gill was greedy, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t believe arguments he was paid to make. There are pockets of opinion on the radical right and left of British politics, among the Trump acolytes and the “anti-imperialist” Nato-quitters, where the Kremlin gets its talking points boosted free of charge.Ideology is not the prime vector for sabotage of western democracies. Political commitment and activism can be less useful than their opposites – apathy and disengagement. The most toxic substance spewing from turbines of digital disinformation is cynicism. It is theview that politiciansare as bad as each other and that none is trading in the truth. That is the path of despair down which democracy itself starts to be dismissed as a sham.Putin should have accepted Trump’s deal. Now Russia’s collapsing economy could lead to his downfall | Simon TisdallRead moreAnd that is where Putin’s strategic calculation merges with his need to avenge Russia’s humiliation in the 1990s. The lesson he observed in the chaotic Yeltsin years was that democracy was easily manipulated by elites to legitimise plunder. The liberal script was different from the one parroted by Communist party elites. The hypocrisy was the same.If that was true of democracy in the former Soviet Union, it was surely true everywhere. The appeal in that analysis is that no Russians need be held responsible for their country’s failure to thrive. They were tricked by their enemy and the great lie of political freedom. According to the same grudge, there was no need to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine because its independence was an extension of the original con. Nato’s defence of Kyiv’s right to self-determination can be dismissed as rhetorical patina on thelong-running conspiracyto diminish Russia.This is the deep well of resentment that fuels Putin’s export of chaos. Sowing discord and shredding consensus is meant to rob western societies of the stability that was once their superpower. Then, in Putin’s ultimate vindication, the moral lesson of the cold war will be inverted. Instead of authoritarian regimes crumbling because their captive subjects craved freedom, it will be demoralised citizens of failing liberal societiesturning to strong leadersfor order.The realisation of that dark fantasy can seem grimly plausible, especially given the spectacle of Trump’s misrule in the US. That has to be our spur to vigilance inEurope. In the end, dictators always underestimate the resilience of societies governed by law and institutions because they cannot believe in a system that is stronger than the rule of one man. They cannot cope with the most powerful truth of democracy – that it outlives every tyrant who tries to prove it is a lie.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The EU must use its leverage and stand up to himWed 17 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 12.37 ESTShareThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’snational security strategyshould stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.But contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity.Europewill fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.The US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension isbound tothe bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment nowrivals consumer spendingas the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, USGDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.Trump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has beenunable to forceSenate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Magafearsthat AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by whatchildren are exposed toon digital platforms.Maga votersparticularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.First, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’smost valuablecompany. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.The US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.Second, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public inUS litigationshow how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has beenunable to tell a US courtwhat its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.This data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has beena wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.If the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.Maga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.The balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year ofabjectcoweringbefore Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. Theextreme reactionof Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.With its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in anopen letterto Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own andpassed a new law forcing digital platformsto protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.Then herhetorically mugged Trumpin a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his toneimmediately. Lower tariffs are nowexpectedafter negotiations between the two leaders.Trump said earlier in December thathe thinksEurope’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, theresponsefromEuropeanleaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.Johnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil LibertiesExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionEuropeDonald TrumpComputingUrsula von der LeyenEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

May we rise above the horror and national shame to be a better and stronger countryWed 17 Dec 2025 17.44 ESTShareI for one am reeling. I am overwhelmed with sorrow and grief for the murdered and their families, friends and communities.It is a time, above and well before all else, for supporting them – no community or religious group should be killed or live in fear no matter their beliefs, customs or even allegiances.Children, Holocaust survivors, religious leaders all have had their fundamental right – to life – abridged by a father and son on a mission. Because they were Jewish. No more, no less – just because of their faith.And in this initial period, I know what it is not time for. It is not time to blame Anthony Albanese for failing to do what Benjamin Netanyahu or some in the Jewish community demanded. It is not time to stifle criticism of Israel under the guise of stopping antisemitism. It is not time (yet) to investigate the possible failings of our intelligence services in anticipating and stopping this. It is not time to ban protests and shy away from our international obligations. It is not time to dilute democracy with overreach laws. And it’s certainly not time to politicise by introducing an immigration system based on religion.At the Bondi vigil, Pauline and Barnaby turned tragedy into opportunism. It is inexcusable | Julianne SchultzRead moreIt is also not time to claim false flags or Mossad involvement or preach “what about Gaza” or Sudan, or anywhere else for that matter. I love many in the Palestinian movement and they have said kind, compassionate things in the face of this violence, but before anyone starts to orate about historic morals or immediate comparisons, please take a breath and say that right now Jewish lives matter. Just that. Unequivocal. There will be time for deeper lessons later.That this should happen in the shadow of Christmas is both a blessing and a curse. It reminds us to be grateful for our families and our friends. To love unconditionally and hold our children, parents and loved ones close in the tightest hug they can bare. To answer honestly and brutally when asked “how are you”, and to ask that question back and listen intently. It also leads us to question faith in any external god-force that could prevent this, but chooses not to.And perhaps, no matter what your beliefs, it is time to phone or email that Jewish friend, acquaintance or even stranger and say “I am so sorry for your loss. I stand with you for peace.” Can we just sit with that for a moment?I will spend some time today meditating. In a garden just below the law school where we planted 35 trees in memory of each victim atPort Arthurbecause one of our students, Jim Pollard, was murdered there. The trees are huge now, and their shade welcome. There is a lesson in that too. I will reflect on how I can do better in this stormy sea. Perhaps I can be kinder, less didactic. Hate less, taste more. Grimace less, cry more.May we rise above this horror and national shame to be a better and stronger country. Where there is less dispute and more conversation. Less hatred and more compassion.David Heilpern is a former New South Wales magistrate and is now dean of law at Southern Cross University.

It is because of his cosmopolitanism that 521 years after his birth, the EU named its exchange programme for students after him. It was part of a project aiming to create citizens ofEurope, not just of its member states.Britain’s post-Brexit withdrawal from the scheme was a setback for a cosmopolitan project that has suffered bigger blows since. Nationalism has been ascendant across the continent, and Euroscepticism ceased to be a peculiarly British phenomenon years ago. Could the announcement thatBritish students are to be readmitted to Erasmus+provide some hope that the internationalist dream is not dead yet?As an alumnus of the then fledgling programme in 1989, I hope so. I spent a term in Erasmus’s home town of Rotterdam, at the university that bears his name, and was there when the Berlin Wall fell. Half-Italian, I was enthusiastic about the vision of ever-increasing union in Europe. So why did it falter?A clue is given in the words that complete Erasmus’s “citizen of the world” quote: “known to all and to all a stranger”. Cosmopolitanism strengthens our links with the world as a whole, but weakens them with specific places and peoples. The trade-off is unavoidable, and for many it has been unacceptable. Keir Starmer’s much-maligned “island of strangers” lineechoed these anxieties. By amplifying, and so exaggerating, the kernel of truth it contained, he poured more oil on the populist fire.At its best, Erasmus+ shows us how better to manage the tension between mobility and belonging. Importantly, the scheme is not a free-for-all, but a highly managed system. This is critical to its public acceptance. We must maintain the distinction between visitor and guest; established populations and new arrivals.That was the dynamic when we were in Rotterdam. We were guests in the Netherlands and were treated as such. Attending their university was a privilege, not a right. This all seemed obvious. But the perception has been allowed to grow that the distinction between born-and-bred, and adoptive, citizens doesn’t matter any more. Globalisation has become a byword for homogenisation, with local traditions lost in the melting pot.The whole premise of Erasmus+ is that each member state of the EU is different, and that is precisely why it benefits students to spend time in another one. That’s what made the exchange such a formative experience for me. The Dutch students seemed more mature, more serious about their studies, with none of the anti-intellectualism that made being an earnest student in the UK embarrassing. They were sociable and liked a beer, but even when they got drunk, it was not the bar-room carnage of halls of residence back home. Most strikingly, their conception of philosophy, and how to conduct it, differed. I would not have read Foucault orMerleau-Pontyif I had stayed in Reading.These may not seem to be radical revelations, but seeing that cultural differences are a collection of individually small things builds respect and understanding. Erasmus+ brings the continent together, but it also teaches us that unity is built on diversity; it is not the enemy of it. This idea is best captured not in European enlightenment thought but in the Confucianconcept of harmony.Harmony remains the pre-eminent political, social and moral value in China today, albeit one that is often misused by the Chinese Communist party. The core of the idea is that harmony needs difference; it must not seek to eradicate it. A piece of music needs many notes and instruments. A delicious soup needs a balance of ingredients, so as to not be overwhelmed by one.Missing from the European project has been a clear sense that this is what a harmonious Europe needs, too. Member states retaining their identities is actually essential for the project to work. Sometimes the EU signals this well, such as when it recognises local foods and cultures. But, too often, the EU is perceived as the enemy of national identity.Students today travel much more than my generation did. But spending months in one place is a much bigger eye-opener. Of course, by itself it won’t halt the nativist tide. Erasmus+ did not stop other European countries going down the nationalist route. But at least it is a step in the right direction, a sign that history does not progress linearly, but zigs and zags, sometimes stepping forwards, sometimes stepping back. It provides a model for a revived Europeanism, in which we embrace our continental identities without losing our national and regional ones.And if that all sounds too high-minded, at the very least Erasmus+ students should also live outanother quotefrom the eponymous philosopher: “A constant element of enjoyment must be mingled with our studies, so that we think of learning as a game rather than a form of drudgery, for no activity can be continued for long if it does not to some extent afford pleasure to the participant.”Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher; his latest book isHow the World Eats: A Global Food PhilosophyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They always reel off their CV of working-class rootsWed 17 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 14.08 ESTShareNew figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal just how much an average Australian earns. Being “rich” might not see you living like a Kardashian but we need to acknowledge that earning more than 90% of people puts you in the top 10%, and that much of the tax system is geared to benefit you.Asking who is rich is a question that can send shivers down the spines of politicians.I’ve encountered more than a few progressives who are at pains to protest that they are not rich despite being on a very good wicket. They immediately reel off their CV of working-class roots as though they are worried someone is about to accuse them they camefrom Greece with a thirst for knowledge.There is far too much preciousness about wealth and income – and it benefits those who are doing a lot better than they would like you to know.Australia does not have an official poverty line and so we rely only on the 1972 definition ofthe Henderson Poverty Line, which is not comparable to international measures.Even given that, a single person on jobseeker is living about 40% below the poverty line.If the graph does not display click hereThat isn’t something that perturbs the government too much, and certainly not more than it did suggestions of affecting the wealth of the 80,000 Australians with more than $3m in superannuation.The way we talk about wealth and high incomes is so skewed that, for example, the government’s own advice on superannuation refers to the ASFA line that a“comfortable retirement”involves being able to have:Top level private health insuranceFast reliable NBNA computer and smartphone with good data allowance/streaming servicesA reasonable carRegular leisure activities including club membership, cinema visits and exhibitionsConfidence to use air conditioning in the home and afford all utilitiesOccasional restaurant mealsAn annual domestic trip to visit family, andOne overseas trip every seven years.For most, that is not comfortable, that is a dream.It’s why we have a system where each year the richest 10% get nearly $22bn a year in tax breaks to use superannuation – nearly double the$12.2bn the government spends funding public schoolsand $5bn more than the $16.9bn spent on jobseeker.So lets not let those who want to keep feathering their very plush nests get away with pretending that they are doing it hard scrabble.A few years ago Anthony Albanese was quick to argue that being on$200,000 a year did not make you rich. It was a very silly statement then and remains silly now.The Bureau of Statistics’ recentannual characteristics of employment surveyreveals just how much Australians earn.As always, we need to be careful with terminology. Average (more technically known as the mean) is not the same as median. If you hear someone talk about average earnings, just realise that is more than what most Australia earn.Median is the halfway point – half earn more, half earn less.We also need to be careful if someone is talking about average full-time earnings, as opposed to total earnings, and also whether they are talking about men, who as a rule earn more than women.For ease of understanding I have converted all figures to annual rather than weekly earnings.This year the average annual male full-time earnings is $111,592, well above the overall median earnings for all workers of $74,100:If the graph does not display click hereIf you earned more than $156,000 you earned more than 90% of Australians, and if you earned $176,930 you earned more than 90% of Australians working full-time:If the graph does not display click hereIt’s worth noting thatthe current full-time minimum wageof $49,296 puts you in the bottom 10% of full-time earners, and the jobseeker rate, which is equivalent to annual earnings of $20,634, has you well in the bottom 10% of all earnings.So, let’s dispense with the bullshit that such amounts in any way discourage people from wanting to work or are too high to run a business.Even in New South Wales earning $200,000 puts you well in the top 10%:If the graph does not display click hereBut don’t call them rich, they might get sad.We also know age and gender plays a big role. Most men in their late 30s to late 50s earn about $100,000 a year, while a majority of women never earn more than $80,000:If the graph does not display click hereThe figures highlight that having children hurts women’s earnings much more than men’s. In their early 20s, women actually have higher median full-time earnings than men but the gap widens in the mid-30s and never closes – even for full-time workers:If the graph does not display click hereOne of the best things about these annual figures is it allows us to also compare the median earnings in each state withthe median house price.The picture across most states is one of despair for how things were even just five years ago, let alone 20 or more:If the graph does not display click hereIn just five years the value of a median prices house in Sydney has gone from 12.8 times the median annual full-time earnings to 16.1 times.Housing affordability is a major reason why those in the top 10% do not feel “rich”. And that might be fair.But while it might be harder for someone on $200,000 or even just in the top 10% to afford a house and allow you to feel rich or wealthy, let us not mistake that difficulty for the plight of the vast majority for whom inequality means actual hardship.And never let it mean we keep handing the richest tax breaks while saying we can’t afford to lift people out of poverty.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist of the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsInequalityTaxcommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve now read their “what we do” section four or five times, and I have a problem – I can’t figure out what they do. There are two possibilities here. One: they don’t know what they do. Two: what they do is so pointless and embarrassing that they dare not spell it out in plain English. “We forge marketing systems at the forefront of the online wellness space” translates to something like “we use ChatGPT to sell dodgy supplements”.But understanding what so many businesses actuallydois the least of my worries. I’m currently among the5% of Britswho are unemployed. In my six months of job hunting, my total lack of success has begun to make me question my own existence. Just like when you repeat a word over and over until it loses all meaning, when you apply repeatedly for jobs in a similar field, the semantics of the entire situation begin to fall apart like a snotty tissue. About one in five of my job applications elicit a rejection email, usually bemoaning the sheer number of “quality applicants” for the position. For the most part, though – nothing. It’s almost like the job never existed in the first place, and it’s possible that it didn’t.In 2024,40% of companies postedlistings for “ghost jobs”, nonexistent positions advertised to create the illusion that the company is doing well enough to take on new employees. And this seems like an all-too-easy way to lie about your success. Regulation of job ads is mostly the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, which – in all its might – has the power to … have a misleading job ad taken down. So with no particularly harsh consequences for employers, why not go on a pretend hiring spree?Ethics in the job marketseem to have gone out the window, and the idea of wasting the time of thousands of hapless jobseekers doesn’t seem to matter much.Even if the job you’re applying for exists, next comes the hurdle of the AI HR bot. While it’s difficult to find any hard data on just how many employers are using AI to filter applications (sometimes favouring men over women, if a now-scrappedalgorithm used by Amazonis anything to go by),articlesandReddit threadsabout how to game the bots and get in the right “key words” now abound. According to anAtlantic articlefrom earlier this year: “Young people are using ChatGPT to write their applications; HR is using AI to read them; no one is getting hired.” And let’s say your CV and cover letterdomake it past the robot gatekeepers, it’s possible that your interview will beconducted by yet another bot. Although I haven’t had the pleasure of an interview, AI or otherwise, since I began my latest job search, the possibility of not coming into contact with a single human during most of the process to becoming the dodgy supplements social media marketing manager looms large and dreadful.While this scramble for jobs is mostly being framed as a problem forgraduates, I can confirm – as someone who graduated 15 years ago bang into a recession – not only is this the worst job market I’ve ever seen, but it’s also impacting people like me with many years’ experience. During my last period of job hunting, about three years ago, I was at least getting interviews. Interviews with humans, to boot.Given all the skilled people I know who can’t seem to land interviews for even entry-level positions, I’m certain that I’m not an outlier. I’m also convinced that we’re facing a crisis in which middle-class jobs have mutated into rare and disturbing beasts.When, according to its job ad, an indie pet food company called something like Flopsies is looking for a “rock star” and a “unicorn” to revolutionise its social media presence, you know that the job market has become high on its own farts. Ill-defined franken-jobs, requiring everything from SEO expertise to video-editing skills (all for a salary of £27,000 and free protein bars that taste like hay) require cult-like dedication. First, you must convince the fine people at Flopsies that it has been your dream since exiting your mother’s birth canal to sell pet food. You would cut off your own hands for the privilege, and quickly learn to write copy for them by smashing your face into a keyboard. You will convey this in a 400-word cover letter, written in your own blood. This cover letter will then be redirected into the ether by an AI filter, because you didn’t use the phrase “optimising algorithmic relevancy” in it. You will never hear from Flopsies again. You will start this process again and repeat it until you are seen fit for an interview in which you have a few minutes to convince a bot that you’re fit for purpose as both a worker and a human being.The hiring process has become so mechanised, both figuratively and literally, that it’s hard to believe that the people who end up being hired aren’t merely the best at gaming the system. And frankly, all power to them. It’s no skin off my nose if the dodgy supplement or pet-food jobs go to people who are incredible at creating the illusion that they live and breathe pet food and/or dodgy supplements. But in this oh-so-streamlined process, what happens to those of us who can’t or won’t play the game? Of all the applications I’ve sent out recently, I wonder how many have been looked at by humans. There’s only so much shouting into the void about your ability to use a CMS you can do before you give up and start Googling things like: “Can I sell a kidney on Vinted?”Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and DivaExplore more on these topicsUnemploymentOpinionWork & careersArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

That’s an opportunity the PM should seize before pro-Europe challengers for the Labour leadership doWed 17 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 11.41 ESTShareSeven years ago, it took just eight words to electrify theLabourconference and to show the party was falling out of love with its then leader. Although not exactly the kind of soaring oratory that gets reproduced on T-shirts, the words were greeted with wild cheering as most of the hall rose in spontaneous acclamation.As the commotion died down, Keir Starmer, then Brexit spokesman, stood at the podium, blinking in surprise. He wasn’t really accustomed to his speeches having such an effect. All he had said was: “Nobody is ruling out remain as an option.” But context is everything.During that darkly divisive time of 2018, departing from his agreed text in this way was always going to be seen as laying down the gauntlet to Jeremy Corbyn, who was trying to prioritise leave supporters in working-class seats over the pro-European instincts of his party. In just one speech, this grey-suited shadowBrexitsecretary was transformed – if only for a while – into a risk-taker who would stand up for most Labour MPs, members and voters against a leader he would later replace.Since then, much has happened, not least to Starmer himself. One of his first acts after taking over from Corbyn in 2020 was to declare the Brexit issue had been settled by the previous year’s general election. And, at the last one, he repeatedly emphasised manifesto “red line” commitments that forbade re-entry into the EU, the single market or a customs union. Like his predecessor, his strategy has been to pursue Brexit-y voters in key seats, even ifpolling evidencesuggests many of them have died or changed their minds.However, it’s now the prime minister’s turn to be an embattled Labour leader. And, if Europe is no longer the boiling pot of British politics, a lid that has been kept tightly sealed for five years is beginning to rattle once more.Both Starmer and Rachel Reeves have ramped up the rhetoric about the devastation that leaving the EU has caused to the UK’s economy. It’s a useful stick with which to beat Nigel Farage, who now rarely mentions how leaving the EU was once his singular purpose and is still his only real achievement. And now there is the impending announcement that Britainwill rejoin Erasmus, the EU’s student exchange programme, a move clearly designed to send a signal of intent.And yet the scale of the Brexit damage, which by someestimateshas left Britain with an economy that is between 6% and 8% smaller than if it were still in the EU, towers over the micro-mitigation so far offered by the government. Starmer’s so-called re-set deal agreed with Brussels last summer offers economic benefits measured in low decimal points. And even while the prime ministerhintshe would like to do more, it’s far from clear what that means in practice.The chancellor is among those trying to overcome entrenched Home Office resistance to an expansive version of a growth-enabling youth mobility scheme by which young people can move between the UK and the EU to study or work. The deputy prime minister David Lammymusesopenly about the “self-evident” benefits of being in a customs union with the EU, while a dozen Labour MPs, including the chair of the Treasury select committee, last weekvoted for a Liberal Democrat motionon joining one.Although Nick Thomas-Symonds , the minister in charge of EU policy, who is now attending every cabinet meeting,insiststhe red lines are still in place, there are ways these could be bypassed. One idea would be to announce the start of negotiations now on a much bolder deal, for inclusion in the next manifesto, with implementation only if Labour won a fresh mandate.Yet Starmer has most recently been damping it all down again by warning that a return to a European customs area would “unravel” the trade pacts with the US, which he regards as signature achievements of his premiership.My understanding is that the PM’s scepticism goes still deeper, and is rooted in three further factors. First, he thinks any customs union agreement has been made significantly more difficult because his ministers are busily de-aligning from European rules across a range of policy areas, including theenvironment. Second, the exorbitant price set for the UK to join the EU’snew defence fundand the subsequent collapse in talks has convinced UK negotiators that former EU partners are less interested in cutting special deals with Britain than in demonstrating that Brexit does not work. Lastly, the newUS national security strategyis seen by some influential figures in Downing Street as a reason for Britain to keep its distance from the EU.In case you missed it, this bizarre and terrifying document, which has been welcomed by the Kremlin, claims Europe faces “civilizational erasure” because of Muslim migration. Instead of proclaiming our special relationship, it contains only one reference to Britain, which can be found on the same page as a suggestion that Donald Trump’s administration will intervene in our politics to encourage the growth of “patriotic” parties. But, far from concluding that this makes the US an unreliable partner, I’m told the government is worried that aligning closer with Europe would destabilise geopolitics further by risking fragile US military support for Ukraine, Nato and much more besides.It remains to be seen whether this position can hold if Trump reallydoesseek to export Maga ideology to Britain at a time when Starmer has promised Labour will throw “everything we have” into the fight against rightwing populism. And perhaps, says one source close to him, a more reasonable US president will be in the White House by the time of the next general election. Given the febrile state of Westminster politics, it must be acknowledged there might be a new Labour prime minister too.All of which brings us back to 2018. Starmer has always said his speech to the party conference was not a pitch for the leadership but merely an attempt to keep open the “option” of remain being on the ballot paper in a new referendum that he was far from convinced was the right solution. Indeed, in those days, Starmer still favoured a “bespoke customs union deal” of the kind he now appears to be opposing.But it’s not been lost on Downing Street that Wes Streeting, who just about everyone assumes would be a candidate in any leadership election, is among a clutch of cabinet ministersletting it be knownthey want to go further on Europe. Aides to Angela Rayner, another probable runner in a contest to replace Starmer, insist she won’t discuss her position on a customs union because it would only “escalate unhelpful speculation”.The danger is obvious. If Starmer rules out more meaningful steps towards a close relationship with the EU, he allows rivals to occupy the space where the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs, members and voters are to be found.I happen to be someone who both wants him to survive and believes he can do so in spite of all this overheated speculation. But it would be prudent of him to remember the impact just a few words had for him seven years ago. There are options for a big offer on Europe that the prime minister should not “rule out”; he should prise them open himself, before someone else makes them his – or her – own.Tom Baldwin is the author ofKeir Starmer, The BiographyExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBrexitKeir StarmerLabour party leadershipForeign policyEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Her words to mourners after the horrific attack ring hollowFull report: Bondi terror attackVictims of Bondi beach shootingWhat we know so far about the Bondi terror attackFollow the latest live updatesTue 16 Dec 2025 23.04 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 14.37 ESTShareMourners crowded around a sea of flowers behind the Bondi Pavilion on Tuesday, quietly singing a traditional song of peace.Shalom, shalom,they whispered in unison, grief settling in like the grey clouds above.The emotional intensity of the moment was suddenly broken by shouts: “Albo must go”, and then a rejoinder, “What did you do? You’re in the parliament too.” The singing stopped. Confused, I looked over.There, standing at the front of the crowd, surrounded by besuited security personnel and journalists, were two of the most egregious opportunists ever to be elected to the Australian parliament – Pauline Hanson and Barnaby Joyce.Locked down in a Bondi yoga studio amid the carnage outside I felt my world explode | Nadine J CohenRead moreAmid the press of modestly dressed people, their faces contorted by sadness, the duo stood out, dressed to perform for the cameras.Hanson, who has done more than any other politician to foster division since she was first elected in 1996, was talking about freedom and safety and the right to live “without fear”. Hanson said she wanted hate preachers “rounded up”. And reiterated the rallying call of her career, “Let’s get back the Australia I grew up in … I look at the people we are bringing to the country. Certain countries they should not be allowed to migrate here.”Some, including a man in a Maga cap, clearly welcomed her empty words, holding up their phones to capture them and then pressing even closer for selfies. “We love you Pauline”, “You’re the only one who speaks the truth.”Not everyone agreed.At the entrance to the memorial a team of volunteers from Turbans 4 Australia were handing out food, fruit and water to anyone who needed sustenance. “Australians reject extremes,” one Sikh man told me, as he struggled to absorb her message. “If she had her way I wouldn’t be allowed to be here.”Presumably Syria and Russia – the homelands ofAhmed al-Ahmed,Reuven MorrisonandBoris and Sofia Gurman, the “heroes” who offered their lives to tackle the gunmen – would not be on her list either.1:52Prime minister meets the ‘Australian hero’ Ahmed al-Ahmed in hospital – videoIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, the overwhelming public sentiment has been that this was not just a targeted killing of Jewish Australians, but an attack on the very idea of the nation, as an inclusive society where fairness and tolerance were considered virtues, safety for most people most of the time was assumed and religion did not play a defining role.That this could happen in a place that brings joy, a place that vies with theSydneyOpera House as the nation’s international calling card, was breathtaking. We know from tragic experience that for terror to work its evil, iconic places are always the preferred targets and human beings the collateral damage.That the political response should so quickly descend into opportunism, name-calling and hair-splitting – about whether to tackle the evident flaws in the nation’s much-vauntedgun lawsorantisemitism– was an even more powerful marker of the times we live in.Of course, both must be addressed, seriously and substantially, not simply by hiding behind process, referring to reviews or demanding more surveillance.Albanese’s own strength navigating the path ahead will be just as important as the bravery seen at BondiRead moreAustralians are not alone in struggling with hard conversations that demand more than superficial answers, but when the major parties – even in the face of tragedy – cannot agree on the basics, that is a dereliction of their responsibility. As the song says:We are one, but we are many, and from all the lands on Earth we come … we are Australian.Having listened to Hanson’s self-aggrandising comments, I was still taken aback to hear her quip as she moved through the crowd to leave the memorial site, “Next time I might wear an Israeli flag into the parliament and see what they do.” To turn this tragedy, which goes to what the writer Julie Macken has calledthe schism in the soul of the nation, into a pantomime as Pauline and Barnaby are wont to do is inexcusable.This past year, so much of what was once unimaginable has become almost normal. The tone was set atthe White House in Januaryand has not abated.Vile racist, misogynist and antisemitic language has been celebrated under the phoney rubric of free speech, angry mobs online have gone unchallenged, superpowers have tested the limits of what they can get away with, nations have struggled to hang on to a unifying sense of identity and purpose, fear and anxiety are pervasive. It is scarcely surprising that under these circumstances some people become prey to demagogues, while most retreat to the comfort of their families and loved ones.Some call 2025 a “hinge year” – a year when we glimpsed a new inhumane order, shaped by those with unaccountable power and wealth. We can only hope that pollster Kos Samaras is correct when he wrote that people see through those who “seek to weaponise grief, hunt for scapegoats and turn fear into a wedge.”We cannot allow this cruel political pantomime become the new normal. Tackling it will require determination, courage and humility, like that displayed by Ahmed al-Ahmed, Reuven Morrison, and Boris and Sofia Gurman – decent people who followed their instincts to protect others at whatever cost.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionBondi beachSydneycommentShareReuse this content"

Happy Birthday hides a tale of corporate greed. And Putin uses Shostakovich’s Leningrad symphony as a call to arms. That’s why I put them in my soundtrack to the complexities of human existenceTom ServiceWed 17 Dec 2025 11.04 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 11.05 ESTShareThe idea was always a ludicrous one: to reduce millennia of human musical history – not to mention billennia of the Earth’s sonic geology – into a book of 50 pieces of music. And yet that’s the challenge I decided to take on. The most pressing question was: why? To which my answer was: the inevitable failures and gaps of the project are precisely where its interest lies.The next concern was how. Called A History of the World in 50 Pieces, the book is not a digested history of music, nor a list of my favourite songs, performances or recordings. Instead, it’s centred on the definition of a “piece of music”. This is a democratic principle – a belief that works don’t belong only to their creators but are shared and reinterpreted by generations of musicians at distances of time, geography and technology, in ways their original composers and performers could not imagine.The Nazis twisted 'all people should be brothers' to mean 'non-brothers should be exterminated'The point of a piece of music is not to exist in a definitive version – be it a recording, a single performance or even a fixed score – but to be continually remade in a cycle of transformation, in which the experience of the piece belongs to anyone who plays or hears it. This way of thinking throws up unexpected and serendipitous connections. Before writing the book, I wouldn’t have thought there were resonances between Beethoven, Mildred and Patty J Hill, and Shostakovich. Yet all have written music that reveals what happens when, whether by accident or design, you dream of musical utopias and write tunes for the whole world.Let’s take Beethoven first, and his Ninth (“Choral”) Symphony. The final movement is the moment when instrumental music alone cannot sustain the full power of Beethoven’s message. The Ode to Joy melody emerges first as a hymn for the cellos and basses to sing, before the tune takes over the whole orchestra – and ushers in the voices of Beethoven’s chorus. The Ode to Joy is Beethoven’s theme of themes, settingFriedrich Schiller’s proto-revolutionary text. It is a dream of universal compassion, a message of sublime connection conveying the essentially humanist philosophy of Beethoven’s music.View image in fullscreenSolidarity … Ode to Joy was the soundtrack to student protests in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on 4 May 1989.Photograph: Peter Turnley/Getty ImagesHis own sketches show how hard the composer worked to arrive at a tune that could be simple and satisfying enough for a new world to sing. And it worked. The success – and the curse – of The Ode to Joy melody is that Beethoven achieved his wish. The idea of “joy” may seem to be apolitical but, taken on its own, the melody can be attached to any ideology you want.The Ode to Joy was used to soundtrack the hopes for freedom and democracy in China’s Tiananmen Square in 1989, with students blasting it from makeshift speakers as the tanks rolled in. It was sung after the fall of the Berlin Wall the same year, with “Freude” (joy) changed to “Freiheit” (freedom).But the tune has also been made into an ode to hate, twisted by the Nazis to mean, as Beethoven’s biographer Jan Swafford puts it, not that “all people should be brothers” but that “nonbrothers should be exterminated”. Beethoven’s tune is the anthem of the European Union, but it was also the national anthem of apartheid Rhodesia. And, after one performance, Stalin declared: “This is the right music for the masses.” It’s not that Ode to Joy hasn’t worked as a song that everyone can sing – it’s that it’s worked too well. That is the problem with musical utopias: they can be all too easily mobilised for political propaganda, whatever the ideals of their creators.View image in fullscreenMake a wish … Happy Birthday was bought for $22m.Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStockAs for Mildred and Patty J Hill, the only utopia they were dreaming of when they wrote the tune we now know as Happy Birthday, was to compose a song for their kindergarten students to welcome the new day. The words were originally Good Morning to All, and were only changed on a whim when the sisters wanted to wish a friend happy birthday in a cabin in Kentucky in the 1890s. From that simple act of creative generosity, the Happy Birthday melody went on to become the planet’s most recognisable melody, the one tune that unites cultures, communities and families.Butthe story of Happy Birthdayisn’t only a celebration of how – thanks to printing, early broadcast technology, and sheer earworminess – a humble melody got into the world’s consciousness and stuck. It is also a story of corporate greed and courtroom drama. The Hill sisters wanted the tune to be part of our creative commons, but after 1933, when the melody appeared in Irving Berlin’s musical As Thousands Cheer, lawyers and publishers began to make claims for payment for its use.View image in fullscreen‘This music is about all forms of bondage’  … Dmitri Shostakovich during the siege of Leningrad in 1941.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesIn 1988, Warner Chappell became Happy Birthday’s legal custodians,having bought the rights for $22m(£16m). The music publisher made an estimated $2m (£1.5m) a year when the tune was used across public media and in places where music was licensed, including restaurants. It is only thanks to the film-maker Jenn Nelson, who won a case in 2016 that asserted the melody didn’t belong to the publisher but to all of us who sing it, that the tune and its words became legally as well as musically part of the world’s “common property”, as Patty J Hill put it. Where she and her sister always wanted it to be.But tunes that everyone can remember, that we can all hum or sing, aren’t always expressions of our common humanity. They can also represent the curdling of community into the violence of crowds; the virus of everyday evil growing unchecked to take over the whole of society.Shostakovich’s Seventh Symphony, “the Leningrad”, was performed in that besieged city in 1942, after arguably the world’s single most courageous act of orchestra-building, in the face of the Nazi onslaught.At this moment of seeming calm, Shostakovich’s symphony becomes a place of insidious terrorAfter a conventional enough opening, the music in the first movement dissolves to single lines of woodwind. And, at just this moment of seeming calm and tranquility, Shostakovich’s symphony becomes a place of insidious terror. In the distance is the tattoo of a militaristic rhythm on a side-drum, before a melody begins in the solo flute. The instantly memorable yet ordinary tune doesn’t do anything “symphonic”: it repeats and repeats, louder and louder, building eventually into a violent orchestral juggernaut.It is a satirical tune, deliberately stupid, based on music by Franz Léhar, who was a favourite of Hitler’s. The “we’re off to Maxim’s” melody, from Léhar’s frothy operetta The Merry Widow, seems to be attempting to steamroller the symphony out of existence, echoing what the Nazis were trying to do to Leningrad. But it’s more than that. Talking about this devastating passage of his symphony, Shostakovich said: “Music can never be literally tied to a theme. This music is about all forms of terror, slavery, the bondage of the spirit.” His piece wasn’t only about Nazism, “but about our [Russian] system, or any form of totalitarian regime”.View image in fullscreenOde to freedom … New Year’s Eve, 1989, at the Berlin Wall just after the fall of communism in East Germany.Photograph: Owen Franken/Corbis/Getty ImagesThis passage is a traumatic experience from which the rest of the symphony will try to recover. In its finale, the music vindicates the optimism of its opening moments in one of orchestral music’s most jaw-dropping spectacles of hard-won victory. That’s how this piece was played and interpreted by audiences all over the world during the second world war, when it was broadcast from London and New York, after the score had been microfilmed and flown in secret out of Russia.Yet the symphony finds itself in a contested position today. There’s Shostakovich the composer and freedom-fighter versus the Shostakovich used by Putin’s regime in the 2020s for nationalistic propaganda. In a speech in August 2022, six months after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin spoke at an 80th anniversary performance of the symphony by the Russian National Youth Symphony Orchestra: “Shostakovich’s Leningrad Symphony continues to evoke the strongest feelings in new generations,” he said. “It makes them share in the bitterness of loss and the joy of victory, love for the Motherland and readiness to defend it.”View image in fullscreen‘It continues to evoke the strongest feelings’ … Vladimir Putin delivers an address to concertgoers attending the 80th anniversary performance of Shostakovich’s Seventh.Photograph: AlamyPutin was enlisting Shostakovich’s symphony, and the young orchestral players who were performing it, as surrogate soldiers: part of the same war effort that sends Russia’s youth to the frontline. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, the symphony is performed to embody resistance to exactly the kind of autocracy and despotism represented by Putin’s Russia.War music: the humanity, heroism and propaganda behind Shostakovich’s Symphony No 7Read moreThese are tunes for the whole world, capturing our complex history.

This is me upside-down and naked in a fireplace – Brooke DiDonato’s best photograph‘I wanted to make a perfect square with my body. My back hurt for days afterwards. People often want to know if the kitten is real’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 17 Dec 2025 09.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.58 ESTShareI’ve thought a lot about the time I made this image. In my 20s, I was living in New York. Then I broke up with my long-term partner in 2019 and I sort of didn’t really know how to cope any more. I didn’t feel creative – my whole experience of living in New York was tied to that relationship, and I felt I needed to go somewhere else and start over. I moved to Austin, Texas – I thought I’d give it a go for a bit.I was doing a lot of tinkering at home, and I started doing a lot more self-portraits and let my psyche run wild. At this point, in 2021, one of my friends, Mike, was living in a 1940s building in East Austin, with old popcorn ceilings, really cool mouldings and outlet covers and original details, including the fireplace. It was inspiring to be there.I wasn’t thinking about what would be popular – though it did get a big reaction on social mediaI was having a bad day and I called Mike to ask if I could come over with my tripod. I knew I wanted to shoot with the fireplace, but I was unclear what the idea was. I am always balanced between these two modes in my practice – between knowing exactly what I’m doing and not. The fireplace was set up pretty much exactly as you see it in this image, I just switched out the bowling trophy he had on the mantelpiece for an artwork that I took from his bathroom. I was thinking about how I was relearning as an adult, and the old lesson people tell kids: “Don’t play with fire.” That’s where the title of the image came from – Learned a Lesson Then Forgot It.There is a lot of tension but also grace in the image. Mike had recently taken in a stray kitten and she kept getting in the photo, but her curiosity conveyed the right message. People often want to know about her, and whether she’s real or Photoshopped in.A House Is Not a Home: the self-portraits of Brooke DiDonato – in picturesRead moreI shot a lot of different versions of the pose – I have around 24 outtakes. Whenever I make an image in a compromising position, I assess the discomfort before I get naked. In this case the pose was extreme, my back hurt for a few days after. But I wanted to make a perfect square with my body. I often come up with poses in response to the space I’m working in. During that first year in Austin, I became more controlled in my process. I would have the idea of a composition but still leave room for how I used to work – spontaneously and reacting to space, working with whatever I had available, having fun.It’s a special image to me now. I’ve since moved back to New York and I think fondly of that period, even though it was really difficult too. I felt really alive. In the New York scene, there is a lot of competitiveness and constant comparison, and it felt good to disconnect from it and hang out somewhere where the pace was different. I could get into a friend’s fireplace and it didn’t matter if it didn’t work out!There was a lot of emotion in this work. I wasn’t thinking about what would be popular – though it ended up getting a big reaction I did not expect on social media. I think people connect with work that lets them create their own narrative. They react to this pose and it’s an image that leaves a lot of room for interpretation.View image in fullscreenBrooke DiDonato’s CVBorn:Canton, Ohio, 1990High point:Completing my first book this year.

As a result, grotesque and reactionary buildings have appeared.”China’s strangest buildings, from pairs of pants to ping-pong batsRead moreBeneath the headline UglyArchitecture, humorous cartoons of weird buildings fill the page. There is a modernist cylinder with a neoclassical portico bolted on to the front. Another blobby building is framed by an arc of ice-cream cone-shaped columns. An experimental bus stop features a bench beneath an impractical cuboid canopy, “unable to protect you from wind, rain or sun”, as a passerby observes. “Why don’t these buildings adopt the Chinese national style?” asks another bewildered figure, as he cowers beneath a looming glass tower that bears all the hallmarks of the corrupt, capitalist west.It was an unprecedented national campaign, rolled out at unparalleled speedIt is one of the many entertaining archival documents that feature in How Modern, a fascinating new exhibition at the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, which explores the development of modern architecture in the first decades of communist China. The years after the foundation of the People’s Republic in 1949, to the period of reform and opening-up in the 1980s, are often seen as a time of drab monotony. In the cliched eyes of western historians, these decades in China are easily dismissed as a period when state-produced buildings, designed by national architecture institutes, were as homogeneous as the Mao jackets worn by the sprawling nation of suppressed automatons.View image in fullscreenAn interior of the Great Hall of the People, during the National People’s Congress, 2025.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersThis exhibition paints a very different picture. Curated by Shirley Surya fromM+ museum in Hong Kong, with Li Hua, professor of architectural history at Southeast University in Nanjing, it draws on official archives as well as materials in private collections in Hong Kong, some of which were smuggled out of the country decades ago and have never been shown before. Together, they depict a surprisingly fertile period of invention, technological innovation and stylistic debate, at a time when architecture was being deployed in an instrument of socialist nation-building – shaping cities, rural life, industry and collective identity.The story they tell also helps to explain the direction China is moving in today, under president Xi Jinping, as he doubles down on his ban on “weird buildings” imported from the west, and amplifies his pleas for distinctly “Chinese architectural styles” in new developments.It opens with point zero, in the form of Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, a place that, under Xi’s reign, has become the most fortified and surveilled public space on the planet. It is surrounded by fences on all sides, with airport-style security checkpoints and access only by booking. Alongside his greatly expanded square, Mao launched a campaign forTen Great Buildings, a series of gargantuan civic structures that would define the new aesthetic, “socialist in content, national in form”.View image in fullscreenAdventurous times … the former Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai, which features in the show.Photograph: © Wang TuoFrom the colossal Great Hall of the People (shown in stunning poster-sized photos of the interior), to the Beijing railway station, Cultural Palace of Nationalities and Workers’ Stadium (depicted in striking blues and pinks on a commemorative mirror), these buildings experimented with a new hybrid style, fusing beaux-arts classicism with Soviet monumentality and modern functionalism, often crowned with traditional Chinese overhanging tiled roofs.It was an unprecedented national campaign, rolled out at unparalleled speed. More than 1,000 architects and engineers across China were invited to take part in a month-long design workshop, while factories and construction workers were urged to build with “high quality, high artistic level, and high speed”, seeing the Ten Great Buildings completed in less than a year. By 1959, an exhibition of photographs at the RIBA in London marvelled at how a mind-boggling 350 million sq m of buildings had been completed in China in only a decade.Not all of the architects involved were happy with the design direction, mandated from on high. “My father wanted the freedom to try out different things,” recalls Yung Ho Chang, speaking in one of the illuminating oral histories in the exhibition, which are shown alongside mediative films of key projects by video artist Wang Tuo. Chang’s father,Zhang Kaiji, was one of the chief architects at the state-led Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, author of numerous leading projects of the period. “But he was given the big roof as a standard design model. He didn’t like that.”Kaiji’s project for the Sanlihe government office in Beijing, begun in 1952, reveals his struggle to adopt the official “big roof” style. It also shows how quickly the party’s design diktats would change, as the mandated ideology flipped back and forth in an Orwellian system of doublethink. Most of the blocks in the Sanlihe office courtyard complex are topped with traditional Chinese hip-and-gable roofs with sweeping eaves. But the largest central block, completed last, stands bare, stripped of its elaborate crown.The reason? Partway through construction, after a speech by then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, criticising the wastefulness of elaborate Stalinist architecture before him, China’s ministry of architectural engineering suddenly denounced the regressive cultural revivalism of the big roof style. The People’s Daily published a searing editorial, criticising the national architecture magazine, Jianzhu Xuebao, for “promoting erroneous architectural ideologies” and attacking the “severe wastefulness and formalist tendencies” of the national style.View image in fullscreenThe Sanlihe government office in Beijing, China, begun in 1952.Photograph: (awaiting credit)By 1955, the year Sanlihe was completed, the new slogan for architects was: “Function, economy, and (when possible) beauty” – extraneous decoration be damned. The central, pared-back block at Sanlihe would for ever be known as the “big roof that lost its hat”.By the 1960s, as Mao’s rule entered its most ruthless phase, it wasn’t just traditional styles that had become objects of suspicion; architects themselves were in the line of fire. In 1964, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution – which saw intellectuals sent to the countryside for brutal “re-education” – Mao launched the Design Revolution movement. An early attempt at mass proletarian participatory design, it saw technicians, manual workers and even farmers mobilised to collaborate in design and construction, with architects and their “bookism” sidelined.The aim was to achieve “greater, faster, better, and more economical” construction by reducing investment, improving technology, and simplifying work procedures. But, just as Michael Gove found with his suspicion of “experts”, the exclusion of proficient professionals had exactly the opposite effect. The bleak reality of the period – a time of mass starvation, forced labour and state-endorsed violence – is barely mentioned in the exhibition, betraying the climate of self-censorship now prevalent in Hong Kong, and the sensitivities of working with a Chinese partner institution.The somewhat propagandising tone notwithstanding, there are countless intriguing design stories to be discovered. One room showcases the infrastructural projects of the Third Front, a secretive government campaign to develop industrial and military facilities in the country’s interior in the 1960s and 70s. The Second Automobile Works in Hubei was dispersed across 27 different sites, each stealthily concealed in its own valley, like something from Tracy Island. Factory 544, which produced artillery fuses, was hidden inside a thrilling cave complex in Hunan, worthy of comrade Bruce Wayne.View image in fullscreenA woodcut image of Third Front infrastructure.Photograph: (awaiting credit)Beautiful traditional woodcut prints, produced in the late 1970s when the programme was finally made public, depict karst mountain formations, with heroic viaducts, pylons and tunnels slicing through them. “With self-reliance and hard work,” exhorted the slogan on the side of one aqueduct, “rearrange mountains and rivers” –a terraforming philosophy that continues to this day.Other sections focus on standardised housing programmes and modular furniture production, while one room shows how widespread shortages of cement, steel and lumber spurred on experiments with industrial byproducts and local materials, from rammed earth to construction waste. Soot, slag, and fly ash were used to produce building blocks and wall panels for prefabricated housing and factories, while bamboo was widely employed as a substitute for steel for long-span structures, including the astonishing bamboo hall at East China Normal University.As Hong Kong regulators misguidedly phase out the use of bamboo scaffolding, a move accelerated by a tragic recent fire (which saw flamesspread by plastic netting more than bamboo), the authorities would do well to look back at this period – a time when scarcity of resources led to a period of lean, low-carbon innovation, by necessity.How Modern: Biographies of Architecture in China 1949–1979is at the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal, until 5 April.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureChinaMao ZedongXi JinpingExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Marty Supreme, he plays a character loosely based on a former two-time US men’s singles table tennis champion. In A Complete Unknown, he played Bob Dylan at the exact moment he decided to reshape all of pop culture in his own image. His upcoming third Dune film is based on a book that is literally called Messiah. So whenTimothée Chalametsingles out a figure for greatness, understand that the greatness is warranted.Which is a roundabout way of saying that Timothée Chalamet thinksSusan Boyleis great. Not only great, but one of the greatest Britons to have ever lived.Ina recent interview with the BBC, Chalamet was asked to list his favourite British people. After naming David and Victoria Beckham, Lewis Hamilton and Fakemink (a rapper who has worked with EsDeeKid, a performer some suspect is Chalamet in disguise). And then he named Susan Boyle. As the interviewer laughed in surprise, Chalamet clarified his choice. “She dreamt big,” he said. “She dreamt bigger than all of us. Who wasn’t moved by that? I remember it like it was yesterday.”Susan Boyle, for those of you without hearts, is a singer who shot to fame after auditioning for Britain’s Got Talent in 2009. The clip of her audition went viral because people could not comprehend the sheer disparity between her appearance (a normal middle-aged woman) and her singing voice (loud and impassioned). Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, sold 10 million copies. A musical was made about her journey. Fox bought the film rights. She reportedly has a net worth of £22 million.‘I fear electromagnetic catastrophe’: Josh Safdie on Marty Supreme, latent Jewish anxiety and why men are lostRead moreAll of which constitutes a stunning achievement. However, the bigger question is:really?To be clear, Susan Boyle is undoubtedly a great example of British talent. But does Timothée Chalamet really believe that, or is he just messing about for clicks?This is becoming a bit of an issue with Timothée Chalamet. He seems to perpetually live in an emotional hinterland where nobody can quite discern his proper level of sincerity. For example, he recently promoted Marty Supreme with what sounded like a Trumpian level of self-aggrandisement, telling an interviewer that “It’s been like seven, eight years that I’ve been handing in really, really committed top-of-the-line performances … This is really some top-level shit.”Taken on the surface, this seems like something that could scuttle a career. It paints him as an insular, out-of-touch, grandstanding blowhard, and it’s hard to reward that sort of person with an award. The fact that the clip of the interview has since been deleted from YouTube suggests that this might be the case.But on the other hand, come on, this is Timothée Chalamet we’re talking about. It’s the guy who rides Lime bikes to his premieres. It’s the guy who enters his own lookalike competitions. It’s the guy who, at the very least, refuses to deny conspiracy theories that he’s actually a scouse rapper in a balaclava. So surely the fact that he’d choose to act like a self-important windbag while promoting a film where he plays a self-important windbag would be entirely in keeping with his personality – and of apiece with the press tour today.Which brings us back to Susan Boyle. Really and truly, there is only one way for anyone to know if Timothée Chalamet does actually love Boyle, or whether it’s just another one of his faux-sincere ironic performance art pranks. And for this I need to call upon my entire journalistic brethren.Interviewers, please, when you are granted time with Timothée Chalamet, I urge you to only ask him questions about Susan Boyle. Ask him what his five favourite songs of hers are. Ask him who directed the video for her cover version of Lou Reed’s Perfect Day. Ask him what he thinks of the ethical implications of her decision to duet with Elvis Presley on her rendition of O Come All Ye Faithful. See if he knows the name of the act that ultimately beat her on Britain’s Got Talent. What Susan Boyle merch does he have? How many times has he seen her live?Only this level of rigorous, evidence-based journalism will be able to help us get to the bottom of this. In fact, you know what? Let Timothée Chalamet talk to me about this. Let me set him a quickfire Susan Boyle trivia round face to face. I’m being serious. The people need to know because, if Chalamet has really just decided to take Susan Boyle’s name in vain for clicks, then god help us all.Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametSusan BoylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 17 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 10.43 ESTShareTheFalloutTV series returns to Prime Video today, and it’s fair to say that everyone was pleasantly surprised by how good the first season was. By portraying Fallout’s retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic US through three different characters, it managed to capture different aspects of the game player’s experience, too. There was vault-dweller Lucy, trying to do the right thing and finding that the wasteland made that very difficult; Max, the Brotherhood of Steel rookie, who starts to question his cult’s authority and causes a lot of havoc in robotic power armour; and the Ghoul, Walton Goggins’s breakout character, who has long since lost any sense of morality out in the irradiated wilderness.The show’s first season ended with a revelation about who helped cause the nuclear war that trapped a group of people in underground vaults for a couple of centuries. It also left plenty of questions open for the second season – and, this time, expectations are higher. Even being “not terrible” was a win for a video game adaptation until quite recently. How are the Fallout TV show’s creators feeling now that the first season has been a success?“We’ll take ‘not terrible’ – let’s get that on a poster,” says Jonah Nolan, the director who co-created the series with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. I’m speaking to them alongside Bethesda’s Todd Howard, director of the most recent Fallout video games. Ilast met with Nolan and Howardin 2024, before the first season premiered. Howard had been holding out a long time to make a Fallout adaptation, waiting for someone who seemed to really understand the series. Nolan, a lifelong player, was that person. Howard was poised with a red pen when he received the first script, but was relieved to find it was “fabulous”.“Going into the first season everyone’s like, ‘Just get it right’,” says Howard. “We’re over the moon with the reception to the show, so this time people are coming in with more excitement and different expectations.”View image in fullscreenA criminal paradise … Fallout: New Vegas.Photograph: BethesdaThe second season is set in New Vegas, the site of 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas, which had the best writing and characters of any game in the series, even if it was a bit broken. The post-nuclear Strip was a kind of decaying criminal paradise full of warring factions and down-and-out inhabitants having as good a time as they can, given the bleak circumstances. It was shot in the real-world Nevada desert, and all over California. “It’s more of a desert vibe, a Mohave vibe, that’s so essential to that game,” says Nolan. “That dusty, blasted-out Route 66 vibe of the game is so much fun to bring into the show.”In the show, a long time has passed since the events of the New Vegas game by the time Lucy and the Ghoul arrive in the city, but Howard says that it does reference the player’s journey. “When you’re doing a location that gamers know so well … honouring everyone’s journey through that game was a trick,” he says. “Time has moved on. What is New Vegas like now?… if you’re a fan of that game there’s so much to love in season two, visually and also with the factions and what’s going on with them.”The Fallout TV series has a tactile feel – its creators ensured real props and sets were built, echoing the cobbled-together nature of the settlements in the games, where everyone is building stuff out of trash and every town is shoved together from whatever anyone can find. “As a sci-fi fan, so many shows I watch, I’m aware that they’re all standing in front of a blue screen,” says Robertson-Dworet. “The whole point of an adaptation, especially of a video game, is to feel like it’s real … of course, we still augment with VFX but, wherever possible, actors are actually standing in front of locations I loved seeing in the game.”In fact, pretty much everything you see on-screen is real, even the infamously terrifying irradiated monsters, the Deathclaws. They were scary even as blobs of pixels in the original 90s Fallout games. In the show, they’re puppets, and apparently pretty frightening up close. “It was the closest look I’d ever gotten at a Deathclaw. In Fallout 4, whenever I saw one, it would instantly kill me,” laughs Nolan. “It was quite peculiar being able to stand there and stare at it.”“Even the radscorpion puppet was amazingly scary,” adds Robertson-Dworet. “It was sobig– the mama scorp, that is. The little ones were fine, they were like overgrown lobsters, but it was genuinely very scary when the puppeteer was charging the big one at me.”The Fallout series works because it’s made by talented film-makers who are also players and with the help of the people who created the actual games. Howard is replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment and resuming a long-dormant obsession with EA’s college (American) football games; Nolan has spent the summer playingZelda: Tears of the Kingdomwith his entire family; Robertson-Dworet is still working on scripts for the show, so she’s playing a lot of New Vegas (as is her husband).(Not everyone involved with the show is a gamer, though. In an interview withPC Gamer, Goggins the Ghoul said he had never played a Fallout game and had no intention of doing so. “No, I haven’t sat down to play the games. And I won’t. I won’t,” he said. “I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.” It’s OK, Walton, nobody is judging your gamer cred.)The second season is coming out weekly rather than in one binge-able batch of episodes, so we will all be experiencing it differently from last season – including Howard, Nolan and Robertson-Dworet, who will now be looking out for people’s reactions every week.“It has more depth, it’s bigger, it’s funnier, it has a lot of surprises,” says Howard. “I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.”What to playView image in fullscreenA folklore mystery … Year Walk.Illustration: SimogoSwedish developer Simogo made some of the most interesting iPhone and iPad games of the 2010s, from the unforgettable puzzle game Device 6 to the eerieYear Walk.

It’s unsurprising: 2025 has felt like a definitive and dismal break with government accountability, protections for marginalised people and holding back the encroachment of AI in creative and intellectual fields, to cherrypick just a few horrors. Anna von Hausswolff and Rosalía reached for transcendence from these earthly disappointments. Bad Bunny and KeiyaA countered colonial abuse and neglect with writhing resistance anthems. On a more personal scale, Lily Allen and Cate Le Bon grappled with disillusionment about mis-sold romantic ideals. For Jerskin Fendrix, the Tubs, Jennifer Walton, Jim Legxacy and Blood Orange, grief was, straightforwardly, grief for lost loved ones.Each of those albums was as distinctive and profound as any personal experience of loss always is. Dev Hynes’ fifth album as Blood Orange felt uniquely keyed into the fragmented, distracted headspace that comes after someone passes, in his case, his mother. Essex Honey’s restive nature was summed up in its painful opening lines, which you could read as the dying’s acceptance of death starkly contrasting the living’s ability to meet them on those terms: “In your grace, I looked for some meaning,” Hynes sings on Look at You. “But I found none, and I still search for a truth.”Blood Orange: The Field ft the Durutti Column, Tariq Al-Sabir, Caroline Polachek and Daniel Caesar – videoThat search is wide-reaching. The Field refashions the Durutti Column’s Sing to Me as a racing hymnal made for the stereo of a Ford Escort. There are tough little Robert Rental-style post-punk gems in The Train (Kings Cross) and Countryside that bristle with frustration. Vivid Light is a plainly soulful duet with Zadie Smith; Life, featuring Tirzah’s unmistakable vocals, basks in languid, flute-dappled funk. Hynes’ focus even shifts within individual songs, often to discomfiting effect. Without warning, a breakbeat will hurtle in and whip up silky strings; a shriek of flute may vault over drifting, collagist piano noodling, like a meteor singeing the washing line. Thinking Clean starts sounding as though it’s holding on to something, Hynes’ clipped entreaties accompanied by stilted piano; then it spins off into gorgeous disco, relinquishing all its tension – only for grunting cello to stagger in and mute the reverie. Other severe cello motifs repeat across the record, like unexpected jolts back to pain amid sunlit moments of reprieve.But when you let Essex Honey envelop you, it flows like the weather playing through a window. For all its stark contrasts, it’s gorgeously naturalistic, not just for the grounding wisps of found sound throughout – seagull cries, a sample of the 90s Black British sitcom Desmond’s, his mum discussing the Beatles the Christmas before she died – but thanks to Hynes’ elegance as an arranger. Every song is cast in a wistful glow, and moves the way the mind does. Look at You starts with plush, elongated synth notes that evoke breathing; part way through, Hynes’ own breath seems to take over the motif, and motes of sax and percussion float by like dust across a lens. His own vocal melodies somehow sound incidental and immaculately turned at the same time.‘It’s scary how many St George’s flags there were’: Blood Orange on coming home to Essex and mourning his motherRead moreHe doesn’t often sing alone. The album’s guest list is testament to a Rolodex built up over Hynes’ 20-plus years in music – including Caroline Polachek, Mustafa, Mabe Fratti, Lorde, Brendan Yates of Turnstile – but nor does he deploy his guests showily; more like patchwork pieces in the beautifully lived-in quilt of the record, there as support and to externalise hopeless emotions. Polachek, who pops up the most, offers an angelic presence with her pristine falsetto. On Mind Loaded, Lorde’s girlish rasp as she exclaims “everything means nothing to me” suggests someone coming apart at the edges. Hynes’ deep voice echoes hers, like an underworld figure affirming her worst fears and tempting her to succumb to darkness: “And it all falls before you reach me.”Essex Honey brushes up against that sort of mindset: when the worst has happened, why does anything else matter? Hynes’ impressionistic lyrics keep looking back, holding on: he disappears to the countryside of his Essex youth, finds solace in the unique comfort of sibling relationships; “regressing back to times you know / Playing songs you forgot you owned” as he sings on Westerberg. He almost didn’t release the record, wondering what the point of it was. Then he realised how privileged he was to be able to share his music with fans, and Essex Honey comes off as much a gift as a dispossession. The final song, I Can Go, concludes with a mirror image of the first line: “Now, what you know / Is nothing I can hold / I can go,” Mustafa sings. It feels like surrendering to the irretrievable, accepting that the lesson in loss is that there is no lesson. This startling and intuitive record captures the feeling of a life rearranged, and traces its awful new contours beautifully.Explore more on these topicsCulture2025 in cultureDev HynesIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, in Chichester, Katy Rudd’s musical of a man’s Bunyanesque journey to visit a dying woman met that challenge with lo-fi eccentricity and folksy songs with a foot-stomping spirit (composed by Michael Rosenberg, AKA Passenger).In the West End from 29 January.Read the review9.The Railway ChildrenAs site-specific shows go, this adaptation of E Nesbit’s classic was hard to top. It began with a ride on a vintage stream train in West Yorkshire, depositing the audience in a disused engine shed at Oxenhope. The story was given an Anglo-Indian twist and Joanna Scotcher’s stupendous set design incorporated track lines. There was one monumental set piece after another, including a train chugging in.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenMonumental … The Railway Children, Oxenhope.Photograph: James Glossop/Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture8.Measure for MeasureEmily Burns excised all the comedy from her modern-dress RSC production to turn this problem play into an intense and dangerous drama about sexual coercion and hypocrisy. Tom Mothersdale was a darkly magnetic Angelo and Burns even resolved the jarring ending to give the heroine, Isabella, her much-deserved freedom.Read the review7.The MaidsJean Genet’s drama about two maids playing sub-dom games and enacting murderous fantasies about their overbearing mistress has never felt so fearlessly punkish. Adapted and directed by Kip Williams at the Donmar Warehouse, it used smartphone content, projected on to screens, to give a modern resonance of influencer culture and the compulsive pull of online image-making.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenFearless … Lydia Wilson and Phia Saban in The Maids.Photograph: Marc Brenner6.1536Ava Pickett’s award-winning debut play was set in rural Essex where three Tudor-era women (played by Tanya Reynolds, Liv Hill and Siena Kelly) banter, bicker, dream and confide, with a growing puritanism and Anne Boleyn’s execution in the air. Staged at the Almeida, it hasa West End run from May. A play filled with complex female characters and razor dread.Read the review5.Hot MessBeginning as a meet-cute between Humanity and Earth, this climate disaster romcom was the best musical at the Edinburgh fringe. It proved that a deeply weird idea can fly in the right hands – in this case, the super-talented duo Jack Godfrey (music and lyrics) and Ellie Coote (book and direction). Heaps of humour, intelligence and two remarkable performers in Danielle Steers and Tobias Turley.Read the review4.Animal FarmGeorge Orwell’s farmyard allegory of fascism has been dramatised umpteen times so how did Amy Leach’s touring production manage to make it freshly harrowing? Partly because of its talented cast but also because of the physicality of its staging and potent, lyrical use of British Sign Language.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenFreshly harrowing … Tianah Hodding and Tachia Newall in Animal Farm.Photograph: Kirsten Mcternan3.Much Ado About NothingJamie Lloyd’s celebrity casting paid off with a confetti-filled bang in this modern reworking of Shakespeare at Theatre Royal Drury Lane, with Hayley Atwell and Tom Hiddleston as the sparring, midlife singletons Beatrice and Benedick. As joyous as the most riotous kind of wedding, there were disco lights, pumping bass, plushy animal masks and enough chemistry to set the room alight.Read the review2.Return to PalestineThis charismatic tragicomedy by Jenin’s Freedom Theatre was devised almost a decade ago but could not have been revived at a more potent moment, at Theatro Technis in London. Taking place on a tiny strip of white cloth and based on stories collected from across Palestine, six performers used physical theatre, clowning and oud music to searing effect.Read the review1.StereophonicDavid Adjmi’s play about the creative pains of making music received a record-breaking 13 Tony award nominations when it ran on Broadway – and for good reason. It began quietly as an unnamed 1970s band arrive at a studio to record an album, then turned up the tempo with slow-burn magnificence to draw a profound, funny and vivid portrait of these musician-couples as they fought, flirted, cried, made up. And when the songs came (written by Will Butler of Arcade Fire) they were a hurricane of pure, skinless emotion, with every performance raising shivers. The set at the Duke of York’s theatre was constructed as a replica studio behind glass, complete with a console and two hippy engineers. A thunderbolt of a show.Read the review.Arifa AkbarView image in fullscreenRecord-breaking … Stereophonic.Photograph: Marc BrennerComedy10.Sam Nicoresti:Baby DoomerWhen she and her girlfriend wondered how to pay for their upcoming wedding, Sam Nicoresti had a brainwave. “It’s easy, I’ll just win the Edinburgh comedy award!” And so she did, with this big-hitting, bid-for-the-mainstream hour, packed with jokes about gender transition, Gollum and a farcical incident in a high street changing room.Read the review9.John Tothill: This Must Be HeavenHis first and second standup shows both nearly drove John Tothill to an early grave – one, when the drugs trial that funded it went wrong; the other, when its run fell foul of a critical bout of appendicitis. But the third, which related the latter misadventure, broke him – and his fizzy, scholarly but hedonistic comedy – into the big time.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenBreaking into the big time … John Tothill.8.Tim Key: LoganberryGoodness me, Tim Key was in masterful form with this latest idiosyncratic standup hour, premiering at the Edinburgh fringe and touring in the new year. An oddball spin on the midlife crisis show, toying with Key’s supposed angst about his age, self-worth, celebrity status and singledom, it revealed an act in complete command of his unlike-any-other style.Read the review7.Ayoade Bamgboye: Swings and RoundaboutsThe best newcomer award at the fringe has launched some big talents over the years – Tim Minchin, Sarah Millican, Harry Hill. You wouldn’t back against Ayoade Bamgboye joining their ranks after this super-bright, always surprising and tricksy tale of cultural crossover and coming of age. One of 2025’s most arresting debuts.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenBest newcomer … Ayoade Bamgboye.6.Simple TownSimple by name, slippery by nature, this comedy quartet from New York made quite the splash on the fringe, watering the arid local sketch-comedy landscape with smart-slacker vignettes forever dodging your efforts to pin them down. A welcome reminder of how joyful team comedy can be.Read the review5.Adam Riches and John Kearns ARE Ball & BoePremiering last Christmas (after annual “Best of” lists had already been compiled!), but revived this year, Kearns and Riches’ affectionate send-up of the crooning duo made for an utterly irresistible hour, exploring double-act dynamics and the art v commerce struggle in patently ridiculous fashion.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenIrresistible … Adam Riches and John Kearns ARE Ball & Boe.Photograph: Matt Stronge4.Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive ComedianCan you be sexyandfunny? Can you be funny about being sexy? And if the answer’s yes, then why the backlash against Aussie import Elouise Eftos’s fabulous provocation of a show? Eftos lays out her ideas, and the pushback against them, in character (or is she?) as the hottest woman in the room, in a fantastically teasing hour on our vexed relationship with good looks.Read the review3.John Early: The Album TourThere’s a brand of comedy that splays across the stage millennial solipsism in the age of social media, and its high priest is John Early. This rare UK appearance by the Search Party star, at Soho Theatre Walthamstow, was a 2025 highlight, a variety night of pop covers, character work and standup comedy laying himself, and his vexed generation, bare.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenLaid bare … John Early.2.Cat Cohen: Broad StrokesBroad Strokes told the story of what happened whenthe most neurotically self-absorbed act in cabaret-comedy, New Yorker Cat Cohen, experienced a stroke at 30 (“isn’t thatsocreative?”) The diametric opposite of “trauma comedy”, the result was playful, musical, whip-smart and deliciously coy with our expectations that Cohen take her material remotely seriously.Read the review1.Nick Mohammed Is Mr Swallow: Show PonyIt’s been a big year for actor-comedian Nick Mohammed – and not just because of The Celebrity Traitors. Had he gone nowhere near Ardross Castle, 2025 would have remained a big step forward for the 45-year-old, who delivered a career-best standup set, Show Pony. Most of his previous stage work shrouded Mohammed like a traitor’s cloak behind magic, memory tricks and his bumptious northern alter ego, Mr Swallow. Here, Mohammed gave us that beloved character, but more of himself too – or at least the version of himself our identity-obsessed age demands. So was this a coming-out party, or a satire on a culture that demands Mohammed play up the identity it ascribes to him? Intriguingly, hilariously, it was both – and much more besides.Read the review.Brian LoganView image in fullscreenBig year … Nick Mohammed.Photograph: Matt CrockettDance10.Ebony ScroogeA late entry into the Top 10 for a new Christmas show from ZooNation, experts in feelgood energy and putting a twist on classic titles. Choreographer Dannielle “Rhimes” Lecointe turned Dickens’ A Christmas Carol into a hip-hop fable, the dancers as tight as Scrooge’s accounting and a helluva lot more fun.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenFeelgood energy … Leah Hill as Ebony Scrooge.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian9.Akram Khan: ThikraOK, so you might have to forget about trying to work out the story – narrative clarity has never been Khan’s strong point – but the magicking up of an enveloping atmosphere and a strong eye for visual drama and design absolutely are. Thikra swirled around themes of life, afterlife, spirits and spirituality.Read the review8.Manuel Liñán: Muerta de AmorA show with all the emotions turned up to 11 – as you’d expect from flamenco – especially passion and desire. But with Liñán, it’s never in a trite way. The choreographer and his all-male cast dealt in neediness and vulnerability as well as coursing testosterone, with singer Mara Rey matching them for power.Read the review7.QuadropheniaA mod ballet powered by an orchestral version of the Who’s Quadrophenia album, as well as by the timeless frustration and alienation of youth and a wardrobe full of Paul Smith suits. Perhaps it shouldn’t have worked, but it did, thanks to strong designs, killer riffs and dancer Paris Fitzpatrick in the lead.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenMod rules … Paris Fitzpatrick and Serena McCall in Quadrophenia: A Mod Ballet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian6.We Should Have Never Walked on the MoonA very cool event. In a collab with Rambert dance company, French collective (La)Horde took over the whole Southbank Centre, with 80 performers appearing across multiple levels and spaces, inside and out. The result was a buzzy if often bleak take on the distractions of screen-filtered 21st-century life.Read the review5.Trisha Brown Dance CompanyThe late Trisha Brown was a titan of postmodern dance and this was a welcome chance to see 1985’s Working Title. Brown’s reputation is well known, but the revelation of this double bill was companion piece In the Fall, by French choreographer Noé Soulier: an immensely satisfying exercise in clarity.Read the review4.Nico Muhly’s Marking TimeThree new dance works set to the music of Nico Muhly and each one a corker. Jules Cunningham offered up their strongest work yet; Maud Le Pladec gave us sirens in sequins and Michael Keegan-Dolan stole the show with a wild ride featuring folk singer Sam Amidon and a clan of dancing skeletons.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenWild ride … Sam Amidon, top, in The Only Tune by Michael Keegan-Dolan, part of Marking Time.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian3.Royal Ballet: PerspectivesThere was beautiful partnering for the male leads William Bracewell and Matthew Ball in Cathy Marston’s world premiere, Against the Tide, inspired by Benjamin Britten’s Violin Concerto. This triple bill also saw the Royal Ballet’s first stab at a work by American Justin Peck, attacked with sunny energy and precision.Read the review2.Figures in ExtinctionYou have to admire choreographer Crystal Pite, not just for her craft – masterful as it is – but for the way she tackles real-world issues, like the precarious future of our natural world (and humanity itself) in this collaboration with Complicité’s Simon McBurney and Nederlands Dans Theater. Things seem more hopeful in Pite’s hands.Read the reviewView image in fullscreenPure pleasure … Thick & Tight: Natural Behaviour.Photograph: Rosie Powell1.Thick & Tight: Natural BehaviourAn utterly unique and eccentric duo – Daniel Hay-Gordon and El Perry – who somehow manage to be completely left-field and yet very accessible at the same time. This show, the format like a series of sketches, had satire, silliness and lip-syncing. It had thoughtful portraits of cultural icons and the warmth of community – with a host of guest dancers. It had the pure pleasure of moving to music and some moments of divine dancing. It also had Perry and Hay-Gordon dressed as an orange pantomime horse with Donald Trump’s face coming out of its bottom.

Old favourites such as The White Lotus and Severance let us down, with gaping plotholes and a total absence of forward momentum respectively. New shows have failed to break through, too, largely due to an expectation that television shows are now the things people put on in the background while they scroll on their phones.All in all, it seems like there hasn’t been a show that people could really get their teeth into this year. That is, until Pluribus came along.Pluribus review – the audacity of the Breaking Bad creator’s new TV show is incredibleRead moreApple TV recentlyannouncedthat Pluribus is its biggest show of all time. Admittedly this might not be saying much, because anyone with an Apple TV account will see how often Ted Lasso rises to the top of the charts like a dead frog in a stagnant pond. But even beyond the streamer’s metrics, it feels like Pluribus is taking hold.There are probably two factors at work here. The first is that Pluribus is aVince Gilliganproject, the first one he’s been solely in charge of since Breaking Bad (its spinoff, Better Call Saul, was wonderfully delegated to Peter Gould). And, clearly, a new show by the creator of the best television programme in history is going to draw a lot of interest.The second is that Pluribus has a premise that is at the same time far-fetched and horribly plausible. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a vaguely embittered romantasy author who somehow remains intact while an alien virus takes over the world. The virus causes everyone to lose their identity, becoming enmeshed in a global hive mind that causes them to act with a sinister placidity. They work together. They seem kind. Bad vibes actively seem to hurt them, too; whenever Sturka has a temper tantrum, millions die. And so, simply because nobody else is going to do it, Sturka sets about saving the world.The story goes that the genesis of Pluribus is Gilligan imagining how hellish it would be if everyone was nice to him all the time. Which, let’s remember, they probably are. A rare showrunner who is happy to act as the face of their work, Gilligan was made a global celebrity by Breaking Bad. And with celebrity comes a sheen of insincere praise that can be hard to navigate. Certainly an early scene in the pilot, where Sturka grimaces through a series of toe-curling interactions with obsequious fans, hints that Gilligan can see through some of the bullshit.But the genius of the show is that you can read it as an allegory for anything you like. Might a show about a woman living in isolation in the midst of a global virus possibly be about Covid? If you look at it a certain way, sure. Could the hive’s distant, uncanny desire for sycophancy be a nod to our blind acceptance of AI? Absolutely it could. Maybe it’s just a show about the sole voice of reason in a world gone mad? Surely everyone has felt a little like that at some point or another.It’s this porous nature of the show that has led some to full-blown online obsession. Pluribus is a show that invites a wealth of theories. Reddit is practically drowning in takes about what happened to the hive, and what they want, and how to stop them. There is currently a huge debate over whether or not Carol is even right to resist the mob. Wouldn’t it be better to simply roll over and assimilate? If you’re into Pluribus, you’re in deep.Fortunately that level of obsession isn’t a prerequisite. Many viewers (myself included) can just luxuriate in the knowledge that the world’s greatest storytellers are parcelling out something new, at their own pace and exactly the way they want to. It’s rare to be given something this confident and well-executed. Why kill the frog by dissecting it too much?View image in fullscreenRhea Seehorn and Karolina Wydra in Pluribus.Photograph: Apple TV+Speaking of pace, this might be an issue down the line. If you watched Better Call Saul, which regularly walked the line between leisurely and stately, you will know how slowly Gilligan likes his stories to unfurl. His are shows about process: whether it’s working out how to destroy evidence without entering a room (Breaking Bad), or how to dismantle a car to check for hidden surveillance devices (Better Call Saul) or, as the most recent episode of Pluribus demonstrated, how to spend several weeks travelling from Paraguay to Albuquerque by car and on foot.This slow-burn pacing might be something that causes viewers to drop off as the series progresses. That certainly happened with Better Call Saul – the magnificent final season was watched by just a sixth of those who tuned in for the first episode – but hope springs eternal.Because, as with Better Call Saul, the quality is absolutely there. It’s a thoughtfully written, thematically rich, beautifully directed sci-fi that feels like it has a very clear sense of self. The finale doesn’t air until Christmas, but it ends on such an intriguing note that new episodes cannot come fast enough. It is currently the best show we have.

He was among the first to combine music, theatre and fashion, helping to craft Roxy Music’s glam rock aesthetic and designing Duran Duran’s yacht rock tailoring a decade later. More recently, he became Queen Camilla’s go-to designer.Often described as the greatest designer you’ve never heard of, Price only ever staged six shows – or “fashion extravaganzas” – in his 55-year career but just last month returned to the London catwalk for the first time in more than 30 years with a show in collaboration with16Arlington. There, Lily Allen created headlines by modelling a black velvet “revenge dress”.During his heyday in the 1970s, his shop in London’s World’s End, with its dark blue glass front, was the ultra-glamorous counterpoint to Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren’s Sex boutique further up Kings Road. The broadcaster Janet Street-Porter once described his clothes as “result-wear” – a modern definition of corseted, hyper-sexy glamour that blurred Rita Hayworth styling with futuristic technicolour, and helped a generation of musicians become bona fide style icons.View image in fullscreenPrice, centre, after his 16Arlington show last month, with Adwoa Aboah, Marco Capaldo, Kai-Isaiah Jamal, Edie Campbell and Lila Moss.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesPrice was born in Keighley, Yorkshire, moving to London in the early 1960s to study at the Royal College of Art. His first job in menswear at Stirling Cooper on London’s Wigmore Street led to him cutting Mick Jagger’s buttoned trousers worn on the Rolling Stones’ American Gimme Shelter tour in 1969.He went on to style Roxy Music’s eight album covers, with Bryan Ferry calling him a “master craftsman”, creating extravagant pin-up looks for the Roxy girlsAmanda Lear,Jerry HallandKari-Ann Mullerwho starred on the sleeves, as well as the band themselves. When Roxy disbanded in 1983, he went on to work with Duran Duran and David Bowie, creating instantly recognisable sharp, slick, broad-shouldered tailoring. He is also credited with designing the men’s cap-sleeve T-shirt seen on the back cover of Lou Reed’s 1972 classic Transformer.View image in fullscreenPrice and David Bowie at King's Cross station, London, in 1973.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesHis ability to shift from menswear to womenswear – not common in fashion – saw him work with Paula Yates, Kylie Minogue and Hall, who wore a Price wedding dress when she married Mick Jagger (a union that turned out not to be legally binding). He oncetold the Independent, “my clothes are men’s idea of what women should wear, and for that they’ll pay good money ... Men are looking for the sex robot fromLang’sMetropoliswith the perfect body offering endless fantasy sex.”He launched his own label in the 1970s and still ran shops in London. In the 1990s, Price became known as “the frock surgeon” for his technical ability and use of boning and corsets to create body-hugging gowns, using old techniques to create clothes for the future. Around this time he began designing made-to-order pieces for Camilla, including a number of looks for her first US tour as Duchess of Cornwall in 2005.His friend and collaborator, the milliner Philip Treacy said the fashion world has lost “a true visionary”. Posting on Instagram, he wrote: “Antony Price was not just a designer but a king in the world of fashion. His brilliance and technical ability were unmatched, and it breaks my heart that the world of fashion didn’t recognise his genius in his lifetime as he deserved. I will forever cherish our moments together, his humour, and his passion for life and craftsmanship.”The British Fashion Council, which gave him the Evening Glamour Award in 1989, described him as “a true original” as a designer, but added that as a figurehead in fashion, Price “was a champion of individuality and an encourager of young talent long before mentorship was a formalised idea. He believed in London as a creative city and lived that belief through his work friendships and generosity of spirit.”Explore more on these topicsFashionRoxy MusicDavid BowieDuran DuranQueen CamillanewsShareReuse this content"

He was the BBC’s head of music and arts during the 1960s and 70s, and went on to win awards for programmes such as The Golden Ring. He also launched theBBCYoung Musician of the Year in 1978, which discovered soloists such as the violinist Nicola Benedetti.BBC Radio 3 said in a post on social media that it was saddened by the news, adding: “He was a much-loved classical music broadcaster and had a huge influence on generations of arts programme-makers. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Sam Jackson, the controller of BBC Radio 3 and BBC Proms, said: “Very sad news – but what a life, and what a legacy. I count myself as being very fortunate to have produced a few radio programmes with Humphrey, back in the day. A man so full of grace, warmth, and brilliant anecdotes. Thinking of his family at this time.”The Royal Philharmonic Society, of which Burton was an honorary member, paid tribute to the broadcaster, saying: “Few have done so much to proclaim classical music’s wonders. In his many TV programmes and vivid writing, he set a gold standard for us all to sustain, engaging millions with music.”Burton was a frequent collaborator of Yehudi Menuhin andLeonard Bernstein, on whom he wrote a biography. He was also a presenter on Classic FM, where he worked on series about Menuhin and Bernstein. In a tribute,Classic FM said: “With these broadcasts and his writing he introduced multiple generations to classical music with the trademark enthusiasm that made his name synonymous with arts broadcasting.​”In a statement to the radio station, Burton’s family said: “He was deeply loved by his children and grandchildren, and his commitment to spreading the joy of classical music was so inspiring. An award‑winning writer, producer and film-maker and a huge influence on several generations of arts programme makers, he was also a former presenter at Classic FM. He will be missed beyond words. We take comfort in knowing he is now at peace.”Suzy Klein, the head of arts and classical music TV at the BBC, said: “In the history of arts and classical music broadcasting, there are few figures as influential as Sir Humphrey Burton. His vision, ambition and ability to forge partnerships across borders brought world-class opera, classical music and arts programming into the homes of many millions. Humphrey leaves an enormous legacy at the BBC and beyond, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Burton was also a founding member of London Weekend Television, where he edited and presented Aquarius. He won several awards including Baftas and Emmys and was knighted in the 2020 new year honours for services to classical music and the arts.In his 2021 autobiography, In My Own Time, Burton said he would like theBBC to take risks with new music programmes.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBCArtsnewsShareReuse this content"

The site is significant for Spinal Tap due to one ofthe original film’s most memorable gags, when a tiny replica of Stonehenge sarsens is lowered on to the stage due to a mix-up over measurements.The film-makers werespotted at Stonehenge in August, with English Heritage confirming at the time that the site had been hired, but did not reveal further details.A statement in Octobersaid that Eric Clapton, Shania Twain and Josh Groban were guest musicians at the concert. None of the footage was used in the recently released Spinal Tap sequel Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, but a cover version was recorded for the film featuring Elton John.DJs Paul Oakenfold and Carl Coxstaged the first officially sanctioned music showat Stonehenge in 2018, while the site was the location of a series of concerts organised by theStonehenge Free Festivalbetween 1974 and 1984.Rob and Michele Singer Reiner were found dead on Sunday at their house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.

The therapist contacted their daughter Romy Reiner, who lives nearby, who entered the house and found Rob Reiner’s body. The Times said that Romy “fled the house in anguish” without realising that her mother’s body was also inside, and that her roommate, who had accompanied her, called 911. Emergency responders then discovered Michele Singer Reiner’s body.Authorities have charged the couple’s son Nick Reiner, 32, with two counts of first-degree murder, and the use of a dangerous weapon, a knife. He is currently in custody without bail.The person quoted by the Times also disputed several details that had previously been reported. He said that Romy had told emergency responders that Nick lived in a guesthouse on the property but did not name him as a potential suspect at that time.View image in fullscreenRomy, Rob and Michele Singer Reiner at a tribute to Billy Crystal in 2018.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APThe source also disputed widely reported suggestions that Rob and Michele Singer Reiner had been particularly “apprehensive” over Nick’s behaviour in recent weeks, saying the family were “accustomed to working through [Nick’s] problems together”. This also includes reports of Nick’s “erratic” conduct at a party hosted by Conan O’Brien, held the night before the Reiners’ bodies were found. The source said that while he was not in a position to say whether Rob had “rebuked” his son for disruptive behaviour at the party, suggestions the pair had a “heated argument” were not correct.LAPD chief Jim McDonnell said on Tuesday that the coroner had yet to determine whether the Reiners died late on Saturday, or on Sunday. Media reports suggested that the state of their bodies indicated they had been dead for some hours.Nick Reiner was arrested at about 9.30pm on Sunday in the Exposition Park neighbourhood, about 15 miles away. He was due to appear in court on Tuesday for an arraignment hearing, but his lawyer Alan Jackson said that he had not received medical clearance and would not appear in court until Wednesday at the earliest.Explore more on these topicsFilmRob ReinernewsShareReuse this content"

Giuffre’s book, co-written by author-journalist Amy Wallace, was published in early October.Nobody’s Girl by Virginia Roberts Giuffre review – a devastating exposé of power, corruption and abuseRead moreThe memoir helped revive criticism ofAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly a British prince, whom Giuffre alleged had sex with her when she was 17. And it heightened demands that the Justice Department release its files on Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Giuffre died by suicide in April at age 41.“This is a bittersweet moment for us,” Giuffre’s family, including siblings Sky Roberts and Danny Wilson, said in a statement. “We are enormously proud of our sister, and the impact she continues to have on the world. We’re also filled with so much sorrow that she couldn’t be here to witness the impact of her words. In her absence, our family remains committed to ensuring her voice is everlasting.”Within weeks of Giuffre’s book being published, King Charles III stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence.‘Prince Andrew believed having sex with me was his birthright’: Virginia Giuffre on her abuse at the hands of Epstein, Maxwell and the king’s brotherRead moreMountbatten-Windsor has long denied Giuffre’s claims but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations.He paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.This weekGiuffre’s family expressed their “deep disappointment”after the Metropolitan police announced Mountbatten-Windsor will not face a criminal investigation in the UK over allegations against him.In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

These shows will be replaced by Up Late, which the BBC says “will feature a curated blend of well-known classics from the 1970s to the present day. The music will highlight a strong Scottish influence, showcasing both Scotland’s most established musicians and its rising talent”.But the open letter, signed by the aforementioned musicians and dozens of others across the creative industries in Scotland and beyond, argues that the personally curated selections of the current DJs are invaluable.“A trusted presenter plays our song and says our name on national radio for the first time,” states the letter, organised by Stephen McAll of the band Constant Follower. “Listeners’ ears, and industry doors that were previously closed, begin to creak open. That single play announces to promoters, funders, labels and audiences: this is someone worth paying attention to. BBCRadioScotland is the only station in Scotland that has anything that comes close to that level of career-igniting clout. And within BBC Radio Scotland, it is the curated late-night shows that provide that space where exciting new music can be discovered, and new artists introduced to Scottish listeners.”The letter calls for the BBC to “pause implementation of these programme changes until meaningful consultation with Scotland’s music sector (including artists, industry organisations and audiences) has taken place”, echoing an earlier call from the Scottish Music Industry Association.The Musicians’ Union has also criticised the plans, with Caroline Sewell, regional organiser for Scotland and Northern Ireland, saying: “We urge BBC Scotland to reconsider, to work with the music community to safeguard opportunities for Scottish musicians – not to contribute to the ongoing decimation of opportunities for our incredible musicians who consistently enrich our lives and communities.”When presented with the open letter, BBC Radio Scotland said in a statement: “It’s not unusual for radio stations to undergo changes, particularly in an increasingly competitive audio market and, whilst we understand some audiences may be disappointed, it is important that BBC Radio Scotland continues to listen to audience feedback and evolve its offer.”The station said it “remains proud to showcase the full breadth of Scotland’s musical talent, from established performers to the next generation of artists, across its schedule. Specialist music remains a cornerstone of BBC Radio Scotland’s music policy. Half of our total music hours are specialist.”BBC Radio Scotland has previously stated: “The existing programmes are ending after a procurement process in which the current independent production companies making those shows did not bid for the work.”However, organisers of the open letter argued that no such bids were made because BBC Radio Scotland had called for a substantially different and new style of show, featuring, according to a publicly available document inviting companies to tender for the shows, “more mainstream, easy-listening tracks”.Up Late will be presented by Lynne Hoggan, taking over the time slot from veteran presenters Iain Anderson, Billy Sloan, Roddy Hart and Natasha Raskin Sharp. Hart will continue to present on BBC Radio Scotland in two new shows on Saturday and Sunday evenings, and Ashley Storrie will continue to present the same time slot on Friday evenings, though the other three presenters will be removed from the schedules at the end of 2025.The letter continues: “A playlist doesn’t give you an enthusiastic and globally respected quote you can use on tour posters, press releases or the sleeve of your debut EP. Neither does a playlist go to small gigs by unknown bands, or offer encouragement and advice to young, upcoming artists … No, it’s the deeply passionate music-lovers, who have spent their working lives inside the Scottish audio landscape, who do these things … These are the trusted voices of our late-night radio. We do not want to lose them.”View image in fullscreen‘Things have a value beyond listening figures’ … James Yorkston.Photograph: Robin Little/RedfernsPosting on social media, Billy Sloan said he was “reluctantly” leaving his role after 11 years, and added: “I can honestly say – hand on heart – that I’ve never played a single record I didn’t think was great. But it appears that in the new format that is being introduced – reported in the press to be more of an ‘easy listening/broad mainstream appeal’ – that is no longer what is required.”Folk musician James Yorkston was among others taking issue with that planned shift in focus. “I like easy going evening friendly pop music as much as the next ageing Fifer, but there are already plenty of places to hear it,” he said. “Sometimes things have a value beyond listening figures or fear of confusing someone. Fingers crossed the decision to lose those shows will be reversed.”Defending its decision, BBC Radio Scotland pointed to a range of other specialist music shows including Travelling Folk and The Quay Sessions, and said it remained “deeply committed” to championing specialist music. It also highlighted the ongoing BBC awards Young Traditional Musician of the Year, Young Scottish Jazz Musician of the Year, Young Scottish Classical Musician of the Year and BBC Introducing Scottish Act of the Year.The new lineup of programming is currently scheduled to begin in the first week of 2026.Explore more on these topicsMusicRadioBBCScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The show takes place 200 years into a post-nuclear apocalypse where most humans are scratching out an existence in a stricken wasteland California of sand dunes, outlaw gangs and mutated monsters. Resources are scarce. Life is cruel. Death is a constant. It should be terrifying. Instead, it’s often hilarious.A wicked sense of humour elevatedthe first seasonof Prime Video’s well-received, no-expense-spared adaptation ofthe long-running video game franchise. An early episode opened with one faction dumping newborn pups into an incinerator – in case you were wondering who the bad guys were – and those flashes of satirical glee gave Fallout an edge over gloomier post-apocalyptic shows such asThe Walking DeadorThe Last of Us.View image in fullscreenWalton Goggins as Cooper Howard in Fallout season two.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/Courtesy of PrimeIf the setting was outlandish and the violence often OTT, the core characters played things admirably straight. Lucy (Ella Purnell) was a wide-eyed ingénue who had experienced a literally sheltered upbringing in an underground vault. Witnessing her golly-gosh, can-do attitude collide with the lawless chaos of the surface as she searched for her kidnapped father Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) was a hoot. The similarly naive Maximus (Aaron Moten) was an orphan brought up in a militaristic religious cult who inherited a clanking mechanical battle suit after his unpleasant superior had a run-in with an irradiated bear.The world-weary contrast to these young innocents was the Ghoul, played by Walton Goggins with a startling CGI makeover that convincingly lopped off his nose. This durable mutant with a cowboy hat, ragged duster coat and saddlebag was every inch the drawling, sardonic gunslinger. But pre-cataclysm flashbacks shaded in the Ghoul’s previous existence as movie star and devoted family man Cooper Howard, navigating a red scare in Fallout’s heightened version of the 1950s.Season two continues the odd couple team-up between Lucy and the Ghoul as they pursue the discredited Hank, last seen yomping toward Vegas in chunky power armour to enact some awful, unspecified scheme. Lucy still says “fudge” rather than swearing but is quicker on the draw than she used to be. Her travelling companion remains impassive as she attempts to break though the crustiness and rekindle his sense of humanity. (“Empathy’s like mud: you lose your boots in that stuff,” grumbles the Ghoul when she rushes to help a stranger.)View image in fullscreenIf the suit fits … Aaron Moten, right, as Maximus in Fallout season two.Photograph: Lorenzo Sisti/Prime VideoThere is also much more of Goggins in dapper matinee idol mode as the 1950s thread tunnels deeper into who might have been responsible for the original atomic disaster. Cooper’s strained relationship with his wife Barb (Frances Turner), an exec at the blandly sinister Vault-Tec corporation, gives him some meaty material to get his teeth into, even if the retro-futurist production design of the flashbacks – all covetable curvy cars and Jetsons-style robotic mod-cons – is distractingly handsome.She may have left her vault life far behind but season two often cuts back to see how Lucy’s old and only slightly inbred underground crew are faring, notably her brother Norm (Moisés Arias) who is locked in a battle of wills with a brain in a jar. And we eventually catch up again with Maximus, who has returned to the bosom of his old brotherhood and is alternately sleepwalking through his duties and daydreaming about his time on the road with Lucy.Those are a lot of plates to keep spinning but Fallout has always had a hopscotching narrative structure, confident that audiences could keep up with its constant parade of weirdos and tangle of plotlines. Season two draws more directly from its gaming source material – notably 2010’s admiredFallout: New Vegas– but remains pleasingly dense with jokes, splatter and slapstick.Future episodes see attention-grabbing guest roles for Kumail Nanjiani and Macaulay Culkin; Nanjiani, in particular, seems to relish the chance to play a cocky heavy. But the most notable addition to the cast is Justin Theroux as the immaculately moustachioed Robert House, a reclusive Howard Hughes-esque founder of a robotics empire and would-be shaper of the future. Theroux’s barely restrained fervour and distinctive accent work – turning every “w” into a breathy caress – makes him stand out in a cast not exactly short on larger-than-life characters, even if his appearances are rather stingily rationed out.Season one launched last April as a bingeable box set but this time new episodes are releasing weekly. That might be intended to create space for obsessive fans to swap theories about Fallout’s various unfolding conspiracies. But that is perhaps to misunderstand its more visceral appeal. Thankfully for every shadowy corporate mystery in season two there are at least three exploding heads and a chance to hear Purnell skilfully finding another inflection on her adorable “okey-dokey!” catchphrase.Fallout season two is on Prime Video now, with new episodes weeklyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewScience fiction TVGamesFalloutreviewsShareReuse this content"

He’d arranged for eight “pseudo-patients” to attend appointments at psychiatric institutions, where they complained to doctors about hearing voices that said “empty”, “hollow” and “thud”. All were admitted, diagnosed with either schizophrenia or manic-depressive psychosis. They immediately stopped displaying any “symptoms” and started saying they felt fine. The first got out after seven days; the last after 52.Told of these findings, psychiatrists at a major teaching hospital found it hard to believe that they’d make the same mistake, so Rosenhan devised another experiment: over the next three months, he informed them, one or more pseudopatients would go undercover and, at the end, staff would be asked to decide who had been faking it. Of 193 patients admitted, 20% were deemed suspicious. It was then that Rosenhan revealed this had been a ruse as well: no pseudopatients had been sent to the hospital at all. Not only had doctors failed to spot sane people in their midst; they couldn’t reliably recognise the actually insane.Rosenhan’s gambit seized the public imagination. Were the men in white suits just quacks? Was mental illness even real? Two years later, the filmOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nestadded to the sense of reputational meltdown, and the psychiatric establishment responded with a major tightening up of diagnostic criteria, squeezing disparate symptoms into even tighter boxes. A freewheeling challenge to psychiatry ended up provoking a kind of counter-reformation, making the profession more medicalised than it had been for decades.The whole affair is a neat example of the ideological switchbacks Edward Bullmore maps in his fascinating, personally inflected history of psychiatric ideas. It is all the more mind-boggling – pun intended – when you find out Rosenhan’s paper was largely made up. Research by journalist Susannah Cahalan in 2019concluded thatmost of the pseudopatients were invented; one colleague remembered the psychologist as a “bullshitter”.Whether or not he lied, though, Rosenhan exposed a faultline that has run through the field almost since its inception. Bullmore, a professor of psychiatry, blames it on a bogus divide between the body and the mind. He calls this the “original schism”, bequeathed to us by Descartes, and before him Saint Paul. It falsely suggests that our thoughts and any psychological distress we experience exist in a separate domain, detached from the flesh. Diseases are either “organic” (like cholera or Alzheimer’s) or “functional” (like depression or schizophrenia), emerging mysteriously from an entirely healthy body.Practically speaking, this schism cleaves psychiatry from the rest of medicine, meaning the physical health of patients with mental illness is often badly neglected. But it also sets up a division within psychiatry itself, between what has been referred to glibly as the “mindless” tribe, which believes biology explains everything, and the “brainless” one, which ignores neuroscience and looks for answers in a person’s upbringing and way of relating to the world.The emerging picture marries biology and experience in a way that was always inevitable, since they are not really divided at allWe’re all familiar with Sigmund Freud, patron saint of the brainless contingent (though the founder of psychoanalysis started out as a neuroanatomist, and – unlike some of his disciples – found iteasy to imaginethat advances in biology might one day replace “the whole of our artificial structure of hypothesis”). But his mindless contemporary, Emil Kraepelin, is far less well-known, “the most important psychiatrist you’ve never heard of”, according to Bullmore.Kraepelin led a German school of thought that saw mental illnesses as manifestations of physical disease, and imagined that, as with tuberculosis, a causal factor or “germ” would surely one day be found to explain them. His focus – and Bullmore’s – is the pattern of symptoms we know as schizophrenia, which Kraepelin called dementia praecox (“early dementia”). For him, the contents of any given psychosis – delusions, paranoid fantasies – were only relevant insofar as they suggested a diagnosis. Interpreting them would not help.When, after Rosenhan’s antics, a new diagnostic manual was issued by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980, it was labelled “neo-Kraepelinian”. But before that, the pendulum had already swung several times – from the first murmurings of dissent by Freud and his followers, to the genocidal overreach of the German school under Nazism, to the “victory” of the refugee psychoanalysts in the aftermath of the second world war. Bullmore is excellent at showing how our understanding of mental illness has not blindly “followed the science”, patterning instead with the tides of history. The brainless tribe won the literal war – and, as a result, the intellectual one as well.But science does march on, and in the last four decades there has been loads of it, which Bullmore charts from his vantage point first at the Maudsley in London, where the tribes clustered in different parts of the canteen, and then at the University of Cambridge. One of his touchstones is Susan Sontag’s essay Illness As Metaphor, which showed how any “intractable and capricious” disease becomes a container for morbid fantasies until such time as we have a better explanation. Now we know that TB is a bacterial infection of the lungs, we don’t tend to think that sensitive poets are naturally more prone to it, as we once did.Schizophrenia may finally be on the cusp of that transformation – something truly momentous, given the puzzle this strange and brutal disease has posed for so long. As Bullmore carefully explains, advances in scanning, maths, genomics and immunology have piled up to give us a clearer understanding of the illness. It is probably caused by the abnormal development of brain networks in childhood and adolescence; this, the evidence suggests, happens under the influence of immune dysfunction, and the cause of that is variation in a broad range of genes, interacting in particular ways with the environment. Triggers can include infections, abuse, social stress or drug use.The emerging picture marries biology and experience in a way that was always inevitable, since they are not really divided at all – and offers promising new avenues for prevention. The task for the next generation is to translate the science into better outcomes in the real world. Given what we now know, prevention, including better health and social services for mothers and young children, should play a major role.And what about those colourful types, the anti-psychiatrists? In the 1960s, the shaman-like figure of RD Laing captured the zeitgeist with his idea that psychosis was simply a rational person’s attempt to “live in an unliveable situation” – of which the modern world provided plenty. Bullmore admits that the anti-psychiatrists “have a lot of the best tunes”. I imagine that many of Laing’s insights could survive the new model of schizophrenia as descriptions of social stress, but despite being sympathetic to him in a romantic kind of way, Bullmore doesn’t really make an attempt at salvage. Nor does he examine the adverse effects of powerful, chronically administered psychiatric medication, and how these might confound some of the evidence of biological differences in people with schizophrenia – something contemporary anti-psychiatrists will doubtless take issue with.But he is emphatic about the need to reckon with psychiatry’s dark past. When he started to research the Nazi programme to exterminate psychiatric patients, he was surprised to find “remarkably little” material in any language for him to consult. This is despite the fact that about 260,000 asylum inmates were murdered, something that followed directly from the theory of dementia praecox as a disorder of one or two defective genes that could be expunged from thevolk. This violence continues to cast its shadow, and he notes that most psychiatrists, regardless of tribe, would agree that “to recover from trauma it is important to talk about it, somehow, at some stage in the recovery process”.Bullmore’s writing has flair and occasional flashes of anarchic humour; as with his 2018 study of depression, The Inflamed Mind, this book is both intellectually exciting and highly readable. Like the best of his psychiatric forebears, he is far from the stern megalomaniac of caricature, animated instead by a desire to do right by his patients, to cut through the ideological commitments that slow down progress, and above all, to understand.The Divided Mind: A New Way of Thinking About Mental Health by Edward Bullmore is published by New River (£20).

First “a colony of moss” speaks – or rather, does not speak, but “if such a colony could tell the story of its life”, here’s some of what it might say. Then we have Agnes in 2018, American, tall, awkward, expert in forensic pathology and uncertain about everything else, including much of life in England. And then, in the first person, there is an iron age teenage girl, the druid of her village, riding towards a Roman town with her brother Aesu and friend Crab: “I had been druid for two seasons at that point and everyone said I was doing very well.”Agnes has a post-doctoral fellowship in Manchester, from which she is summoned to the discovery of a body in a peat bog in Ludlow. The story shadows that of Lindow Man, found by peat harvesters in a bog near Wilmslow in 1984. In this novel, “Ludlow” is a town in which “the steel mill has closed down” leaving nothing but “[a] few shops, a Tesco, a Pizza Express”. It’s “the Gateway to the north” and a bus ride from Manchester. Novelists may of course invent time and place as they see fit, but it’s an odd choice to borrow the location of a bourgeois satellite town of Manchester and give it the name of a pretty medieval market town in the Welsh Marches, with a history that belongs to neither.Agnes’s weak social skills are balanced by joy in her academic specialism, which allows her to see immediately both that this body is 2,000 years old and that the young woman lived for weeks after her obvious injuries. Her knowledge and instinct for individual living and dead bodies is the strongest element of this uneven novel. She can read the way people move and keep still in ways she can’t read voices and faces, and she cares about particular lives in ways she doesn’t care for ecology or archaeology in general.North builds and sustains a material world vividly and with close attention to the bodily experiences of light, landscape and textilesPeople pile in after the discovery of the body: environmentalists who want to save the bog from developers, the niece of a woman whose husband confessed to killing her and dumping the body there 40 years ago, archaeologists seeing a career-making find, but Agnes is the only one primarily concerned with one ancient girl’s life and death. Her own backstory is well told, its American setting as solid as the present-day Manchester/Ludlow is wobbly.It’s likely that readers without much knowledge of iron age archaeology and bog bodies would find those sections comfortable enough. North builds and sustains a material world vividly and with close attention to the bodily experiences of light, landscape and textiles. The scene where the young druid encounters some of the power and goods of the Roman empire is memorable. But even from a position of amateur enthusiasm more than expertise, I’m distracted by oddities in this world: distinctly modern shame at a pregnancy outside “marriage”; archaeologists speculating that those who put the bodies in the bog intended them to be found later, when there is widespread evidence that many were taken from bogs, kept indoors and put back several times over centuries. There’s always an interesting question about the representation of historic and prehistoric speech and worldview, and no correct answer, but North’s solutions are unthinkingly modern in ways that Sarah Hall’s, for example, are not.The extent to which it’s possible for fiction to voice or represent the lives of plants and animals is important to many modern writers whose thinking includes environmental crisis. The risk is anthropomorphism, and the disclaimer at the top of each section that “a colony of moss does not” imagine/narrate/remember whatever it then goes on to do is not enough to avoid the error. North’s mossy chorus is little more than a projection of human eco-anxiety, in the same way that her iron age story doesn’t step far from the assumptions and traditions of 21st-century America, and her mash-up of English cities and towns doesn’t recognise the specificities of place and time. Bog Queen could be, and occasionally is, beautifully strange, but overall, imagination and research don’t reach far enough.Bog Queen by Anna North is published by W&N (£18.99).

But those liberties are nothing compared with North by Northwest, The Manchurian Candidate or ThanksgivingStuart HeritageWed 17 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 17 Dec 2025 02.01 ESTShareTo be able to enjoy Kate Winslet’s new Christmas movie, Goodbye June, you have to be able to do a couple of things. First, if you’ve ever suffered any form of bereavement, you may have to approach it slowly, since the film is explicitly about the death of a parent. But the other thing you need to do is not Google the age of any of the cast.This is for good reason. The titular June is played by Dame Helen Mirren, and her husband is played byTimothy Spall. Fine actors and national treasures, the pair of them. However, Mirren is 80 years old, and Spall is 68. Again, this is fine. You have undoubtedly met couples with bigger age gaps than this, and in all probability they are perfectly happy together.The problem, however, comes when you factor in the ages of their children. Goodbye June is about four siblings who have to push their differences aside in a moment of extreme familial crisis. One of the siblings is played by Toni Collette. Toni Collette is 53 years old, and you’re already way ahead of me here, aren’t you?View image in fullscreenAndrea Riseborough, Johnny Flynn, Kate Winslet and Timothy Spall in Goodbye June.Photograph: APIn order to square this circle, you have to accept that Mirren’s character must have been 28 years old when she had Collette, but Spall must have been just 15. And at no point during the film is this mentioned. Perhaps that’s wise – after all, a Christmas movie about a dying parent is heavy enough, so a Christmas movie about a dying parent of a woman who was herself the daughter of a literal schoolboy might be overegging the pudding a little – but it is nevertheless quite weird.But let’s not be too heavyhanded here. Since the dawn of cinema, actors have been playing older and younger than their actual age. Maybe – hopefully! – Timothy Spall is playing someone a decade older than he really is here. The bigger problem is that, when you start noticing this sort of thing, it’s everywhere.View image in fullscreenYoung at heart …  Renée Zellweger with Mila Jankovic and Casper Knopf in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy (2025).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyIn the most recent Bridget Jones film, the lead character (played by Renée Zellweger, 56) has a six-year-old. And in Lulu Wang’s Expats, Nicole Kidman (58) has a toddler. Again, wonderful for their characters, and having a baby later in life is great. It’s just weird that nobody mentions this, especially because it’s statistically so rare. Indeed, to return to Goodbye June for a moment, it may be worth mentioning that Collette’s character is also pregnant.While the number of women in the US over the age of 50 giving birth has grown dramatically over the last few decades – there were 144 recorded births in 1997, compared with 1,217 in 2023 – it still represents a vanishingly small slice of all births. Women over the age of 50 account for just 0.03% of births, so you’d think that something this rare would have at least been acknowledged in the plots.Things get a little muddier in Eli Roth’s 2023 horror Thanksgiving, since it’s revealed that the character played by Gina Gershon (61 at time of release) was pregnant. This isn’t completely unheard of – in 2019, 74-year-old Erramatti Mangayamma gave birth to twins after receiving IVF – but the pregnancy would almost certainly be the most significant thing about her character. Some forums have tried to explain this away by theorising that her character was never actually pregnant, and that the film’s obsessed villain was simply inventing it, but this is altogether too much thought spent on an Eli Roth film.View image in fullscreenGina Gershon and her baby scan in Thanksgiving.Photograph: Sony PicturesWhat’s the reason for this? In the case of Bridget Jones and Expats, it may be because the film-makers wanted to reflect the growing trend of women giving birth later in life, but then again it may be because Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger can both pass for younger than they really are.Then again, in the case of Goodbye June, it may be because Kate Winslet had access toHelen Mirrenand Timothy Spall and, when you have the possibility of casting actors of their magnitude, you’re willing to fudge the numbers a little.View image in fullscreenAngela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarIt’s distracting, but it’s no bad thing in itself. In fact, you could even see it as a corrective to years and years of Hollywood casting women to play the mothers of actors who aren’t all that much older than them. Jessie Royce Landis played Cary Grant’s mother in North by Northwest, for example, even though they were so close in age that she would have had to have him when she was eight.Similarly, Angela Lansbury would have had to have given birth to Laurence Harvey at the age of three for The Manchurian Candidate to make sense. And the less thought about Oliver Stone’s Alexandra (in which Angelina Jolie played the mother of Colin Farrell, who is just 362 days younger than her), the better. Compared with this, Timothy Spall was practically geriatric when he fathered Toni Collette for Goodbye June. Thank God Hollywood used to be so much creepier.Explore more on these topicsFilmHelen MirrenKate WinsletTimothy SpallBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyChildbirthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Superficially, it appears to be about a guy named Kim Dok-ja (Ahn) who finds that the web novel he’s been following for years is turning into reality. That means the whole world becomes gamified, as if everyone has been turned into players compelled to kill to survive, while plagued by CGI monsters and puckish digitaldokkaebi(demons) which explain things when the rules change.But under the surface, this film is really about being popular, coping with traumatic childhood experiences such as being forced to beat up your best friend, getting a pimple, and building up enough gumption to tell authority figures – older people, your boss, the author of the book you’ve been a fan of for ages – that they suck.A goodly chunk of the action in the first hour takes place on a commuter train which will inevitably remind some viewers of the far superior zombie-themed featureTrain to Busan. That comparison gets thinned down with a big dollop of Ready Player One meets Squid Game meets Super Mario Bros: as Dok-ja and his newfound friends struggle to survive, the excessively complex gaming narrative involves collecting coins and then spending them on upskilling. Dok-ja’s buddies include pretty co-worker Yoo Sang-ah (Chae Soo-bin), nerdy primary-school-aged boy Lee Gil-yeong (Kwon Eun-seong) who loses his beloved ant farm in the first melee, fictional soldier come to life Lee Hyung-sung (Shin Seung-ho) and cold-hearted Yoo Joong-hyuk (heart-throb Lee Min-ho) who is the protagonist of the original web novel.You’d think with all that palaver about novels becoming reality and so on that this would have a bit more fun with metatextual jokes, but no, the film is profoundly single note. Similarly, all the monsters kind of look the same with different serpentine-dragony-demigorgonoid components mixed and matched as needed, all of them moving with the same kind of hypersmooth sinuous motion generated by off-the-shelf CGI engines.Omniscient Reader: The Prophecy is on digital platforms from 15 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsGamesK-popKPop Demon HuntersSouth KoreaAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

That might be an ever more unattainable ideal in our time of Punch and Judy politics, culture wars and artistic self-censorship. This is one of the reasons why Sam Grabiner’s play about a north London Jewish family eating dinner on Christmas Day feels so singularly outspoken.It begins lightly with humour (“You’re not Larry David, you’re from Hendon”), then builds to bickering and full-on fallouts, covering antisemitism, spirituality, belonging and how the Israel-Gaza war has shaped these Londoners’ sense of self. There is certainly no conflation of Israel and Jewishness but a deliberate foray into this highly charged and contested ground.View image in fullscreenEmotional … Samuel Blenkin in Christmas Day.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt is not a perfect play but an immensely courageous one. So is its programming by outgoing artistic director Rupert Goold. I have not seen a drama that deals with British Jewish identity with this much complexity. There are some manufactured rows between characters as a result, but they hold you, and emanate danger merely in their airing.In James Macdonald’s interval-free production, the dinner begins as father Elliot (Nigel Lindsay) visits his son, Noah (Samuel Blenkin), and daughter, Tamara (Bel Powley). They are living in an abandoned office cum squat and Miriam Buether’s set design gives it the slightly sinister gloom of an underground bunker. Various others drift in, including non-Jewish flatmate Maud (Callie Cooke), who carries the comic burden of explaining yuletide ritual, and Tamara’s ex-boyfriend Jack, returning from Israel and now called Aaron (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd). The word “genocide” causes the biggest explosion when Tamara uses it to describe the killings in Gaza.“Have you seen the news?” characters ask each other without naming the incident directly. It could be a reference to theBondi beach terror attacktargeting Hanukah celebrations; it might be the latest news of terror out of Gaza or equally, you feel, a terrible global event that has led this family into an underground refuge.The drama meanders, as if unfolding in real time. Sometimes its silences are reminiscent ofAnnie Baker; at other times they feel arid. The play throws curveballs that come to nothing, such as a doped-up flatmate who passes through, as does a drug dealer (both played by Jamie Ankrah). Too many plot revelations come after the central discussions and it enters a symbolic realm in the last moments, which include a dead fox and a ritualistic baptism of sorts. This is an arcane part of the play’s risk-taking that does not come off.But what is remarkable is that, despite the ideological gulfs between the characters, there is an underlying affinity that allows them to disagree. Tamara argues against occupation and Israel itself. Elliot, pained by her logic, has a more emotional response: “They [Palestinians] had their chance … It’s ours now.” This is stuff you don’t hear said aloud and it is handled with utmost respect for all the perspectives across the dinner-table divides.AtAlmeida theatre, London, until 8 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreJudaismreviewsShareReuse this content"

By the time Mickey topped the US charts 43 years ago this week, in 1982, Basil had already spent four decades in the entertainment industry. The deeper you go, the more places you realise she was. WhenElvis Presleysings “See the girl with the red dress on” in his 1964 movie Viva Las Vegas, and points across the dancefloor, the gyrating girl in the red dress is Basil. When Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper take LSD at the end of Easy Rider with two sex workers, one of them is Basil. When dance troupe the Lockers show​case their pre-hip-hop street dance moves on Soul Train in 1976, it’s six guys and … Basil. By the time of Mickey she had already worked with everyone from David Bowie to Tina Turner to Talking Heads, with more to come.Basil has been-there-done-that in so many places, for so long, and over the course of our two-hour conversation she’ll casually drop asides such as “… so I went to see Devo with Iggy Pop and Dean Stockwell” or “… me and Bowie had just come from dinner with Bob Geldof, Paula Yates and Freddie Mercury” or “I was just at Bette Midler’s 80th birthday party, what a bash!” She’s now 82 years old but on Zoom, from her dance studio in Los Angeles, she doesn’t look much older than she did in the video for Mickey – and she looked like a teenager inthat, even though she was 38 at the time. Her memory is perfectly sharp, too, and her energy levels are as high as ever, as she shares her packed life story with animated diction. If she has a secret to eternal youth, it’s that she has danced her whole life, and she still does, she says. “Dance is my drug of choice. You get high from it, and it gives you community.”View image in fullscreenBasil during a visit to Britain to perform ‘Mickey’ on Top of the Pops.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBasil’s brief pop career was, she explains, actually thanks to Manchester and the BBC. She signed to a British record label in 1979 to record her album Word of Mouth, which included a reworking of Kitty, an album track by forgotten British band Racey. Basil gave it a gender-switch, a new wave synth makeover and that unforgettable cheerleader chant – “I had tobegmy record company to let me record it,” she remembers. “They thought it was aterribleidea; they didn’t know what cheerleaders were.” She made little films for a few of the songs, singing and dancing. “This was a year before MTV,” she explains. By chance, a couple of BBC producers, Ken Stevenson and Alan Walsh, watched them playing in a record shop in Manchester, “and they saw in the credits that I had choreographed and directed it all.”They invited her to make a two-part special for the BBC, with more song-and-dance numbers and little comedy skits. The show plays like a lost time capsule of 80s kitsch: somewhere between punk, new wave and hip-hop; colourful, playful, subtly subversive, almost like an over-caffeinated kids’ cartoon. It was this that launched Mickey as a hit single – first in the UK (in March), then in Australia (a No 1 that July), then, after a new American recording contract and a new video (Basil wore her original high school cheerleader outfit), a No 1 in the US that December. “It took Britain, land of Boy George and the Beatles, to go, ‘Look at this. Let’s put this on television,’” she says. “In the US, they were like: ‘What is she thinking?’”Basil really did have showbiz in her Italian American blood. “It never occurred to me that I would do anything else,” she says. “My mother’s side of the family were vaudevillian stars, kind of acrobatic comedians.” Her father was an orchestra leader, first in Chicago, then at the Sahara hotel in Las Vegas. “I stood on the side of the stage from 1947 to 1957 seeing a show every weekend; everybody from Josephine Baker to Nat King Cole to Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland.”View image in fullscreenBasil in the ‘Mickey’ video.Photograph: Sipa Press/REX/ShutterstockShe was their only child. “They thought I was the centre of the earth. I was extremely spoilt. And I was really a good dancer. They saw what I had going, and they really pushed it.” Her teenage life was daily ballet classes and acting lessons, followed by go-go clubs every night, “dancing the pony, the mashed potato, all of that”. The tide was turning: the youth rebellion of the early 1960s was making older entertainers look stale and square. Basil was one of a handful of dancers who really knew what the kids were digging, so she soon picked up work dancing and choreographing. It sounds like a great time to be young, I suggest. “I think it’s always a great time to be young!” she replies.Given all this, Basil wasn’t particularly fazed to find herself standing in for Ann-Margret and teaching Elvis Presley dance steps when she was just 20. “Being nervous around Elvis? He was part of the show-business family. I mean, I appreciated it was Elvis Presley, but not in that crazy fan way.” Or hanging backstage during the 1964 concert movie T.A.M.I Show, which she also choreographed. “We were in the green room with the Rolling Stones and Smokey Robinson watching James Brown, and the Stones realised, ‘Oh shit, we gotta followhim?’” Likewise the Rat Pack movie Robin and the Seven Hoods, where she played a chorus girl. “I started out in the back line, and the next day I was in the centre line. By the third day, I was front and centre.” Basil even features in apromotional featurettefor the movie, chatting on set with Sinatra, Dean Martin and the gang. They were mostly gentlemen, she says. “Maybe Bing Crosby made a pass at me, but I don’t think I was so interested.” That seems to be another thing she was unfazed by: “I had directors making a pass at me, but it was never a pass that, if I was not reciprocal, I didn’t get the job.”By the late 60s the tide had turned again, and Basil was part of the counterculture. Her boyfriend at the time was the actor Dean Stockwell, which brought her into the orbit of Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda and artists such as Wallace Berman and Bruce Conner. Conner’s 1966 art filmBreakawayconsists of Basil dancing and singing the title song, which went on to become a sought-after northern soul track – Mickey was not her first rodeo.That’s how she came to be in Easy Rider, plus other counterculture classics such as the Monkees’ Head, Five Easy Pieces (with Nicholson), and Hopper’s infamously erratic The Last Movie. Hopper was usually the overbearing presence in this gang, it seems. His intensity filled the room, she says. “He either hated something or loved it, there was no in between, which was quite entertaining, but he could be mad as a hatter.”View image in fullscreenPerforming in the Monkees’ Head (1968).Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyAs for the drugs associated with this scene, Basil never really took to them. “Pot made me paranoid, to the point of passing [the joint] around and really not taking a toke out of it,” she says. “And at one point I was able to get some cocaine, which was pretty fabulous. I made a film in a week on cocaine! But it broke my skin out. So me with my vanity? Oh no!”By the time this scene fizzled out in the early 70s, Basil was already on to the next thing. Dance had moved on since go-go, so she asked a girlfriend: “Find me the best dancer and have him call me. I need some classes.” The best dancer turned out to be a kid called Lamont Peterson, who put her on to the straight Black club scene in south Los Angeles, and Don “Campbellock” Campbell, who was inventing a new style of dance that became known as “locking”. “It was the most spectacular dancing I had seen since James Brown,” says Basil. “He did a lot ​of arms,” she goes through the moves on camera: “wrist-roll, point, five, slap. There was something of communication; the dancer could have a conversation with the audience.” There were also athletic leaps, down on to the knees or into splits, even somersaults. This was an individual, club-based style but, drawing on her vaudevillian instincts, Basil formed a stage troupe with Campbell and four other dancers called The Lockers. This was still pre-hip-hop, in the mid-70s, but you can see it prefiguring later street dance styles – like body​ popping, “waacking” and breakdancing. The Lockers toured with everyone from Sinatra to Funkadelic. “We changed the face of dance,” she says. “We showed audiences that street dance was an art form.”View image in fullscreenBasil and Dennis Hopper attend the 1976 Cannes film festival.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty ImagesBasil was also building a career as a choreographer. Bowie invited her to London out of the blue in 1973 to choreograph his forthcoming Diamond Dogs tour. His vision for it was more like rock opera: complex moving sets, costume changes, theatre lighting, dance numbers. It was intense​; 13-hour days of rehearsals. “There was a lot of homework with Bowie.” She marvelled at his stamina. “David could do anything; as an actor, as a mover, he wasn’t a normal dancer – I mean, the guy didn’t even look normal, he just looked like this strange alien god. I always thought he should have been James Bond.”This is what connects all the most impressive people she’s worked with, says Basil: “Their work ethic is just obsessive: pre​-production, planning, rehearsals.” Turner was another. She approached Basil in the late 70s, when she was seeking to go solo. It was a vulnerable time for her, having effectively been in hiding since ending her infamously abusive marriage to Ike a few years earlier. After her high-energy moves with the Ikettes, Turner was after something more elegant, says Basil. But she certainly knew her stuff. In their first run-through Basil sat poised, ready to write down her feedback. “I watched the whole thing, and I realised I’d never put the pencil to the paper. It was just shocking to be in the same room with her, singing and dancing with the band. It was startling. And she does it all in high heels, and then, ​as soon as it’s over, she can hardly walk in the heels. But you’d never know it.” Basil worked with Turner right until her final 50th anniversary tour, in 2009. “She was an elegant queen, and yet she’s up in the girls’ dressing room, working on their weaves, fixing their hair.”Basil’s pre-MTV videos also caught the attention of David Byrne, of Talking Heads, who asked her to direct a promo for their songCrosseyed and Painless– which featured her street dancer friends and none of the band – then, a year later, their classicOnce in a Lifetime, for which she and Byrne researched films of people in trances and religious ecstasy to come up with his jerky, idiosyncratic dance style. “As a matter of fact, he was very hesitant about that,” she recalls. Before that, “I don’t think he really danced at all.”View image in fullscreenWith musician David Byrne, of Talking Heads, photographed in 1987.Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty ImagesBasil would go on to choreograph other acts, especially Midler, and films and TV shows, from American Graffiti to Sesame Street to Legally Blonde, right up to Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, for which she taught Margot Robbie and Leonardo DiCaprio their 60s moves. “She was the goddess of go-go,” Tarantino said of Basil, “She knows the era perfectly.” Perhaps better than he realised: Tarantino’s film harked back to the Manson family’s murder of Sharon Tate and her friends in 1969. “I knew Sharon and Roman [Polanski, her husband], we used to hang out,” she says. “I dated Jay Sebring!” Sebring, the celebrity hairstylist, was Tate’s friend and ex-partner, and was murdered alongside her that night. Basil dated him years before. “He and Gene Shacove were the two straight hairdressers in Hollywood. Straight hairdressers get laid as much as straight male dancers.”Basil never married but seemingly had quite a few celebrity liaisons over the years, not least with her collaborators. “I worked with them through it all.” She remains cryptic on the details. “I worked with Bowie through it all. I worked with Jerry Casale [of Devo, who contributed tracks to Basil’s Word of Mouth album] through it all. I worked with Byrne through it all. Our relationships have always remained, no matter what, creative.”View image in fullscreenStage troupe The Lockers in concert in 1973.Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty ImagesIs she saying these were purely creative relationships? “No.” She’s not minded to go into detail, though. “You’re the Guardian and I’m not talking about my sex life!” she says mockingly, then adds: “It’s extremely erotic when it’s creative and it’s sexual. Oh my God, there is nothing more spectacular. And if you deliver work that is also spectacular, you don’t mind losing the sex, but you don’t want to lose the creative connection.”Now she lives alone in “a wonderful house in Los Angeles” with her five cats and her dance studio next door. She still teaches students, judges street dance competitions globally and is regarded as a legend in the field. And she still hears Mickey echoing through the culture: in movies (most recently Die My Love), and in songs by the likes ofRun DMC(It’s Tricky), Gwen Stefani (Hollaback Girl), Taylor Swift (Shake It Off),Charlixcx (Speed Drive) and, most recently, Blackpink singer Rosé’s hit single with Bruno Mars,Apt. “It’s kind of an anthem now. Here in America, if you’re a little cheerleader, you’re dancing to it.”Her own taste of pop stardom might have been fleeting – follow-up singles to Mickey and a second album barely troubled the charts – but she doesn’t seem too bothered: “I never thought of it as anything but a time period. It was just a train ride. I was able to earn a living, I had fabulous, talented friends that were all doing something similar, but like Bowie, we all evolved.Dancestyles change, music changes, so if you keep up with the trend, you change.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleDanceDavid BowieBette MidlerElvis PresleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Arts in the UK are underfunded and overburdened with bureaucracy to gain what little money there is in a contracting industry. It’s heartening, then, to see a major new charity step into the breach.Veteran London-based violin dealersJ&A Bearehave supported students and professional players with loan-instruments for nearly five decades. Now they up the ante with a new Cultural Trust, founded to supply masterclasses, scholarships and practical support for string players. A biennial mini festival, featuring Beare’s instruments and their international players, launched last night at a sold-out Cadogan Hall, with a second concert at the Wigmore Hall this evening.Talk about a supergroup. The sheer weight of star-power marshalled here was dizzying: violinists Janine Jansen, Ning Feng and Alexander Sitkovetsky; French quartet Quatuor Ébène; violists Timothy Ridout and Amihai Grosz; cellists Kian Soltani and Daniel Blendulf. But an army of musical generals needs serious musical terrain to conquer, and they got it in Schubert’s monumental String Quintet in C major – the composer’s 1828 farewell to chamber music and to life – and Schoenberg’s rule-breaking, harmony-bending 1899 sextet Verklärte Nacht. The opening sextet from Strauss’s Capriccio was a buffer zone between.View image in fullscreenGallic elegance: Quatuor Ébène with(far right)Kian SoltaniPhotograph: Simon Weir/Simon Weir - Classical MediaThe Schubert saw the Ébènes joined by Soltani; where Mozart and Beethoven added an extra viola to their quintets, Schubert chose a cello. The effect is anchoring, spacious, rooting a musical glimpse of heaven absolutely in earth. And it was Soltani who provided this guide-rope, the ghostly violin’s insistently corporeal double in the famous adagio, a defiant life-force in the fanfares of the scherzo, holding us fast through the convulsive dance of the finale. If the quartet’s instinct was to skate with Gallic elegance on the surface of this vast work, Soltani’s was to dig in. The resulting conversation, sometimes debate, was compelling.Where Schubert teeters on the brink of life, Schoenberg stands at the edge of harmony itself, one foot suspended over the void. When Jansen recorded it in 2013, she and her hand-picked group leaned hard into that extremity, underlining the musical melodrama of a narrative that sees a woman confess to her lover that she is pregnant by another man. The Dutch violinist’s approach has since audibly softened, her own moonlit tone – glinting high and sweet through the ensemble, silver to viola Grosz’s bronze warmth – drawing out the strange, transformative mystery of this “Transfigured Night”. Collegiate intimacy was uppermost here, letting the supple score find its own shape without undue intervention. It takes a lot of skill to wrestle Schoenberg’s score into submission, still more to surrender so completely to it.Beare’s Chamber Music festival concludes tonightat Wigmore Hall, LondonExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tired of the fussy nature of console development, the pair would stake their claim on Apple’s App Store, which in 2010 was regarded as one of the most exciting frontiers in games. Mashing their names together to form a portmanteau, Flesser and Gardebäck became Simogo, and a consistently wonderful and forward-thinking games studios was born.Simogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years. Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.Thank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)And oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.Simogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s originon their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.Times have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.Simogo Legacy Collection is out now; £13.49Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Final call for morning mass. I took a seat at the back of the modern church, built when the Abbey of Saint Maurice and Saint Maurus relocated to this hill in Clervaux, north Luxembourg, in 1910. Then the monks swept in – and swept away 1,000 years. Sung in Latin, their Gregorian chants filled the nave: simple, calming, timeless. I’m not religious and didn’t understand a word, but also, in a way, understood it completely.Map of Luxembourg with castles marked and neighbouring countries shownAlthough mass is held here at 10am daily, year-round, the monks’ ethereal incantations seemed to perfectly suit the season. I left the church, picked up a waymarked hiking trail and walked deeper into the forest – and the mood remained. There was no one else around, no wind to dislodge the last, clinging beech leaves or sway the soaring spruce. A jay screeched, and plumes of hair ice feathered fallen logs. As in the church, all was stillness, a little magic.Clervaux Castle looked Disney cute, fairy lights dripping from its white-washed turretsI’d come to Luxembourg by train, with the notion of finding a frozen fairytale. This tiny grand duchy, about the size of Dorset, has a ridiculous number of castles – as many as 130 (depending on your definition). It’s the legacy of being sited at the heart of western Europe, suffering centuries of incursions. Some of these castles have been restored for visitors; some are places you can stay at (with lower rates off-season). Add in rimy forests, chanting monks and the factall public transport is free– maybe the most magical thing of all – and my hopes Luxembourg would make an atmospheric winter break were being fulfilled.My walk ended atClervaux Castle. It dates from the 12th century, but was destroyed during the second world war’s desperate Battle of the Bulge, which played out in these cold forests in December 1944. The castle has since been rebuilt and now houses the 1950s Unesco-listed photo exhibition The Family of Man. It was almost empty as I moved between the 503 images, taken by the most prestigious photographers of the age, depicting normal people in all life stages, the ordinary rendered extraordinary. There are no captions or locations; each photograph is its own whole story, containing multitudes. It was incredibly uplifting.View image in fullscreenClervaux Castle perched on a rocky promontory above the city, was destroyed during the Battle of the Bulge in the second world war and then rebuilt.Photograph: Pixelbiss/AlamyYou can’t spend the night at Clervaux Castle, but 10 minutes away by (free!) bus isChateau d’Urspelt, where you can stay. When I arrived, this castle looked Disney-cute, fairy lights dripping from its white-washed turrets. Eighty years ago, it was quite different. The US 1st Battalion 110th Infantry had its HQ here in December 1944, before being overwhelmed by German forces. After the war, Urspelt fell further into ruin, until 2005, when a local entrepreneur decided to restore it and turn it into a smart hotel. I skipped the snazzy spa, and the ice rink sparkling in the courtyard, but relished a fruity Luxembourgish pinot noir in the low-lit bar, which hides like a speakeasy in the castle’s historic cellars.One of the country’s most impressive castles isVianden(less than an hour from Clervaux via a free bus), a beast of a bastion, lording over the River Our, on the German border. It was constructed between the 11th and 14th centuries on Roman foundations, altered multiple times, left to rot, then, from the 1970s, painstakingly restored to its medieval pomp. On a pallid winter’s day, it was crowd-free. I rattled around its vast state rooms and marvelled at the layered history visible in the visitor centre, which is built around past excavations.It’s not just the castle that gives Vianden its fairytale feel. There’s the winding river, the tight-pressed wooded hills and the village itself, with its remnants of 13th-century walls and pretty, cobbled main street. I opted to escape reality entirely in the Ancien Cinéma cafe, a former movie theatre where you can grab a coffee, sit on a couch and watch whatever’s on the big screen, surrounded by film paraphernalia.View image in fullscreenThe Sherlock room at Château de Clémency.Photograph: Sarah BaxterMy final stop was a castle unlike any other.Chateau de Clémency, close to the Belgian border, is a five-room guesthouse and the 2025 winner of Luxembourg Tourism’s Best Host award. Dating back to 1635, it was only ever a small residential retreat, with no military function. When Pascal Zimmer – former judoka, self-taught tailor and architect, and restorer of historic buildings – bought it 20 years ago, it was a proper mess, in need of either demolition or renovation. He saw the property’s true value and he liked the staircase – “You could say I spent €400,000 on some stairs …” he confessed, pointing out the stone pleasingly worn by 400 years of footfall.“When you think about castles, you think of Windsor or Versailles. But this is a Luxembourgish castle, not so expansive, not so well done; you can’t restore it in the same way.”I travelled the length and breadth of Luxembourg by bus – and it didn’t cost me a pennyRead moreSo, to that end, Clémency is Pascal’s own artistic vision. Each room has a different theme, from belle époque “Peggy’s” to the “Roaring 20s”. “Tribute” pays homage to the local steel industry on which Luxembourg’s wealth is built. “My father was a miner,” Pascal said. “He was a humble guy; he’d say all he wanted was a small, clean room. This is a small, clean room.” A patchwork blanket covers the bed, while the bathroom is black polished concrete, a nod to life underground. I stayed in “Sherlock”, a Holmesian fantasy suite; the lounge was a steam-punkish curiosity shop of moody portraits, scientific implements and stuffed cats.There isn’t much to do in the town of Clémency itself, although that hardly mattered. It was only 40 minutes by public transport (did I mention: all free!) into Luxembourg City, a capital perched on a precipitous rock, like something from a storybook. It was a shorter hop to Bascharage, where I got cosy in D’Braustuff, a gemütlich brewery-brasserie serving Luxembourgish classics – I tucked into a heartywäinzoossiss(traditional sausage). But when darkness fell, I was also content to stay in my castle with a book – the shelves were full of Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle – and enjoy an alternative winter’s tale.The trip was provided byLuxembourgtourismboardandByway, which can arrange bespoke itineraries including Eurostar tickets, Interrail passes and accommodation.Château de Clémencyhas doubles from €99.Château d’Urspelthas doubles from €174Explore more on these topicsLuxembourg holidaysPublic transport tripsEurope holidaysShort breaksCultural tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And not just any baking, but baking for a crowd. So, with this in mind, here are two crowdpleasing recipes – a rich hazelnut “Nutcracker” creme brulee and a resplendent chocolate fondant bundt cake – with a few make-ahead and shortcut secrets to give you a head start.Chocolate fondant bundt cake (pictured top)Serve this rich, decadent dessert warm from the oven in the centre of the table, piled with ice-cream (and perhaps pouring cream, too – why not? It’sChristmas!). The batter can be made and kept in the fridge for up to 24 hours, then baked from chilled; add an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time if you do so, though.Prep5 minCook45 minServes8-10250g butter,plus extra for greasing6 large eggs150g caster sugar250g dark chocolate50g milk chocolate50g malt syrup100ml whole milk120g plain flour20g cocoa powder½ tsp fine sea saltIce-cream and/or pouring cream, to serveHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and generously butter a large bundt tin (or spray it with cooking spray). In a stand mixer (or with an electric whisk), beat the eggs and caster sugar on medium-high for five to seven minutes, until very pale, thick and tripled in volume.Meanwhile, melt the butter, both chocolates, malt syrup and milk in a heatproof bowl set over (but not touching) a pan of gently simmering water (or in short bursts in the microwave), then stir until smooth.With the mixer running on low, slowly pour the warm chocolate mixture into the whipped eggs, mixing it in until just combined.Sift the flour, cocoa powder and salt into a bowl, then gently fold into the batter until no streaks remain. Pour into the greased bundt tin and smooth out the top. Chill this until ready to bake, or bake immediately for 20 minutes, until the edges are just set and the centre still has a gentle wobble.Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then carefully turn out on to a platter and take to the table. Slice and serve warm with scoops of ice-cream and plenty of cream.Nutcracker hazelnut creme bruleeView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s hazelnut nutcracker creme brulee.Photograph: Rita Platts/The Guardian. Food styling: Hanna Miller. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Isobel Clarke.This luxurious custard can be made ahead of time. If you have a blowtorch, by all means, finish it off like a regular creme brulee, but I’ve devised a crunchy, nutty and sugary topping that can be made in advance and sprinkled on top of the set custards.Prep5 minCook1 hr, plus coolingChill3 hr+Makes690g whole roasthazelnuts, or hazelnut butter120ml whole milk360ml double cream90g light brown sugar3 large eggsA big pinch of saltFor the topping120gcaster sugar60groasthazelnutsHeat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1 and put six ramekins in a deep baking dish. If using whole hazelnuts, blend them with the milk (and a splash of the cream, if needed) until you have a smooth paste; if using hazelnut butter, simply whisk it into the milk.In a saucepan, combine the cream, milky hazelnut mixture and brown sugar and heat gently until steaming and the sugar has dissolved.Lightly whisk the eggs in a bowl, then slowly pour in the hot cream mixture, whisking continuously but gently (you don’t want to incorporate any air). Stir in the salt.Strain the custard into a jug, then divide it between the six ramekins. Fill the baking dish with hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, then bake for 30-40 minutes, until the custards are just set with a slight wobble in the centre. Remove, leave to cool to room temperature, then chill for at least three hours (or overnight).For the hazelnut caramel topping, line an oven tray with baking paper. Heat the caster sugar in a small pan until it melts and turns into a golden caramel, stir in the hazelnuts, then pour on to the tray and leave to cool completely. Once set and hardened, blitz into a fine crumb. Just before serving, sprinkle this generously over the chilled custards. Alternatively, for a classic brulee topping, sprinkle a thin, even layer of caster sugar over each custard and torch or grill until melted and caramelised. Leave for a minute or two to harden into a glassy crust, then serve.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.

Discs of pistachio meringue are baked until crisp, then layered with pistachio cream and cherry compote. The meringue softens a little under the cream as it sits, giving it a pleasingly chewy, cake-like texture. A very good option if you’re after a Christmas dessert without chocolate, alcohol or dried fruit.Pistachio and cherry meringue cakeThanks to the viralDubai chocolate bar, pistachio creme is quite easy to come by in most supermarkets these days; it’s already sweetened and brings a lovely, soft green colour. You could use pistachio butter if you prefer, though the colour will be a bit more muddied and you’ll need to sweeten it a little to taste.Prep5 minCook2 hr 20 minServes12-16150g pistachiokernels, plus 50g extra, chopped, to finish50g icing sugar1 tsp cornflourA pinch of salt165g egg whites155g caster sugarFor the cherry compote350g frozen cherriesJuice of ½lemon60g caster sugarFor the pistachio cream600ml whipping cream60g pistachio cremeHeat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½. Line three baking trays with greaseproof paper, then use a 18cm plate or cake tin to draw a circle outline on each. Turn the paper upside down, so the pen marks don’t touch the meringue.Pulse the pistachios, icing sugar, cornflour and salt in a food processor until mostly fine – some chunkier pieces of pistachio are fine.Whisk the egg whites on medium in a large bowl until foamy, then turn up the speed to medium-high and whisk to soft peaks. With the mixer still running, add the caster sugar a little at a time until the meringue is thick, stiff and glossy.Fold in the pistachio mix, being careful not to knock out too much air, then spoon into a large piping bag. Snip off about an inch from the tip.Starting from the outside of each pencil template, pipe a meringue disc on to each tray and carefully smooth the surface with a palette knife. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the meringues are lightly browned and feel firm to the touch; they should peel away from the paper fairly easily. Remove and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, put all the compote ingredients in a saucepan and heat gently until the cherries release some liquid. Bring to a boil and cook for five or six minutes, until the cherries soften . Spoon the cherries into a bowl, leaving the juices in the pan. Bring the juices to a boil, reduce by just over half, then pour over the cherries and leave to cool.Make the pistachio cream bywhipping the cream and pistachio creme in a bowl until just thickened and smooth.To assemble, trim the edges of each meringue disc with a small serrated knife, using the 18cm plate or cake tin as a guide. Place one disc on a serving plate and top with some whipped cream. Make a slight 10cm-12cm-wide dip in the middle and spoon in some of the cherries (this will stop the juices spilling out). Top with another meringue disc and repeat with more cream and cherries, reserving a few for the top.Place the final meringue disc on top and cover the top and sides with more cream, using a palette knife or bench scraper to smooth. Pat the chopped pistachios on to the sides.Put any remaining cream into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe on top, add the reserved cherries and chill until ready to serve.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe sweet spotCakeFoodFruitNuts and seedsChristmasBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

The reason is our old arch enemy, date labels, which can cause confusion and trick us into thinking that perfectly safe yoghurt is not OK to eat. That’s one reason many supermarkets have scrapped use-by dates on the likes of yoghurt, but they still use best-before dates. Remember, if a product doesn’t have a use-by date, always dothe sniff testbefore throwing it away.Today’s recipe is a light, gelatine-free version of panna cotta that’s instead set with agar agar (a type of seaweed), which gives it a soft-set texture. It’s refreshing, deliciously sour and simple to make. I use brown sugar for flavour and micronutrients, but regular sugar, honey and other sweeteners will all also work well.Waste not ‘panna cotta’This vegetarian pannacotta is made with yoghurt instead of cream for a lighter, less rich and more refreshing take on the traditional Italian pudding; it’s also a delectable way to use up excess yoghurt or its non-dairy equivalents. It goes beautifully with mytea-soaked prunes from last week, especially with a little of their syrup drizzled over the top; it also goes well with jam, and with any poached seasonal fruit or compote. I like the soft texture of the set yoghurt just as it is, but if you want to add some crunch, scatter a few toasted nuts on top; pine nuts, for instance, have a delicious, sophisticated flavour that goes very well with the prunes.Serves42½ tbsp agar agar flakes– I usedClearspring, but if you have a different brand, you may need to alter the amount according to the manufacturer’s instructions50g brown sugar, or honey or maple syrup1 tsp vanilla extract300g live yoghurt, or a non-dairy alternativeTo serveTea-soaked prunes, jam, shortbreadPour 200ml water into a small saucepan and sprinkle the agar agar flakes on top, so they float. Turn on the heat, bring to a boil without stirring, then turn down to a simmer and stir for five minutes, until the agar agar dissolves completely. Take off the heat, add the sugar and vanilla extract, and stir again until that, too, has dissolved. Stir in the yoghurt until well combined. The agar agar will begin setting almost immediately, so quickly divide the mix between four tumblers, bowls or ramekins, then put in the fridge to set for at least four hours.Serve straight from the containers, or loosen the sides by giving the tumblers a gentle shake, then turn out on to plates and enjoy plain or with tea-soaked prunes or jam and shortbread.Explore more on these topicsDessertWaste notFoodFood wasteItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
