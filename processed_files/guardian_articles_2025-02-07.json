Security experts have saidChinacould capitalise on the move.In an interview with the Guardian on a trip to Kyiv, Lammy said: “What I can say to American friends is it’s widely accepted that the decision by the UK with very little preparation to close down DfID, to suspend funding in the short term or give many global partners little heads up, was a big strategic mistake.“We have spent years unravelling that strategic mistake. Development remains a very important soft power tool. And in the absence of development … I would be very worried that China and others step into that gap.“We werehugely critical of the way that the last government handled the decision. So I would caution US friends to look closely at what went wrong in the United Kingdom as they navigate this decision.”US foreign aid graphOn Friday night a US judge ​said he ​would ​issue an orderblocking the Trump administration from taking some steps to dismantle USAid, adding that 2,200 employees from the agency would not immediately be placed on administrative leave.​ However, the ruling from district judge Carl Nichols in Washington is expected to be “limited” and temporary.Ukraine is reelingfrom the decision to pause all US foreign aid programmes immediately, with projects in the country from military veteran rehabilitation programmes to independent media and anti-corruption initiatives in effect stopped overnight.“We will do what we can to ameliorate those decisions but clearly the United Kingdom hasn’t got the resources available to the United States,” Lammy said. He added it was “not yet clear” to him whether Trump was planning to withdraw entirely from the development arena, or to absorb some of it back into the state department.Trump signed an executive order toauthorise aggressive economic sanctionsagainst the international criminal court on Thursday, accusing the body of “illegitimate and baseless actions” targeting the US and Israel, after itissued arrest warrantsfor Israeli ministers for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy (centre) in Kyiv, Ukraine. He refused to guarantee that Labour would hit its own 2.5% target this parliament.Photograph: Ben Dance/FCDOAfter meeting President Zelenskyy and senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, Lammy said there would be no imminent end to fighting despite the US administration promising to broker a swift end to the conflict, with talks beginning at the Munich security conference next week.“I am not sure we are weeks away from peace talks. And I say that because our assessment, which I’m quite sure the US shares, is that Putin shows absolutely no appetite for negotiation and to bring this war to an end,” he told the Guardian.“We are still very much in the depths of winter. The truth is the young men and women that make up the Ukrainian force are fighting for their country’s future on the ground, and that will go on for a number of months …skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I don’t anticipate a ceasefire in this war anytime soon. I’m very clear that Putin at the moment shows no desire to negotiate. And therefore, sadly, I think this war of attrition will go on for some months yet.”Keir Starmer, who has said the UK will “play a full part” in any future security guarantees, has not ruled out sending British troops intoUkraineto act as peacekeepers in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.But the foreign secretary said discussions with European and G7 allies over what type of guarantees might be necessary would “run for some months yet” and it was “premature” to anticipate what role the UK would play.“In navigating what those security guarantees are, they are always bespoke to the theatre that you were engaged in … it will have to be a set of guarantees that really work.”He pointed to an international monitoring mission along Ukraine’s 1,200km border with Russia that ended in 2022 after repeated breaches by Russian forces: “That cannot happen again.”Zelenskyy has called on European allies tourgently increase defence spendingto boost their own security, while the Trump administration has demanded Nato members spend 5% of GDP on defence.“As foreign secretary, I’m really clear that we have to increase defence spending,” Lammy said. “It’s important that we play our role and that means that we must increase defence spending.”However, he refused to guarantee that Labour would hit its own 2.5% target this parliament, saying only that the government would set out a pathway “in the next few months”, before the June spending review, and that he was aware that defence spending had to be weighed against domestic priorities.After promising in opposition to rebuild the UK as a reliable development partner, the Labour government announced fresh cuts to international aid in the autumn budget. It has also warned that the economic conditions required to return aid spending to 0.7% of GDP, up from 0.5%, were unlikely to be met before the next election.Explore more on these topicsUSAidAidChinaDavid LammyDonald TrumpUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

With an election looming, all parties are scrambling to portray themselves as patriotic and ready to defend the country’s sovereignty.In Quebec, where provincial sovereigntists have experienced a surge in popularity, the number of people calling for a referendum on the province’s secessionhas dropped. Between December and February, people in Quebec who said they were “very proud” or “proud” to be Canadian increased 13 points from 45% to 58%, according to anAngus Reid poll.In this Trump era of shakedown diplomacy, everything has a priceRead moreOn Friday, federal cabinet ministers sought to reassure attenders.“Our American friends understand that they need Canada for their economic security, they need Canada for their energy security and they need Canada for their national security,” the industry minister, François-Philippe Champagne, told AFP.The trade minister, Anita Anand, said there would be “no messing” with the border.“Canada is free.

She was reportedly found by a neighbour, who thought she had passed out,and called the emergency services.When police arrived they searched the property and discovered Andrew Searle dead inside. He was reportedly found hanging with a gag in his mouth. Police say no theories are being excluded for the motives of the apparent killings. Theories include a burglary gone wrong or a possible domestic dispute.The couple married in 2023 and had two children each from previous relationships. They had lived in the village for a decade.A forensic pathologist was flown in by helicopter to carry out an initial examination of the bodies. The results of autopsies were not expected before Monday.The public prosecutor Nicolas Rigot-Muller said on Friday: “Both died violent deaths, but I cannot establish that either was a homicide. All hypotheses remain open.”According to his LinkedIn profile, Andrew Searle retired in 2015 after a career in financial crime prevention.After quitting as a consultant in financial crime assurance at Barclays in Glasgow, Searle posted that he was “enjoying life in rural France – renovating!”. He previously worked for 21 years at Standard Life, in Edinburgh, where he was responsible for the bank’s anti-crime initiatives across Europe.Aclaim made by MailOnlinethat police were investigating the possibility that the couple were murdered by UK-based criminals has not been confirmed by the French authorities.Searle went to a grammar school in Steyning, West Sussex, and graduated from Liverpool John Moores University.A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

If the defender was clearly offside when meeting Bruno Fernandes’s spiralling free-kick from the left he certainly did not care as here was his own tale of FA Cup romance.Before the rush of Maguire’s intervention, Joshua Zirkzee’s 67th-minute equaliser appeared the lifeline United needed to keep a shakyFA Cupdefence alive.Van Nistelrooy incensed as Leicester exit to Maguire’s ‘offside time’ goalRead moreHaving bested Leicester 8-2 on aggregate in two previous meetings with their visitors, United were what they are constantly under Ruben Amorim: disjointed. Introducing the jet-heeled Alejandro Garnacho at the break transformed home fortunes as he was key in Zirkzee’s strike. But to dice with being eliminated by opponents with 12 points fewer and candidates for relegation cannot happen, as was the case after Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s first-half opener.But, cometh added time, cometh Maguire, whose intervention would have been scrubbed out if there had been a video assistant referee, and whether James Justin should have been penalised for handball for Fernandes’s free-kick is debatable too.A porous rearguard is one of the myriad problems that plagues United so when Patson Daka out-foxed Leny Yoro and Maguire and teed up Jordan Ayew early alarm bells clanged. The No 18’s effort was fierce and straight at André Onana and the home goalkeeper saved.Momentarily, United turned up the heat: a crossfield Diogo Dalot pass sent Patrick Dorgu sprinting upfield and United claimed a corner on the right. This was the flank Amorim fielded Dorgu on, rather than the expected left, the Dane’s debut offering a first sight of the head coach’s first recruit in action.View image in fullscreenA screengrab shows Harry Maguire (top) in an offside position before heading in a stoppage-time winner.Photograph: ITV SportAmorim explained: “If you see the history of Dorgu in the last team he played a lot on the right. Sometimes you need a left foot on the right side to connect in a different way.”The 20-year-old, signed in the winter window for £25m from Lecce, was a promising blend of pace, neat touches and potency off either boot, as with a right-foot effort aimed too high.Yet Dorgu’s opening period offering was United’s sole glimmer of brightness. Instead, the Premier League’s third-bottom side possessed the thrust, a De Cordova-Reid burst again turning the home team.Amorim either dropped to his haunches in despair or shook his head. Concern, too, coursed through the manager when, down Leicester’s left, Ayew flipped the ball to Luke Thomas and he aimed in a delivery Noussair Mazraoui headed for a corner. When Thomas hit this in from the right Mazraoui, again, repelled.Crumbs was the attacking fare served up by United. A Dorgu foray claimed a corner, Amad Diallo pinged it in, Mads Hermansen clutched the ball, dropped, those United players nearby got excited, then the keeper recovered.Now: joy for Ruud van Nistelrooy’s men and the too-familiar sense of despair for Amorim’s. First, Bilal El Khannouss knocked Manuel Ugarte off the ball. His cross, from the left, was stabbed goalwards by Wilfred Ndidi, Onana saved, but the keeper saw the ball go in off De Cordova-Reid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A strange decision from Amorim to remove his team’s sole flicker of hope? Certainly, unless this was about the player having taken a knock or having only 45 minutes in him as he moves up to speed with his colleagues.Garnacho instantly burned down the left and splayed Leicester: a fine start but he failed to find a teammate and once more a United attack petered out. Leicester had more fizz. Ugarte, enduring a poor display, could not stop the live-wire El Khannouss swerving around him and on the No 11 went, United just about stopping Daka prospering from the winger’s run.With the clock running down on the holders’ chances, Amorim removed Kobbie Mainoo for Zirkzee and within moments Ugarte sent in Garnacho. At close range he unloaded, the ball ricocheted off Wout Faes’s boot over Hermansen but Caleb Okoli smashed the ball against the bar and the keeper grabbed it.Soon, Garnacho’s zest created the leveller via a shoulder-drop and killer ball in: Rasmus Højlund’s shot was blocked and Zirkzee finished. Towards the end, Garnacho had a golden chance to set up either of the forwards but failed.Now, though, up stepped Maguire. He said: “A great finish to the game. The second half we played a lot better. The first half was nowhere near good enough. We probably deserved to go into half-time losing.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupManchester UnitedLeicester CityHarry Maguirematch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’m saying there’s a very strong level of reasonable doubt.”Shannon said there was “no scientific justification whatsoever” for the prosecution’s claim that there was “no doubt that these were poisonings”.She said the immunoassay tests used by scientists at Liverpool Clinical Laboratories were notoriously unreliable at detecting synthetic insulin as antibodies could cause interference.A second, more forensic, test should have been used to check the result. “I think the prosecution case missed a lot of the critical relevant science,” she said. “They presented just part of the story.”The two insulin charges are highly significant as they were presented as the strongest evidence of someone deliberately harming babies, as it was based on blood tests.Letby’s defence barrister Benjamin Myers KC told jurors he “cannot say what has happened” to the two babies and could not dispute the blood test results, as the samples had been disposed of.In a highly significant momentduring her evidence, Letby accepted the assertion that someone must have deliberately poisoned the babies, but that it was not her. Experts now working for her defence say she was not qualified to give such an opinion and that it should not have been regarded as a key admission.The trial judge, Mr Justice Goss KC, told jurors that if they were sure that the babies were harmed on the unit – which Letby appeared to accept – then they could use that belief to inform their decision on other charges against the former nurse.Jurors reached unanimous verdicts of guilty in respect of both insulin charges – the only offences on which they were all agreed – and returned their decisions days before reaching conclusions on the others.A CPS spokesperson said: “Two juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby. She has been convicted on 15 separate counts following two separate jury trials.“In May 2024, the court of appeal dismissed Letby’s leave to appeal on all grounds, rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.”Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyNursingChesterHospitalsChildrenEnglandCheshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The matters within are described by Hampshire as “not something he would ever discuss openly”.It has become part of proceedings relating to December’s decision by the immigration tribunal to uphold Yang’s exclusion from the UK – and whether the public can be told about the full contents of a document referred to in the tribunal’s final judgment.Yang has said previously that the allegations against him are “entirely unfounded” and he is seeking permission to appeal against the tribunal’s decision.Adam Wolanski KC, for the media, told a special one-day hearing that journalists should be allowed to see Hampshire’s witness statement and other documents referred to in the tribunal’s proceedings, on the principle of open justice.He said it was normal practice for cited documents to be disclosed to the media because the “public need to understand the issues, and also the evidence”, and that Hampshire “must have known” his witness statement could eventually come into the public domain.Jonathan Price, acting for Hampshire, said the royal fixer had originally thought “his evidence could be dealt with in private” but discovered he could not get a guarantee it would remain confidential. Having been “disabused of that” he “sought to ensure his evidence was not included in the case”.Price referred to a brief account by Hampshire of how the 34-paragraph witness statement came to be prepared in May 2024 and his subsequent efforts to keep it from the public view because of the “level of confidential detail” it contains.Hampshire, a former Scots guard and old friend of Andrew, described himself as a “senior adviser” to the royal in letters written to Yang in 2020. But on Friday he described himself as “secretary of the Quad-Centenary Club”, a society established to raise funds for London’s Royal Blackheath golf club, for which Andrew was chair.Inone of his letters to Yang, written in March 2020, Hampshire had heaped praise on the businessman for his loyalty to the prince after adisastrous interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlisthe year before. “You sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,” Hampshire said at the time.The witness statement was provided on the basis it would be sent to James Cleverly, the then home secretary, “to provide some context” to the correspondence, which had been obtained by police from Yang’s mobile phone, Hampshire said on Friday in his account.“I wrote what I did in the statement with such candour – including about my own confidential commercial interests but also about the private interests of third parties – in the expectation it was for the private attention of one of the most senior ministries of state on a grave matter,” he added.Yang’s lawyers then told him they wanted the document to form part of his immigration appeal. “I agreed, following assurances from Mr Yang’s legal team that they had every confidence their application to have the session heard in private would be successful,” Hampshire said.However, “when I was informed by Mr Yang’s legal team that they had been unsuccessful” Hampshire said he told them: “I did not wish to give evidence and did not want my witness statement to be used, or relied upon, in any part of the proceedings.”Though Yang’s legal team agreed not to refer it to in their case, the document remained part of the bundle, or legal papers, lodged with the tribunal – and Wolanski told Friday’s hearing that it was cited by the tribunal inits judgment last month.The tribunal noted that Cleverly “now has the benefit of Mr Hampshire’s witness statement” and that, after a review, the original decision to exclude Yang made by Cleverly’s predecessor, Suella Braverman, “has been maintained”.A second letter from Hampshire, dated October 2020, said Yang was authorised to act on behalf of an investment scheme inChinacalled the Eurasia fund which involved the prince. Further details about the operation of the fund and information “identifying individuals as potential associates” have been redacted from documents disclosed to the media so far. Those redactions are being challenged by the Guardian.Members of the immigration tribunal will rule at a later date on whether the documents sought can be disclosed and redactions lifted.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewChinaPress freedomNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new State plans are submitted and approved,” she wrote.Elon Musk’s journey from climate champion to backing EV-bashing TrumpRead moreBiondi added that until new guidance is issued, reimbursements of existing obligations for designing and building charging stations will be allowed in order to prevent the disruption of current financial commitments.According to an existingpageon the energy department’s website, the NEVI program provides funding to states to strategically deploy EV chargers. Funding is available for up to 80% of eligible project costs including the acquisition, installation and network connection of EV chargers, proper operation and maintenance of EV chargers, and long-term EV charger data sharing.Politicoreportsthat as of Thursday, the FHWA removed several website pages that provided information on the NEVI program.In a statement to Politico, Andrew Rogers, a former deputy FHWA administrator under theBiden administration, said that the memo “appears to ignore both the law and multiple restraining orders that have been issued by federal courts”.The outlet further reports Roger saying that the memo appears to be “in direct violation” of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a law thatrestrictspresidents from withholding congressionally approved funding.Currently, 14 states have at least one operational EV station,according toEV States Clearinghouse. As of last November, there are 126 public charging ports in operation across 31 NEVI stations in nine states, marking an 83% increase in open NEVI ports since last quarter,according toa NEVI report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its other packages are going up in price, too. The last time it pushed through a price increase in the UK was October 2023.“We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improveNetflix,” the company said, adding it would “continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members”.‘We have to reset’: Britain’s TV industry struggling in big-budget streaming eraRead moreThe company signalled a price rise was on the way last month when it announced increases in other countries, including the US and Canada. In the UK the price of a standard subscription with adverts has gone up by £1 to £5.99 a month. The most expensive “premium” tier is also up by £1 to £18.99.Netflix has also increased the cost of adding an extra member to a package by £1. For a standard subscription with adverts, the cost of adding another person is now £4.99. For a standard subscription without adverts, this fee is now £5.99. The new, higher rates apply to both new and existing customers.Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight, said the price increases were widely expected. “The streaming business is following mainstream TV in its price rises, and we should get accustomed to them,” he said.However, he added: “Netflix must tread extremely carefully … there is a ceiling, a point at which consumers will become incredibly frustrated by price hikes.”Netflix is not the only platform to raise its subscription costs as rivals Disney+, Spotify, and Paramount+ put their prices up last year. In 2023, Netflix cracked down onpassword sharing, which led to millions of new sign-ups over the following year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was gifted to the New England Conservatory in 2015 following the death of its most recent owner, a former student, Si-Hon Ma, with the understanding it would one day be sold to fund musical scholarships.The winning bid for the so-called Joachim-Ma Stradivarius was almost $5m short of the record $15.9m (then £9.8m) paid in 2011 for the Lady Blunt Stradivarius named for Lord Byron’s daughter, a boundaryit had been expected to test.The money will be used primarily to fund an endowment at the Boston musical college providing scholarships for aspiring young violinists. Andrea Kalyn, president of the conservatory, said the instrument had been a prized possession, and that a handful of students had enjoyed the privilege of playing it, but the school ultimately felt the time was right to sell.“Now we really have the chance to have it benefit so many more students, generations of students to come,” shetold the New York Times.“It’s really about what’s the most powerful use of the instrument.”The Conservatory graduate Geneva Lewis played the Largo from Bach’s Sonata No 3 on the Jochim-Ma violin to saleroom attendees before the auction, the newspaper said.Only about 600 instrumentscrafted by Italian violin maker Antonio Stradivari and his familyin the late 17th and early 18th centuries are believed to survive, mostly in the hands of collectors. Private sales have reached as high as $20m, some reports say.The Joachim-Ma violin was one of several once owned by the Hungarian virtuoso and composer, perhaps best known for performing the premier of Brahms’s violin concerto in 1879.Joshua Bell, the American violinist and musical director of London’s Academy of St Martin in the Fields,told NPRthat Stradivarius violins offer “sound colors” to their players.“It’s kind of the overtones and the way once you get to know the instrument, you can find these tonal varieties that are very difficult to find in a modern instrument,” said Bell, who has owned a Stradivarius for more than 20 years.“It’s not just for the name. It’s something very, very special that it does to the player.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Papers and IDs checked, they could take away what they had been allocated.Hugely overcomplicated, under-resourced and ultimately set up for failure, the GRM never functioned properly. Instead it allowed a hidden market to quickly emerge, sometimes at the very doors of the secure warehouses where deals would be done for bags of cement.All of which explains some of the enormous complexities facing the rebuilding of Gaza. It is not simply a physical problem, huge though that undertaking is. It is a political problem as well.The experience of past reconstruction in Gaza, and Israel’s veto on the process, as academics have noted, has been used as a vehicle for sustaining domination and ultimately conflict.View image in fullscreenA family who were displaced to the southern part of Gaza gather in the rubble of their ruined home in Jabaliya.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersA ban on building materials entering the Gaza Strip has been a feature of Israel’s blockade since it was put in place in 2007. Hundreds of items, from drilling equipment and epoxy to concrete moulds, asphalt and wiring, have been designated as dual-use items.This time the task, and Palestinian needs, will be almost immeasurably larger.In the first instance there is the question of rubble. According to an estimate from UN-Habitat and the UN Environment Programme, there were 50m tons of rubble and debris in Gaza in December, 17 times more than all the debris generated by other hostilities in the territory since 2008.The rubble, if collected in one place, would cover five square kilometres. UNEP estimates that disposing of it will take up to 20 years and cost $909m (£730m).After previous conflicts, Palestinians in Gaza relied heavily on recycling concrete rubble, processing it in sites in open areas, a bone of contention because Israel has said Hamas has taken advantage of recycled concrete for military purposes.View image in fullscreenA tent camp for displaced residents in Khan Younis. Up to 1 million Palestinians may need long-term shelter because their homes have been damaged or destroyed.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersHow long reconstruction may take is another issue. While some experts have suggested several decades, the reality is that it entirely depends on political conditions.After the second world war, German cities – with the benefit of the Marshall plan – were reconstructed in about a decade, although some rebuilding continued until the 1990s.With a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged – including schools and hospitals – and 66% of buildings sustaining at least some damage, the first issue will be to survey what is salvageable and identify the potentially 1 million people in need of long-term shelter and support.Setting aside Trump’s callsto permanently displace Palestinians from Gaza, one risk in reconstruction – experienced in London’s East End after the blitz – is the social damage that can be done in moving communities with close social networks.One successful UN innovation in Jordan’s refugee camps during the Syrian civil war was the deployment of mobile shelters, which residents were allowed to reposition to preserve communities and social structures.In many ways, however, housing may not be the most serious issue. Gaza’s water and sanitation system – on the brink of failure even before the onset of the war –has collapsed. It is estimated that up to 70% of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in north Gaza have sustained damage.In Gaza City, damage to those same facilities exceeds 90% includingto the desalination plantsin a coastal strip where residents rely on electric pumps to supply roof tanks and where the power system is also badly damaged.Beyond the physical infrastructure there is other, less obvious, damage. More than half of Gaza’s critical agricultural land has been degraded by conflict and 95% of cattle have been slaughtered along with nearly half the sheep.That suggests something like a Marshall plan will be required, although almost certainly without the involvement of the Trump administration, which has indicated that it will not pay andhas wound up USAid, its development agency.All of which raises multiple questions including how, with Hamas still a presence in Gaza, a mechanism can be found to allow large-scale rebuilding while holding off Israel and the Trump White House. Only that will bring the nightmare of Palestinians in Gaza to an end.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

We may not immediately know the answer, but we know it when we (don’t) see it. Monotone pitch, strangulated vowels or swivel-eyed certainty – these are the people telling us that difficult days lie ahead, or that only their party can deliver a better future. It would be nice if they seemed a bit more normal while they did it.The good news is, they can get better at it – just ask Keir Starmer. This week it was confirmed that the prime ministerworked with a vocal coach, Leonie Mellinger, for five years before entering Downing Street to soften his buttoned-up barrister’s monotone. Indeed, ina testimonialon her website, Starmer says Mellinger’s help “made all of this possible”. Quite the vote of confidence – some of us thought it was the voters.View image in fullscreenLeonie MellingerPhotograph: Dave Benett/Hoda Davaine/Getty Images for Women of the YearStarmer hasfaced questionsover the timing of one of his appointments with Mellinger during the Covid lockdown in December 2020, but there has also been some sniffiness that it happened at all. He needed to be taught how to speak?It is a critique that many high-profile people fear when they ask for this kind of help, saysAnthony Shuster, a speech and accent coach – he has signed plenty of NDAs as a result. “I think people want to preserve the mystique that they are effortlessly brilliant,” he says. “People like the idea that speaking well is a talent and it’s not: it’s a skill. And, like any skill, it can and should be practised if you want to get better.”Shuster points to Ed Miliband as one public speaker who has greatly improved with coaching. The younger Miliband used to make a mistake common to inexperienced speakers –Kemi Badenoch does this, too, Shuster says – of dropping eye contact back to their notes at the end of a phrase, before allowing their point to land. (He recommends underlining the final three words of key sentences as an aid.)View image in fullscreenAnthony ShusterPhotograph: Ruth CraferInstead,Miliband’s most recent party conference speechin September (thankfully spokenwith a teleprompter) “was really well delivered. He’s obviously had some support, but you can’t see the strings.” That’s important, too, he says – there’s nothing worse than when the coaching stands out a mile, as with Liz Truss’spork markets-related rictus, Jeremy Corbyn’s“strong message here”or Penny Mordaunt bringing the bombast to urge the Tories to “stand up and fight”.Louise Kerr, who like Shuster was previously an actor before foundingResonance Voice Training, says effective speaking is at heart “very physical and very muscular”. She says: “Once you’re speaking with muscularity, you get what we describe as gravitas. We get a fully voiced sound that can travel with ease.”For those who are really terrified of public speaking, the physical effects are obvious – breathlessness, a frozen state – but even politicians who have given hundreds of speeches can be physically constricted, she says. “There’s a tension in Keir Starmer when you watch him talk,” says Kerr; she contrasts withBarack Obama, who she says has “complete physical and vocal ease”.Her key tip? “Speak in short sentences and embrace the pause. It allows your message to land with your audience, it gives your voice the oxygen it needs, and allows your brain to find the next word.”Sylvia Cohen, a communications coach, agrees that breath is vital, and says the goal is to release tension in the body in order to access the full range of our voice – something young children do naturally, but adults often lose as they get older.She says: “There are three areas of the voice that we use naturally: the head voice, which is where we go for inspiration and humour; the heart voice, where we build rapport; and the lower register of the voice, where we go to create certainty and credibility.”With good coaching, she says, someone will be able to access all three areas authentically. “But what lots of politicians do is get training [that focuses] only on the outcome. They talk in the lower register of the voice, but it’s not really their voice.”Cohen suggests trying an exercise that involves planting one’s feet parallel on the ground, closing one’s eyes and balancing the head perfectly above the spine as if held by an imaginary thread. “You’ll feel that you’re rocking further forward on to your toes. You’ll notice the breath drop. If you speak in this new position, you’ll notice that the tone and pace of your voice have changed because you’re accessing more breath.“If you do that just as a first step, things will start to change.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerEd MilibandKemi BadenochLabourLinguisticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without question, there are “skeletons in every cupboard”, they said, as others expressed concerns that this could be the start of a wave of allegations putting the bank and its former chair in the spotlight.The attender was right to be worried. The Guardian was the first to detail allegations against De Rothschild, a former financial adviser to Queen Elizabeth II; since then other allegations have emerged – and some staff at the bank fear more will come to light.A world-famous bank, which prides itself on discretion for its monied clientele, is now facing the prospect of seeing its workplace culture being scrutinised in public.One attender at that crisis meeting suggested giving the predicament, and the way it intends to handle it, a code name. This was dismissed, in case the name itself was leaked to journalists and added grist to the media’s mill.Lawyers acting for Rothschild said this did not accurately reflect the conversations of the team handling this situation.The memo, which shocked many staff at the bank but came as little surprise to others, tried to suggest that there was only ever one allegation made about De Rothschild. This was one dated to 2003, which came shortly before his departure.“Some of you may be aware of an article that was published by the Guardian yesterday,” staff were told.“We are naturally appalled by any allegation of conduct that is so at odds with the culture we strive to foster within the group, even if it was several decades ago. No colleague should be subjected to inappropriate sexual behaviour.”Staff were told about this only afterthe Guardian revealedallegations of sexual misconduct related to De Rothschild that multiple sources said took place in the mid to late 1990s. That it followed a news report, rather than being proactively shared with staff, caused some disquiet.A search of internal records had found no allegations from the 1990s, the memo said.There was, however, a complaint from 2003 that the bank must have known about – but its lawyers failed to mention to the Guardian despite being asked about the existence of other complaints.“We discovered a single complaint of sexual misconduct in late 2003. This case was investigated immediately, dealt with appropriately, with full support for the colleague concerned, and led to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild leaving the group in March 2004,” the memo read.“We have found no record of any other complaint relating to Sir Evelyn. We do not tolerate and will never tolerate behaviour of this nature at the company. We work hard to create an environment in which all can thrive, and we encourage the highest standards of professionalism.”The memo did not go into detail on the 2003 incident. However, sources claim it involved De Rothschild exposing himself to a member of staff in his office. It is alleged he had suggested a sexual act to her and the woman ran out of the room, with her distress apparent to several witnesses.This incident bore similarities to some of the 1990s allegations first reported by this newspaper: they included claims the celebrated financier used his office within NM Rothschild, a stone’s throw from the Bank of England,to force himself upon women over several years.The 1990s claims include serious sexual assaults. One involved an alleged violent assault of a member of staff when she was a young woman working for him. Another allegation is that he put his hands down a different woman’s top and under her underwear to grope her. And a third woman claimed she was forced to perform a sex act on him while he sat on his desk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A scion of one of the most famous dynasties in global banking, he spent 44 years working within Rothschild family businesses.So powerful was the banking group and the figure of De Rothschild that sources told the Guardian that – even speaking anonymously – they felt safe to share their accounts only two years after his death.The Rothschild group, which combines an array of financial services including investment banking and wealth management, was at the heart of the UK’s privatisation wave in the 1980s and is among the most prominent investment banks.Its London arm, NM Rothschild & Sons, was founded in 1809 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, close to the Bank of England. Such was the sharp rise of its merchant banking activities that by 1826 it effectively saved the UK’s central bank with a loan of gold. Generations of the family’s successes are documented in objets d’art and display cabinets at its St Swithin’s Lane headquarters: the New Court Vitrine. Insiders describe it as a sort of shrine to the Rothschild dynasty.NM Rothschild & Sons later merged with another arm of thefamily’s European banking empire, Paris Orléans SA, and in 2011 the company rebranded from NM Rothschild & Sons to Rothschild & Co. In 2015, the parent company of the Rothschild Group, which was previously called Paris Orléans, also changed its name to Rothschild & Co, according to the Rothschild Archive.The allegations raise questions about how De Rothschild, a member of one of the world’s most famous and powerful families, a banker-adviser to Queen Elizabeth, and whose eulogy was delivered by former US president Bill Clinton, could have hidden so many claims from public view.Lawyers acting for Rothschild & Co said that the Guardian’s sources’ characterisation of the 2003 complaint was inaccurate and said they had not been aware of any other claims related to De Rothschild’s employment at the banking group.Explore more on these topicsRothschild & CoBankingFinancial sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite the indisputable offensiveness ofunearthed social media postsby Gascón, some are questioning the wisdom of ostracising her so comprehensively.Speaking to the Guardian, a number of senior film publicists raised concerns over whether those working on the film, both during its making and its marketing, had, in the words of one veteran PR, “chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her body”.“Those tweets were despicable,” they continued. “But everyone was on board for this amazing fairytale: an unknown becoming the first ever [out] trans actor up for an Oscar.” That magical narrative, said another, curdled into “the absolute worst case scenario”.Another veteran of the awards circuit said they had been particularly surprised by the coldness of theresponseof Emilia Pérez’s director, Jacques Audiard, who said of his maligned star: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to.”“I think he’s trying to protect the remaining nominations [Emilia Pérez has 13 in total] by distancing himself from Gascón,” said one insider. “But what’s really horrifying to me is that the most vulnerable person in the film, who previously was lauded and even fetishised, is now bearing the brunt of the ire and receiving no support.”If Netflix boss Ted Sarandos finds out this social media history was known, and not surfaced to him … watch this space.On Thursday, Garcón posted on Instagram to say that, following a tearful Spanish TV appearance over the weekend, she would be stepping away from the media to allow the film to speak for itself.This follows reports that Netflix was no longer including her in its campaign or covering any of her expenses for attending events. She has also been dropped by her Spanish publisher.Journalist Ryan Gilbey says that when he interviewed Gascónin October, the star’s garrulousness was widely acknowledged as central to her saleability, just as her personal journey – transitioning around a decade ago – was key to Audiard’s realisation of his drama about a Mexican cartel leader who transitions.“I think it makes it even more unsightly that the wrongdoer is someone who doesn’t know how to work the Hollywood machine politically, and has just kept digging a deeper hole for herself,” said Gilbey.“So now the denouncing of her has blurred into a vicious glee at this absolute rube who doesn’t know how to apologise properly or shut up – it’s like Jade Goody syndrome, and it’s the very quality that people found refreshing about Gascón when she was being unfiltered and tearful in interviews, or when accepting the best actress award at Cannes for herself and her co-stars.”View image in fullscreen‘I haven’t spoken to her’ … director Jacques Audiard and Karla Sofía Gascón at the Cannes film festival last year.Photograph: Sameer Al-Doumy/AFP/Getty ImagesSuch volatility, coupled with a lack of experience or apparent support, means “her next moves are quite hard to call”, cautioned one publicist. “Over the weekend, she was clearly freaking out, as anyone would.“She seems calmer at the moment, but what’s happened would be disastrous for anyone’s mental health. Representing someone who is quite naive on such a high-profile film should come with a duty of care, which I don’t think has been fulfilled.” The decision to instead cold-shoulder her “feels like a gamble”.Only one of the publicists the Guardian spoke to believed that the resurfacing of Gascón’s posts on X, and the traction they rapidly accrued, were the result of a hit campaign by a rival Oscar contender, as the actor herself suggested.A more common theory, as advanced by Variety executive editor Steven Gaydos, was that it was the work of an independent journalist “appalled by the tone and the content, [who] felt it was an important story. Old-fashioned shoe-leather journalism still wins the day.”Gaydos and everyone the Guardian spoke to expressed amazement that none of the teams working on the film had appeared to sufficiently vet Gascón’s past postings on X. “Social media searching and scrubbing will now be task one for any film or person in an awards race,” says Gaydos.“If Netflix boss Ted Sarandos, who’s spent millions campaigning for awards for the film, finds out this social media history was known, and not surfaced to him by anyone on his team … watch this space.”View image in fullscreenKarla Sofía Gascón (right) and Zoe Saldaña have both received Oscar nominations for Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/Netflix via APOne reason for such oversight may have been that Emilia Pérez’s path to Oscar nominations was not short of obstacles, with gay, trans and Mexican communities all criticising the film. Amid such firefighting, crucial details were apparently overlooked.It’s the Oscars on a knife-edge: who’ll win the award for hating Emilia Pérez the most? | Marina HydeRead moreAnother reason could be that the liberal-leaning Hollywood community assumed the views of a trans woman of Hispanic heritage would largely mirror their own. That they were wrong will have strengthened their kickback.This is what happens, says one PR, when Oscar voters participate in “their annual performative patronage of marginalised communities. The frenzy around awards means there’s very little inquiry or self-reflection until it’s too late.”A scapegoat is needed, who, if they don’t immediately roll over, can easily turn into a sacrificial lamb. “The frantic race we’re seeing to condemn her over and over again,” says Gilbey, “contains that strain of Hollywood self-righteousness, that rush to say: ‘Look! We caught one of our own doing bad! That means we’ve defeated racism and hate and Islamophobia. All good now?’”Ironically, it has meant that the industry is piling on to a member of an increasingly marginalised community. Inan interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundoon Tuesday, Antonio Banderas said Gascón deserved the benefit of the doubt, adding that he felt she had also been the victim of transphobia.‘I was deeply upset’: Karla Sofía Gascón to miss Spanish ‘Oscars’ as storm over racist tweets continuesRead more“I’m from Andalucía,” he said, “and in Andalucía, there’s forgiveness for every sin. If she’s asked for forgiveness, then she’ll get it from me. But, in any case, I think they’ve gone after her. There’s a lot of transphobia.”Gilbey, who is the author of It Used To be Witches, a history of queer cinema out later this year, agrees: “The sort of gloating, protracted attacks that she’s receiving now would be distasteful whomever it was happening to, but we shouldn’t pretend that everyone would get the same treatment in her situation or that marginalised people aren’t held to different standards.“I’d like to think anyone who made the sort of remarks that she has would receive the appropriate level of censure, but it’s no effort to think of straight cis men who have come back to awards and nominations and sellout tours after a year or two on the naughty step.”The Hollywood PR machine will be working overtime for the next three weeks, to try to spin something positive from this unhappy lapse. “It’s a new world,” says one publicist. “Social media means people behind the scenes have far less control than they used to.”The case of Karla Sofía Gascón will change the landscape – but only until the plates shift again. “Things have got really out of hand, and really ugly,” the publicist says.“And now Trump’s back in, ugly is exactly what you don’t want from the movies. TheOscarsare meant to be light and escapist. This is heavy. There are no real winners in a witch-hunt.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryOscarsEmilia PérezAwards and prizesSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

Why we can’t stand feeling boredIn one study, nearly half of participants left alone for 15 minutes with no stimulation chose to have an electric shockMadeleine AggelerFri 7 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.02 ESTSharePeople hate feeling bored. We hate it so much that we spend hoursmindlessly scrollingthrough our phones. Many of us would rather experience physical discomfort than sit quietly with our own thoughts, as a 2014 University of Virginiastudyfound. Nearly half of participants sitting alone in a room for 15 minutes, with no stimulation other than a button that would administer a mild electric shock, pressed the button.On the other hand, we also romanticize boredom. Philosopher Walter Benjamin once wrote in his book Illuminations: “Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience.” That is: boredom is a rich, loamy soil of creativity, and stepping back from the constant stimulus of everyday life allows the mind to expand.So which is it: a fertile, imaginative state or mind-numbing agony?The answer, according to experts, is both. Like life’s proverbial lemons, boredom is what you make of it.What is boredom?Leo Tolstoy’s description of ennui – as “the desire for desires” – is fairly apt, say experts.When you’re bored, you want to be engaged, but you don’t want anything that’s currently available to you, explains Dr James Danckert, professor of neuroscience at the University of Waterloo and author of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom.Boredom is often conflated with laziness or apathy, but they’re very different. Boredom is “much more of a motivational, restless, agitated state”, Danckert says.Dr Erin Westgate, an associate professor of social psychology at the University of Florida, suggests that there are two types of boredom with two different causes: meaningless boredom and attentional boredom.Meaningless boredom occurs when we feel like what we’re doing lacks meaning, Westgate says – for example, when a student says “math is boring” because they can’t understand how calculus relates to their life. Attentional boredom happens when “we can’t do something because it is too hard or too easy for us, so we can’t pay attention” – for example, when a student says “math is boring” because calculus is too advanced for them.Is boredombad?Boredom is a negative affective state, meaning it’s an unpleasant emotional experience, like anger or sadness.But like anger or sadness, boredom isn’t inherently good or bad. Westgate compares it to pain, like the twinge of a twisted ankle. “It doesn’t feel good,” she says. “It hurts. But it’s critical because it lets us know when something is broken and needs to be fixed.”What matters is how we respond to the emotion when it comes up. Does it prompt us into positive or negative action? Do we use boredom as motivation to do something creative or productive, or do we do something destructive – like self-administering a shock – in an attempt to escape it?Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’How we react to boredom has a lot to do with our mental state before we get bored, says Dr Yasmine Saad, a licensed clinical psychologist and founder of Madison Park Psychological Services in New York City.When a person is balanced and able to regulate their emotions, they can approach boredom with curiosity rather than aversion.On the other hand, when we keep ourselves busy and distracted all the time, we might perceive a sudden lack of stimulation as scary or overwhelming. Not only that, the thoughts and emotions that we were too busy and distracted to process during the day can flood into the mental space boredom creates.“All the negative [experiences] that had no place to go come to the mind,” Saad says.Are some people more prone to boredom than others?There is a popular truism – often trotted out by adults to scold aimless children – that only boring people get bored.This is not true, say boredom experts, many of whom are very interesting. Everyone experiences boredom; some just deal with it more quickly and efficiently than others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe people we tend to find boring are not those who are bored themselves, says Danckert: “They’re the people who don’t listen to us or engage with us. When you’re trying to have a conversation with them and it’s all about ‘me, me, me’ and not about you.”Some groups and personality types are more likely to experience boredom. Children are more likely to feel bored than adults, Westgate says, as are people with conditions that affect attention, like ADHD.Danckert says people who are boredom-prone also tend to struggle with a “failure to launch” – meaning initiating and maintaining action in pursuit of their goals – as well as neuroticism and a perceived lack of agency.Counterintuitively, some people are more prone to boredom because they don’t let themselves experience it, says Saad. “People who constantly need to be busy for self-esteem purposes, the moment they stop, they feel shame about the boredom,” says Saad.Are we more bored now?Boredom is not new. In the first century AD, the Roman philosopher Senecadescribedthe feeling as a kind of nausea.What is new is the ease of avoiding boredom thanks to digital means including smartphones, social media, video games and streaming services. “The constant stimulation makes it so we’re so much more busy, so much more stimulated, and less well-equipped to deal with boredom,” says Saad.Still, Danckert says, he isn’t sure that our boredom is worse now than at any other point in history. In some cases, he argues, turning to your phone to stave off boredom is “perfectly reasonable”. Being stuck behind 20 people at the DMV is not a particularly enriching experience, so why not play sudoku or text a friend?How do you deal with boredom?Calm down:Boredom is an agitated state. “When you’re restless, you don’t always make the best decisions,” says Danckert. When you feel bored, he says, the first thing to do is take a deep breath and try not to get flustered.Reframe the situation:If a project or exercise feels meaningless, find a way to inject meaning. “Think about why you’re doing what you’re doing,” says Westgate. She says research has shown that when high school students reflected on why math was important to them and how it related to their own goals – for example: “I need good math scores to get into my first-choice university” – they not only became more interested in their classwork, but went on to get better grades.You don’t need a smartphone: a practical, personal guide to downgrading your deviceRead moreAdjust the difficulty:If you’re experiencing attentional boredom, meaning a project is too easy or too difficult to hold your attention, find ways to make the task more or less difficult. Projects that are too difficult can be broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks, Westgate says. And tasks that are too easy can be gamified to inject more of a challenge – try to complete the task in a limited amount of time, for example, or give yourself rewards for completing certain activities.Make space for play:Boredom often results from “a lack of connection to yourself”, says Saad. If you don’t know what you enjoy or what interests you, how can you pull yourself out of boredom? Give yourself time and space to explore what activities engage and stimulate you. “The more playful you are, the less bored you will be,” Saad says.Just do something else:In some cases, there is no solution to boredom – you just need to do something else. “Recognize that you’re bored and instead of shoving that feeling away, figure out what it’s trying to tell you,” Westgate says. “That might be finding a new job or a new relationship.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been writing about toxic chemicals for years, and my friends always ask me: what do I do about it all? The list of things to worry about can seem overwhelming.I have waded through the science – as well as the marketing materials from companies that want to assure us their products are safe – with the goal of ridding my kitchen and the food I cook of dangerous chemicals.And I have some simple suggestions on how you can do it, too.Study finds microplastic contamination in 99% of seafood samplesRead moreIn collaboration with Consumer Reports, the leading independent consumer organization in the US, the Guardian has created a US-focused newsletter featuring my seven-week course on detoxing your kitchen.You can sign up here.It’s launching in just a few days, with guidance on everything from fruit and vegetables to meat, seafood and cookware. Until then, here are three fixes you can do right now.Spatulas and spoonsPlastic hangs out in the kitchen before, during and after every meal: coffee makers to start the day, sandwiches wrapped in baggies at lunch, spatulas used to prepare dinner, the containers in the fridge holding the midnight snack. It’s ubiquitous.It can alsocontainaround 16,000 chemicals, and thousands of those arethought to be“highly hazardous”. Chemicals and microplasticscan leachat higher rates when they are heated or come into contact with hot food and drink, making plastic even less ideal for kitchen use.Fortunately, for almost every plastic kitchen product, there is a safer wood, borosilicate glass, silicone or stainless steel alternative. These are easy to find, often cheap, and they can go a long way to reducing the amount of chemicals you’re exposed to in your diet.I think utensils are a good place to start when reconsidering your plastic use because the alternatives are cheap and widely available (though you’ll want to try to recycle, if possible, any plastic you decide to throw out). It’s also a meaningful place to begin because putting a plastic spatula on a hot pan, or tongs in boiling water, for example, can cause a small dose of chemicals to leach. Try thesewood,stainless steelorsiliconeoptions instead.Basic cookwareThere’s a lot to think about when buying pots and pans. Nonstick cookware can contain Pfas or other potentially dangerous chemicals, while some pieces of popular ceramics and enameled cast iron have been found to contain lead or other toxic heavy metals. There is a lot of marketing around pans that are “eco”, “green” and so on, but those are terms that don’t have a legal definition, so they could be meaningless.The best way to go about it is to rely on tried and true materials that we know are safe and abundantly available: stainless steel, cast iron and glass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s also made of one seamless steel piece instead of multiple components and materials that can contain heavy metals. (As of publication date it is not available, but I also recommendother productsby the same company.)MyMade-in carbon steel panalso seems to be free of toxins and functions similarly to non-enameled cast iron pans, which are another generally safe option. I also use a glass saucepan, though look out for older models that have been found to contain lead.For pasta and stews, I use an eight-quartHomiChef stock potmade with a high-quality stainless steel.CuttingboardsOver a decade ago, I replaced my plastic cutting board, which can shed microplastics into food, with one made of bamboo that I assumed was less toxic. But I later discovered that bamboo is often made of multiple wood pieces assembled with glue that containsformaldehyde, which cancauserashes, eye irritation and changes in lung function, and might be acarcinogen.Though bamboo boards produced with “safe” glue exist, they can also bemade withtoxic melamine-formaldehyde resins that are linked to kidney problems,endocrine disruptionand neurological issues. Bamboo products now often come with California government Proposition 65warnings, stating that the product may contain some chemicals known to cause cancer.When looking for a cutting board, try to find those made from a single piece of wood that has not been glued.Treeboardis among the few companies I found using a single piece of wood and safe finish.This piece incorporates and updates recommendations I madeback in 2022.

There are mobs on the street and far-right trolls on TV. There’s a billionaire making mischief and a state of uproar in Congress. Robert De Niro stars as ex-president George Mullen, whisked out of retirement to investigate a crippling cyberattack. Mullen is dogged and courageous, but he’s a man of the past, not quite on his mettle. His daughter thinks he’s out of touch. “The world has changed in ways he doesn’t understand,” says his wife.I’m excited to talk to De Niro about Zero Day and its real-world echoes. The show’s politics are what drew him to the project. The actor has made no secret of his disgust and loathing for Trump. But our Zoom interview comes with constraints. Netflix have requested that there be “no personal or political questions” and have dispatched a pair of publicists to serve as chaperones. Even ex-presidents and movie stars have to work within a wider system. Sometimes it gives them freedom. At other times, maybe not.De Niro beams in from his home in New York. He looks the very ideal of an 81-year-old man: trim and handsome, with platinum hair and professorial specs. There is a potted fern by his head and a barking dog at his feet. One good thing about making Zero Day was that it kept him close to his infant daughter Gia, the youngest of his seven children. At his age, he has learned to choose his roles more carefully. “I had another thing offered to me over in eastern Europe recently. It was a terrific script but I couldn’t make it work and one of the sticking points was the location.” New York shoots are the best, he says. “It’s important, it helps, especially with kids and so on.”View image in fullscreenFlight risk … De Niro (right) with Jesse Plemons in Zero Day.Photograph: NetflixEveryone will have their favourite De Niro performance, whether it’s silken Vito Corleone or toxic Jake LaMotta; the harried bounty hunter from Midnight Run or the traumatised Green Beret from The Deer Hunter. Naturally, the actor has his own favourites. Yesterday he was at a school fundraiser and the other parents – all much younger than him – were clamouring to discuss his role in Martin Scorsese’sTaxi Driver, which was nice and strange, because there is no way of predicting which films will last and which won’t.“I mean, we always liked that script,” he says. “We thought it was special. Marty and myself, and Paul Schrader who wrote it. But after that you never know. So there’s [Taxi Driver], obviously, but there are other ones, too.The Godfather II,Raging Bull,King of Comedy. Everything I did withMarty Scorsese. Roland Joffe’s The Mission. David O Russell, Barry Levinson.” He shrugs. “I’ve been lucky to work with these great directors.”Zero Day is no Taxi Driver, but it makes for a fine autumn flourish. Netflix’s thriller was devised by a pair of political journalists – the New York Times correspondent Michael S Schmidt and former NBC producer Noah Oppenheim – and depicts a United States that can be switched on and off like a light. Shadowy malware knocks out the air traffic control system and redirects trains on to the same stretch of track. The country panics, conspiracy theories abound and the crisis plays out over six precision-tooled episodes. It’s a big, glossy production with myriad subplots and an ensemble cast. But De Niro is the linchpin and brings the whole thing back to centre.He’s always thought of himself as a big-screen actor but knows TV has changed and figured this might be a good time to dive in. The average film shoot can feel like a sprint; this felt more akin to a marathon.“It’s like doing three features at once,” he says. “I likened it to being in the Channel between France and England and looking back. I can’t see France any more and I can’t see England. So I’ve got to keep swimming, staying up with the scenes, the endless information, the thrust of the story. Stay ahead of it, stay on it. So it was a whole other kind of experience for me.”His hero, George Mullen, is a one-term president who bowed out in the wake of a family bereavement. He’s imperfect but decent; an old-school public servant. “I had the idea of a president who was trusted, well-liked, and who told the truth as much as he could,” says De Niro. “He’s a person who tries to be straightforward. Who has no agenda other than to do the right thing.”I ask if Mullen is based on anyone in particular and he says that no, he’s really not; maybe Joe Biden very slightly. I say that he reminded me more ofJimmy Carter, a much respected commander-in-chief, and he accepts that there may be some truth in that.View image in fullscreenDesk job … De Niro as George Mullen with Joan Allen as Sheila Mullen in Zero Day.Photograph: Netflix“Well, Carter was a great president. He was a good person, a kind person, empathetic. No one really gave him credit until the end. But that was important to me, that he was a good person. I didn’t know this [at the time] but I watched interviews about him that say he was also a little standoffish, an outsider in certain ways, and that’s interesting to me, too.”One president whom Mullen emphatically doesn’t resemble is Donald Trump. De Niro despises Trump on an almost visceral level. He has been one of the man’s most outspoken public critics. He’s called him a pig and a punk and a con artist and a dog. He’s called him a jerk and a mutt, a real-estate hustler and a two-bit playboy. But today he’s saying nothing. He is courteous but seems wary. The publicists ping me a message suggesting I return my focus to the show.The best artists – the best actors – are hot-wired to their times. De Niro, arguably more than any other living actor, embodied the turbulent last decades of the American century. His golden years were entwined with Vietnam and Watergate, spiking crime rates and a borderline bankrupt New York City. So he’s familiar with political instability, with division and anger and a sense of chaos. But I get the impression that the situation under Trump (the tariffs, cuts and firings; the repurposing of the federal government) is different. More than that, I suspect he thinks it’s without precedent.“Well, I’d ask you that,” he shoots back. “Do you think it is?”“I think it is,” I tell him. “But I don’t have your reach of history.”“Yeah, you’re a lot younger than me.” He pauses. “But it is unprecedented. It is. It just is. As we all know.”Is he hopeful or despairing? “I’m not despairing, because I always look at the bright side and hope that things will right themselves and that people will appreciate goodness and empathy and will try to do the right thing. So I can’t help but think that.” Another pause. “Some people look at [things] differently. They have different values. That’s disturbing to me. I don’t understand it. But I just have to look at things in an optimistic way.”View image in fullscreenSecret service entrance … De Niro (centre) in Zero Day.Photograph: Jojo Whilden/NetflixDe Niro’s Zoom window is minimised and one of the publicists drops in. “Sorry to interrupt,” she says. “But can you just bring it back to show questions?”Michael S Schmidt – Zero Day’s co-creator – is still on staff at the New York Times. Last monthhe filed a storyabout the president’s threatened reprisals against his perceived enemies. Schmidt and his co-writer Glenn Thrush contacted more than two dozen of Trump’s most vehement public critics. Almost all, they said, now declined to speak up in case it made them a target.I mention this article to De Niro and make one last attempt. “I’m wondering,” I say, “if you’re now feeling you need to be more careful about what you say.”He has no time to answer. The publicist pitches in. “No, no, no. Sorry, Xan, I’m really sorry but we agreed this. Can we just go back to the show because we don’t have much time.” And that is the end of our Trump conversation – inasmuch as it ever became one at all.I’ve had car-crash interviews in the past and I’m unsure this quite qualifies as one. It’s too polite and well-managed; the tone is faintly apologetic. It’s not even clear who is in the driving seat here. Is it the actor’s decision not to discuss Trump with the press or does his contract have him muzzled? Either way it begs an obvious question. If De Niro – a world-famous two-time Oscar-winning millionaire – no longer feels he is able to speak out, one wonders who in the US does.In Zero Day, De Niro effectively plays the role of backstop, the US’s last line of defence. President Mullen’s Secret Service codename is Legend. Colleagues describe him as a knight in shining armour. He is old and exhausted, but his values are sound and he’s still up for a fight. We need heroes like that, says De Niro, both on TV and in films. “And in the real world, yeah, of course.”Zero Day is on Netflix from 20 February.The headline of this article was amended on 7 February 2025. De Niro’s character in Zero Day is a former US president, not a current one as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRobert De NiroMartin ScorsesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it’s just raised the stakes for its entire genreStuart HeritageFri 7 Feb 2025 12.05 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.06 ESTShareIt’s alarming to see just how quickly your sense of superiority can be undone. Just a few weeks ago, British viewers were quietly congratulating themselves on the high drama ofThe Traitors, a show where a group of inherently nice people are inconvenienced into polite little arguments. It was, we thought,the pinnacle of reality TV.But now that has been undone by three short words: Montoya, por favor.If you have been anywhere on the internet recently, you will have almost certainly seen a genuinely jaw-dropping clip from the Spanish reality show La Isla de las Tentaciones in which a contestant, confronted with live footage of his girlfriend having sex with another man, absolutely loses it.The clip lasts for just over two minutes, but contains more drama than the entire run of Love Island. Shot in the Dominican Republic, contestant José Carlos Montoya stands on a beach and watches as his girlfriend Anita kisses a hunky newcomer on TV. First, he blinks in disbelief. Then, as the newcomer strips to his underwear, Montoya starts to scream at the TV. They cut the lights and Montoya tugs at his swimming trunks in anguish. Night vision footage shows them pulling the covers over their heads, and Montoya falls to his knees screaming. And then Montoya has enough. As lightning streaks across the sky, he sprints the entire length of a beach, screaming and crying, while the show’s presenter begs for him to return. The music swells. We see Anita fully having sex with the other man. And, just as Montoya reaches the villa to confront them, the clip ends. There is drama, there is high drama, and then there isMontoya por favor.View image in fullscreenBreathtaking … Anita Williams cheats on partner José Carlos Montoya in La Isla de las Tentaciones.Photograph: XIt is breathtaking television, red-zoning with so much adrenalised torment that you can barely comprehend it. And yet this is apparently just another day on La Isla de las Tentaciones; an earlier clip shows Anita kissing another man, which prompts Montoya to a) tear off his shirt in anguish, b) kick the iPad he was watching the footage on and, c) scream into the surf while the host once again pleads, “Montoya, por favor!”Obviously La Isla de las Tentaciones is the Spanish version of Temptation Island, a 25-year-old format where couples go on holiday to see if they can withstand being seduced by sexy strangers. There have been eight seasons in the US, plus 32 international versions. The UK version aired in 2001 and was such a damp squib that it pretty much died on impact. This might be down to the national temperament. Had British people the sort of personalities that made them scream into the thundering sky, rather than passively squirm with disappointment when faced with a moment of emotional discomfort, then maybe it would still be on television here.Nevertheless, the point is this: in the year 2025, no human being goes into Temptation Island blind. José Carlos Montoya is 30 years old. Temptation Island has been a thing since he started school, and its whole point is how unethical it is. Even before the very first episode had aired,religious groups were expressing their outragein the hope that it would get pulled off air.View image in fullscreenThe ante has been upped … Anita Williams with someone not her boyfriend on La Isla de las Tentaciones.Photograph: XBoth Montoya and Anita must have known that they were going on a show that explicitly encouraged them to cheat on each other. Their expectation going into it must have been that one or both of them was going to cheat. In other words, Anita’s actions weren’t a surprise, and certainly not the sort of surprise that would cause you to run wailing down a beach like an injured horse.Nevertheless, the reaction to the Montoya por favor clip shows that ethics aren’t really an obstacle to popularity. The clip has already been memed to death, with sporting moments and Twilight clips already dubbed over with Montoya’s pained screams. It will almost certainly make Montoya himself a celebrity for life. Perhaps he can leverage this into actual fame, maybe with a series where he violently overreacts to hundreds of different situations. Or perhaps he’ll just be the guy from the meme for ever. Either way, this is how he’ll be defined until the end of time itself.As for all the other reality TV shows? This is a line in the sand. The ante has resolutely been upped now, and the old ways simply won’t cut it. We live in a post-Montoya por favor world. Everyone else, with all their normal human reactions, need to get with the programme.

A new book looks back on how it fell apart – and how it’s relevant todayGaby HinsliffFri 7 Feb 2025 12.14 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.50 ESTShareEmily Callaci is at home in Wisconsin, surrounded by the usual debris of family life. The bed behind her is unmade, she confesses, and there’s “a bunch of marbles and blocks on the floor” left by her sons, now seven and three. But on Zoom she has blurred her background so none of this is visible on screen, just as here, on the other side of the Atlantic, I’ve angled my laptop camera away from the mess on my kitchen worktop. We’ve both automatically hidden the domestic for the sake of looking professional, ironically given this interview is about making unseen, unpaid labour in the home visible.Callaci, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has written a book, Wages for Housework, which chronicles the radical1970s feminist campaignthat argued for recognition of the economic value of domestic labour. In truth, she explains, it was a recipe for revolution, designed to smash capitalism and its underpinning myth that women just love keeping house so much they’ll do it for nothing.The Guardian view on women’s unpaid labour: attitudes have shifted, but the burden hasn’t | EditorialRead moreWages for Housework’s founders argued that when an employer hires a worker, they get the value not only of that person’s labour but that of the person at home enabling them to work in the first place by looking after the children and chores. No housework, no capitalism: yet, somehow, the housewife (and back then it invariably was a housewife) gets none of the profit. “The idea was that if you show how much capitalism relies on that work and then actually demand that it be compensated, you see that the system doesn’t work as it says it works,” says Callaci. “It’s supposed to be the most efficient way to organise an economy, but what’s hidden is how much work is extracted and exploited for free. The point is to expose that and bring it crashing down by putting a price on that work.”In the book she profiles five of the movement’s stars: New Yorker Silvia Federici, a philosopher, who saw the nuclear family as a prison;Selma James, an American Marxist factory worker, who ran the movement’s British arm after her husband,CLR James, was expelled from the US under McCarthyism; Italian activist Mariarosa Dalla Costa; Wilmette Brown, a lesbian veteran of the Black power organisation the Black Panther party, who ranBlack Women for Wages for Housework; and Barbados-born Margaret Prescod, who argued that American prosperity relied on black women’s unpaid labour.View image in fullscreenSelma James at a protest.Photograph: Peter Marshall/AlamyFrom the start, there were differences of opinion about what exactly Wages for Housework meant.For Federici – whose 1975 manifesto coined the phrase “They say it is love, we call it unwaged work” – it wasn’t literally about getting paid but about the revolutionary struggle. (Though she conceded the money might help women with no other means of earning, she argued that many had other options – including not having children, as she herself didn’t.) And if it wasn’t really about wages, before long it was only loosely about housework, with the definition expanding to include voluntary work or political organising, rent strikes (because homes were workplaces), surviving poverty or racism, and what might now be called “emotional labour”: essentially, anything women felt obliged to do unpaid.It was when she had children, while working full-time, that Callaci began to take a professional interest in this dilemma. “I found myself working essentially 18-hour days, which seemed like a strange way to think about liberation. As feminists, I feel like we’ve gotten the message that the answer is to succeed at work, and of course I love my career. But that kind of exhaustion seemed to me not …” And we’re just discussing what exactly it’s not when, appropriately enough, she has to stop and take a phone call from her sons’ daycare centre. Anyway, she says, the well-meaning advice she received about time management for working mothers didn’t cut it. “I was hungry for more ambitious explanations about how we got here, why we live this way – even more than ideas about how we might do things differently.”More unexpectedly, she found Federici’s manifesto resonated as a set text with her young university students. “A lot of students that I teach are responding to a society that really emphasises production and consumption, and just seeing what that’s done to the planet,” she says. But this generation, for whom home ownership and financial security feels out of reach even if they work hard, are also, she thinks, prioritising time with family and friends. “They’re questioning that kind of grind culture that tells us we need to be seen to be working all the time to justify our existence.”Wages for Housework was, she says, similarly about clawing back time. Though James was more focused than Federici on putting cash in female pockets, she also favoured a 20-hour working week, and guaranteed income whether you were working or not – a forerunner of today’s campaign foruniversal basic income. Federici argued for government-funded daycare freeing mothers not to work but to do whatever they liked: making art, napping, seeing friends or having sex. (None of the five seems very interested in how any of this might be paid for, prompting some contemporary critics to see it as gimmicky, while others worried that linking wages to housework would trap women in the domestic sphere – though Federici saw making housework a paid job as a necessary prelude to quitting it.)View image in fullscreen‘Joyful militancy’ … Silvia Federici in 2018, advocated a search for happiness rather than productivity.Photograph: Cabalar/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockIt was this idea of what Federici calls “joyful militancy”, or seeking to be happy rather than productive, that attracted Callaci as an exhausted new mother. “At the moment when I felt I most needed things like leisure, like exercise, like seeing my friends. I just couldn’t because I had too much work. And part of me feels like why do we expect that mothers are cut off from all those things that make life worth living? Why should women have to apologise for that, why should we have to say: ‘I need help so I can do my other job more efficiently’?”She also liked the inclusivity of Wages for Housework, which recognised that for many working-class women, liberating careers were out of reach; they were doing low-paid, grinding work just to survive. The movement embraced sex workers, and “welfare mothers” protesting about being forced to take minimum-wage jobs, who argued that raising children was work enough. Initially it even tried to include men, arguing that this wasn’t a battle between the sexes but between workers and capitalism. James argued that men should also get wages for housework if they chose to do it; knowing they were no longer their family’s sole earner might give them confidence to stand up to their bosses without worrying about being sacked.This cut little ice however with the British trade union movement of the 1970s, while in Italy Dalla Costa encountered fierce male hostility inside a leftist movement where women were expected to be happy printing off copies of pamphlets written by men.The New York Wages for Housework committee, meanwhile, seemed to take a more confrontational approach. In her book Callaci quotes from its 1974 declaration, which she bought as a poster to hang at home: “The women of the world are serving notice! We want wages for every dirty toilet, every indecent assault, every painful childbirth, every cup of coffee and every smile. And if we don’t get what we want, we will simply refuse to work any longer!” What leaps out is the phrase “indecent assault”, as if that were just part of the 70s housewife’s lot, along with scrubbing toilets, and something for which she should be compensated. The second line of Federici’s manifesto – “They call it frigidity; we call it absenteeism” – certainly suggests she saw marital sex as work, and consent as uncomfortably linked to financial dependency.View image in fullscreenA Wages for Housework protest in Boston, 1977.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images“One of the arguments Federici makes is that we think we know what it means to be liberated sexually, but how can we really know what that means if we are not financially autonomous, if we’re dependent on the men we’re sleeping with?” says Callaci.”Perhaps the most radical thinker was Brown, who defined housework as anything involving repairing damage – environmental or more emotional – caused by capitalism. She opposed nuclear weapons on the grounds that they caused “nuclear housework” – such as having to look after people suffering from radiation sickness. When she was diagnosed with cancer, she described the endless medical appointments as “the housework of cancer”.To Callaci, this is “really capacious, imaginative politics”. But, if practically everything is housework, does the word still mean anything? What about things that take work, but which we enjoy or find deeply rewarding? Seeing everything that humans do as a product of economic exploitation leaves little room for love, maternal or otherwise.This is where she had misgivings. “For a while, my younger son wouldn’t fall asleep unless my hand was resting on his stomach, and I was like, ‘Is this work, or …?’ I understood that it was valuable; I guess I was glad I could do it even if it got very annoying sometimes. But did I want to call that work? I felt like I didn’t want to call everything in my life a commodity.” She notes that later in life, even Federici described caring for her ailing mother as a way of resisting capitalism, and not the exploitation her earlier writing might suggest.View image in fullscreenMargaret Prescod.Photograph: Al Seib/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesIf it could be contradictory at times, the movement had other tensions. Prescod and Brown have both since said they experienced racism within it, while Callaci’s research unearthed some Guardian reports of alleged bullying and supposedly cultish behaviour. Wages for Housework’s tendency to see everything through one lens could be irritating to other feminists (Federici even criticised US legislation banning sex discrimination at work, arguing that paid work was “liberation for nobody”). Eventually, after a series of personal fallings-out and tactical differences that may not surprise those familiar with revolutionary movements, the campaign splintered.Half a century on, care did become paid work, but only when outsourced to others by mothers going out to conventional jobs. Callaci and her partner both work full-time and pay for childcare, but she writes that they are uncomfortably aware that this “exploitative social arrangement” adds up only because skilled childcare workers earn less than professors. It bothers her deeply that care is so undervalued, whereas “if you find a way to make me look at my phone for an extra one second and pause and click on an ad, you can make a fortune”.Meanwhile the idea of getting paid to stay home has become a rightwing, rather than leftwing, cause – embraced by conservative politicians and “tradwife” influencers earning a living performing chores on Instagram.“JD Vance made this case for child tax benefit to ‘bring back traditional gender roles, so women can stay in the home and raise children’, and it just infuriates me,” sighs Callaci. “I get frustrated that the Democrats couldn’t find a way to seize on that message in a way that was more liberating and supportive of women. Why does the right get to seize that territory?” Though she believes Wages for Housework influenced feminist thinking, she admits to feeling sad that it got nowhere in practice.But researching it has, in some ways, changed her. “I feel much more confident in taking the time when I need it, like looking after my kid when he’s sick and not feeling guilty about doing that.” She is also, she thinks, more alert to invisible work everywhere, paid or unpaid: the unacknowledged cleaning, caring and collection of trash that makes the world go round. “It’s like you suddenly get X-ray glasses, orwhen you can see the electricity grid in a city and it’s like: ‘Oh that’s how everything works.’” After all, she says, we’re all products of such housework somehow. It’s just that some choose to see that, while others feel more comfortable if it’s blurred out.Wages for Housework by Emily Callaci (Penguin, £25) is published on 13 February.

In any Venn diagram denoting the commonality between the two, there would be very little in that overlapping section in the middle. Or, more precisely, there would perhaps be just the one word:Tropea.This restaurant in Harborne, named after a sunkissed Italian resort, has made a quiet name for itself over the past few years with its Salizà amaretto sours and provolone arancini to savour at sunset on a charming terrace. Yes, this particular sun terrace may overlook the traffic on the Lordswood Road, but hopefully some of the edges will be blurred after a round ofbombardinos.Inhis memoir, Richard E Grant writes about the human need to find “a pocketful of happiness” in every single day – a phrase that came to mind on entering Tropea late last month. Suddenly, I was out of all the coldness and gloom, and in a roomful of diners defiantly enjoying themselves with gossip, venison ragu tagliatelle and blackberry daiquiris. “We’ll stay for just a couple of plates,” I told Charles, hedging our collective bets.View image in fullscreen‘A delight’: Tropea’s tagliolini with black winter truffle.Tropea is not one of those high-street Italian restaurants with red velour chairs, spag bol and breaded mushrooms on the à la carte and a framed portrait ofRoberto Baggioin the loo. But then, neither is it one of those “fancy Italians”, where you get a squirrel’s portion of tagliolini in a pale sauce, in a pale room, while listening to Sade covers played on panpipes. Instead, Tropea is a forward-thinking take on the Italian trattoria.Chef Kasia Piątkowskatrained at University College Birmingham alongside her now business partner, Ben Robinson-Young, and together they have created a welcoming spot that leans heavily on arty, modern Birmingham, complete with a sleek, navy-blue frontage and, inside, bronzes, warm, sunset oranges and flattering soft lighting. Cool, but not overly cool. This is a restaurant where adventurous mums and dads can treat their student kids to a big £20 plate of gnocchi with gorgonzola dolce and confit red onion, or where mixed groups can catch up semi-noisily over grilled octopus and house red; there’s aubergine parmigiana, too, and tiramisu for dessert if you want something more recognisably “Britaly”.But Tropea is not in the least painfully “big fish small pond” cool. The staff are absurdly friendly, which helped turn our original order of some very good, crunchy cauliflower house pickles, an arancino and a small portion of tagliolini into a full-blown, three-hour lunch. Our plans changed swiftly after the large butternut squash and sage arancino appeared: it was a golden vision, laden with grated provolone and fixed to its spot by a puddle of cheesy butternut sauce. Crunchy, well seasoned, exquisite.View image in fullscreen‘A golden vision’: Tropea’s butternut squash arancino.A portion of rather thickly cut salt-aged beef carpaccio probably did not need the thick, mayo-style sauce ribboned across it, but it was devoured all the same. We were back on firmer footing with the house-made pasta. Tropea does not go wild in its choice of pasta – there were only four on offer, and two of those were gnocchi and fregola – but quality, not quantity, is what’s important here. The fresh, al dente tagliolini with local black winter truffle was a delight, and came in a meaningful parmesan sauce. Soft, hand-rolled pillows of gnocchi in gorgonzola avoided being one-note by the addition of sweet red onions and a scattering of hazelnuts. Piątkowska and her team run a very good kitchen with a delightful menu, and Harborne is very lucky to have them.From the pasta, we trundled on, admittedly with a few gaps in service, to a whole roast partridge, out of its pear tree and in a red-wine sauce, served on parmesan polenta with buttery chanterelles. The hero dish of lunch, however, was three bronzed, slightly caramelised slabs of delica pumpkin with whipped ricotta, which wasexactlyhow pumpkin ought to be celebrated. It felt wrong to send any of it back to the kitchen, so I took the last piece home in a box and chopped it over salad for an evening snack.View image in fullscreenTropea’s cannoli are ‘obscenely decadent’.The overall mood that lunchtime was a little sedate, but I’m told more cocktails are drunk and the disco music is turned up of an evening. If that isn’t your thing, try lunch – and do try the tiramisu while you’re about it, too, because it is a wonderful, generous, boozy lump, and easily enough for two.And please do not be a fool and skimp on the homemade cannoli. Oh, I know what those are, you’ll think – they’re so often a disappointment. But here they are whopping great, crisp, deep-fried tubes stuffed with cream, salted caramel and chocolate sauce, and they are obscenely decadent.

That means telling them about itEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 7 Feb 2025 09.30 ESTShareSix months ago I lost my partner. We were lovers for22 years. You are the first personI have told about this.Our relationship was secret, because of his complex family situation. I totally loved everything about him, and I dreamed of a time when we could be openly together.I’m absolutely lost now. I don’t think that I’m suicidal, but I feel that nothing matters any more.I’ve tried to help at a charity that is connected to his work (we are both retired medical professionals), but I feel utterly worthless. Most days I stay in my flat avoiding people. We had several friends and colleagues in common, but, of course, I can’t talk to any of them.It’s so painful to see photos of him in my phone and to see the presents he gave me. I have had counselling in the past following my young son’s death, but this feels more traumatic, because there are no family or friends to share this with.How can I go on existing?What an enormous amount of grief. I’m so sorry. To even begin to deal with such huge emotions you need to be able to process them, and to be able to process them you need to start talking about them. I’m glad you’ve come to me. I hope this is the start of you being able to bring details of your partner, and your relationship, more into the open with selected others.I went to BACP- and UKCP- registered psychotherapist, and grief specialist, Mandy Gosling.We felt the first thing that needed looking at was the “magical other” of your partner. To properly grieve for people they need to be seen as what they were – as humans. The reality is (and this may make you furious, but in a way: good) your partner hid you from his other family for two decades, now leaving you in a state where you can’t share this. Gosling and I thought the relationship, as you tell it, had a “childlike nature to it, based almost in non-reality and not in an adult ego state. It’s interesting you are trying to be close to him by volunteering, almost a childlike fantasy, almost like ‘smelling’ him.”There is disfranchised grief here. The inability to mourn publicly or to look at photos shows that mourning hasn’t happenedThe process of grieving may start with looking at your childhood attachments – or lack of them – and why this is so painful, beyond the obvious. Who made you feel safe as a child? Have you ever learned how to do this for yourself as an adult?There is also the enormous loss of your son (and you didn’t say when this happened, so it may also be recently, hence particularly raw) which has compounded this grief. “There is,” explained Gosling, “disfranchised grief here, the inability to mourn publicly, the inability to look at photos shows that mourning hasn’t happened, there is a stuck-ness to this.”We’d like you to do more than simply exist. How you do this is by talking to others. It doesn’t have to be friends, although I do strongly recommend in time you let them in and tell them the truth. You don’t have to tell everyone, nor do you have to tell them everything, but you don’t have to protect your partner any more, only yourself. And friends can help you process this, they may even know more about it than you realise. Keeping this to yourself is making it very corrosive to you. You can also seek out a grief counsellor (cruse.org.uk).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s about finding ways to let the emotions surface and balance with restoration.” At the moment you are squashing them, and they won’t go away by themselves.Processing grief takes time, it doesn’t mean letting him go. “You don’t feel this pain,” explains Gosling, “unless you have loved.” Awful though it feels now, that is something to be grateful for.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ieEvery week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

The team don’t deserve this’Jamie Jacksonat Old TraffordFri 7 Feb 2025 18.34 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 19.00 ESTShareA furious Ruud van Nistelrooy said Leicester were not defeated “in ­Fergie time” but “in offside time” after Harry Maguire’s 93rd-minute winner for Manchester United was ruled legal andeliminated his side from the FA Cup. With no video assistant referee in the competition until the next round, Maguire’s winner was not chalked off despite the assistant referee being perfectly in line to see he had infringed.“We are not defeated in Fergie time, we are defeated in offside time,” said Van Nistelrooy, referring to the extra minutes opponents claimed were allocated to United when needed under Sir Alex ­Ferguson, the Dutchman’s manager at Old ­Trafford. “It is a hard one to take because the game was decided on a mistake, that is clear. It is not a matter of VAR, where you have to look at ­millimetres. It is half a metre, it is clear. The team didn’t deserve to lose the game in this way. They fought, played well, and dominated the game for a long bit.”Van Nistelrooy was asked if VAR should be used from the third round onwards when possible. “Let me think about that question,” he said.Van Nistelrooy was curt when asked if being knocked out was a blow. “That is not a question for me,” he said. “We want to die on the pitch today, to get to the next round, to be the best we can be, to be competitive, we are representing ourselves on the pitch at Old Trafford.”Ruben Amorim was visibly disappointed at United’s poor performance. “We had to believe until the end but this game has nothing to do with the time of Fergie,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Saturday night, 10 years on, the pair of them will be as close but if Atlético score at the Santiago Bernabéu don’t expect the same embrace. Not even if the kid scores it, and he might. If he does, it would mean everything: “Atlético,” he says, “is the team of my life.”His name is Giuliano and he was 12 then. He is 22 now and these days heplaysfor Atlético, still flying up the wing, looking like his lungs might explode. He has become the embodiment of Atlético’s identity during a season in which they are fighting for everything. He is also an academy product and Simeone’s son, however much the manager tries to avoid that fact.Nico González cannot replace Rodri but will help Manchester City fill the void | Will UnwinRead moreGiuliano joined Atlético at 16, having spent his early teenage years with River Plate in Argentina, moving into the family home in La Finca, west of the city, but father and son no longer live together since he returned from a loan spell at Alavés. He and his father sit apart when they go to see Gianluca Simeone, Diego’s son and Giuliano’s brother, play for fourth-tier Rayo Majadahonda. And it has been fun to watch Simeone Sr not celebrate when his son scores and go wild when anyone else does, not least because it is happening increasingly often.But if Simeone once said he could never sign a son of his and is concerned about being accused of favouritism, aware of the risk of dressing room divisions, he need not worry any more. Not just because Giuliano is an academy product rather than a signing, as discreet as his dad, as fiercely competitive as him too, but because when he starts Saturday night’s derby on the right side of midfield it will be for all the right reasons. “I don’t see a son; I see a footballer,” Atlético’s coach insists, and so does everyone else. A very good one too.A ballboy almost a decade ago, Simeone is making his first derby appearance as a player. Like Kylian Mbappé, he sat it outwhen these two great rivals teams metat the Metropolitano in the autumn, a late Ángel Correa goal securing a draw. Now, both will start at the Bernabéu, any doubts there might have been before gone now. After a difficult start, Mbappé has scored 21 times in 33 games. He has nine in his past nine league matches, and two in his past three in the Champions League. Simeone has scored three and set up two more in his past three, decisive in all three competitions.If Mbappé’s recovery was always likely, if Real Madrid coming into this derby top of the table was just logic imposed again, the same was not true of Simeone. This is a decisive derby: Real Madrid and Atlético are separated by a single point, while Barcelona are only three behind that. That owes much to Barcelona’s collapse, a title that seemed as if it was in their hands afterOctober’sclásicoslipping away with three consecutive home defeats, andMbappé becoming Mbappéagain. It also owes much to the ballboy who started this season as a sub, the decision to loan him out again only reversed late in the summer, and is now irreplaceable.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé has hit form recently for Real Madrid.Photograph: Nacho Doce/ReutersAtlético were Spain’s big spenders in the summer, Julián Álvarez and Alex Sørloth arriving for more than €100m between them. They were joined by Robin Le Normand andConor Gallagher. That brought excitement but it needed time. It also meant few opportunities for Simeone Jr. In the opening 11 league games of the season, he played 0, 0, 0, 6, 14, 5, 65, 0, 0, 33 and 20 minutes, starting only once. He didn’t start either of their first three games in the Champions League, two of which they lost. At the end of week 11, Atlético were 10 points behind Barcelona, four behind Real Madrid and trailed Villarreal, having won only five times.The solution, it turned out, was at home. Simeone started the following week and the revival began. It has not all been about Giuliano of course. Rodrigo de Paul looks like the Argentina player, not the man who had the fans whistling him. Álvarez has been outstanding, scorer of 16 goals. Antoine Griezmann has 15. And Sørloth is on 11, mostly from the bench,his contribution key.More importantly, the coach has found a structure; he has also found a collective idea, a commitment, getting his players to truly buy into his idea that they will all play a part – something he says “isn’t difficult; it’s almost impossible”. Atlético have strength and variety in depth, the team that most use their subs and that get the most from them: a third of their goals have come from the bench.Simeone Jr symbolises that, something in his energy, his intensity, which transforms the entire team, in his dad’s words. Beaten only once in the 19 games he has started, they went on a run of 15 successive wins in all competitions. The run ended at Leganés, knocking them back off the top of the table, and a draw with Villarreal followed, but he was then decisive against Salzburg, Mallorca and Getafe, taking Atlético into the top eight of the Champions League, the semi-final of the Copa del Rey and to within a point of Madrid at the top of the table.Asked how they arrive at this derby this week, his dad replied, “by bus”, and then started laughing like Muttley,very pleased with his joke. The real answer is: in very good shape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are though without Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão, David Alaba and Antonio Rüdiger; there will be at least one midfielder in the back four, probably two. There is also, the coach concedes, the old question about balance, a defence exposed; but then there’shatforward line. “I could take off one, two, three, four attackers and press more,” Ancelotti said. “But if I do that, I don’t score 60 goals. It’s simple.”“They have great individuals,” Simeone insisted –four times. “We have to take the game to a place where we can hurt them.”And so it is set, Ancelotti against Simeone again. Against two of them this time, just like 2015. He comes with back-up, fathers and sons entering the fray: Davide Ancelotti, Carlo’s assistant coach, will be there too. This is the 26th meeting between two coaches so classic they bring their kids with them now. No current managers have met as often nor been so well matched: they have won nine each, and it’s a battle every time, they know.“These are the games you like being at,” Madrid’s manager said. “There’s high pressure, yes, but everyone is going to watch it, it’s a great spectacle, there are great players on the pitch, it will be very competitive. It’s spectacular and you’re in the middle of it. As a coach you’re in the most uncomfortable place in the ground but you suffer, you fight with your team. You have to enjoy it before. And hopefully celebrate it after.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridAtlético MadridLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Different coaches, five million different fans and the 80,000 people in the stadium will all have different views, different affiliations and different opinions about who should be playing for England. It plays a large part of every Test week and it’s fantastic because it creates debate, it gets people talking.It is not specific to England either but the problem with Steve Borthwick’s recent team selections is that I just wish it felt like it was coming from a place of understanding exactly what his best team is and precisely how to deliver their best gameplan. I’m not sure we have clarity on either of those things yet and as much as I understand the notion of horses for courses, I would much prefer to have a sense that selection is first and foremost about yourselves rather than the opposition.‘Sorry, good game’: why English rugby attitudes still infuriate FranceRead moreIn Dublin last weekend, Borthwick picked both Currys in the back row and as effective as it was for the first 50 minutes, as much as it was on task, the way that we out-enthused the opposition, displayed more energy, it was a selection based on negating what the opposition was going to do. This week, it’s a similar story. The back row has changed with Tom Willis coming in to add more weight. I just wish the selections that England make are primarily about themselves first rather than reacting to what the opposition may or may not do and the threats that they have.This England team should always be competitive because we have a lot of depth, but I don’t know what the clarity is in terms of what their best team is and we’ve had a lot of games to at least answer that question. In the case of France, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and even New Zealand, even though they’ve had a period of transition of late, you can pick their best team. They can tweak things but the foundation is there and I’m not sure England have that yet but the best teams in any sport know what their best side is when everyone is fit.I think England are about 80% of the way there but in key positions, and fly-half is without doubt one of those, there is uncertainty. Is Marcus Smith considered the best fly-half to take England forward? He was their best player in the autumn and I understand the temptation to move him to full‑back given France kicking longer than anyone else, but again it is the result of thinking about what the opposition is going to do. From full-back we’re going to expect Marcus to counterattack from deep because he is electric one-on-one but that completely changes England’s attacking philosophy from week one to week two.How does this England side want to set up tactically? I believe I have a fairly good idea. Borthwick has said of late that he wants to be a ball-movement side and I agree to a certain extent but until we get clarity in certain areas we will be a team who reacts to the opponent first and foremost.View image in fullscreenTom Willis being added to the back row is the latest reactive decision made by England.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe knock-on effect is being seen in England’slast-quarter collapses. Borthwick is evidently a good coach, coming up with a gameplan for each match and England are starting positively, on the front foot as a result. They have scored the first try in their last four matches but they are tailing off because their opponents are growing into games and working out ways to counter England’s plan. In response, England haven’t really had an answer because they can’t really deviate or adapt.Quick GuideEngland v France: the teamsShowAllianz Stadium, 4.45pm GMT, Saturday 8 FebruaryEnglandM Smith; Freeman, Lawrence, Slade, Sleightholme; F Smith, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Stuart, Itoje (capt), Martin, T Curry, Earl, Willis.Replacements: George, Baxter, Heyes, Chessum, Cunningham-South, B Curry, Randall, Daly.FranceRamos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio, Roumat, Meafou, Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.Replacements: Marchand, Baille, Colombe, Auradou, Guillard, Jegou, Le Garrec, Gailleton.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England have got such a wealth of personnel and analysts as well as access to so much live data and the players couldn’t be better prepared for what is coming but there is a trend because all of the defeats in this unwanted run have been by a margin of nine points or fewer.

I don’t really buy the excuse that England were lacking experience because last weekend was Simon Easterby’s first match in charge of Ireland and his proactive changes swung the game in his side’s favour. They certainly weren’t panicking in the dressing room at half-time but history shows that Borthwick has a habit of being reactive with his replacements because only once, in all his games in charge of England, has he made a tactical change before the opposition. I understand that there is a reluctance to change a winning formula but there has to be a realisation that the opposition will always respond and that England have to be proactive in order to stay on the front foot. You cannot sit and wait for things to happen.Having said all that, ultimately it was individual errors that costEngland against Ireland. They missed crucial one-on-one tackles and that proved fatal. In this defensive system, they are robust through the middle – one poor misread by Chandler Cunningham-South aside – but that leaves the No 9 and No 10 defending in the wide channels and ultimately that turned out to be a problem in Dublin. Perhaps it was inevitable given how much time Ireland spent in England’s red zone but if they can tighten up n that area they can be competitive on Saturday.We’ve seen that England have not been getting blown away in recent defeats and I don’t expect that they will be against a phenomenal French side. But they have to find a way to adapt in the final quarter if they are to achieve the win they so desperately need.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Steve BorthwickFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

The championship run started with theChiefs beating the Eagles two years agoin Super Bowl LVII.As much as Philadelphia’s size advantages on the offensive and defensive lines and the addition of game-breaking running back Saquon Barkley make them look like the better overall team heading into the rematch, the mere fact that the Chiefs have Mahomes and the Eagles don’t is why you’d sooner trust a cat to babysit a goldfish than bet against Mahomes. “If it’s a one-score game, I’m takingPatrick Mahomesany time because he’s just got that championship DNA,” Tom Brady said earlier this season.Consider that source for a moment: Brady, by consensus the greatest quarterback of all time, won a record seven championships while playing for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Two of those came at Mahomes’s expense – in the 2018 season, when Brady’s Patriotsbeat the Chiefs in the AFC championshipin Mahomes’s first year as the Chiefs’ starting quarterback; and two years later, when the Bucs beat the Chiefs on home soil in the Super Bowl itself. Each time, Mahomes gave Kansas City a fighting chance just by having the ball in hands. It’s only Brady’s good luck that he caught him early in his career.Sunday will mark Mahomes’s fifthSuper Bowlappearance. He’s already won the game three times and been voted the most valuable player in each victory. What’s more, he hasn’t even turned 30. Between those trophies and his staggering overall win totals and passing statistics, Mahomes would probably make it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame if he retired on Monday. A third straight championship – something Brady never achieved – would make it a moot point.In the early stages of his career, Brady was the underdog, the “puny” (to league talent evaluators anyway) late-round draft choice who was thrust into duty after a freak injury to New England’s starter Drew Bledsoe and kept on rising to meet the moment. His dink-and-dunk pocket passing style conformed to the geometry of the game. He had a great partner to weather the ebbs and flows in Bill Belichick, the mastermind coach who guided his every step (until their breakup following the 2019 season, after 20 years together).Mahomes? He’sthe villain lurking inside the fortress, ready to knock his challengers back to square one. He’s slippery, spiky and can fire a ball just about every way imaginable. Where Brady had to contend with Peyton Manning for years, Mahomes holds back one of the best generation of quarterbacks the game has seen. The Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson, a two-time league MVP, has only beaten Mahomes once. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen,this year’s NFL MVP, fell to Kansas City in last month’s AFC championship, marking the third time in four seasons that Mahomes has topped him in the playoffs.Philadelphia’s Jalen Hurts played the game of his life when the Eagles faced the Chiefs in the Super Bowl two years ago only to wind up losing after Mahomes drained all the time off the clock. (“He made the plays when they mattered most,” Hurts said after the game. “That’s what the great ones do.”) The only top-level quarterback to hold a head-to-head edge over Mahomesis Joe Burrow, most notably in a victory in the 2022 AFC championship game – but that boast only goes so far when you play for the bungling Cincinnati Bengals.In the days leading up to games Mahomes goes through a metamorphosis – from mild-mannered father of three to ruthless “creature” with “a look in his eye that normal people don’t have,” Chiefs’ offensive coordinator, Matt Nagy,recently told the Athletic. That crunch-time creature brings out the sweat like Michael Jordan trailing in the fourth quarter or Novak Djokovic with his back against the wall in a five-setter: you know it’s a matter of time before he pulls the rabbit out of the hat. But the truly impressive thing about Mahomes is how much he has evolved as a threat. In his early seasons in Kansas City, he piled up the passing yards while chucking deep balls to star receivers Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, and otherwise dazzling defenses with no-look throws and tosses with his weaker left hand.But with Hill long gone to the Miami Dolphins and Kelce past his peak, Mahomes has becomelessof a showman in the pocket, dinking and dunking defenses into a lull before catching them by surprise and taking off running.One drive in this season’s AFC championship game exemplified the new version of Mahomes. With the Chiefs trailing the Bills 22-21 in the fourth quarter, he threw a short pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster that went for 29 yards, ran the ball in for a 10-yard score and then found Justin Watson for a two-point conversion – flipping a one-point deficit into a seven-point advantage in less than five minutes. That’s Mahomes: he doesn’t beat you with huge plays any more. He kills with a thousand cuts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course, there are some who believe he gets help. This season opened with Kansas City beating Baltimore after a review of the winning touchdown confirmed that a Ravens receiver’s toe was out of bounds – a lucky break for Mahomes. Rival fans accuse game officials oftreating him with kid gloves, even when he might exploit the very rules that were designed to protect him. They say he’s too big to fail because he has Taylor Swift and nowDonald Trump on sideand history within his grasp.Typically, it takes years before a superlative talent steps into their greatness. But Mahomes has been great from the off. With a third straight Super Bowl title in possession, Mahomes wouldn’t just go down as sport’s ultimate final boss.

Even the arrival of the Hundred in its first iteration – bringing an extra £1.3m per county per year – barely made a dent in some cases, the additional income swallowed up by rising costs, inflation, and the servicing of longstanding, significant debts.But over the past 10 days the outlook in the shires has changed considerably (perhaps even to the point of said club eyeing the quilted variety). At the time of writing, the England and Wales Cricket Board has raised around £400m byselling 49% stakesin six of the Hundred’s eight teams. Investors for the remaining two, Trent Rockets and Southern Brave, are expected to follow next week.Cricket’s going bananas: nothing is real at Hundred auction but it still costs £145m | Jonathan LiewRead moreIt means the combined valuation of the eight teams is now tracking towards £1bn and, whether that milestone is breached or not, the upshot will be profound. Under the terms of the sale – a sale that sees grassroots initiatives promised around 10% of the proceeds – even the 11 counties without a team in the Hundred stand to gain somewhere between £20m and £27m each.Richard Gould, chief executive of theECB, said last December this money is intended to recapitalise the county game and sustain it for the next “20-25 years”. If it achieves that, county supporters may have reason for quiet optimism – and perhaps even forgive Gould and the ECB chair, Richard Thompson, for their damascene conversions, the pair having previously led the opposition to the Hundred at Surrey.In turn the very fabric ofEnglish cricket has been alteredin an unprecedented and irreversible way. After last year’s landmark sale of Hampshire to India’s GMR Group – the starting pistol,if you will – private money will now pour into the county game at large in exchange for high summer, the use of eight premier grounds and the pick of the players, and in hope of a return on the investment.While a non-host county like Worcestershire, for example, can now pay off its debts, enjoy the interest generated by the remainder, and plot a move to dry land in time, the eight host venues will have to negotiate new power dynamics.Yorkshire sold the Northern Superchargersoutright but, as one corporate lawyer working on the sale told me, even the clubs who retained 51% may discover that their minority partner is the one calling the shots.View image in fullscreenManchester Originals have been paired with the Lucknow Super Giants of the IPL via the Hundred auction.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAUndeterred by warnings of “Ponzi scheme” from Lalit Modi, architect of the Indian Premier League 17 years ago, teams such as Mumbai Indians (Oval Invincibles), Lucknow Supergiants (Manchester Originals) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (Northern Superchargers) have alsoexpanded their global networks. It is here that English cricket has increased the chances of the world’s best players moving to year-round franchise retainers, hastening international cricket’s predicted retreat.There are questions that follow. Will the new investors be comfortable with a four-week window or will elbows begin to push outwards in time? Given a number of their portfolios have a heavy leaning towards men’s cricket, are they as enthused by the women’s teams they now own? Will revenues match the ECB’s projections? And will this influx of cash be invested well by the game or simply swallowed up by player wages and the ever-growing coaching class?As for the Hundred itself, new kits and team names feel inevitable looking at IPL-driven leagues like the SA20. But there is a growing school of thought – one said to be shared by a number of the investors – that in time it will become Twenty20. Some believe this to be a side issue at best but a switch back is one this particular observer feels is as inevitable as it is necessary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By the same token, this recalibrated, decimalised version of short-form cricket has felt out of sync with the wider world, both on a performance level – past reviews into the England team have stressed the need for domestic cricket to mirror the international game – and as a divide between old fans and new.The Hundred’s name may have to change – the ECB slightly painted themselves into a corner here – but ultimately, if played as T20, it will surely become more recognisable and palatable for its current detractors. Perhaps in time this will help win over enough to foster the “tribalism” that the ECB’s Vikram Banerjee once admitted, without a shred of irony, the tournament currently lacks.One of cricket’s strengths over the past 150 years has been its adaptability but having settled on six-ball overs in the late 1970s, the move to 100-ball cricket has felt a stretch; a stretch reflected by the lack of pick-up overseas and at club level. The flow of T20 through to 50-over cricket through to four-day and Test cricket ultimately works and there is nothing to stop the big screen and the TV graphics still displaying balls remaining and runs required.Although maintaining that flow through to the longer formats will only be relevant if the world game strives to maintain balance and the counties use their windfall wisely. The switch from counting loo rolls to feeling flush is only the start.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredECBCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

They have denied wrongdoing.Nico González cannot replace Rodri but will help Manchester City fill the void | Will UnwinRead moreCity have written to the league asking for arbitration over a new system of APT rules agreed by clubs before Christmas. The changes had been made in response to previous arbitration brought by City, which found aspects of the APT rules to be unlawful.In a letter sent to clubs on Thursday the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, confirmed the arbitration request. “On 20 January, 2025, Manchester City FC began a further arbitration to challenge the APT rules,” he wrote. “As you will see, the new challenge relates to the amendments to the APT rules that clubs approved at the 22 November 2024 shareholders’ meeting. Manchester City FC seeks a declaration that the amendments approved by clubs in November (and therefore the current APT rules in force) are unlawful and void.“The Premier League remains strongly of the view that the amendments passed in November were lawful and the APT rules comply with all competition law requirements. We consider that the new arbitration must be resolved as soon as possible and, to that end, have agreed that the same tribunal should be appointed to hear the new case. The parties are currently corresponding in relation to further directions.“The APT rules remain in full force and effect and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system.”City, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest voted against the new rules in November and Chelsea abstained. City had written to clubs before the vote arguing that the process was too hasty and Villa warned in a letter of more legal action from City.“It is now abundantly clear that any vote (if passed) will result in immediate further litigation by Manchester City FC and an associated defence by the EPL (English Premier League), incurring material further costs and unnecessary distraction and devotion of time to this issue,” the Villa letter said.City and the Premier League have been approached for comment.Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola denied City invested £172m on four players in the winter window to mitigate against a potential transfer embargo if found guilty of the charges levelled against them by the league.City historically sign very few players in the winter window but recruited Nico González, Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis. Guardiola was asked whether this was because of potential punishments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the last five years, we are the last team in the top six for net spend.“Even after what we have spent in this transfer window, we are away from Chelsea, [Manchester] United, Arsenal, Tottenham. Even from Liverpool. The only reason why is because we sold a lot in the last seasons but even with that I know this club, it is always ‘just about the money’.“In one month I think there will be a verdict and a sentence and after we will see my opinion of what happened so far. Still, at the end, every club can do whatever they want. Because in the last 10 years we are third [for net spend], but in the last five even with what we won we are behind the top six teams, so I’m sorry for the comments and that is why I don’t agree.”González, a midfielder, was bought because of the serious knee injury sustained by Rodri that is thought to be season-ending. Yet City have selected Rodri in their Champions League squad for the rest of the campaign. Guardiola was asked what chance the 28-year-old has of playing this term.“The rule is we can just add three players,” he said. “Vitor we cannot do it as he was the youngest [inexperienced] one. I would have loved to add all four to the Champions League [squad]. I would love to arrive in the latter stages of the Champions League and Rodri could help us but in my mind Rodri is for next season. Maybe he comes back earlier – that would be good for us.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPremier LeagueFinancesBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Fortunes have diverged since but Orient welcome City to east London on Saturday in upbeat mood and at something of a crossroads.After seven and a half years of steady upward progress since Travis’s consortium took over a club in ruins after relegation to the National League, the chairman has been soliciting fresh investment. A new stadium nearby is being considered and talk has been afoot of aping their former lower division London rivals and “doing a Brentford”. The manager, Richie Wellens, has spoken of “not being ‘little Leyton Orient’ any more”.“I think Brentford’s the inspiration for a lot of football clubs, as are Brighton,” says Travis. “Mark Devlin [Orient’s chief executive, formerly at Brentford] thinks we were in a better position when he came on board than Brentford were when they were inLeague Oneso it’s possible. It’s probably unlikely, but every year except one here we’ve made progress. The biggest issue is the stadium’s not big enough.”Brisbane Road holds 9,271 and with gates averaging 7,628 this term – their highest since the old Second Division days of the 1970s – and a growing local population the case for a move, preferably within their home borough, Waltham Forest, is strong. Three potential sites have been identified.View image in fullscreenThe crowd at the FA Cup quarter-final meeting of Clapton Orient and Manchester City in March 1926. City won 6-1.Photograph: Kirby/Getty ImagesLeague One is a tougher environment, though, than it was 11 years ago, when the Bees began their rise by pipping Russell Slade’s Orient to automatic promotion. The money splurged by American owners at Birmingham – “at least four times our budget” – and Wrexham has raised the cost of competing. Orient, too, are largely US-funded; the 75-year-old Travis is an east Londoner and lifelong fan but is Boston-based and his business, as chair of the Baskin‑Robbins ice cream brand, is in the US. Half the board are American.Travis says Orient’s budget has been revised upwards three times this season as they push for a playoff place, so the estimated £300,000 boost promised by Saturday’s match against a club who have spent £172m on transfers in the past month is a tonic. Wellens, having managed the team to theLeague Two title in 2023, has his team sixth, an unbeaten league run of nine wins and two draws brought to a halt last Saturday by Stockport.That run was kickstarted, or rather head-started, by the on-loan Tottenham goalkeeper Josh Keeley. Orient were heading for a second‑round Cup exit at home to the National League side Oldham until the ninth and final minute of injury time. The O’s won a free‑kick, which the Ireland under‑21 international Keeley met with awell-directed glancing headerto equalise. Wellens’ side won the tie in extra time with another last-gasp goal, from the live‑wire forward Dan Agyei.Keeley says he would “100%” go up for a late set piece should Orient be level or a goal behind late on against City. But other than a bicycle kick in a lockdown kickaround with friends, the Oldham goal is the only one he can recall scoring since he took up the gloves aged 12. Progress has been swift since, as he prospered. at St Patrick’s Athletic, where he was coached by Patrick Jennings, son of another goalscoring former keeper, the Tottenham legend Pat, before his move to Spurs in 2022. Jennings Sr is a regular face at Spurs and he and Keeley have struck up a rapport. “He’s at the club a lot. I’ve even played golf with him,” says Keeley.View image in fullscreenRichie Wellens has led Leyton Orient to sixth in League One after managing the east London side to the League Two title in 2023.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe goalkeeper was Orient’s hero again in round three, saving in the shootout against Derby to set up Zech Obiero’s winning kick. It was the second shootout win of Orient’s Cup campaign, Keeley having also saved a penalty in the first round at non-league Boreham Wood. Every match in Orient’s run has gone the distance – they have played moreFA Cupminutes this season than any other side in the fourth round.Taking the Premier League champions to 120 minutes will be a much more exacting task. For all their recent frailties Pep Guardiola’s side tend to make short work of lower-league opposition, as a half‑strength City showed incuffing aside an in-form Salford 8-0last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is an elite football club so it’s going to be really difficult for us whoever they pick.”Whatever the result the tie can, at least, serve as a celebration of progress made. The club have been galvanised in a rollercoaster decade that has featured their near-destruction under thechaotic three-year ownershipof the Italian waste management magnate Francesco Becchetti, Travis’srescue in 2017, promotion back to the Football League in 2019 under Justin Edinburgh, whotragically died suddenly five weeksafter that triumph, and the progress under Wellens of the past three years.Wellens too deserves his moment in the spotlight. His past as a Manchester United youth player, and lifelong fan – “Pep’s caused me a lot of pain in the past but he’s a genius, a pioneer,” he says – adds spice for a manager who has forged a reputation as a progressive tactician. Injuries have taken their toll recently amid a crowded schedule, depriving Orient of the attacking talents of Agyei, Ollie O’Neill and the commanding defensive presence of Omar Beckles, though they recruited well in January. Still standing though are the classy Northern Ireland midfielder/full-back Ethan Galbraith (another Old Trafford academy graduate, and subject of a rejected £750,000 bid from Swansea on deadline day) and Keeley’s fellow Spurs loanee Jamie Donley, who has sparkled in the No 10 role.It all constitutes a big shop window for team and club, and a prize for fans.“When I think back when we were playing teams in the National League,” Travis says, “I never dreamed we’d be playing Manchester City at home so this is a reward for everyone that’s followed us through the years.”Explore more on these topicsLeyton OrientFA CupManchester CityLeague OnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kerr denies the charges.Making his closing argument, Bill Emlyn Jones for the prosecution said that despite the words of former teammates – who flocked to court on Friday and described Kerr as a “truly special human” – she had still called Lovell “fucking stupid and white”.“It might make it surprising, it might make it sad, but it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen,” Emlyn Jones said.He said Kerr’s claims about what had happened in the taxi did not make “one blind bit of difference to what this case is about” and said she was “drunk and angry” and “lashing out in a rage” that night.Kerr said Lovell had doubted her claim of being “held hostage” by a taxi driver.View image in fullscreenSam Kerr arrives at Kingston-Upon-Thames crown court.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesEmlyn Jones said he would not suggest that Kerr is a “card-carrying racist” but asked the jury to consider a “hypothetic question”.“What if PC Lovell had been a black man? What if she had called him fucking stupid and black,” he said. “It’s not really a fair question is it? Calling a white man white is not as loaded as calling a black man black.”He added: “The fact remains that, in the heat of the moment, this was an insult delivered by reference to race and that is what the law prohibits.“The law does not discriminate between different races when it comes to racist language.”Current and former Chelsea players, including Millie Bright and Carly Telford, and the team’s former manager, Emma Hayes, have come to Kerr’s defence in court.Sam Kerr was ‘speaking her truth’ in clash with police, partner tells courtRead moreOn Friday, a number of figures fromChelsea Womenprovided character witness statements in support of Kerr, who was described as “one of the warmest, friendliest, kindest players” but an “introvert” off the pitch.Telford, a goalkeeper who played for Chelsea from 2017 to 2022, told the court she first met Kerr in 2012 when they played against each other in Australia.At one point in the game, Telford “came out to punch a ball, and punched Sam instead”. They met up after the game and “had a good chat”, said Telford. “The fact she came and spoke to me, check in on me. She didn’t have to do that but it was a very nice thing to do.”She said once Kerr had signed with Chelsea, the pair “became close friends”. She described how Kerr would interact with younger academy players. “That’s probably where you see someone like Sam shine the most. She’s the type of person who makes people feel very at ease. I think that’s why she gets on with everyone in the team,” she said.She described Kerr as an “introverted extrovert” who, “on the pitch you see the skills, the back flips [but] away from pitch, she’s quite quiet and shy. Quite reserved”.Telford said Kerr was “generous” with her money and considers how she can cover costs for the younger players on nights out “to make sure they can celebrate with us”.Grace Forbes, defending Kerr, also read out a number of character witness statements provided in writing.Millie Bright, the Chelsea and England defender, described Kerr as a “truly special human”.“Sam is that person who connects with everyone and brings everyone together and puts a smile on everyone’s face. She’s a big believer in having the right environment at the club,” her statement said.“She has the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met and do anything for anyone. There are not many people in the world who can bring people together like Sam. She is a truly special human,” said Bright.Bright said that Kerr has a “great poker face” and that others “probably don’t know what she’s dealing with”. Bright added: “She doesn’t want to put her stresses on others so she deals with it behind the scenes.”Emma Hayes,the former Chelsea managerand current head coach of the USA football team, described Kerr as “one of the warmest, friendliest, kindest and most considerate players” she had ever coached.“She is calm and level-headed and mindful. She comes from a wonderful family. She has the biggest heart, she is a big kid at heart,” said Hayes. “I think she does well to manage everything that is thrown at her and the expectation that is placed on her.”Erin Cuthbert, the Chelsea and Scotland midfielder, called Kerr a “great friend and teammate” who “has a unique knack of seeing the best in everyone”. She said they “immediately got on like a house on fire” after first meeting and “we find ourselves belly laughing often”.“Sam takes part in charity work in Australia. Sam is a pivotal LGBT figure. Sam uses her platform to allow everyone to be accepted and she is no different in her personal life,” said Cuthbert. “That is why I’m lucky to call her my friend.”Kerr’s mother, Roxanne, also provided a statement, called her daughter “the most humble, honest and loving person I know” who “will always fight for what is right”.“I’m so proud of the woman she has become,” she added.The defence will give its closing argument on Monday.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomenLondonWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump is fuelling themJonathan FreedlandRarely has a US president proposed an idea more repugnant than this Gaza plan, with its appeal to old enmitiesFri 7 Feb 2025 11.49 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 11.53 ESTShareThe shock and awe continues and it only gets more shocking and more awful. These past few days, Americans have watched an unelected tech billionaire destroy large chunks of the federal government – Elon Musk bragged that he was feeding the life-saving USAid international development agency “into the wood chipper” – and yet that was not even the most outrageous event of the week.That honour went instead to Donald Trump and his proposal to “just clean out” the Gaza Strip, by removing its people, bulldozing it and then redeveloping it as “the Riviera of the Middle East”under permanent US ownership. It was so staggering that it succeeded in dominating attention, at home and abroad, for several days rather than, as has become the norm in the less than three weeks since Trump returned to the White House, a meagre few hours before some new shocker took its place.Initial reaction inside the US confirms how the US political classes, and what passes for the opposition, have been left numbed and punch drunk by the speed of events since 20 January and how far Trump has widened what was once quaintly referred to as the Overton window. He’s not just opened that window, but smashed the glass, knocked out the frame and taken out the wall that used to hold it. Now everything is thinkable and, therefore, permissible.So domestic criticism of Trump’s Gaza plan focused largely on his suggestion that US troops be deployed on the ground in Gaza to enforce US ownership. Bad idea, said theDemocrats and Republican senator Lindsey Graham: that would put Americans in harm’s way, recalling the 241 US marines who were sent to Beirut by Ronald Reagan, only to be killed in 1983 by a Hezbollah bomb.Rahm Emanuel, who served as Barack Obama’s White House chief of staff,told me this weekthat to have the US seize Gaza would be to repeat both the Beirut calamity and the “hubris” of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, “the worst foreign policy mistake ever in United States history”. Indeed, it would be “Iraq and Lebanon on steroids”. Trump was meant to pull Americans out of Middle East wars, not plunge them into the oldest and bitterest of them all.Others have faulted Trump for his timing. Just as negotiations were meant to begin on the second phase of the fragile ceasefire deal between Hamas andIsrael, the US president has not so much destabilised the process as upended it. Israeli families waiting for loved ones held captive in Gaza for nearly 500 days now fear that Hamas has lost all incentive to continue releasing hostages or observing the ceasefire. Why would they stick with a deal brokered by a US whose ultimate plan is to empty Gaza of its population and turn it into a US-owned beach resort?Plenty offer the now familiar advice that it’s unwise to take Trump too literally. This, they hope, is nothing more than a classic Trump negotiation tactic. You threaten the other party with a fate so awful they happily accede to the more modest request that was your true objective. So you threaten Canada with annexation as the 51st state, or 25% tariffs, and then get the trade or border concessions you actually want.In this case, runs the logic, Trump announces a wholesale US takeover of Gaza and thereby pushes Saudi Arabia to do a deal with Israel on terms it would previously have rejected – stripped of a Palestinian state, say – just to avert that nightmare prospect, giving Trump the prize of a diplomatic breakthrough. Trump has form in this area. Recall how he put pressure on the UAE, Bahrain and others to agree the so-called Abraham accords with Israel in 2020 by threatening that the alternative would be US approval for Israeli annexation of the West Bank (a threat that, incidentally, Trump seems set to revive, hinting this week that he will announcehis view of the West Bank’s futurein the next month).All these analyses and critiques have their merits, but they miss the big, ugly point. In rushing to assess the impact, they skip over the great wrong. This is not just another foreign policy proposal. This is a US president calling for his country to steal the land of another people 6,000 miles away by means of ethnic cleansing, and to do it for the sake of a lucrative real estate opportunity.Such a move would leave international law in tatters, with only the law of the jungle in its place. That prospect delights Trump, which is why heannounced sanctions on the international criminal courton Thursday. He relishes a world in which might is right, because the US has might.But the Trump plan is not merely illegal. Trump has forever legitimised the messianic fever dreams of the Israeli ultranationalist far right, the likes of the thuggish Itamar Ben-Gvir and the fanatic Bezalel Smotrich, who oppose the ceasefire with Hamas because they want to rebuild Jewish settlements inGazato fulfil some warped notion of holy destiny. There is, moreover, an extra repugnance in seeing Trump and his acolytes eyeing up a piece of land that belongs to Palestinians, and that should be an integral part of a future independent state of Palestine, chiefly because it has investment potential.Listen to David Friedman, Trump’s ambassador to Israel during his first term, who was asked who would live in Gaza after the envisaged 15-year rebuild is complete. It would be a “market-driven process,” he toldthe New York Times. “I know I’m sounding like a real estate guy,” he added, but just imagine the possibilities presented by “25 miles of sunset-facing beachfront”.Trump said he had to empty Gaza of its people because the Strip had become uninhabitable. No one could possibly live there until it had been levelled and rebuilt. It was“hell,” “a demolition site”, every building flattened or at risk of collapse. Next to him sat a smirking Benjamin Netanyahu, the same Netanyahu who for 15 months insisted his bombardment of Gaza was targeted and discriminate.Looking down on them both was the portrait, restored by Trump to the Oval Office, of one of his favourite predecessors,Andrew Jackson, the man who signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, an act of ethnic cleansing that expelled tens of thousands of native Americans from their ancestral homelands and left thousands dead.Trump says Palestinians in Gaza will be delighted by the prospect of being “relocated” to another country and perhaps some, driven to despair by Israeli airstrikes and nearly two decades of Hamas oppression, will grab the chance to get out. But many won’t. They have an attachment to the land that will not be bought off by the promise of a condo far away.And you know who should understand that better than most? Jews. They too were offered various alternatives back in the day, fromUganda to Madagascar to Alaska to a corner of Russia, but none ever gained serious traction, because there was only one place Jews ever regarded as their ancestral homeland. It is the same, small piece of land the Palestinians see exactly the same way. That is the tragedy of both peoples.Each may fantasise about the land empty of the other, so they can have all of it to themselves, from the river to the sea. But those are dangerous fantasies, and a US president has no business fuelling them. Instead, both peoples are fated to share that land, one way or the other. Even the most powerful man in the world cannot wish them away.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If that’s not a film for our troubled times, what is?Fri 7 Feb 2025 07.41 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.29 ESTShareThe implosion of theawards juggernaut Emilia Pérezis extremely watchable. Honestly, this is a five-star controversy for a three-star film. Each day brings a new piece of hilarity, as a hurt elite entertainment community – who were simply trying to do the correct and approved thing – now struggles to navigate the possibility that actually, they might all have been involved in a big old shitshow.Take Zoe Saldaña, whose Oscar campaign has been simplyruinedby her marginalised-community co-star’s historic attempts to marginalise some other communities. As sheheroically put it yesterday: “I’m allowing myself to still experience joy.”Me too, Zoe. Like many, I have given myself permission to be amused.If you’ve missed this one,Emilia Pérez is a movie musicalabout a transgender Mexican drug lord, acquired after its Cannes premiere by that adorable indie-outsider-that-could, Netflix. Along with its lead star, Karla Sofía Gascón, the film has been nominated for masses of awards, and Gascón declared at the Golden Globes: “The light always wins over darkness … I am who I am, not who you want.” Alas, it has since emerged via a trawl of her old tweets that she’s quite a committed marginaliser herself. Muslims, George Floyd, Chinese people – they all came in for a pasting. But probably the worst thing she did in the eyes of the marginalised community she’s seeking to impress – Hollywood – was criticise the Oscars. “I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M [Women’s March],” she opined of the 2021 Academy Awards. “Apart from that, an ugly, ugly gala.” OMG. Actual sacrilege.‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreEmilia Pérez took $13.5m (£11m) on a budget of $25m (not including marketing), so it’s fun to keep reading that it was a hit in cinemas. But as the world’s TV channel, Netflix has different metrics for success, and it’ll do well enough for them on the platform. What Netflix craves, though, is movie awards, so I’d love to know what the full-time Emilia Pérez awards team – who will have numbered in double figures – were doing instead of deleting Gascón’s old tweets. That’s day one, guys! You have to detonate the entire shaft before the offence miners get there. Failure to do so means Netflix is now engaged in a ludicrous rearguard attempt to firewall the movie’s other awards prospects. They’re eventaking Emilia Pérez outof the Emilia Pérez posters. Amazing.Or is it? Many people will find themselves so lost after the cultural contortions of the past few years that they might think that counts as trans erasure. But it’s happening over a movie that a lot of people think was involved in some kind of Mexican erasure? Even though everyone’s given it every award nomination out there, when theytipped all overthe author Jeanine Cummins for her deeply-researched 2020 novel American Dirt, because she wasn’t Mexican? Oh dear. What a muddle. It’s almost as if things haven’t been as simple as we’ve been told to believe for so long.View image in fullscreenZoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/APWhich brings us to why theEmilia Pérezcontroversy is most interesting. It has blown up at precisely the moment that a necessary conversation is being had about the blowback or logical end of the cultural politics that has defined the past decade or so.A few months ago I was chatting to the pollster James Kanagasooriam about something, and he noted that “the left tends to issue-bundle”. Which feels a good way of putting it. Many people will have felt the increasingly illogical strictures of this all-or-nothing deal in recent years of supposed progressivism. It’s as though you can’t consider each subject or cause on what you, personally, judge to be its individual merits. Instead, you must buy the entire suite of opinions off the shelf, and you have to agree with all of them, or you are “on the wrong side of history” with the ones you don’t. This was odd, James pointed out, because outside the small minority of the hyper-politically-engaged, most people in the world are not actually like this. His example was to say that most people in the UK are extremely pro gay rights, but a substantial proportion of this group might also support the non-progressive cause of the death penalty.Anyway: Emilia Pérez. A trans story! Latin actors! Big-swing cinema! It’s all good, right? Except: no. ApparentlyMexicans hate it. Apparently trans people hate it. Now old-skewing liberal Academy voters – who loved it – have seen these controversies and know they have to do a 180 and hate it too. For all its superficial whimsy, Emilia Pérez feels like an issue-bundled movie, and the implosion of its star’s awards campaign feels like the absurd logical end of this prescription for looking at the world. It was pitched as a progressive triumph – now it’s on “the wrong side of history”.The rise and fall of Emilia Pérez: how did it all go so wrong for the Oscar-nominated film and its star?Read moreOn which, before we conclude, a note: I can’t stand that infantilising, hectoring phrase, which has spent the past decade being the laziest but most successful way to force someone to agree with you. Ditto the idea that if you share any opinion – at all – with people on the other side of a supposed divide, then you should just consider what that makes you, and fall back into line with your tribe. What bollocks.In fact, the present political climate in the US seems to have been exacerbated by people performing their endless taxonomy of what is and isn’t on the wrong side of history. It’s enough to make you feel that the left, who bang on about polarisation the whole time, are actually more invested in it than the right. The movie industry could always come up with a big-swing, important movie which explores that. And maybe, more people would go out and see it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Who he? In his inaugural address, Trump pledged to restore the name Mount McKinley to North America’s highest peak. It was an anti-woke dig at Barack Obama, who had given it the Alaskan native name ofDenali. But why this idolatry?The answer has since become clear. McKinley was the president (1897-1901) whointroduced super-tariffsin his first year in office to protect the US’s post-recessionary manufacturers. Some were as high as 57%, and were seen as an alternative fundraiser to income tax. McKinley was also appealing to Trump for presiding over the founding of a hesitant US empire beyond the North American continent, one from which it has since retreated. Apart from that, the man was unostentatious, intelligent and impeccably polite, faults that Trump is clearly ready to forgive. His only carelessness was to be assassinated six months into his second term.Trump has blatantly sought to mimic McKinley’s policies over the past fortnight. It is therefore worth studying what his hero actually did. Unlike Trump, McKinley made sure that his tariffs wereapproved by Congress. Indeed, the constitution thenrequired it– and technically still does. He was emphatic that they should be based on treaties embracing reciprocity. They should be treaties.In the event, the tariffs were not seen as critical to economic recovery. They were also blamed for a 25% rise in the cost of living. McKinley lost enthusiasm for them and became instead a champion of global free trade. He formed a group of nations to pursue an open-door policy, aimed at strengthening trade with China. He never saw tariffs as tactical weapons of foreign policy, nor used Trump’s description of his trading partners as “atrocious”.As for seeking new colonies, historians regard McKinley as at best an accidental imperialist. A year after his 1897 tariffs were introduced, the US was faced with the effectivecollapseof the Spanish empire, with armed insurrections in Cuba and the Philippines. Like many Americans, McKinley welcomed the arrival of new and free states. But he was adamantly against aiding them in wars against Spain. Hismuch-cited quotewas that “war should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed”. He had seen the civil war, and never wanted to see another one.View image in fullscreenAn undated photo of William McKinley, 25th president; he was inaugurated in 1897 and again in 1901, just prior to being assassinated on 6 September 1901.Photograph: APYet he was under pressure. This was a time when European nations were reaching their imperial limits. It was an opportunity for the US to spread its wings, and many of McKinley’s colleagues were eager for the challenge. Over the course of 1898, war fever against Spain became hysterical. The Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers dailydemanded interventionin the Caribbean and the Pacific. Showered with petitions, Congress demanded, in effect, that McKinley declare war on Spain.He did so under protest. His belligerentassistant navy secretary, the young Teddy Roosevelt, had already mobilised the navy, aiming it at Cuba and the Philippines. Roosevelt then formally resigned his position and led a volunteer regiment to fight in Cuba amid a blaze of publicity. He hadaccused McKinleyof having “no more backbone than a chocolate eclair”. He was nonetheless chosen as McKinley’s vice-president in 1900.These interventions did not result from any threat to US territory or sovereignty. They were naked acts of aggression. They were spectacularly egged on by Rudyard Kipling’s poem,The White Man’s Burden, directed at the Philippines and published in the New York Sun. It challenged America to take over from the British empire, to fight “the savage wars of peace” against “sloth and heathen folly”.McKinley throughout was on the side of negotiation and peace. The Spanish war ended in a treaty signed in Paris in December 1898, which ceded America varying measures of control overCuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. McKinley agreed with an anti-imperial majority in Congress that, once pacified, the US should deny any “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control”. The government of the islands must be left to their people. The only “imperial” acquisition that McKinley did undertakewas that of Hawaii, to prevent it falling into the hands of Japan.View image in fullscreenA sign at a coffee shop in Anchorage, Alaska, where in 2015 Barack Obama renamed Mount McKinley Mount Denali.Photograph: Jerome Cartillier/AFP/Getty ImagesOn McKinley’s assassination in 1901, it was Roosevelt who assumed control of these territories, did not leave and retained them into the 20th century. It was also Roosevelt who backed rebels in seizing Panama from Colombia and giving the US control of the canal’s building and fortification. This was highly controversial. Roosevelt was challenged in Congress and by the New York Times for “an act of sordid conquest”. If Trump is seeking to emulate an earlier president, it is surely Roosevelt – described as the “bucking bronco” of American imperialism – he should be worshipping.Almost every president comes to office asserting if not isolationism, then a refusal to commit money or resources to setting the world to rights. Yet all are seduced by the power of office and the language of the founding fathers. They come to see the US’s “manifest destiny” as being to champion freedom and democracy wherever it is threatened. From Woodrow Wilson to Franklin Roosevelt, from JFK to Johnson and the Bushes father and son, all came to see themselves as global crusaders for that cause.In 2016, Trump refreshingly described the interventionism of his predecessors as a “total disaster”. He stuck to his guns and almost entirely avoided troop deployments during his first term of office. The world at least knew where it stood.His emphasis on putting America’s interests first was repeated in 2024. But this time the prospect is uncertain. In his inaugural speech, he described his task as one that “expands our territory … and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons”. He even used the fell phrase,manifest destiny, as being one he would “pursue … into the stars … to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars”. Not content with Mars, he has set his sights on Panama, Greenland and Gaza.These territories might not match the ambitions of a Kipling or a Roosevelt, but Trump’s current intentions are hardly pacific. If he is to deify McKinley, he might first seek to find out a bit more about him.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The kid not allowed snacks between meals goes mad at houses with an open-fridge policy. Inflexible bedtimes create inflexible children. News blackouts designed to preserve the innocence of a child can make the world seem more not less frightening, and so on.The obvious exception to all this is tech, which takes away all of our abilities to self-regulate. Until recently, I imagined there was no amount of slack-jawed screen time that would exhaust my children’s appetite for it. This has turned out to be wrong: one child, off sick a few weeks ago, actually looked up bleary-eyed from her iPad after two days of constant usage and expressed a desire to go back to school. More generally, however, they will want more time on it than I think healthy, even as I use the time bought by their screen addiction to feed my own.Until recently, it has seemed as if the messaging around kids and screen use has been broad stroke and premised on assumptions that all forms of engagement are equal.Social mediacan be harmful to teens because of online bullying, toxicity and skewing their values towards instabullshit but, in general, children need to be on phones and iPads less and that, we are led to believe, is the bottom line. This may well be true; I’m sure it would be better if they were all playing volleyball. But the Eiger-scale task of getting them off screens altogether can seem so overwhelming that it discourages any action at all.This week, there is some consolation to be had, therefore, in research undertaken by Birmingham University and published in the Lancet’s Regional Health Europe journal, that suggests the ultimate – and ultimately impossible, or so it feels – goal of banning children from screenscan support some shades of nuance. While the research confirmed what we already know, that increased screen time in young people affects mental health, behaviour and sleep patterns, the university research team also discovered that banning phones from schools doesn’t actually achieve anything. The study concluded: “There is no evidence to support that restrictive school phone policies, in their current forms, have a beneficial effect on adolescents’ mental health and wellbeing or related outcomes.”These findings seem like a foregone conclusion when you stop and give them some thought; apart from break and lunchtime, school days simply don’t afford an opportunity for what happens after school and at the weekend, which is the spectacle of kids engaged in unbroken, multihour screen usage that results in the average child spending betweenfour and six hours on screens a day.Even within that horror statistic there are differentials, however. If I’m bingeing a TV show, I can easily pull down a four-hour shift of back-to-back episodes. There may be better ways to spend time – I’m sure there are – but apart from a vague risk of deep vein thrombosis, I don’t think of the activity itself as particularly damaging.Childrenare more malleable, need to move around more than adults, and should ideally have a life before they turn into couch potatoes. But it is worth making a distinction between different types of screen engagement so that rule-making around it can become more realistic.To this end, it’s worth isolating the single most damaging aspect of online culture for kids, which is the dopamine-spiking, attention-nuking, wholly ruinous and entirely nutrition-free feeds on YouTube Shorts, TikTok and Instagram Reels, that have apparently led to gen Z college kids beingunable to read a whole novel. Going screen-zero is great if you have the resources to occupy your kids in other ways, but assuming, like most parents, you have neither the time, energy or fine temper to police what happens when you cancel all screen time and tell them to play with each other for four hours after school, there is another way.This seems so obvious but for some reason struck me only recently: they can be on screens, even for hours at a time, but it has to be nutritional content, which is to say either to involve an element of active play – Roblox or Minecraft, where they message and hang out with friends – or actual programming. This revelation has led to a rare enforcement of rules in our house: I won’t ban screens, but I will ban short videos. (I make an exception forBluey webisodes, because they’re well made and I am a snob, plus I find the Heeler family soothing.)It’s early days, but so far the new rule seems to be working, not least because it makes everyone feel as if they’ve won. Now I have one child who just ploughed through three seasons of A Series of Unfortunate Events and another embarking on Young Sheldon, which with any luck will keep her going all year. OK it’s not volleyball or sticking bits of felt to a toilet roll, or, you know, interacting with each other; but considering the alternative, I’ll take it.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSocial mediaChildrenDigital mediaFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Just a few days ago it was thefifth anniversaryof the UK leaving the EU, so how come we didn’t have a weekend of celebrations? The Labour government marked the occasion by choosing to ignore it entirely. As if it had never happened. The Tories were also rather muted, with Kemi Badenoch keeping a low profile. Even Nigel Farage was sotto voce. His statement merely noted that Brexit would have gone a great deal better if the Tories had managed it better. As usual, Nige was taking no personal responsibility for anything.So it’s left to me to toast the many successes of the Brexit project. To sound a note of triumphalism. Here’s just a few. First, the trade deals. Why do people get so hung up about the 4% drop in GDP when we are now a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership? Give it 10 years of so and we might increase our GDP by 0.01%. Surely that’s something to get excited about.Then there’s the trade deal with Australia that allows Aussie farmers to dump cheap meat in the UK. Brexit wasn’t all about improving our trade, it was about giving a boost to the Commonwealth as well. Job done. Nor must we forget the increased regulations. As Chris Philp recently pointed out, most British workers are terminally lazy. That’s why we now make exporters fill in tens of millions of completely unnecessary forms each year. The EU had made us idle. Brexit has restored the work ethic.And thank God we got rid of the youth mobility scheme. All those young people wandering around Europe, having a good time in Florence or Barcelona. Eating pasta and tapas. That had to stop. Fraternising with Europeans when they could have been looking at Corfe Castle in the rain. If God had wanted us to speak a foreign language, he would have made us foreign. What’s the point of being an island nation if we’re going to waste time on the European mainland? Finally, there are the lengthy queues at European airports. Queueing is uniquely British and it’s good to show the French and Germans how to do it properly. Call it soft power. Chin up, everyone.TuesdayEven by his usual reality-bending, incoherent standards, the latest intervention from Donald Trump was spectacularly wild. For the US toown Gaza, to kick out the 1.8 million Palestinians and turn the territory into the Riviera of the Middle East. Golf courses and casinos wherever you look. Foreign policy reduced to a real estate deal. This didn’t just take the rest of the world by surprise, it also caught his supporters off guard. Trump had campaigned on a ticket of non-intervention on the global stage.There again, maybe The Donald is a mystery to himself. You often get the impression that the words tumble out of his mouth of their own accord and that he has no idea of what he is going to say until after he has said it. So he’s constantly playing catchup with himself. Either way, the fallout was predictable, with every country in the Middle East bar Israel, along with many others around the world, insisting the US plan was never going to happen. It broke with the Geneva conventions and amounted to ethnic cleansing. Bizarrely, Trump then announced that everyone loved the plan and that it was definitely going to happen. Just with no US money or boots on the ground. We were now through the other side of the looking-glass.Keir Starmer’s responsewas instructive. He has clearly given a lot of thought to how to deal with the president and has decided to take the indulgent-parent approach. Shower him with praise and then suggest a few minor tweaks. So Keir declared The Donald was ahead of the game in realising Gaza was now rubble. He himself had never noticed that before. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, adopted a similar approach by saying he had never known Greenland existed before Trump brought it to his notice. Perhaps this is the way forward.View image in fullscreenDigested photo of the week 1: ‘The Trump Gaza golf course is going to be amazing. The very best.’Photograph: Evan Vucci/APWednesdaySam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, hasrecently been complainingthat the Chinese have been scraping his data to train their own AI engine DeepSeek. Copyright theft on an industrial scale. I guess Sam should know what he’s talking about, as OpenAI ransacked the internet to get its own engine up and running. Along the way, he powered through several hundred thousand books without asking the authors’ permission or offering a payment. Instead, he just stole everyone’s intellectual property. Including mine. A friend directed me to a website where you could find out whether your own books had been part of the grand larceny. And sure enough, several of my books had been chosen to be immortalised on various giant servers somewhere out in the desert. Fame of sorts, I suppose.More interesting is: what is my contribution to AI? What will future generations unknowingly learn from me? From Vertigo: One Football Fan’s Fear of Success they will learn that being a Spurs fan is a life sentence in disappointment. And it is the hope that finishes you off. Give it a year or two and they could find that out for themselves. From Brideshead Abbreviated, OpenAI will have found out how to parody 100 of the best books of the 20th century. Slightly niche, I would have thought. That just leaves several collections of my political sketches over the past 10 years. I guess even AI needs to develop a sense of humour. Much like Westminster.Sometimes the sketch is a straightforward transcription service. Another lobby friend recently tested DeepSeek by asking it to write a sketch about Chris Philp in the style of John Crace. It was disturbingly good. Apart from one thing. It thought the Tories were still in government and that Philp was still a minister. My job is safe for a little while yet, I hope.ThursdayYet again I seem to find myself out of sync with the rest of the world. Research conducted by scientists at University College London and published in the British Medical Journal Mental Health has found that peopleare at their happiest when they wake upin the morning. Thereafter, the day seems to slip away from them and they feel progressively worse. By the time it gets to midnight, they are wondering why they even bothered to engage with the world. They would have been better off staying in bed all day watching TV on their laptops. There were some variations, as you might expect: people felt generally more chipper at weekends and on holiday, but the general principle applies: if you’re feeling crap, try not to dwell on it. Just go to sleep and you will wake up in a better mood.All of which is the precise opposite of my own biorhythms. I dread waking up each morning because that is when I am at my worst. When I am most in the grip of my anxiety. I often feel so anxious it is a struggle to get out of bed. The urge to hide under the duvet is almost irresistible.Frequently I have to give myself a strong talking to. Reduce the morning to small increments. Minor achievements. Check phone. Get dressed. Go downstairs. Have breakfast. Answer texts and emails. Leave house. Once I’ve done all this, I find my anxiety is more or less manageable. I can get on with the day. Enjoy what I am doing at work. Have fun with friends and colleagues. Go to the gym. By the time I get home, I’m at my most relaxed. Ready even for something as brain dead as Silent Witness. Talking of which, the season finale was so bad it was a must-watch. Jack and Nikki’s wedding was hysterical. Awkward dancing in Trafalgar Square. Two people with no obvious attraction to one another. Bring on season 29.View image in fullscreenDigested photo of the week 2: ‘The economy appears to be on life support.’Photograph: Oli Scarff/PAFridayThe older I get, the more I want to mark important milestones. Maybe I’m getting more sentimental, or maybe it’s a realisation that I may not have so many of these occasions left as I would like and I want to make the best of them. So I should point out that we are very close to theanniversary of myheart attack. My very own unwantedmemento mori. Obviously some memories have faded in time. I can’t remember the faces of those in the hospital beds next to me. But a lot is still vivid. The feelings of terror. Of being out of control. The consultant, doctors and nurses who looked after me and saved my life. The notion of time appearing to slow down.To all intents and purposes, I am now a well man. My artery has been unblocked. My heart is functioning well in stress tests. My blood results are normal. I take all my meds with the devotion of a man who has been given a second chance. And yet … something important has changed. I feel more vulnerable than I ever did before. There is not a day goes by without me thinking of my heart attack. It’s always just beneath the surface of my thoughts. Sometimes when I am heading off to work, I find myself wondering if I will make it back home. Whenever I am in the gym – the place where I had my heart attack – I am always on the lookout for chest pains. Most of all, I feel as if I have been given a chronicle of a death foretold. As if I know how I am going to die. All that’s left to be decided is when.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsDigested weekcommentShareReuse this content"

Across Europe, young people like me are finding friends by walking our citiesViola Di GradoWe are the post-pandemic flâneurs: stepping out of social media silos to meet people and connect with the world around usFri 7 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 09.55 ESTShareWhen I moved back to London from Rome just before the second lockdown in 2020, I found a city that was hardly welcoming, with shops closed and an atmosphere of silent apprehension. Young, single people like me were only socialising online with existing friends, and opportunities to make fresh connections were rare.When I met Irenka from Poland at a literary festival, she looked as thirsty for new friends as I was. As we started complaining about the difficulties of mingling she introduced me to an app that allows people to find new pals on organised walks. I quickly downloaded it.On my first walk – a six-mile stroll along the banks of the River Lea in east London – I met Haris from Greece. While we were exploring, she explained to me that, since her grandmother had died (they had been living together), she had been staying on the sofa of a friend whom she also recently met on a walk. This friend went to that walk after being encouraged by one of her friends, who also happened to be a Meetup-acquaintance of Irenka.As someone who is much better at slow-cooked friendship that acquires its flavour over time, I was surprised at how trusting Irenka was of strangers and how quick she was to rearrange her life around them. Yet I too was becoming a friend of Irenka’s with startling alacrity, and the same happened on the next walk. I made more new friends. This kind of thing never happened to me in bars or at parties; those traditional places for socialising. So I started wondering why these walks were so different, and I realised it was to do with the balance between an interpersonal exchange and the outside world.In bars or clubs you are required to interact with people. On walks you also pay attention to the environment around you, and it seems to me that it’s this shift of focus that makes it easier to make friends this way – precisely because there is less pressure to do so.Lockdowns made us more aware of the line between self-sufficiency and our need for others, as well as between nesting and exploring the outside world. The flat or house that had always been our refuge suddenly became a prison, and it wasn’t enough to fill it virtually with video-chats with friends. We knew something was missing, and it wasn’t just people or the outdoors: it was both at the same time.It probably explains why walking meditation and walking psychotherapy are now so popular, not just in London but inother European and US citiestoo. It is as if, after we became painfully aware of the claustrophobic distress of having too much of our own company (who will forget how our worries were amplified by the four walls of our homes?), we needed to discover a new way of combining conversation with equally needed contemplation: we had missed human connection as much as we’d missed connecting to the outdoors.View image in fullscreenForest walking in Vartiosaari, Finland.Photograph: Markus Thomenius/AlamyBut this is nothing new. Europe has a long history ofpsychogeography, a concept that originated in the 1950s among a Paris-based group of radical artists and conceptual theorists called theSituationist International. In practice, this involved exploring urban environments while also focusing on personal connections to places.Originally psychogeography – with its strong dadaist and surrealist influences – had an anarchic emphasis on the casual and the subconscious. The contemporary post-pandemic version of it, however, tries to bring order and rigour to our overwhelming lives. Where traditional psychogeography was rooted in thedérive, literally going “adrift” without a planned route, the preferred tactic for much contemporary walking is to follow a well-organised route.I’m now really good friends with Irenka and Haris. We like to walk and talk, and never hang out in our own flats: instead, we relish exploring the city on foot. While in recent years there has been a lot of emphasis on mindful meditation and other types of individual self-care, I find that shifting the focus from myself to the outside world works better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, the Japanese practice ofshinrin-yoku(or forest bathing) is nowpractised across Europe. There is also an emerging field of science on hownature can improve our health, withmental health practitioners worldwidebeginning to take talking therapies outdoors. But I believe that, alongside nature’s capacity to restore, we can also count on the reviving effect of urban spaces. They too can act as rich symbolic maps, with the power to distract us from self-obsession and the usual everyday neurosis.Which is why, instead of mindfulness, I prefer to perform a “mindemptyness”: that’s what I call my long walks with the new friends I’m making, during which I predominantly think about the streets that I’m walking and the city I live in. We are post-pandemic flâneurs: just like the romantic strollers described by the 19th-century French poet and writer Charles Baudelaire. We sometimes make our walks’ lack of destination their whole purpose, cheerfully drifting while deepening our friendships.The flâneur became unfashionable with therejection of idlenessin busy, modern, working lives. But now is the perfect time for its rebirth. After all,every cityis, in a way, still a “traumascape”: a space transformed by the collective memory of lockdowns. By walking, we give it – and ourselves – a chance of healing and reinvention.Some names have been changedViola di Grado is an Italian authorExplore more on these topicsWalkingOpinionEuropeMental healthMindfulnessHobbiesHealthHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

And, in so doing, showing their colleagues how to overcome their reputation for ditheringFri 7 Feb 2025 11.28 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareIt’s easy to be disgusted with the Democratic party right now.Donald Trumpis running roughshod over the rule of law, treating the US constitution like toilet paper. His trusty pal Elon Musk is the arsonist in chief, burning down worthy democratic institutions and installing his minions in the heart of government where they have gained access to citizens’ private information. Much of what’s happening is illegal and unconstitutional.And the Democrats, mostly, look less like an opposition party and more like stunned bystanders. As my Guardian colleague Moira Doneganput it,they are “out of touch, opportunistic and cowardly”.But not all. Some Democrats in a new generation are punching back hard, and in so doing, showing their colleagues how to overcome their reputation for spineless dithering.Take Jasmine Crockett, for example, a 43-year-old congresswoman from Texas, who is defiantly feisty. You’ll find her everywhere – on social media, on cable TV and leading citizen protests in front of government office buildings.“We have a thug in charge of the White House,” shethunderedin a TV appearance this week. And she didn’t spare her fellow citizens who elected Trump or who stayed home instead of voting in November. “Americans thought that it was OK to take a full-fledged criminal and make him the president of the United States, and then they want to act aghast when he does criminal things.”I’ve been talking with Sawyer Hackett, a strategist who worked in the Obama administration, about how Democrats can meet this terrifying moment. He praised Crockett as “an authentic source of righteous indignation when Democrats desperately need it”.The millions of anti-Trump Americans, he told me, aren’t interested in curated talking points or polished press conferences.“They want to see us fight and speak clearly about the threats we face,” Hackett said, and she has been delivering. As a Black woman, Crockett is particularly incensed about TrumpWorld’s racist attacks on diversity and has no hesitation in blasting the “mediocre white men” who benefit.The Connecticut senator Chris Murphy is at least as impressive. He has been relentless in calling out exactly what’s happening and why, especially in the shocking weeks since Trump took office.“We have days to stop the destruction of our democracy,” Murphy raged at a protest Tuesday in front of the US treasury building in Washington. “It’s the people who rule, not the billionaires. We are taking this country back fromElon Musk.”Murphy calls what’s happening a constitutional crisis. It is one that the public must play a role in fixing by putting pressure not only on Democrats but on the cowardly Republicans who hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Talk about spineless!“There’s been no better messenger in the first two weeks of Trump 2.0 than Chris Murphy,” in Hackett’s view. “At a time when too many Democrats are afraid of their shadow, Murphy is showing how to fight back with a compelling populist message that should be a blueprint for the Democrats moving forward.”As outraged and frightened Americans urge Democrats to “do something”, it’s not clear whether voices like Crockett’s and Murphy’s can really make a difference. Whatcanbe done? Lawsuits are cropping up all over, and a federal judge on Wednesday barred the enforcement of Trump’s executive order that would restrict birthright citizenship.And some in Congress are refusing to vote for anything Trump wants until the illegality ends and Musk is sent home. Their notion is simple: gum up the works.“Democrats need to throw every possible wrench into the plans of Trump, Musk and their Republican cultists in Congress,”argued scholar Norm Ornsteinin the Contrarian newsletter. “Doing so will also underscore how serious the threat is to our system, thereby forcing media to cover it.” As the Virginia congressman Don Beyer suggested on Greg Sargent’s Daily Blastpodcastfrom the New Republic: “Put those things that used to be routine and make them not routine until Trump stops breaking the law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Most of all, prepare for the midterms elections next year by honing a strong, populist message.And lead with convincing voices that can motivate the public. Crockett and Murphy surely are two of those. Though far from alone – Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, for example, is irreplaceable – they are notable because they are younger and savvy about how to communicate forcefully in today’s media environment. (Here’s Murphy’s clarity onthe billionaire bonanza: “Why is Donald Trump engaged in this relentless campaign to try to silence journalists, media companies, and his political opposition? It’s because he’s trying to steal from you.”)They know how to put up their dukes.That’s important because one thing is certain: if the public believes there is no determination to fight back, Trump’s destruction will continue unabated.What’s giving me hope nowWhat’s giving me hope now is knowing so many talented young journalists, not only my students at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, but others whose careers I have followed in recent years. Many of them are determined, honest, idealistic, energetic and unwilling to give up on their chosen craft despite all the headwinds and challenges that face them. Democracy demands journalism, so this is extremely important now and in the future.Margaret Sullivanis a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

His last administrationslapped sanctionson it over its investigations into potential war crimes in Afghanistan, including by the US, and into the actions of Israeli forces. But his new executive order goes even further, attacking the fundamentals of the court and endangering its functioning.The US never joined the ICC, fearing scrutiny of its own actions and those of its allies. Joe Bidendamagedboth the court and US claims of commitment to the “rules-based international order” when he justified the arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin while attacking as “outrageous” the one issued for Benjamin Netanyahu.But for Mr Trump it is not just about expedience. His loathing for the court speaks to something fundamental about this president. Ultimately, the law he believes in is that of the jungle. Naked transactionalism and coercion replace diplomacy and alliances. The biggest beasts are hungry and the rest must flatter or flee.This credo can be seen at work again in thedestruction of USAid. The callous disregard for life is sickening. As Gordon Brownlaid out powerfullyin the Guardian, this decision will kill. It is also shortsighted and stupid. USAid has been a shrewd, low-cost foreign policy tool. It cost less than 1% of the federal budget in the 2023 fiscal year – and much of the moneywent back tothe United States. US foreign aid spending as a percentage of gross national income is far below that of most advanced economies. USAid helped to stabilise countries, contain diseases, and foster goodwill in places which will now look to other patrons.Mr Trump’s “might-is-right” doctrine can be seen most clearly in hisreckless and immoral callto ethnically cleanse Gaza, so that the US could “own” a new “Riviera of the Middle East”. This is the most disturbing element of his unexpected and repeated proposals forAmerican territorial expansion, in place of the anticipated isolationism. He has even declared his willingness touse military forcein other places.No one expects US troops to march into Canada. His Gaza proposal is not realisable. At least some of his suggestions are surely wielded as the crudest available threat to achieve concessions on other issues. Yet a worrying consistency in the theme suggests that observers may need to take himliterally as well as seriously, however ludicrous these ideas sound. He does not need to enact them exactly for them to prove hugely damaging. And whether or not the US expands its borders, there seems every prospect that Mr Trump will approve of Israel and Russia annexing land, emboldening others to use force to remake borders.In the past, some have wondered how effective the ICC can really be: the work of bringing war criminals to justice has been slow, painful and often unsuccessful at the best of times. Mr Trump’s attack is a perverse recognition of the importance of the court, and of international law more generally. It is alarming that influential voices within the British government appear inclined tolament the rigour of international lawas an obstacle to domestic priorities, rather than celebrate its place in the architecture of a civilised world. Recoiling at Mr Trump’s excesses is not enough. The UK and others have rightlyexpressedtheir “unwavering” support for the ICC. They must now defend it, and the values for which it stands, by whatever means they can.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They have reclaimed the fantasy genre for womenFri 7 Feb 2025 13.03 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 13.15 ESTShareAstrange and powerful creature has taken over the publishing industry –romantasy, a magical union of romance and fantasy. Last week in scenes reminiscent ofPottermania20 years ago, bookshops across the country heldmidnight launches, with fans dressed as their favourite characters, for the publication of Onyx Storm, the third instalment of Rebecca Yarros’s Empyrean series. In its first week it became the fastest-selling adult title since records began, with more than 180,000 copies sold in one day in the UK alone.Yarros is following in the fairy dust of fellow American novelistSarah J Maas, who is credited with spearheading the genre with her hugely successful A Court of Thorns and Roses series. In just five years, a genre born during the pandemic and rising on a blaze of BookTok recommendations and emojis has gone from being a niche offshoot of young adult fiction to a once-in-a-generation phenomenon. In the past year, the market share of science fiction and fantasy booksrose by over 41%. With their action-packed storylines, alternate worlds and friendship groups, romantasy novels satisfy a nostalgia for those who grew up on a diet of the Harry Potter, The Hunger Games and Twilight series. Tolkein this is not, nor JK Rowling. But lack of literary finesse never hindered juggernaut bestsellers from the likes of Dan Brown (who has a new Robert Langdon novel out in September).“They get to ride dragons, they get to ride each other,” Yarros quipped of her new novel to whoops from delighted fans ata recent event in Los Angeles. The Empyrean series is set in Basgiath War College for elite dragon riders, an unholy mix of Hogwarts and Top Gun. Yarros has been dubbed “Dragons Jilly Cooper”, Maas’s novels“fairy porn”. But in our porn-soaked culture, there is something old-fashioned about the sex scenes – this is Mills & Boon for millennials, not to mention Gen Z.Romantasy has reclaimed the geeky fantasy dominion for women, celebrating female friendship, agency and sexuality– a less sexist Game of Thrones. It has created its own communities and fandoms: just as you might be a Swiftie or a member of the BeyHive (Beyonce fan), readers belong to the Maasverse or Empyrean army.Along with the magical power of lightning, Yarros’s protagonist, Violet, has a chronic illness (Yarros suffers from the genetic disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), adding to her relatability for many readers. The genre promises transformation – from weakness to strength, from outsider to inner-circle, from enemies to lovers. The novels celebrate individuality and belonging.Taylor Swift and Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba in the movie Wicked, are both Yarros fans, apparently. The romantasy heroine speaks to the cultural moment. The strong, female-led stories show young women can be nerdy and sexy, vulnerable and powerful, both “not that girl” and “that girl”. You can be Glinda and Elphaba, Chappell Roan and Swift. You can be anyone – or anything – you please. This is the fantasy.Along withthe rise in cosy crime, romantasy’s soaring popularity has been attributed to the appeal of escapism in dark times. For its devotees, the genre offers the joy of getting lost in another world and connecting with others. In the face of powerlessness and uncertainty in the real one, its message for young women seems compelling. As Yarros promises her readers at the beginning of Onyx Storm, “Get your leathers. We have dragons to ride.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What the letter fails to do, however, is to capture what a big “if” this is.Some promising theories of consciousness do indeed open the door to AI consciousness. But other equally promising theories suggest that being conscious requires being an organism. Although we can look for indicators of consciousness in AI, it is very difficult – perhaps impossible – to know whether an AI is actually conscious or merely presenting the outward signs of consciousness. Given how deep these problems run, the only reasonable stance to take on artificial consciousness is an agnostic one.Does that mean we can ignore the moral problem? Far from it. If there’s a genuine chance of developing conscious AI then we have to act responsibly. However, acting responsibly in such uncertain territory is easier said than done. Theopen letterrecommends that “organisations should prioritise research on understanding and assessing AI consciousness”. But existing methods for testing AI consciousness are highly disputed so can only deliver contentious results.Although the goal of avoiding artificial suffering is a noble one, it’s worth noting how casual we are about suffering in many organisms. A growing body of evidence suggests that prawns could be capable of suffering, yet the prawn industry kills around half a trillion prawns every year. Testing for consciousness in prawns is hard, but it’s nothing like as hard as testing for consciousness in AI. So while it’s right to take our possible duties to future AI seriously, we mustn’t lose sight of the duties we might already have to our biological cousins.Dr Tom McClellandLecturer in philosophy of science, University of CambridgeRegarding your editorial (The Guardian view on AI and copyright law: big tech must pay, 31 January), I agree that AI regulations need a balance so that we all benefit. However, the focus is perhaps too much on the training of AI models and not enough on the processing of creative works by AI models. To use a metaphor – imagine I photocopied 100,000 books, read them, and could then string together plausible sentences on topics in the books. Clearly, I shouldn’t have photocopied them, but I can’t reproduce any content from any single book, as it’s too much to remember. At best, I can broadly mimic the style of some of the more prolific authors. This is like AI training.I then use my newfound skill to take an article, paraphrase it, and present it as my own. What’s more, I find I can do this with pictures, too, as many of the books were illustrated. Give me a picture and I can create five more in a similar style, even though I’ve never seen a picture like this before. I can do this for every piece of creative work I come across, not just things I was trained on. This is like processing by AI.The debate at the moment seems to be focusing wholly on training. This is understandable, as the difference between training and processing by a pre-trained model isn’t that obvious from a user perspective. While we need a fair economic model for training data – and I believe it’s morally correct that creators can choose whether their work is used in this way and be paid fairly – we need to focus much more on processing rather than training in order to protect creative industries.Michael WebbDirector of AI, JiscWe are writing this letter on behalf of a group of members of the UN high-level advisory body for AI. The release of DeepSeek’s R1 model, a state-of-the-art AI system developed in China, highlights the urgent need for global AI governance. Even thoughDeepSeekis not an intelligence breakthrough, its efficiency highlights that cutting-edge AI is no longer confined to a few corporations. Its open-source nature, like Meta’s Llama and Mistral, raises complex questions: while transparency fosters innovation and oversight, it also enables AI-driven misinformation, cyber-attacks and deepfake propaganda.Existing governance mechanisms are inadequate. National policies, such as the EU AI Act or the UK’s AI regulation framework, vary widely, creating regulatory fragmentation. Unilateral initiatives like next week’s ParisAI Action Summitmay fail to provide comprehensive enforcement, leaving loopholes for misuse. A robust international framework is essential to ensure AI development aligns with global stability and ethical principles.The UN’s recentGoverning AI for Humanityreport underscores the dangers of an unregulated AI race – deepening inequalities, entrenching biases, and enabling AI weaponisation. AI’s risks transcend borders; fragmented approaches only exacerbate vulnerabilities. We need binding international agreements that cover transparency, accountability, liability and enforcement. AI’s trajectory must be guided by collective responsibility, not dictated by market forces or geopolitical competition.The financial world is already reacting to AI’s rapid evolution. Nvidia’s $600bn market loss after DeepSeek’s release signals growing uncertainty. However, history shows that efficiency drives demand, reinforcing the need for oversight. Without a global regulatory framework, AI’s evolution could be dominated by the fastest movers rather than the most responsible actors.The time for decisive, coordinated global governance is now – before unchecked efficiency spirals into chaos. We believe that the UN remains the best hope for establishing a unified framework that ensures AI serves humanity, safeguards rights and prevents instability before unchecked progress leads to irreversible consequences.Virginia DignumWallenberg professor of responsible AI,Umeå UniversityWendy HallRegius professor of computer science,University of SouthamptonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromHuw PriceFri 7 Feb 2025 13.01 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 13.15 ESTShareRecently, the letters pages of the Guardian have featured conflicting accounts of cold fusion, otherwise known as low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). On the one hand, the Nobel laureate Prof Brian Josephson and his co-authorsargue(27 January) that cold fusion’s time has come: companies can “make these reactions work quite reliably”, with the promise of “ending reliance on fossil fuels”. In response, Dr Philip Thomas, a researcher at the University of Exeter,proclaims(2 February) that cold fusion is a “pseudo-scientific fringe theory” in violation of the “laws of nature”. Which laws, in particular, Dr Thomas does not say.There is, however, a constructive middle ground between Josephson’s fervour and Thomas’s denigration. LENR advocates often fail to appreciate the evidentiary standard required to demonstrate novel nuclear effects. Overzealous critics are generally not well read on the LENR literature and lackperspectiveon theemergenceof new fields from anomalous effects in science. As a result, they contribute to the palpable stigma that the Cambridge emeritus professor Huw Price calls the “reputation trap”. Regardless, there is compellingexperimental dataand strongtheoretical motivationsto study cold fusion.We are MIT-based researchers in anLENR research programmerun by the US Department of Energy’s innovation agency, Arpa-E. Our group is pursuing the careful replication and characterisation of promising LENR experiments in close coordination with the original experimentalists and informed by the theoretical work of the MIT professor Peter Hagelstein.Cold fusion could result in spectacular technologies. But we are convinced that the way forward requires rigorous, open-source scientific investigation, not more claims. The Arpa-E LENR programme – a result of Google’s research efforts in cold fusionsummarisedin the journal Nature – is a model in this regard. It balances the highest scientific standards and careful experimental documentation with an open mind to the anomalies reported in the LENR literature.In many ways, cold fusion’s time has come. Advances in theory and experiment have made the LENR field eminently actionable. It is time for fellow scientists to constructively engage and for science funders to take Arpa-E’s lead and back rigorous inquiry into this promising field.Jonah MessingerPhD candidate, University of CambridgeFlorian MetzlerResearch scientist,MITMatt LilleyResearch affiliate,MITNicola GalvanettoPostdoctoral research fellow, University of ZurichDr Philip Thomas seems to be unaware of current work on cold fusion. A good example is the five-year EU-fundedCleanHME project, which held its wrap-up meeting recently at the University of Szczecin in Poland. This collaboration involved some 40 scientists from several European universities and institutes.To refer to the concerns of such projects as “pseudo-scientific fringe theory”, as Dr Thomas does, is both unfair and unwise. Unfair, because these are serious scientists, fully conversant with the laws of nature. Unwise, because we are in a very tight spot. We need new sources of fossil-free energy, so we need to search for them diligently, even in what many regard as unlikely corners. By all means criticise such work on scientific grounds, but it is folly to discourage it by calling it names.I would be delighted to introduce Dr Thomas to some of the leading scientists in the field if he would like to explore it further.Huw PriceEmeritus Bertrand Russell professor of philosophy, CambridgeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Areas of low pressure and strong north-westerly winds brought cold air from other parts of Asia, causing the extreme weather.In the Takachi district of Obihiro, a city in the northern prefecture of Hokkaido, a record 129cm (4ft) of snowfall in 12 hours was measured this week. The conditions affected travel, with many vehicles stranded, trains and planes cancelled, and hundreds of schools closed.Temperatures in parts of Japan have dropped below -10C, and strong winds have led to rough seas along the north-west coastline. A further 40-80cm (16-32in) of snow fell during the second half of the week in several prefectures including Niigata, Tohoku, and Hokuriku.Prolonged torrential rainfall in Queensland, Australia, resulted in two deaths this week, and thousands of people were advised to seek higher ground after heavy flooding. More than 1,100mm of rain was dumped on the town of Ingham and the city of Townsville, equivalent to about six months’ worth of rain. As a result, about 10,000 homes were left without power and flood waters caused the partial collapse of a highway link, which hindered recovery efforts near Ingham on Sunday.Heavy rain and mountain snow hit parts ofCalifornia, triggering severe flooding and landslides. Palmetto, a neighbourhood about 17 miles east of the city of Chico, has recorded more than 600mm of rainfall since last Friday, and surrounding locations recorded well over 500mm. Mount Shasta, a ski resort in northern California, has reported 172cm (68in) of snow in the past week, of which 130cm (51in) fell in three days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It added: “For some, Grenfell Tower is a symbol of all that they lost. The presence of the tower helps to ensure the tragedy is never forgotten and can act as a reminder of the need for justice and accountability.“Being able to see the tower every day helps some people continue to feel close to those they lost. For others it is a painful reminder of what happened and is having a daily impact on some members of the community.“Some have suggested that some floors of the tower should be retained for the memorial, others have said that this would be too painful.”The ministry said it would continue to work with the independent Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission as the community chooses a team to design a memorial.Downing Street saidRayner would ensure bereaved families, survivors and residents “continue to have opportunities to speak with her” about “issues that matter to them most”.She had met and spoken with Grenfell survivors and bereaved, and other community figures, in recent months before making the decision, No 10 said. It also denied she had attempted to avoid scrutiny by making the announcement via a press release.“The deputy prime minister has been clear on her determination to speak with survivors and bereaved families first, and it was important to ensure the community had heard the decision first,” Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said.“She has had multiple engagements with the community, the bereaved and the families affected since taking office. I think that demonstrates our commitment to this, and she is committed to keeping those voices at the heart of the decision-making process.”Asked why, given this, some had criticised the decision, the spokesperson said there was “clearly a range of views on this” in the community.In May 2024, prosecutors and police said investigators would need until the end of 2025 to complete their inquiry into the Grenfell disaster, with final decisions on potential criminal charges by the end of 2026.Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireLondonAngela RaynerEnglandHousingConstruction industryCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Neither Hellmich, who was disqualified for nine years, or a third ex-trustee, Veronica Chou, have appealed against their disqualifications.Charity law experts say it is rare for a charity tribunal to overturn a disqualification order, and that even if Campbell can prove a fake email account was used, it may not be sufficient to reverse the commission’s decision.Liz Brownsell, the head of charities at the law firm Birketts, said: “Naomi Campbell has publicly admitted that she was not involved in running the charity and that shefailed in her dutiesas a trustee. Charity trustees cannot be passive in their role and a failure to act can amount to mismanagement in the administration of the charity.“Ultimately, the tribunal’s decision regarding her disqualification will be taken based on evidence regarding how she performed her duties as a trustee and whether the tribunal concurs with the commission’s assessment that she is unfit to act as a charity trustee.”At the tribunal on Friday, lawyers for her and for the commission variously applied for the disclosure of documents. Campbell’s lawyers failed in an attempt to force the commission to disclose its case files.In written arguments for Campbell, the barrister Andrew Westwood said the disqualification order was wrongly made because she was “not able adequately, or at all, to deal with issues that arose with the running of Fashion for Relief” or to present her “proper and accurate position” during the inquiry.He told the court: “It is Ms Campbell’s case that because of the deception that was practised on her … she has been disqualified without having the opportunity to respond to the reasons for disqualification and without having had sight of the documents relied on by the commission in taking that action.”Faisel Sadiq, for the Charity Commission, told the tribunal on Friday that Campbell’s position “is not to criticise the commission”, but to say she was a victim of fraud and that her case in a nutshell was that she “knew nothing about it” and was a “figurehead”.Campbell said earlier this week that she had “fought to uncover the facts” ever since the commission’s report, published in September, and that she had “never undertaken philanthropic work for personal gain, nor will I ever do so”.Explore more on these topicsNaomi CampbellCharitiesRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

He went on to become a regular chef on ITV’s prime daytime show This Morning.He has also presented the ITV gameshow Family Fortunes, and has hosted a number of his own cooking programmes.Reruns of old D’Acampo shows have been pulled from the ITV schedule in response to the claims.Among the allegations reported by ITV News are those made by women working on shows including Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip, Gino’s Italian Express and Gino’s Italy – Like Mamma Used to Make.In response to the claims, D’Acampo said in a comment issued to ITV News: “I have been told by ITN News that allegations have been made about me acting inappropriately, some dating back over 10 years ago.“I have never been made aware of these matters previously and the allegations are firmly denied. I would not do anything that I thought would upset or distress anyone. This is simply not in my nature. I do not recognise the version of events being put to me.“Not only have these allegations never been raised with me before, I have been repeatedly supported by executives at the highest level and was commissioned on prime-time programmes during the period in which it is now suggested I was acting inappropriately.“I am a father, husband and have worked with well over 1,500 people on around 80 productions in my career, which I have been so proud of. I take such matters extremely seriously and the suggestion that I have acted in an improper way against is deeply upsetting.”The Guardian has approached D’Acampo’s representatives for comment.His legal team said: “Mr D’Acampo categorically denies these allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour.“To his knowledge no such allegations have been made against him in relation to his time on Gino’s Italian Express and this is the first time, six years later, he has been informed of these alleged incidents, and he does not accept them, not least because some of this is considered by Mr D’Acampo to be a fabricated work of fiction.”One woman alleged D’Acampo made sexualised comments towards her while they were working on a magazine shoot in 2011.Another woman interviewed by ITV News claimed she had witnessed him threatening a young colleague in 2019, with another two women accusing D’Acampo of making sexual remarks while working on Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip in 2018.The ITV News report said executives at Objective Media Group, which co-produced Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip in 2018, were aware of the concerns, with an email seen by the broadcaster, sent last year, detailing “unacceptable and distressing” behaviour by D’Acampo.Objective Media Group said it “takes the welfare and wellbeing of all its production staff and teams incredibly seriously” and includes “behavioural clauses in talent contracts” and provides “behavioural training for on-screen talent”.MultiStory Media, which produced Gino’s Italian Express, said it would be “inappropriate to go into the detail of individual concerns” but that it was “reviewing the concerns which have been raised, what was known at the time and what action was taken”.It added: “We will also look at any new concerns that have come to light.”In a statement to ITV News, Studio Ramsay, which produced the show Gino’s Italian Family Adventure and co-produced Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip in 2018, said it takes “all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and workplace misconduct seriously, promptly investigate, and take appropriate remedial action when warranted”.A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “The allegations against Gino D’Acampo are deeply concerning.“Everybody should be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace. As the culture secretary has previously said, it is right that any allegations of inappropriate behaviour are taken very seriously and that victims are supported and able to challenge behaviour – no matter how famous the star is.“The culture secretary has met with the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority to discuss how government and the industry can work together to ensure that no one faces abuse or harassment in their workplace.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFood TVITV NewsITVnewsShareReuse this content"

They cited a number of issues around staffing levels and the sharing of “risk-pertinent information”, with multiple missed opportunities to provide support.The area coroner, Laurinda Bower, said: “I’m concerned not only by the failures in Anthony, David and Rolandas’s care, but also by the persistent failure to learn from deaths at Lowdham Grange, and by the manner in which the prison agencies have engaged with this inquest.”She issued two prevention of future deaths reports, which said staff reported being “overwhelmed and overburdened”,there was “widespread evidence of failures to do the basics” and there was need for “a radical change in culture, and reflective learning from deaths”.The first suicide occurred six weeks after management of the prison changed hands from Serco to Sodexo on 16 February 2023, believed to be the first private-to-private prison transfer inEnglandand Wales.The facility wastaken over permanently by the government in December 2023due to the suicides, the “ready availability” of illegal drugs, high levels of self-harm and “significant staffing issues”.Binfield, who had a history of self-harm and substance abuse issues, was under half-hourly observations at the time of his death. CCTV footage played at the inquest showed that checks recorded on prison logs were never actually completed.Lynda Hurren, Binfield’s aunt, told the inquest that her nephew “tried to get help for himself, but he often felt that he wasn’t given the help that he needed, and he was let down”.“It seemed to me like the prison couldn’t cope with him, and often didn’t care,” she said.Richards was found dead a week later on 13 March, two weeks after arriving at the prison. He had been placed in a vulnerable prisoner unit at his previous prison for his own protection, and one staff member described him as like a “rabbit in headlights” on arriving at Lowdham Grange.Karbauskas, a Lithuanian national who spoke limited English, died five days after his arrival in the prison.A nurse told the inquest that, when asked questions to assess his risk of suicide, Rolandas made a gesture drawing his hand across his neck, and other inmates raised concerns that he wasn’t eating, but no action was taken.‘Basic lack of decency’ driving self-harm in women’s prisons, report saysRead moreDuring the inquest, the Ministry of Justice was fined £500 for failing to meet deadlines to provide documents and evidence, with the coroner saying the penalty was an “extraordinary step”.A spokesperson for Sodexo said it apologised to the family and friends of the deceased, and said the prison had a “unique set of challenges, both old and new” when it took over.“These challenges have been fully considered during the course of this inquest and we are grateful to the coroner for her thorough approach. Whilst we have since transferred the management and operation of the prison to HMPPS [HM Prison and Probation Service], we will fully take on board any learnings.”In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: “Our thoughts remain with the families of Anthony Binfield, David Richards and Rolandas Karbauskas, and we offer our sincere apologies for the failings in these cases.“Since 2024, we have boosted staffing levels to better support vulnerable prisoners, reopened education and workshops to provide greater opportunities for offenders and teamed up with Nottinghamshire police to clamp down on the flow of contraband into the jail – resulting in several arrests.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The ADP service uses end-to-end encryption, a form of security that means only the account holder can decrypt the files and no one else can – including Apple.Apple declined to comment. However, in a submission to parliament last year itflagged its concernsabout the IPA, saying it provided the government with “authority to issue secret orders requiring providers to break encryption by inserting backdoors into their software products”.Apple touts privacy as one of its “core values” and describes it as a “fundamental human right”.The Apple document refers to the ADP feature, claiming that “reporters and technical experts across the globe” welcomed it as an “invaluable protection” for private data.The submission also indicates that Apple would refuse to cooperate with a request, saying the company would “never build a backdoor” and would rather withdraw “critical safety features” from the UK market.However, the submission also points out that the IPA allows the UK government to impose requirements on companies based in other countries that apply to users globally.Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said the UK government had “lit the blue touch paper on a truly enormous fight in the never-ending saga of the encryption debate”.He added: “I don’t see how this is to be resolved, as Apple has made such a big point of privacy for users. If they accede to this technical notice their reputation will be in tatters. They’re bound to challenge it.”End-to-end encryption hasbecome a battleground between successive UK governments and tech companies, with ministers arguing that the technology prevents law enforcement agencies from tackling criminals, including child abusers.Companies are also barred from revealing whether they have received a technology capability notice under the IPA. The Washington Post reported that by the time Apple made its submission in March last year the US-based company had been informed that a notice might be served on it. The newspaper said the Biden administration had been tracking the matter since the UK government told Apple it might demand access, and Apple had said it would refuse.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on operational matters, including, for example, confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.”The submission related to amendments to the IPA passed last year under Rishi Sunak’s government and included giving ministers power to clear in advance any product changes that could alter the UK government’s ability to access users’ data.One expert warned that the multinational nature of the order could lead to a clash with the EU, which has an agreement with the UK allowing the free flow of personal data between the EU and UK – such as a company in Europe using a datacentre in the UK. The agreement comes up for review this year.“This may provide a backdoor for access to European citizen data which could go against our ability to retain the rights to share personal data without restriction between the UK and Europe,” said Ross McKenzie, a data protection partner at the UK law firm Addleshaw Goddard.Explore more on these topicsAppleEncryptionPrivacyComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Annual growth eased slightly to 3%, down from 3.4% in December.Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax, said the housing market had started the year on a positive note – for homeowners and the industry at least.“Affordability is still a challenge for many would-be buyers, but the market’s resilience is noteworthy,” she said. “There’s strong demand for new mortgages and growth in lending. With a stamp duty increase looming, some of this demand may have come from first-time buyers eager to complete transactions before the end of March.”Liz Truss’s short-lived government temporarily raised the thresholds at which stamp duty is due in England and Northern Ireland in September 2022 in aneffort to spur the housing market, before her reign collapsed in the wake of bond market chaos.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced in her budget in October that she would end the temporary cuts in April. Scotland and Wales set different taxes on house purchases.From 1 April, first-time buyers will have topay tax on homes worth more than £300,000, down from £425,000, and the threshold for a reduced rate for first-time buyers will drop from £625,000 to £500,000. The zero-tax stamp duty threshold that applies to all housing in England will drop to £125,000 from £250,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether that translates to a slowing housing market will depend to a large extent on the state of the broader economy.The Bank of England on Thursday halved its forecast for GDP growth from 1.5% to 0.75%, citing weakness in household and business confidence, both of which have fallen since the budget. The prospect of aglobal trade war started by the US president, Donald Trump, has also alarmed economists.However, Bryden said: “Despite geopolitical uncertainties, and waning consumer confidence, other key indicators look fairly positive for the housing market. The Bank of England has made its first base rate cut of the year, and there are probably more to come.“Household earnings are expected to continue outpacing inflation – albeit that gap may narrow – easing some of the financial pressure still being felt from the cost of living squeeze.”Explore more on these topicsHousing marketHouse pricesPropertyReal estateStamp dutyFirst-time buyersnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a clear and deliberate business decision by TikTok that cost these four children their lives.”According to TikTok, searches for videos or hashtags related to the challenge have been blocked since 2020. The platform says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges, and aims to remove these before they are reported, as well as directing those who search for hashtags or videos to its safety centre.The complaint was filed in the superior court of the state of Delaware on behalf of Archie’s mother, Hollie Dance, Isaac’s mother, Lisa Kenevan, Jools’s mother, Ellen Roome, and Maia’s father, Liam Walsh.The lawsuit accuses TikTok of being “a dangerous and addictive product that markets itself as fun and safe for children, while lulling parents into a false sense of security”. It says TikTok “pushes dangerous prank and challenge videos to children based on their age and location in order to increase engagement time on the platform to generate higher revenues”.The lawsuit further claims that TikTok has told lawmakers around the world that the blackout challenge had never been on its platform and “works to discount credible reports of children being exposed to and dying because of blackout and similar challenge videos on the platform”. It notes that other dangerous challenges that have been found on TikTok include those involving medications, hot water and fire.The firm states that the parents believed TikTok was a “fun, silly and safe platform designed for kids and young people”, and claims that the children involved were “confident” and “well-behaved”, and did not have prior mental health problems.The Social Media Victims Law Center represents families who believe their children have been harmed by social media, and has filed several other lawsuits against TikTok over the deaths of children and young adults, including for promoting videos showing suicide, self-harm and eating disorder content.The law firm helped Tawainna Anderson sue the platform in 2022 after her 10-year-old daughter, Nylah, died after allegedly taking part in the blackout challenge. A US appeals court overturned a lower court’s dismissal of her case in August 2024.In February last year,a coroner ruledthat Archie had “died as a result of a prank or experiment gone wrong” at his home in Southend-on-Sea. He said he could not rule out the blackout challenge but noted that there were “hundreds of other possibilities”.Jools’s mother hascampaignedfor parents to be given the legal right to access their children’s social media accounts to help understand why they died, after she was left with no clues as to her son’s death in 2022.Changes to theOnline Safety Act, which come into force in the UK this year,explicitly requiresocial media companies to protect children from encountering dangerous stunts and challenges on their platforms, as well as to proactively prevent children from seeing the highest-risk forms of content.Explore more on these topicsTikTokSocial mediaChildrenDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The road is quiet, with busy traffic passing by at both ends but not cutting through, according to some parents, who said that even during rush-hour and school dropoff hardly any cars drove up the road. The children desperately needed the playground as many lived in flats, Bryant said.“I have given over two years of my time to try and get a new playground for the school. This is a lovely school and community and they make the best of the space they have. But the impact of not having proper space to play is compounded by the extreme deficiency in local play and green space … most of the children live in flats and it’s a mile to the nearest green space or tiny playground.”Bryant helped fundraise £100,000 to pay for the design and feasibility studies, £84,000 of which came from Westminster council itself through its community infrastructure levy.However, despite this, the council has advised against the playground going ahead, citing the protection of a view of the back of the grade 2-listed Clermont Hotel in Victoria, previously known as the Grosvenor, as one of the reasons.In a pre-planning advice letter, for which parents paid more than £2,000, a planning officer, wrote: “The existing size of the school’s playground is substandard … however the proposed benefits … would not outweigh the harm resulting from the loss of the public highway … and the disruption the playground would cause to the townscape.He added: “The playground extension is considered to harm the character and appearance of the conservation area and … of the grade 2* listed Grosvenor Hotel. This harm is likely to be ‘less than substantial’ … however, it would be at the upper end of this harm. Accordingly, such an application would not be viewed favourably.”The letter also stated: “The introduction of a netted sports court would contribute to a cluttered streetscape … [and] the parking bays on Lower Belgrave Street and the single yellow lines provided for loading are … well used and, therefore, we would find their loss to be unacceptable.”Benji, seven, waiting to go into school, said he was desperate for more space to play. “Sometimes I come out of school and ask if my friends can play but there is nowhere for us to meet so we can’t do it.”He said he did his best to play football in the space they had. “We do penalties in one corner. But if we had a big playground we could divide it up and there would be room for skipping, games, football. Then we could have a St Peter’s football team.”Asked if there was anywhere with space for running, Benji suggested: “You could run round the block?”His mother, Charlotte, said: “I have lived in Pimlico for 22 years. I work near here, my children are at school here, we want them at this school in their community. But they need space to play.”View image in fullscreenRebecca Bryant: ‘They have prioritised heritage and paid parking meters over the health and wellbeing of local children.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWestminster council told the Guardian: “The hotel view is not a primary concern or the reason that the council advised the proposed playground would not receive planning permission.“It would be lovely to extend the playground on to the highway, but it simply isn’t practical. This has been explained to the parents on a number of occasions including in writing following a formal approach. This is a busy area of central London, and the road is needed for traffic to access several office blocks, of which one is on a site allocated for the Crossrail 2 railway. It’s no place for a playground.”Bryant, however, said that it was “completely untrue” that the council had told the school that the playground would never be feasible. “If they had, they would have saved us – and the public purse – a huge amount of money. This comment bears no relation to the formal advice we received.”Last March, the scrutiny committee for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing andCommunitiesheld an inquiry into children, young people and the built environment.The MP Clive Betts chaired the inquiry, which took evidence from architects and planning experts as well as doctors and children and play experts on the lack of provision for children in planning. The committee disbanded before releasing its findings because of the general election.Betts said it was clear children’s needs should have better protection in planning. “We would have produced a scathing report if we had been able to.Childrenare almost forgotten. They are mentioned once in the national planning policy framework. If we can’t change this then we are going to design an environment that is not fit for future generations.”While Labour policy has recently focused on removing red tape in the hurry to build more new homes, Betts said that should not mean children were pushed to one side.He said: “This is not about delaying planning. I’m passionate about building more homes but we can’t have boxes on roads where the only thought is cars in and cars out. Children’s needs, their ability to move around and play, can’t be an afterthought, we need to provide for them properly.”Bryant said the council’s response showed a lack of consideration for children’s needs, voices and experiences within the planning system. He added: “I am a civil servant with experience of delivering infrastructure projects and I ensured that the planning and feasibility studies were done to the highest standard.“We analysed traffic, which showed there would be very little impact, and we have the support of the key neighbourhood groups. They have prioritised heritage and paid parking meters over the health and wellbeing of local children.”She pointed to a line in the planning advice that talked about people visiting the street to enjoy the view: “It says: ‘the proposed loss of the public access to the land … removes areas from which the public can appreciate views of the listed building’. This is a dusty wall at the back of a hotel we are talking about.”She added: “We met Deirdra Armsby, director of town planning, in person and she said she would look into it – we have since emailed her eight times and not had a single reply. Other senior councillors, including the leader of Westminster, Adam Hug, have not replied to us.”Westminster council did not respond to questions about the alleged lack of replies to the parents’ emails.This article was amended on 7 February 2025 to remove some personal information.Explore more on these topicsChildrenPlanning policySchoolsPrimary schoolsLocal governmentLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

China bought the site in 2018, but Tower Hamlets councilrefused planning permissionin 2022 citing a range of concerns, including the impact of large protests at the site. The Conservative governmentdeclined to intervene.Beijing resubmitted the application after Labour came to power and the government called it in after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, raised it directly with Keir Starmer. Cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and David Lammy have signalled their support for the proposal and a local inquiry hearing will begin next week.The proposed embassy is staunchly opposed by local residents, who are organising Saturday’s protest alongside campaign groups representing Uyghurs, Tibetans,Hong Kongersand Chinese dissidents.Several politicians including the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, shadow security minister, Tom Tugendhat, and Blair McDougall, the Labour MP for East Renfrewshire and member of the foreign affairs select committee, are due to address the demo.McDougall said: “We have to have red lines in our relations with Beijing. Currently Jimmy Lai, a British citizen, is in prison for exercising the rights that are guaranteed under the agreement between the UK andChina. of savings for British Hong Hongers have been stolen. We should not be doing any favours for Beijing while they are in breach of past deals.”Mark Nygate, the treasurer of the Royal Mint Court Residents Association, said residents were concerned that the embassy was being pushed through for political reasons without any regard to local people’s concerns. “We’re all unhappy with the way the government has gone about this process – it seems to have got involved and not allowed the inspector to do her bit,” he said.“They called for a public inquiry, appointed an inspector – and next thing you’ve got David Lammy and Yvette Cooper writing a letter to the council saying they would approve the scheme based on a couple of changes to the plan … But the damage that would be caused to my block and the estate is huge.”Organisers have informed the Metropolitan police that more than 1,000 people were expected to attend the demo, with coaches due to bring demonstrators from Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland.The Met lodged an objection to the project in November, warning that there was not enough space in front of the proposed embassy to safely accommodate more than 100 protesters and that demos on the site would impact local roads and risk public safety.However, the Met later withdrew its objection on the basis of a 2022 document submitted by the Chinese embassy, which estimated that nearly 2,000 could safely protest in front of the site and up to 4,500 people on the streets surrounding it.Tower Hamlets council,which restated its opposition to the proposal in December, has also now withdrawn its objection.Those involved in organising the protest include several Hong Kong campaign groups, the World Uyghur Congress, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China and the Global Alliance for Tibet and Persecuted Minorities.The organisers’ objective is to prove the Met was right originally to warn that the embassy would become a prime target for large protests that could not be safely accommodated. The planning inspector in charge of assessing the application has been invited to attend.A local inquiry into the plans will begin at the planning inspectorate on Tuesday and will sit for up to six days. The final decision rests with Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary.Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyProtestChinaLondonForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Netanyahuvisited Washington this weekand praised Trump as Israel’s “greatest friend”.View image in fullscreenKarim Khan, a British ICC prosecutor, is understood to be the first person targeted by the sanctions.Photograph: Marwan Ali/APThe US has not yet disclosed who will be sanctioned under the order, but four sources with knowledge of the situation said the ICC’s British chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, is the first and only individual to be targeted so far.Responding to the order on Friday, the ICC called on its 125 state parties to stand against the sanctions, describing Washington’s move as an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work”.Seventy-nine countries – including Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Mexico and Nigeria – released a joint letter that warned sanctions would “increase the risk of impunity for the most serious crimes and threaten to erode the international rule of law”.Longtime US allies have found themselves at odds with Washington, while the head of a leading global rights group called it “vindictive”.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said sanctions would “jeopardise an institution that is supposed to ensure that the dictators of this world cannot simply persecute people and start wars”.France said it would reaffirm its support for the ICC and mobilise with its partners so that the ICC could continue its mission. In London, a spokesperson for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said Britain supported the independence of the court.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the ICC gave “a voice to victims worldwide” and it “must be able to freely pursue the fight against global impunity”, while the main UN rights agency said Trump’s decision should be reversed.In his order, Trump said the ICC had “abused its power” by issuing the warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, which he claimed “set a dangerous precedent” that endangered US citizens and its military personnel. Netanyahu strongly applauded Trump’s move, calling it bold.View image in fullscreenIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) welcomed Trump’s sanctions.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APTrump’s predecessor Joe Biden acted as Israel’s most prominent international defender as it pursued a devastating war in Gaza, and called the ICC warrants issued in November “outrageous”.Trump, who used the term “Palestinian” as a slur during a campaign debate, has gone further,suggesting Gaza should be “cleaned out”.Earlier this week, Trump presenteda proposal for a US takeover of Gazathat would require the removal of about 2 million Palestinians to neighbouring countries, a plan lauded by Netanyahu butwidely condemned as a blueprint for ethnic cleansing.Egypt, which borders Gaza, intensified calls with Arab partners on Friday, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to stress its rejection of any measures aimed at displacing Palestinians, its foreign ministry said.Trump’s proposal has also thrown uncertainty over a fragile Gaza ceasefire deal that was reached last month.The ICC was established in 2002 to prosecute serious crimes committed by individuals when member states are unwilling or unable to do so themselves. While the US and Israel are not parties to the statute, their citizens can fall under its jurisdiction. Israel has other allies such as the UK, Germany and France who would be obliged to arrest Netanyahu if he were to travel to those countries.The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were approved by a three-judge panel elected by state parties, and an arrest warrant has also been issued forthe Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif, whose whereabouts is unknown. In 2021,the ICC ruled that it had jurisdiction in Palestineand could investigate crimes there, despite Israeli objections.Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said Trump’s order “sends the message that Israel is above the law and the universal principles of international justice”.She said on Thursday: “Today’s executive order is vindictive. It is aggressive. It is a brutal step that seeks to undermine and destroy what the international community has painstakingly constructed over decades, if not centuries: global rules that are applicable to everyone and aim to deliver justice for all.”The​ ICC​ has separatelyissued an arrest warrant for the ​Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children, andfor Russian officials related to missile strikes on civilian infrastructure.Ukraine said on Friday it hoped the ICC would continue its work on those cases. “We hope that they will not affect the court’s ability to achieve justice for the victims of Russian aggression,” said a foreign ministry spokesperson.After ICC judges issued the arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant in November,the court braced itself for retaliatory movesby the incoming Trump administration. Officials at the court, which is headquartered in The Hague, fear the sanctions could pose an existential threat to the judicial body.Emergency meetings were held on Friday among senior court officials to rapidly assess the implications of Trump’s order, which one official said had been written in such a way that it was “broad enough to be very disruptive for the court if [the US] wants it to be”.Among the issues alarming the court is a requirement in the order that within 60 days the US Treasury submits to Trump the names of “additional persons” to be targeted with sanctions. ICC sources said this would hang over the court and create considerable uncertainty for its staff, operations and access to services it depends on to function.Sanctions placed on Khan would severely hamper his day-to-day work at the court, former and current prosecution officials said. It is expected that Khan will have to be effectively ringfenced from certain cases and some of his staff. He would also be prevented from travelling to the US.In 2020, under a separate but similar executive order, Trump imposed travel bans and asset freezes onthe ICC’s former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, who is Gambian, as well as one of her top officials.The measures were launched in response to decisions made by Bensouda in war crime investigations in Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territories. At the time, Bensouda was conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of crimes committed by Israel’s armed forces and Hamas.In 2021, Bensouda upgraded the case to a formal criminal investigation. Khan inherited the inquiry and later accelerated it after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks and Israel’s ensuing destruction of Gaza.Israel is fighting a separate court case in the international court of justice, which adjudicates disputes between states, onallegations of genocide in Gaza, where it has killed nearly 50,000 people.Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump also signed orders to ban the legal recognition of transgender people by the US government.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead moreThe president’s push for a religious conservative alliance also bridged domestic and international spheres this week, with his new taskforce announcement paralleling thevisitof the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to Washington.At Blair House on Monday, Netanyahu met with key evangelical leaders, including the Christians United for Israel founder and pastor John Hagee and former governor Mike Huckabee – Trump’s ambassador-designate to Israel – drawing together Christian Zionists who form a critical geopolitical support network.These evangelical powerbrokers, who champion hardline annexation policies such asTrump’s surprise announcementto empty out and take ownership of Gaza, and reject traditional diplomatic language around the occupied Palestinian territories, represent a formidable political bloc through groups such as Christians United for Israel, which claimsmore than 10 million members.The recent executive order announcement takes direct aim at federal agencies including the FBI and IRS, which Trump accused of systematically targeting Christian believers. It includes the creation of a new White House faith office led by Trump’s longtime spiritual adviser, the televangelist Paula White.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is thought to be some kind of organic colouring.”An AFP journalist said the colour of the waters had faded by late on Thursday afternoon.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaRiversPollutionAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The group was bound for Alberta and made the journey in “incredibly cold” weather. A second group, composed of six adults from Jordan, Sudan, Chad and Mauritius, was found in a forest near Manitoba’s border with the US after an RCMP plane using thermal cameras detected them. Neither group had clothing suitable for the frigid conditions.View image in fullscreenAssistant Commissioner Lisa Moreland.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockMoreland said the people might have succumbed to a “heartbreaking situation” similar to the freezing death ofthe Patel family, the Indian couple who died alongside their toddler and 11-year-old near the border in 2022. “There’s the cross-border piece, but also the humanity piece,” she said. “[There have been] incidents where people did not make it.”Underscoring the deadly realities of the northern border in the winter, a man extradited from Canada was arraigned in New York state on human smuggling charges on Thursday over the death of a 33-year-old pregnant woman from Mexico. Searchers found footprints in the snow leading to a New York river, where Ana Vasquez-Flores drowned in December 2023.Ever since he was elected, Donald Trump has turned his focus to Canada’s border with the United States, alleging it is the source of vast amounts of fentanyl and illegal migration – neither of which is borne out by evidence.US Customs and Border Protection says 23,721 people were apprehended last fiscal year crossing its northern border, up from the 2,238 caught two years prior. But border agents made 1.5 million apprehensions at the border with Mexico last year.Still, to appease the president, Canada’s federal government has promised Trump C$1.3bn (US$900m) in spending along the border, including two Black Hawk helicopters and drones. Provincial premiers have also committed new resources. Earlier this year, Alberta’s premier, Danielle Smith, said her province would create a new sheriff patrol unit, with 50 armed sheriffs, 10 cold weather surveillance drones and several drug detection dogs at a cost of C$29m.Moreland said police were “doing our part to secure the border” but none of the apprehensions are linked to new border efforts.Trump’s victory last year – and a promise to enact the country’s largest mass deportation – initiallyprompted concern among political leaders in Canada that the country could experience a surge of immigrantsfleeing north and crossing unpatrolled areas of the 5,500-mile border –as happened during Trump’s first term.“What we saw in the days and weeks after Trump won was fearmongering,” said Abdulla Daoud of the Refugee Centre in Montreal. “And none of that – the idea that hundreds of thousands would come to the border – has ever come to fruition.”During Trump’s first term in office, tens of thousands of Haitians fled to Canada after the president ended temporary protected status for the group.In January 2017, Trudeau posted on social media: “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength#WelcomeToCanada.”Canadian minister says ‘not everyone is welcome’ amid Trump migrant threatRead moreIn 2022, nearly 40,000 people enteredCanadaat Roxham Road, an informal crossing in the forests of upstate New York that has become a political flashpoint in recent years. The following year, Canadaoverhauled an agreement with the United States on the border, in effect shutting down Roxham Road as a point of entry.The closure shut off irregular crossings but asylum claims at ports of entry have since increased. “The data shows that many of them – 83% – are successful in court. The majority of people coming to claim asylum are actually in danger and are seeking safety from persecution,” said Daoud.Even in the face of crackdowns and the threat of deportation, no notable uptick of irregular crossings into Canada has been recorded.Daoud said the wave of people that fled for Canada in 2017 were those using the United States as a transition because there was no way for them to claim asylum.“But now Trump is targeting individuals in the United States who have been there for decades. Some were even born there. It’s a totally different profile of person now.”Under the current rule, a person can make an asylum claim if they remain undetected in Canada for 14 days, incentivizing risky and possibly deadly crossings.“The current rules, and the landscape, are very much a deterrent to most people,” said Daoud. “But we’ll still see people crossing because the reality is, that it’s not a deterrent for those with no options left.”This article was amended on 7 February 2025. Justin Trudeau posted his #WelcomeToCanada message in January 2017 in response to the US entry ban on citizens from Muslim-majority countries, not Haitians as an earlier version suggested.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Khartoum has largely been in the control of the RSF since theopening salvoes of the warin April 2023.Battlefield updates indicate a shift in momentum, with one army source confirming its troops were “close to reaching the centre of Khartoum”.Babikir Elamin, the head of mission at the Sudanese embassy in London, said he expected the SAF to recapture the entire capital in a matter of days.He said: “There are just pockets [of RSF] in Khartoum, some in an area we call the eastern Nile. It will be a matter of days before Khartoum is cleared of RSF.”In nearby Omdurman, Sudan’s second largest city, home to about 2.4 million people, clashes have escalated including an incident last weekend in which the RSF killed at least 54 civilians in anattack on a market.Elamin said: “Omdurman is almost free of RSF and Khartoum North is free of RSF.”The war between the army and RSF has been calamitous for Africa’s third largest country, killing tens of thousands of people, forcing 12 million to leave their homes and pushing regions into famine. In Khartoum alone, at least 3.6 million residents have fled the violence.The battlefield developments come days after the Sudanese military broke an RSF siege of its headquarters in Khartoum, allowing the army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to visit for the first time since the war began.That in turn followed the SAF recentlyrecapturingthe strategically vital city of Wad Madani, the capital of Sudan’s breadbasket, about 110 miles (180km) south of Khartoum.The advances potentially set up the prospect of Darfur, thesprawling regionof western Sudan, providing the backdrop for the final battles of the war. Intelligence indicates that many of RSF fighters have already retreated to the western Darfur region, where the paramilitary group hails from.Except for the North Darfur capital, El Fasher, which is under sustained attack and siege by the RSF, the group controls the region.Last week, teams from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Darfur and Khartoum said they were coping with “mass influxes of war-wounded patients”, confirmation of the escalating violence in both areas.Experts say the dire humanitarian situation in Sudan will be amplified by Donald Trump’s intention toclose the US’s lead international aid agency, USAid.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Police have not said what type of weapon he used but they have said he had a licence to own four weapons, three of which were found beside him.“The horrific act of violence in Örebro raises several key questions about gun legislation,” the centre-right coalition government, which relies on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, said. As well as tightening legislation, it said it wanted to improve the way that people considered “medically unsuitable” for weapons possession were reported.“We have to ensure that only the right people have guns in Sweden,” Ulf Kristersson, Sweden’s prime minister, said during a visit to Latvia.On Friday police said identification was complete and that seven women and four men aged between 31 and 68 had died. They have not yet named the victims or the perpetrator, nor given the victims’ nationalities.The Guardian understands that the victims include a Syrian man, an Eritrean woman and an Iranian woman. Police areinvestigating whether the shooting was racially motivated.Swedish hunters, of whom there are hundreds of thousands, are able to apply for licences for semi-automatic weapons. In August 2023, the environmental protection agency lifted a ban on military-style models, meaning guns such as the AR-15 were permitted for hunting.The government said on Friday it wanted to reimpose restrictions that existed before 2023 and develop a strategy to seize military-style weapons. “The AR-15 is an example of a weapon that is compatible with large magazines and can cause a lot of damage in a short time,” it said.The government said a recent report found that several of the requirements that should be taken into account when assessing a person’s suitability for a weapons permit were not clearly stated in weapons regulations, and that they should be set out in law. These include age, knowledge, skills, some medical factors and how law-abiding a person is.It also plans to add provisions on doctors’ reporting obligations in relation to weapons and the police’s ability to revoke permits.The main opposition party, the Social Democrats, welcomed the government’s announcement but called for all weapons licences to be reviewed. It also said there should be a review of how registers between authorities were cross-checked.The decision has attracted public criticism from several high-profile Sweden Democrats.The Syrian embassy in Stockholm has said its citizens were among the dead.The suspect, who apparently killed himself, has been named in media reports as Rickard Andersson, 35, aformer student of the school, who lived locally. He is understood to have attended maths classes at the school a few years ago and had been unemployed for a decade.Among the victims was Salim Iskef, 28, who phoned his fiancee, Kareen Elia, 24, from the school and told her he had been shot. “He called me and said: ‘I’ve been shot, they shot us.’ He said he loves me and that’s the last thing I heard,” she said in an interview.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Members of their church said there was standing room only at a memorial service for Iskef on Thursday night.Fr Jacob Kasselia, a priest at St Maria Örebro, the Syrian Orthodox church attended by Iskef, said the community was reeling. “We have our doors open for everybody. You can see that everybody is affected. A dark cloud has come over us all. But despite that we say that we must look for the light,” he said.Kasselia said he knew of two others who had been killed. One, he said, was a woman from Eritrea, who looked after her four children alone, and the other was a middle-aged woman from Iran.The number of non-Swedish victims would affect Örebro and the whole country, said Kasselia, who went to the remembrance service attended by the prime minister and the king and queen on Wednesday. “It is dark over us all.”The Bosnian Islamic Community in Örebro said the organisation had been advised to increase security since the shootings and had hired security guards to watch the mosque.Elia Xincher, 20, a student and member of a Syrian Orthodox church young people’s association, said many of its members went to Campus Risbergska to improve their grades so they could go to university or increase their employment prospects.Some of his friends had been forced to hide in a classroom during the attack. “I saw one of them yesterday and still to this day she is shaking,” he said. “You cannot forget about it for your whole life.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenGun crimeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His appeal against this judgment wasrejected by France’s highest court in December, leading to the fitting of the electronic tag at his home on Friday.Sarkozy, who has been forced to cancel all evening and foreign engagements, has said he will make a final appeal to the European court of human rights, but this does not delay the verdict from being carried out. If he wishes to go abroad during the next 12 months he will have to ask for authorisation from the court.It is the first time a former president has been electronically tagged. Sarkozy, who ledFrancebetween 2007 and 2012, is also on trial over allegations he received millions of euros in illegal campaign funding from Gaddafi. The trial follows a 10-year anti-corruption investigation.His predecessor, Jacques Chirac, who died in 2019, wasgiven a two-year suspended sentence in 2011for having overseen a fake jobs scam at Paris city hall when he was mayor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The case will continue in Washington DC on Friday when the district court judge Jia Cobb will determine whether to extenda temporary order.Bove,in an emailon Wednesday, said the purpose of requesting the information was not for retaliation, but to ensure proper procedures and practices were followed during the course of the investigations.“Let me be clear: No FBI employee who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to January 6 investigations is at risk of termination or other penalties,” he wrote.“The only individuals who should be concerned about the process initiated by my January 31, 2025, memo are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent, who blatantly defied orders from department leadership, or who exercised discretion in weaponizing the FBI.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Intelligence officials in South Korea said about 300 North Koreans had been killed and about 2,700 wounded. In January the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, posted a clip showingtwo captured North Korean soldiers, one of whom said his commanders had told him he was being sent on a “training exercise”.Suicides, new tactics and propaganda iPads: details from captured North Koreans expose new foe in UkraineRead moreThe North’s soldiers, who had not seen combat before being deployed, were said to have been unprepared for the harsh realities of warfare in unfamiliar terrain and particularly vulnerable to Ukrainian drones.Intelligence officials in the South claimed notes had been found on dead North Korean soldiers indicating that the regime expected them to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner.The arrival of North Korean troops triggered fears that the war could take a dangerous turn for Ukraine, amid claims by military officials in South Korea that the regime in Pyongyang waspreparing to send even more troops.In return for sending personnel, weapons and ammunition, the North is hoping to gain access to sophisticated Russian satellite technology and earn foreign currency to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.The South’s intelligence service said the large number of casualties was a factor in the apparent decision to withdraw North Korean soldiers from Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive in August 2024.Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington estimated this week that as many as half of the North Korean troops sent toUkrainehad been killed or injured in Russia’s “war of attrition”.“The casualty rates were significant,” Jones said during a podcast appearance, according to the Yonhap news agency. “By most accounts we were able to take a look at somewhere between a third and probably on the real high end, maybe 50% casualties among the North Korean forces.“Again, [it’s] hard to know exactly what reality is … with as many as 1,000 killed. Those are pretty staggering casualties for a force of 11,000 [to] 12,000.”North Korea has not publicly acknowledged its role in the war, but in October Putin did not deny that the North’s forces had arrived in Russia. North Korean vice-foreign minister Kim Jong-gyu said any such deployment would be in line with international law.Explore more on these topicsUkraineNorth KoreaRussiaAsia PacificEuropeShareReuse this content"

Leoni, 41, recently described herself as being of the “CK One generation”.Some of the standout looks featured a slim silhouette that felt fresh – black trousers and shrunken jumpers over shirts that recalled Gwyneth Paltrow’s officewear in Sliding Doors. The moodboard for the collection included photographs of David Byrne, whose influence was felt in oversized shoulders, and Paltrow and Brad Pitt as a couple in the 90s.New York fashion week, which began on Thursday, has the unenviable task of bringing cheer and glamour to a fretful city reeling fromthe chaos of Donald Trump’s first weeks as president.The brand has felt the impact directly. This week its parent company, PVH – which also owns Tommy Hilfiger – was blacklisted by China in a retaliatory action afterTrump imposed a 10% tariff. The results of this action are unclear, but they could include fines and shutdowns. About 18% of PVH’s suppliers and factories, and 6% of its sales, are in the region.Little known outside fashion, Leoni – who is Italian and lives in Rome with her wife – has never led a major house, but has an impressive CV working among fashion’s most influential minimalists, including Jil Sander, The Row, and CELINE, under Phoebe Philo.She launched her own brand, Quira, in 2021.Like many who grew up outside the US, she said she had a fictional view of the country, and of New York specifically, gleaned from movies and media before she ever visited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I feel that these kind of moments help to shape a variety of personalities.”Klein, who founded his company in 1968 and who has kept a relatively low profile since he retired from it in 2004, told her after that he was happy with her collection and that “he found a new coat to buy”.The brand’s most recent show, before its catwalk hiatus,took place in 2018, underthe Belgian designer Raf Simons, now co-designing at Prada. At the time, Simons found inspiration in the horrors of the first Trump administration,presenting a dark view of Americana. This time, its rather more upbeat interpretation of American style was based on a seductive and much longed-for fiction.Explore more on these topicsNew York fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

Joe Wright’s Italian-language TV adaptation ofAntonio Scurati’s novel, which has just arrived in full on Sky and Now, is a world away from the fuzzy VHS recordings of old war documentaries that served as the multimedia element of many of our GCSE history classes.Following Il Duce’s faltering first steps towards domination, from establishing his fascist party, through the March on Rome to the installation of a dictatorship in Italy, Wright’s eight-part drama has the fidgety energy of a student trying to make history more exciting and cool. “What if the scene where blackshirted goons violently attack that socialist paper was shot in a stylised, Tarantino-ish way?”; “Could we replace the characters with puppets here?”; “Wouldn’t it be cool if Mussolini played with a grenade on his desk in this scene?”; “How about we soundtrack the whole thing with frenetic big beatscored by one of the Chemical Brothers?”Amazingly, for the most part this approach works well. The restlessness of Wright’s direction feels suited to the roiling, change-filled era of Italian history it depicts, when socialism and fascism were vying to usurp the old order, and all manner of literary, technological andartistic movementswere bubbling up. At the centre of this circus is Luca Marinelli’s spectacular performance as Mussolini, a fourth-wall-breaking narrator-lead who seems as interested in convincing the TV audience of fascism’s charms as he is the Italian public. This Mussolini seems more than a little inspired by the TV antiheroes of the past two decades, men who carried us along for the ride as they did terrible things: a dash of Walter White’s sociopathy and scheming here; a sprinkling of Tony Soprano’s brutishness and brittle self-doubt there – not to mention his hairline too.Framing Mussolini in such a way is a high risk strategy. One of the less enjoyable aspects of TV’s golden age were thebad fans, viewers who cheered on TV’s antiheroes in their worst moments. On its release Scurati’s novel, which uses historical documents alongside Mussolini’s omniscient narration to retell the tale of the rise of fascism through its instigator’s eyes,was criticised by some historiansfor “resurrecting the cult of the leader” at a time when the far-right was making gains in Italy. It’s hard not to imagine the same criticism being levelled at Wright’s adaptation (though it should be said that Italian reviews have been unanimously glowing so far).View image in fullscreenLuca Marinelli sporting Tony Soprano’s hairline.Photograph: Andrea Pirrello/Sky ItalyFor his part, Wright hasspoken in interviewsof the need for the audience to feel “seduced” by Mussolini, to grasp how a nation might have fallen under his sway. And certainly the series is at pains to undercut its lead character’s stump speeches at every opportunity: Mussolini is portrayed as pompous and craven, ready to sell out his fellow fascists whenever the movement looks like it is about to go south. The cruelty and brutality of that movement is shown in unflinching detail. As it moves from violent rabble to terrifyingly efficient force, uncomfortable parallels with recent violent rabbles-turned-terrifyingly efficient forces will be felt.Son of the Century arrives on our screens at an interesting cultural moment. The past decade of populist and far-right political movements have brought ideas and figures considered fringe or extreme closer to the mainstream:people like Curtis Yarvin, a previously obscure US “neoreactionary” thinker who yearns for the replacement of liberal democracy with a “form of one-man rule: halfway … between monarchy and tyranny” (vice-president JD Vance is reportedly a fan). The question for that mainstream, has been whether to go with option one: continue treating these ideas and figures as fringe and extreme – to “no-platform” them, in essence; or option two: contend with them, but risk giving them oxygen to grow.For much of the past decade, it has felt like option one had won out. But then came Donald Trump’s re-election in November, and with it the feeling that ignoring these fringe figures and ideas had either had no effect, or had been actively counterproductive. So now some are feeling it might be time to try option two. A case in point: on the eve of Trump’s election the New York Timespublished an interview with Yarvin, arguing that “given that [his ideas] are now finding an audience with some of the most powerful people in the country, Yarvin can’t be so easily dismissed anymore”. Son of the Century too has more than a little of option two about it, reckoning with fascism in a way that some will find illuminating and others will feel is potentially dangerous. It feels emblematic of a new, charged cultural era.I wonder though if Son of the Century also signals something else: the definitive demise of the antihero drama. The TV zeitgeist already seems tohave largely shifted awayfrom the exploits of morally dubious men in the past few years – though Taylor Sheridan seems to be on a (actually pretty successful) crusade to keep them alive. But when a figure of such historical, outsized horror is being given the antihero drama treatment, where does the genre have left to go, what new moral depths does it have plumb?Vince Gilligan, Breaking Bad’s creator, used to describe the journey of Walter White, from cheery chemistry teacher to ruthless drug lord, as progressing from “Mr Chips to Scarface”.

Katsiaryna Snytsina was a star Belarusian athlete – but when she protested againsther country’s 2020 electionon social media she was excoriated by the Lukashenko regime. And when she then came out, she was labelled an “extremist lesbian”.Belarus Free Theatre now operate in exile, their productions ranging from agitprop to opera. Natalia Kaliada, who directs this show with Nicolai Khalezin, describes their method as “immersing ourselves into the pain of the world”, to expose oppression and dream of freedom.View image in fullscreenPlayful … Katsiaryna Snytsina in KS6: Small Forward.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe small stage sports the lines and hoop of a basketball court, and a talkshow’s snug chairs. The format cuts between Snytsina’s final professional match last year and a TV studio interview. It’s merrily messy – as well as an onstage DJ and live camera, there’s also a pop quiz, kiss cam, bubble machine and a basketball challenge for three game audience members.Tall and sculptural, Snytsina brings a rangy authenticity as she relates her Soviet childhood and pro career. It’s a pleasure to watch her deftly handle the ball and lope around the stage (movement direction by Javier de Frutos). But she’s also playful with her lived experience – turning her coming out tale into a standup routine or sending herself up when she misses a throw.Music and sound design are by DJ Blanka Barbara, bopping behind the mixing desk. Like the production’s bubble machines, the carefree energy mirrors young Katya’s absorption in sport. But the bubble of professional basketball creates an illusory, apolitical freedom – Snytsina didn’t vote, didn’t track her country’s slide into dictatorship, until she could ignore it no longer. Once she played small forward on the basketball court – now each opportunity to raise awareness is another small step.We often see the athlete training using resistance bands – promising release but then yanking her back. This is no straight-arrow story – Snytsina’s fitful sporting progress, her avowals of political and sexual identities, are matched by the purposefully busy production. The journey from athlete to activist isn’t a smooth ride, but it’s a captivating one.Atthe Pit, Barbican, London, until 8 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBelarus Free TheatreBarbicanBelarusreviewsShareReuse this content"

My life depended on it’Lyndsey WinshipBallet has always been more than just a job for Carlos Acosta. And as director of Birmingham Royal Ballet, he is trying to make it bigger than ever – even in the face of brutal cuts and the tragic death of its CEOFri 7 Feb 2025 09.33 ESTShare“Gone are the times when you used to just create for your own indulgence,” says Carlos Acosta. Now, when it comes to running a major ballet company, and keeping it afloat, “You have to learn from your audience.”Acosta has always been a crowd-pleaser, ever since he took the top prize at the famous Prix de Lausanne competition in 1990, the auditorium erupting in cheers at the then 16-year-old Cuban’s Don Quixote solo. He went on to fire up adoring audiences around the world, settling at London’s Royal Ballet for 17 years, but making global guest appearances as one of the few genuine ballet superstars.He’s talking to me from a very unstarry grey office in Birmingham. But even the unflattering rectangle of a video call can’t dampen his crinkle-eyed smile, and down-to-earth magnetism. He’s been running Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB) for exactly five years, and just renewed his contract, so despite all his other projects (the Acosta Danza company in Havana andAcosta Dance Centrein Woolwich, south London, among them) he’s committed to the precarious business of helping ballet thrive in the Midlands. More precarious since Birmingham City Council announcedit was slashingits arts budget entirely, hence the concern with a healthy box office as well as artistic integrity.View image in fullscreenOn the move… Black Sabbath: The Ballet at Birmingham Royal Ballet.Photograph: Johan PerssonBut that needn’t always mean playing it safe. Acosta has made it his business to make bold artistic choices, commissioning surprising new works and choreographers, and making headlines with the collision of heavy metal and pointe shoes that wasBlack Sabbath: The Ballet, which tours to the US this summer and has just announced another UK tour in 2026. He pushes his dancers to be crowdpleasers, too. “From day one I said: ‘This has to be a company of virtuosos,’” he says, looking for the kind of fireworks that make classical ballet a mainstream entertainment in his home country. “I want personalities, ‘Look at me!’ – that’s how I like it. I want dancers that are exceptional, and I think we are getting there.” He’s right that there is great talent in the company, although I’m sad they’ve lost the beautiful Eric Pinto Cata to Paris Opera Ballet.The company has just headed out on tour, dancing Cinderella. It’s not the most groundbreaking of their rep, but as Acosta says, “It’s one of the most popular ballets. The version we have [by BRB’s former artistic director David Bintley, from 2010] is different to any other Cinderella out there, very bold in scale, it’s a really great show.” Bintley’s Cinderella has inspired designs by John Macfarlane – a painterly backdrop of a starry sky and giant clockwork cogs – along with the usual comic ugly sisters, magical transformations and rogue glass slipper.In Birmingham, they’ll be staging a “relaxed” show, for audiences with different access needs, making good on the aim of ballet being for everyone. Among other adjustments, the first act of the show will be replaced with a spoken introduction to the story, before going straight into act two. That’s what I want at the ballet sometimes, I say to Acosta, just to cut to the action. “Instead of sitting there for three hours,” he laughs, with the love of someone who has dedicated their whole life to this art form.Ballet has given Acosta a life he could never have dreamed of, growing up in an impoverished family of 11 kids in Havana. His story’s been told many times, pushed reluctantly to classes at Cuba’s esteemed, state-funded NationalBalletSchool by his truck driver dad, to keep him out of trouble. After a shaky start, Acosta knuckled down and then he soared. “Some dancers see it as a job. Others view dance as a necessity. For me it was salvation,” says Acosta. “My life depended on it. I was in a very bad place socially and the only way forward was to succeed at all costs. I understood that I had this talent and I began to really, really hammer it. It consumed every aspect of my life.”The company is takingCinderellaon tour to Japan this summer, a country where Acosta has many fans. “They absolutely love classical ballet. It’s like no other place,” he says. And the fans really show their love. “I don’t know how they find out the hotel address but when you arrive everyone’s waiting for you with posters and DVDs to sign and running after you. It’s quite remarkable. And they give you presents – I remember a really expensive watch,” he marvels. “So in other words, we like Japan a lot,” he smiles.To be fair, BRB has been getting a pretty good reception at home recently (luxury watches notwithstanding) with record ticket sales for Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty and the Nutcracker. A second company of younger dancers, BRB2, is going from strength to strength. The main troupe performed on Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage last year, which this newspaper saidwas reaching“towards the best of what humanity can do and be”.View image in fullscreenAspiring … Don Quixote at Birmingham Royal Ballet.Photograph: Johan PerssonBut in the midst of all these highs, the company has been hit by a huge emotional blow: the death of CEO Caroline Miller in December, from cancer, just before her 53rd birthday. “It’s left a void,” Acosta says, telling me he keeps expecting Miller to walk in any moment, in her blue coat, bubbling with new ideas as she always was. “To come to terms with the fact that’s not going to happen again, it’s tough.” It was Miller’s very savvy idea to recruit Acosta, and they made a great team. She gave him the confidence he needed to direct a company of this scale, but beyond operational expertise, “she would fight for the art at all costs,” he says. “And sometimes she got a lot of heat for that.”Before going to BRB, Miller had led the industry body OneDanceUK, and was well known across the dance world as an ebullient woman of unstoppable can-do spirit. “She was an enthusiast, like I am,” Acosta says. “I’m always dreaming the impossible, and she did as well. She would dream with me. She would never say, ‘We can’t do that.’” Instead she would find a way to make it happen. “She was so positive. You would be dwelling on the negative and she’d come and say: ‘Yes, but on the other hand …’ and just lift you up.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But she wanted to carry on and fight for the company. Her passion was this company; she was so proud of the dancers. Somebody like her is very rare to find.” BRB will be dedicating a gala of dances by the choreographer Frederick Ashton to Miller, at Birmingham’s Symphony Hall, later this month.View image in fullscreen‘She would dream with me’ … Caroline Miller and Carlos Acosta.Photograph: Maja SmiejkowskaAcosta and the company now have to find a way to move forward without Miller. The 2025-26seasonhas just been announced, and as well as the Black Sabbath tour, there’ll be Acosta’s own production ofDon Quixote, full of sunny fun and Latin spirit, and a triple-bill of 20th-century classics. Acosta is in talks to present Kurt Jooss’s classic The Green Table, from 1932, a powerful depiction of the futility of war but little seen these days. “An entire generation of people don’t know this important masterpiece exists,” he says. “And it has this anti-war message that is very necessary at this point.”Acosta also has something exciting brewing for later in 2026, which should appeal to fans of the classics and those hankering for something new – but that’s all under wraps for now. Whether they’re dancing a new creation or injecting energy into a classic, “ballet is a living art form”, says Acosta. “Whatever we do, we have to make a difference. Caroline understood that.”Cinderella is at the Mayflower theatre, Southampton,8 February; touring to 29 March. Ashton Classics is at Symphony Hall, Birmingham,15 February.BRB’s 2025/26 season is on sale soon.Explore more on these topicsBirmingham Royal BalletBalletDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Quick to write and cheap to make, films like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, Cherry Falls and Valentine trotted out slightly different variations on the same formula (masked killer, WB channel teens) until the films became dumber than the ones Scream had been targeting in the first place.Companion review – empty sci-fi thriller short-circuits too quicklyRead moreIt tracks then that after a Ghostface reboot, with 2022’s surprisingly successful fifth instalment, the same would happen once again. Heart Eyes, a film that boasts the same production company and one of its stars, is exactly what an exec would give an easy greenlight to, an easily sellable “if you liked” knock-off. But whatever might have made sense on paper just doesn’t translate to screen, a fun little concept that ends up being something of a drag.Like the aforementioned Valentine, a 2001 also-ran that saw a group of one-time high school mean girls targeted by the guy they once bullied, Heart Eyes is set on the most romantic day of the year. It’s a date that had been traditionally used by studios as an obvious romcom launchpad but this year, it’s attracted the opposite from the sexbot-gone-wrong sci-fi comedyCompanionto fighting exes actionerLove Hurtsto ghosting horrorThe Dead Thingto toxic relationship taleI Love You Forever. Heart Eyes exists somewhere between a romantic comedy and a horror, skewering the structure of the meet-cute with the inclusion of a serial killer hunting the boy who’s just met the girl.The killer only targets couples and in a rubbishy, red-flag-raising cold open, we see an Instagram-obsessed pair stage a cheesy proposal at a vineyard before getting slaughtered. Each year lands him (or her) in a different city and it’s finally time for Seattle or at least the New Zealand-filmed approximation of Seattle (with bit parts also played by uneasily accented locals, it’s a clearly non-American American movie). Ally (Olivia Holt) is very OK with having no date for the big day, turning her nose up at Valentine’s expectations, too focused on her job at an advertising firm to have time for distraction. It’s there where she meets the handsome and far more romantically inclined freelancer Jay (Scream’s Mason Gooding) who she has to work with for the day before he flies off to his best friend’s wedding. It’s Hallmark 101 but the script, from Phillip Murphy, Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy, isn’t smart or witty enough to do much more than just recycle cliches and point at them, and the synthetic romcom world they’re in never as exaggerated or fun as it was in high-concept Rebel Wilson parody Isn’t It Romantic (the eye-rollingly stupid behaviour by pretty much every character edges the film closer to a horror spoof).There are laughs to be mined from their burgeoning romance being underplayed to evade a killer who only wants to butcher those in love but the comedy here is far too broad, misfiring to the point of frequent embarrassment (the cops on the trail are called Hobbs and Shaw because, you know, the film Hobbs and Shaw, end of joke). Landon and Kennedy previously found just the right balance of comedy and horror in 2020’s underseenFreaky(a film that also managed some brief moments of real emotion) but they’re flailing here, the script a closer cousin to Kennedy’s shoddy, critically reviled Netflix horrorTime Cut. If the romance is uninvolving (Gooding is charming but Holt indistinctive, characterisation starts and ends with limp “When I was a kid” monologuing) and the comedy aggressively unfunny then it’s left to the horror to impress, and director Josh Ruben does deliver on some inventive gore but it feels discordant in a film that would be best enjoyed by very young, very undiscerning high schoolers (he’s also, like many other genre directors today, unable to generate suspense). Like Riverdale before it, Heart Eyes employs some ex-teen stars to wink at those of us who remembered the last cycle (The Faculty’s Jordana Brewster and Final Destination’s Devon Sawa) but the film pales in comparison with even the weakest of that era, devolving into a finale of predictable who-cares reveals.No one expects, or wants, every slasher to emulate the snappy self-aware snark of Scream but Ruben isn’t even able to conjure up the fun of something with far less expectation attached. I was reminded of Eli Roth’sThanksgiving– another back-to-basics holiday-based horror with the 00s on its mind – which was the kind of low-stakes, high-reward jolt that I would happily see more of in this era of slasher re-emergence, a film made with real affection for the genre. There’s very little love to be found here.Heart Eyes is now in US cinemas and will be out in the UK on 14 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsComedy filmsComedyThrillersRomance filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Drama costs have risen exponentially.“Until just after the pandemic there was a model that had evolved where the public service broadcasters could keep up to a certain level, where shows didn’t cost the earth to make. That model continues to work in some areas of the business.“I am ever the optimist. We have got to try and reset and work out a way to build slates that are sustainable, rather than one show that costs a fortune, making it impossible to see other shows through.”For nearly a decade after the international rollout of the streaming giants,led by Netflix in 2012, the industryfeasted on huge investmentin the battle to build a content arsenal of expensive shows to build global scale, which dramatically inflated the production costs of high-end TV shows in particular.Despite the competitive pressure that came with rivals entering thefight for viewers and subscribers, broadcasters’ programme-making aspirations benefited handsomely from deals with deep-pocketed streamers, such as the funding deal struck by Netflix totake the BBC hit Peaky Blinders globalin 2014.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Zephaniah and Aidan Gillen in Peaky Blinders.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThat year – just two years afterNetflixlaunched in the UK – the high-end TV production market was worth £640m, with just 30 shows classified as funded or co-funded by streamers.By the peak of the streaming wars in 2022, fuelled by the race to restock content post-Covid, the premium TV market wasworth £5.1bn, with almost 160 productions attributed to streamer funding or co-funding.Since then, almost £2bn in annual spend has disappeared, although the latest BFI figuresshow a slight uptickto £3.4bn last year, as the streamers have cut back on profligate spending tofocus on profitability.“What we are seeing is a fall from the point of peak drama, but there is still more than has ever been made, and it is of the highest quality,” says Wayne Garvie, the president of international production at Sony PicturesTelevision, the parent of producers behind shows including The Crown, Outlander and Cobra Kai.UK broadcasters, already struggling under high-end TV production costs of as much as £5m an hour, have tightened commissioning spend amid anadvertising downturnand significant cost increases due to soaring UK inflation. The BBC has also had to contend with several years of a frozen licence fee.View image in fullscreenClaire Foy and Matt Smith in The Crown.Photograph: Coco Van Oppens/NetflixTheimpact on the UK production sectorhas been brutal, with many smaller producers either shutting, merging with others or struggling to remain financially afloat in the hope the market will recover.“The mantra last year was‘survive until 2025’,” says one production company executive. “Now it’s ‘hang in there until 2026’. It’s pretty bad out there.”As US streamers take a circumspect approach to funding, with a sharp focus on owning all rights to shows exclusively, the market may take years to rebound to the post-pandemic peak.“There is a short-term, immediate problem at the moment because it is difficult to get that all-important American pre-sale,” says Garvie. “And post the Hollywood strikes, and with streamers seeking sustainable profitability, there is a moment of reflection that is creating pressure on British-made dramas. American sales have dried up, that is the biggest problem. But I think that will change in the next year to 18 months as British content is of a very high standard and there will still be a demand for it.”Industry figures including Featherstone and Jane Tranter, a co-founder of Bad Wolf, which makes shows including His Dark Materials and Doctor Who, have called for alterations to the existing “blunt tool” tax credit for high-end TV to relieve the cost-of-production pressure.View image in fullscreenNcuti Gatwa, Nicola Coughlan and Jonathan Aris in the 2024 Doctor Who Christmas special.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC StudiosLast year the government announced anew enhanced tax creditfor independent film productions up to £15m, to support a sector that has produced lower-budget films such as The King’s Speech, The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire, as that sector focuses ever more on mega-budget blockbusters.However, one industry source said the government would have to think carefully about “intervening to sustain inflation” in the high-end TV market. They suggested perhaps a focus on production incentives for £2m- to £3m-an-hour projects that fall in the mid-range of the current market expectation for making premium TV content.Despite the current trials, tribulations and financial pressures, Garvie says there is no question the UK is still riding high on the premium drama boom instigated by the global streamers.“If you’d have said to drama producers 20 years ago, when reality TV formats ruled the world, that we would be in a business today where free-to-air broadcasters would be able to make as much high-quality drama as they do, and that international streamers would pay Hollywood budgets and distribute shows around the world but that you would keep the rights, broadcasters would have bitten your hand off.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryTV streamingBBCITV plcChannel 4NetflixWolf HallfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is how to harness its power for goodElle HuntFri 7 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 10.04 ESTShareIt’s safe to say Pope Francis is not a fan of gossip. Just before Christmas, in one of his final public appearances of 2024, he declared it “an evil that destroys social life, sickens people’s hearts and leads to nothing … gossip is zero”. Beyond the Vatican, however, gossip’s bad reputation is being reassessed.Last year a study in the USfound that gossip evolved to help social groups function, by spreading useful information about individual members and encouraging cooperation. Researchers also found that people spend approximately an hour every day gossiping – and that “almost everyone” does it.Far from it being the preserve of “small minds”, as the (annoying) adage goes, it seems that gossip is a natural social behaviour, with potential benefits. There are, however, good and bad ways of going about it. We asked experts about how to gossip smarter.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Eiko OjalaShould youtry to gossip less – or abstain altogether?“I don’t think it’s possible to stop people from gossiping,” says Frank McAndrew, a professor of psychology at Knox College, Illinois. “It’s a part of who we are, like eating or breathing. I can’t tell you how many times people will say to me, ‘I don’t gossip’,” he says, explaining that many think of it as “something other people do” while they are merely “expressing concern” or sharing important information.In truth, much gossip is either inconsequential “or actually does some good”. McAndrew suggests that gossip is best understood not as a character flaw, or a bad habit you should be striving to kick, but as a social skill. “It’s not whether you do it or not – it’s whether you do it well, or not.”What distinguishes a good gossip from a bad one?“Good gossipers are usually pretty popular,” says McAndrew. Their intel on others makes them desirable company, but they also exercise good judgment in portioning it out. That is how they are able to be so in-the-know, he continues: “They have a reputation for being discreet; they don’t use it in a reckless, nasty sort of way.”Less effective gossipers are either careless, sharing “everything that they know, to anyone who will listen” with no mind to their audience, or the potential risks and consequences – or are obviously self-serving, “talking badly about other people so that they can get ahead”, says McAndrew.What is the safest kind of gossip to share?Though gossip is usually negative, it doesn’t have to be. Maria Kakarika, an associate professor at Durham University Business School, recommends practising “positive gossip” – either complimenting people behind their backs or recounting their good deeds.Not only does this counter the negativity bias of much back-channel communication (which can make situations seem worse than they are), it reflects well on the gossiper. “You’re perceived in the minds of others as someone positive,” says Kakarika.This is particularly important in the workplace. A study Kakarika conducted last year found thatoffice gossips were generally viewed negatively, and their behaviour can effect their career progression.An exception was “when the purpose of gossip is to benefit the group”, she says – for example, sounding the alarm on workplace wrongdoers or free-riders.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Eiko Ojala/The GuardianShould you ever act on gossip?For organisations, gossip can contain useful data and even raise awareness of looming issues or risks.Kathryn Waddington, an emerita fellow in psychology at the University of Westminster and author of Gossip, Organization and Work: A Research Overview, quotes a Native American proverb: “Listen to the whispers and you won’t have to hear the screams.”If the information being shared is recurring, and from several sources, it’s worth looking into with an open mind, Waddington suggests. “Sometimes it’s actually quite useful to know what the gossip about you is.” But not all of it will be high quality or “pure”, Waddington adds: “You need to know your dealer.”Similarly, it’s important not to lose sight of the risks: “The potential for gossip to harm should never, ever be overlooked.”How can you gossip for the greater good?As far back as biblical times, gossip has been gendered as a female behaviour – though men do it too, says Waddington. “What do you think you’re doing when you go down the pub with your mates on a Wednesday night?”McAndrew says there is evidence that gossip has greater currency for women than it does for men, and that women are more likely to use it aggressively – to ostracise people from social groups or get an advantage on rivals. But “that’s not to say that women are nastier than men”, he adds. Rather, it reflects them making use of what little power they have historically had.In the past, understanding who could be trusted, and who was connected to whom and how, was key to women’s survival. “It became an essential skill and currency in a way that it just didn’t for men,” McAndrew says.That remains the case today. The predatory behaviour of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby was rumoured long before they were brought to justice. In the office environment, a new female employee might be told by other women to watch out for certain male co-workers, says McAndrew. “It might be seen as negative, nasty gossip – but it’s actually serving to protect.” Similarly, gossip can highlight workplace inequity, such as if one person is being paid much more than another in the same role. “It can be a way of levelling the playing field – of dealing with power.”Does it matter who you gossip with?One function of gossip is as a social glue, says McAndrew: “If I’m sharing sensitive information with you, what I’m really saying is, ‘I’m trusting you not to use this information in a way that’s going to cause trouble, for me or for others’.”That creates and strengthens bonds – but it also creates an expectation of reciprocity, he adds: “There’s pressure on you to share something back, for our relationship to move forward.”Who we choose to gossip with, and about, can be just as revealing of ourselves. Someone spilling about their best friend to casual acquaintances, for instance, may come across as two-faced – but two best friends blowing off steam about the third in their trio can trust in their mutual understanding.The more intimately we are connected to the person we are gossiping about, the higher the stakes, says McAndrew. “If I’m saying things about my wife to co-workers that I don’t know well, that should be a red flag, because I’m betraying a confidence to someone I’m supposed to be protecting.”What are the gossiping ground rules?Although our penchant for gossip goes back to the days we were hunter-gatherers, we now use different tools. And “that’s what causes a lot of the trouble”, says McAndrew. Before digital communication and social media, gossip “would travel slowly”. Now, compromising material can be shared instantaneously, unthinkingly and to large audiences. “The damage gets done much more quickly,” he says.Even screenshots and other “receipts”, posing as crystal-clear proof, can easily be misinterpreted. Limiting your gossiping to in-person offers a level of protection, as well as more opportunities to communicate context and tone.Similarly, McAndrew advises exercising caution when mixing gossip with alcohol: “In a situation where your guard is down and your inhibitions are lifted, you’re at greater risk. You may not remember exactly what you said to who, or be aware that you did something you shouldn’t have.”What can you do when you get caught out?The best course of action – but also the hardest – is to own up to your mistake, says McAndrew: “Acknowledge that this is something you did, apologise, and try your best to convince the individual you’ve offended that this will never happen again.”Whatever you do, don’t deny that you were gossiping or try to brush it off, he says. People have different thresholds for what counts as private information – some don’t like publicising their age, for instance, or strive to keep work and home life strictly separate. “If you tell them, ‘Nobody cares’, you’re in some ways belittling them, telling them that it’s inappropriate for them to be upset. You may think it’s trivial, but if it’s not trivial to them, it’s not,” McAndrew says.Should you tell someone if others are gossiping about them?Gossip often presents us with moral dilemmas like this one, says Waddington. “There is no clear-cut right or wrong answer – it is ultimately an ethical decision.” She suggests approaching it “on a need-to-know basis”. If disclosing the gossip would cause the person harm, distress or suffering, then your role as their friend might be to protect them.However, if there is benefit in sharing the gossip – for example, if it is obviously untrue or malicious – you might be able to help them challenge and expose it. It could even be an opportunity to build an alliance, says McAndrew. “Strategically letting someone know that they are the target of gossip can ingratiate you with them.” But, he adds: “One must play this game skilfully and thoughtfully.”How can you protect yourself from hearing something you don’t want to hear?Waddington likens gossip to a rich meal. “With good friends and good wine, it’s actually pleasurable,” she says. But overindulging can leave a nasty taste. “It’s a bit like a hangover, or feeling a bit bloated.”Drawing the line between harmless and hurtful, however, is intensely personal. “People have to have their own moral compass, their own codes as to what is acceptable to them or not. You can’t be prescriptive, or give them a little checklist,” says Waddington. She does, however, have a strategy for when you find you’ve lost your appetite for gossip. “If somebody comes to you and says, ‘Have you heard …’, before they go any further, say: ‘Why are you telling me this?’”The pause focuses the conversation and gives you some control without chiding the other person, Waddington says. It may even give them pause. “I think it’s a great question, because the other person might think: ‘Oh, right – whyamI doing this?’”"

The untitled work by the American artist depicts four figures in bold acrylic and oil, and is estimated to be worth up to $600,000 (£480,000). “Richard Prince reinvented himself during every decade of his career; he always challenged himself to do something completely different,” Haleigh Stoddard, Sotheby’s head of contemporary curations, says.It’s a description that is entirely befitting of Beckham herself. From Spice Girl and Wag, to a fashion designer revered for her contemporary command of quiet luxury, Beckham is known as the queen of reinvention. Now she is trying her hand at something different once more: art curation.Beckham, 50, hasteamed up with Sotheby’s to host an exhibitionof work by some of the biggest names of the 20th and 21st century, including Yoshitomo Nara, George Condo, Keith Haring, Francis Bacon, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Joan Mitchell, Gerhard Richter and Yves Klein. The artworks will be on public view until 10 February before they go under the hammer in New York and London or are sold privately.Art, Beckham has said, has always been a source of inspiration. “Collecting is about more than just investing or acquiring beautiful objects. It’s about finding pieces that bring us real joy.”On a rainy Friday morning, there is joy in the way the childlike playfulness of the images sit in contrast to Beckham’s tailored silhouettes and muted shades.View image in fullscreenThe outside of Beckham’s store on Dover Street, London.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe store is not overrun with customers but it certainly has the air and look of a gallery. Located within a three-storey Georgian townhouse on Dover Street, it features a cutaway floor and a cast-lattice coffered ceiling. The walls are a bespoke green created by the luxury interior designer Rose Uniacke just for Beckham.On a table, next to a collection of handbags and jewellery, sits a pile of leaflets, and half a dozen visitors study them as they saunter around the store taking pictures to a soundtrack of uptempo jazz. One shop assistant says while they’ve not had any inquiries about purchases of art, they have noticed an increase in customers.“For us, it’s incredible to show these works in a totally new context,” Stoddard says. “People are so used to seeing artworks on white walls in galleries or museums. A space like this almost feels like a home.“We’re always trying to engage new, younger collectors. People who come into this store, who might be interested in Victoria Beckham’s design aesthetic, might also love a George Condo or a Yoshimoto Nara painting.”View image in fullscreenCosmic Eyes (in the Milky lane), 2005, by Yoshitomo Nara.Photograph: Sotheby’sAlthough she has hit the headlines this week, Beckham has been collecting for several years and collaborated with Sotheby’s on a number of occasions to exhibit work in her store. Other projects have included hosting a 2021 takeover of ultra-bright neon installations by Chila Burman.The designer has said she was first introduced to collecting when she saw an “enormous Julian Schnabel” in the dining room of her friend Elton John’s house in the south of France and “being so mesmerised by it”.Since then she and her husband, David, have gone on a journey to “educate” themselves about art – first purchasing a piece from Schnabel’s Sonanbul series, before expanding their collection to include works by Yayoi Kusama, Nan Goldin, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and Nara. They are also regulars at Art Basel Miami.Stoddard praises the designer’s “incredible curiosity” when picking the works on display. The Nara painting, entitled Cosmic Eyes (in the Milky lane), depicts a cartoonish, wide-faced young girl staring at the viewer with sparkly eyes – a reminder that “things are never as simple as they look”, according to Beckham.Nearby is an abstract pastel by Mitchell, and a painting from Klein’s most revolutionary body of work: International Klein Blue monochromes, which Beckham called “one of the most iconic colours of the 20th century”. Works elsewhere include Basquiat’s Red Joy and Condo’s Artist and Muse, believed to depict Picasso and his muse, Sylvette.Together, the value of the works is in the tens of millions, with the most expensive, Cosmic Eyes, estimated to be worth in the region of $6m. Security, undoubtedly, has been a foremost concern, and Stoddard says they have “a very bespoke security plan” in place – although she cannot expand on that.View image in fullscreenRed Joy, 1984, by Jean-Michel BasquiatPhotograph: Sotheby’sThe exhibition comes at a time when collaborations between art, fashion and music are on the rise. Louis Vuitton has collaborated with Richard Prince and the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, and Dior regularly collaborates with artists to put its own spin on the house’s Lady Dior bag. Last year,FKA Twigs unveiled a huge art projectat Sotheby’s;Skepta also curated an auction there.These collaborations provide consumers and audiences “with a perceived sense of connoisseurship”,according to Dr Federica Carlottoof Sotheby’s Institute of Art.“There’s more of an appetite for the art world to embrace fashion and possible collaborations,” Stoddard says.“It’s an interesting opportunity for people to learn more, to dive into a world that’s sometimes not as accessible. Seeing contemporary art in a space like this can be much more inviting than a museum, or walking into an intimidating auction house.”Explore more on these topicsVictoria BeckhamArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You decide whose argument doesn’t washFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorGeorgina LawtonFri 7 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 08.48 ESTShareThe prosecution: IslaJake is a grown man – he should care about his hygiene. Showering is hardly a massive choreJake, my 31-year-old little brother, is temporarily living with me in my flat. I love him but I’ve noticed he has a few strange habits. The main thing is his hygiene – or lack of it. I don’t say this to be mean, but Jake showers so infrequently that it shocks me.I first noticed it a month after he moved in. I realised that the shower seemed barely used so I asked him: “Do you shower every day?” He said no, he showered usually every three to four days. That’s only twice a week.Growing up, Mum always impressed upon us the importance of being clean and well presented, and we were encouraged to bathe daily. My brother was living on his own before he moved in with me, and has been single for a while. Maybe that’s why he’s dropped the habit. When I asked him why he doesn’t shower more often, he said he “can’t be bothered” as he doesn’t get stinky. That is true. He’s lucky he doesn’t suffer from body odour. He wears deodorant and brushes his teeth twice a day. He also doesn’t get greasy hair or look unpolished. It’s just that now I know he is shower-shy, I can’t unknow it.I don’t like the idea of Jake living in my flat and walking around having not washed for half a weekI shower every day – I suppose that women are held to higher beauty standards. It’s not really my business to tell him how to care for his body, but I don’t like the idea of Jake living in my flat having not washed for half a week. He’s also a teacher and I get disturbed by the possibility of him bringing germs into my home from the unwashed kids he’s around every day.I don’t want to seem like a nag – I’m not his girlfriend or his mother – but I want him to get that, as a grown man, he needs to wash more often. I think most people will agree that twice a week isn’t enough. I don’t want to shame Jake, but maybe just a little bit of shame will help him see sense. Our parents live a long way away, and I’m not going to tattle on him as we have a good relationship and the living situation is generally quite peaceful. However, it’s not the Victorian era. I have a lovely bathroom. Jake needs to clean up his act.You be the judge - send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: JakeI’m not dirty, I don’t smell, so what’s the problem? Plus overwashing is bad for your skinI hate to sound like a scruff but I don’t think it’s necessary to have a shower every day. Call me a weirdo but I have better things to do. Especially when I don’t smell.I take good care of my clothes and put deodorant on every day. I also don’t really sweat much on a day-to-day basis unless I exercise, which I do around twice a week – and I’ll always shower afterwards. It’s just that if I haven’t exercised, or have just got home from work, I usually won’t take a shower.There just isn’t the time to shower daily. In the evenings I’m too tired, and in the morning I’m rushing out the door to school. If I don’t exercise, I will shower every three to four days. I don’t really see a problem with that. My hair never gets greasy and I guess it all just comes down to not being bothered.I do feel like she has taken this issue and run with it … Is my showering really any of her business?Yes, I am lazy and see showering as a chore. Our mum is very clean so I don’t get it from her, but when my dad was working full-time, he would always complain about showering and said it took up too much of his time. Maybe I inherited his hatred of bathing.I also think it’s good to let the natural oils of the body sit on your skin. Overwashing is worse as it strips them off – I read that somewhere. I also think your body is largely self-cleaning in a way. Isla should be happy because lower shower frequency helps keep the water bills down – she pays most of the bills as it’s her flat.I think living on my own for a few years made me less aware of how strange not bathing every day is to some people. I do feel like she has taken this issue and run with it, though. Is my showering really any of her business? Isla worries that I could be bringing germs home from school, but I always make sure to change into pyjamas or casual wear when I get in and wash my hands before cooking.I don’t get any other complaints from Isla regarding us living together, so it’s not like I’m a dirty person. Showering just feels like a super big chore to me.The jury of Guardian readersWho gets taken to the cleaners?Although I empathise with Isla, she needs to accept she can’t control the actions of those around her. So, as tricky as it is, she needs to learn to let it go. Given Jake is not unhygienic or smelly, it shouldn’t impact her much anyway.Georgia, 30Jake needs to shower more often. It’s Isla’s flat too and Jake is making her uncomfortable. Jake’s arguments are nonsense. Everyone has time in the morning or evening to have a shower.Andrew, 31Isla’s use of “little brother” and “tattle on him” is telling. She obviously cares for Jake, but she is worrying for no reason. She says Jake doesn’t smell and is well presented, so what’s the problem? Changing your clothes after work and handwashing is sufficient.Chloe, 33Jake has no problems with smells or looking unkempt. He’s living there temporarily so Isla won’t have to put up with feeling uncomfortable for long. And why is she assuming the kids at his school are “unwashed”?Roz, 61If Isla says Jake doesn’t smell, then he probably doesn’t – a sibling would notice. But using lots of deodorant isn’t ideal; a quick wash on days when he doesn’t shower sounds healthier. I argue he is not guilty because Isla doesn’t have to touch Jake. If he was her partner, he’d be very guilty!Gwen, 40Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Jake clean up his act?The poll closes on Thursday 13 February at 10am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherKaterina’s daughter, Anya, should stop tipping so muchwhen they eat out.23%of you said yes –Anya is guilty77%of you said no –Anya is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyHygieneHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But questions aboutdelayed evacuation ordershave given rise to feelings of neglect among some Altadena residents.“This is a human issue,” said Sharpton. “We stand with those at the Palisades and Hollywood Hills, but let everybody stand with us too.”Newdatafrom the University of California, Los Angeles, revealed that nearly half of Altadena’s Black households were either destroyed or severely damaged by the fire.“We want to make sure that we have truth, accountability and justice for Altadena,” said Crump. “We don’t want three-fifths justice. We don’t want half justice for those Black families who lost so much.

The city’s largest public housing complex,Nickerson Gardens, bears their family name.On the night of the wildfire, Rodney was in bed in his Altadena home.“The reason why this memorial is important is these people did nothing but what they were supposed to do in their own homes,” said Sharpton. “When you don’t have the safety and sanctity of your own home, then what is left? What are we supposed to tell our children now?”Altadena’s historically Black, middle-class neighborhood was shaped byracially discriminatory housing practices. Surrounding cities restricted Black home ownership, so Altadena became a refuge.UCLA researchers said this area was closest to the Eaton fire perimeter, and required the most support to recover.“This is our blood. This is our sweat,” said Sharpton about the diverse Altadena neighborhood. “And even though it burned to the ground, we are going to build back.”At the service, community leaders urged homeowners to stay united and resist selling their properties in the aftermath of the fire.“It’s a community that cannot be replicated,” said Calvin. “Those people need to be loved on and given the chance to build back, so the community does not change.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastUS wildfiresRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hardline approach to law and order. A purge of “gender ideology” and “wokeness” from the nation’s schools. Erosions of academic freedom, judicial independence and the free press. An alliance with Christian nationalism. An assault on democratic institutions.The “electoral autocracy” that is Viktor Orbán’s Hungary has been long revered by Donald Trump and his “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement. Now admiration is turning into emulation. In the early weeks of Trump’s second term as US president, analysts say, there are alarming signs that the Orbánisation of America has begun.With the tech billionaire Elon Musk at his side, Trump has moved with astonishing velocity to fire critics, punish media, reward allies, gut the federal government, exploit presidential immunity and test the limits of his authority. Many of their actions have been unconstitutional and illegal. With Congress impotent,only the federal courtshave slowed them down.“They are copying the path taken by other would-be dictators like Viktor Orbán,” saidChris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut. “You have a move towards state-controlled media. You have a judiciary and law enforcement that seems poised to prioritise the prosecution of political opponents. You have the executive seizure of spending power so the leader and only the leader gets to dictate who gets money.”Orbán, who came to power in 2010, was once described as “Trump before Trump” by the US president’s former adviser Steve Bannon. His long-term dismantling of institutions and control of media in Hungary serves as a cautionary tale about how seemingly incremental changes can pave the way for authoritarianism.Orbán has described his country as “a petri dish for illiberalism”. His party used its two-thirds majority to rewrite the constitution, capture institutions and change electoral law. He reconfigured the judiciary and public universities to ensure long-term party loyalty.View image in fullscreenA person holds a sign with Orbán and Trump on it during an inauguration party outside the US embassy in Budapest, Hungary, on 20 January.Photograph: Márton Mónus/ReutersThe prime minister created a system of rewards and punishments, giving control of money and media to allies. An estimated 85% of media outlets are controlled by the Hungarian government, allowing Orbán to shape public opinion and marginalise dissent. Orbán has been also masterful at weaponising “family values” and anti-immigration rhetoric to mobilise his base.Orbán’s fans in the US include Vice-President JD Vance, the media personality Tucker Carlson and Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage Foundation thinktank, who once said: “Modern Hungary is not justamodel for conservative statecraft butthemodel.” The Heritage Foundation produced Project 2025, a far-right blueprint for Trump’s second term.Orbán has addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference and two months agotravelled to the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for talks with both Trump and Musk. He has claimed that “we have entered the policy writing system of President Donald Trump’s team” and “have deep involvement there”.But even Orbán might be taken aback – and somewhat envious – of the alacrity that Trump has shown since returning to power, attacking the foundations of democracy not with a chisel but a sledgehammer.The threat is much more real now than people anticipated it being a month agoBill KristolOn day one he pardoned about 1,500 people who took part in the 6 January 2021 insurrection, including those who violently attacked US Capitol police in an effort to overturn his election defeat. Driven by vengeance, he dismissed federal prosecutors involved in Trump-related investigations andhinted at a further targetingof thousands of FBI agents who worked on January 6-related cases.Bill Kristol, director of the advocacy group Defending Democracy Together and a former official in the Ronald Reagan White House, said:“Flipping the narrative on January 6, becoming a pro-January 6 administration, then weaponising the justice department and talking at least of mass firings at the FBI – that’s further than the norm and very dangerous for obvious reasons.“If he could do that, he could do anything. Why can’t he order the justice department to investigate you and me and 50 other people? One assumes the lawyers at justice or the FBI agents wouldn’t do it, but if a couple of thousand have been cleared out and the rest are intimidated. I’m not hysterical but I do think the threat is much more real now than people anticipated it being a month ago.”Borrowing from Orbán’s playbook, Trump hasmobilised the culture wars, issuing a series of executive orders and policy changes that target diversity, equity and inclusion programmes and education curricula. This weekhe signed an executive orderaimed at banning transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports and directed the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to lead a taskforce on eradicating what he called anti-Christian bias within the federal government.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold signs outside the West Virginia state capitol in Charleston on 5 February, during a series of protests against Trump administration initiatives.Photograph: Chris Dorst/APHe is also seeking to marginalise the mainstream media and supplant it with a rightwing ecosystem that includes armies of influencers and podcasters. A “new media” seat has been added to the White House press briefing room while Silicon Valley billionaires were prominent at his inauguration. Musk’s X is a powerful mouthpiece, Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook hasabandoned factcheckingand the Chinese-owned TikTok could become part-owned by the US.Trump has sued news organisations over stories or even interview edits; some have settled the cases. ThePentagon saidit would “rotate” four major news outlets from their workspace and replace them with more Trump-friendly media.

The most sensitive treasury department information of countless Americans was opened to Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) team in a breach of privacy and protocol, raising concerns about potential misuse of federal funds.Musk’s allies orchestrated a physical takeover of the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), locking out employees and vowing to shut it down, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio,stepping inas acting administrator. “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,”Musk postedon X.Musk’s team has also heavily influenced the office of personnel management (OPM), offering federal workers a “buyout” and installing loyalists into key positions. It is also pushing for a 50% budget cut and implementing “zero-based budgeting” at the General Services Administration (GSA), which controls federal properties and massive contracts.View image in fullscreenOrbán poses with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida on 11 July 2024.Photograph: Zoltán Fischer/X account Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orbán/AFP/Getty ImagesMusk, a private citizen who has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts, is slashing and burning his way through Washington with little accountability and has significant potential conflicts of interest. An array of lawsuits is demanding interventions to stop him unilaterally gutting government. Protests are erupting outside government agencies and jamming congressional phone lines.But critics aiming to sound the alarm that a shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover face intimidation or punishment. Edward Martin, the interim US attorney for the District of Columbia,threatened legal actionagainst anyone who “impedes” Doge’s work or “threatens” its people. Martin posted on X: “We are in contact with FBI and other law-enforcement partners to proceed rapidly. We also have our prosecutors preparing.”Murphy, the Democratic senator, said:“What’s most worrying to me right now is there’s a whole campaign under way to try to punish and suppress Trump and Musk’s political enemies. It started with the pardoning of the January 6 rioters; now everybody knows that they are at risk of having the shit beat out of them if they opposeDonald Trump.“It extended to the seizure of government funding. It’s clear now that Musk and Trump are going to fund entities and states and congressional districts that support them and will withhold funds from entities and states and congressional districts that don’t support them.”He added: “Now you have this lawyer who represented January 6 defendants, the new acting DC US attorney, trolling activists online, threatening them with federal prosecution. It’s dizzying campaign of political repression that looks more like Russia than the United States.”View image in fullscreenSenator Chris Murphy speaks at a press conference at the US Capitol in Washington DC on 28 January.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPADemocrats such as Murphy are determined to fight back but, being in the minority, have few tools at their disposal.Republicanshave mostly appeared content to cede their own power. The party’s fealty to Trump was demonstrated again this week when senators in committee voted to move forward with the nominations of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F Kennedy Jr as director of national intelligence and health secretary respectively – two mavericks whose selection would have been unthinkable just a year ago.The complete indifference of the Republican Congress to the ways that it is being stripped of its core constitutional functions is demoralisingCharlie SykesCharlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “There had been some lingering optimism that at least some Republican senators would draw the line at some of the more absurd Maga appointees but that hasn’t happened. That also demoralises any potential opposition.”He added: “WhatElon Muskrepresents is basically a hostile takeover of the government and the complete indifference of the Republican Congress to the ways that it is being stripped of its core constitutional functions is demoralising. It is this mood that nothing can be done or will be done to stop them. You’re seeing that in the business community, in the political community, and it’s a fundamental loss of faith in the rule of law and in our system of checks and balances.”One guardrail is holding for now. Courts have temporarily blocked Trump’s efforts to end birthright citizenship, cull the government workforce and freeze federal funding. Even so, commentators warn that the blatant disregard for congressional authority, erosion of civil service protections and concentration of power in the executive branch pose a grave threat.Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “You’d have to have your eyes fully closed not to be deeply concerned and outraged about the vacuum that Donald Trump is operating in now. In a real sense, US democracy has died this month. It doesn’t mean it’s dead for the long term but at this moment the idea of an accountable representative system, as the framers of the constitution wrote it, is no longer present.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe fight for democracyViktor OrbánUS politicsTrump administrationRepublicansElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Joe Biden did not repeal the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by his predecessor; and indeed erected new barriers in the form of restrictions on exports of important technologies such as semiconductors. (Ironically it appears to be the difficulty in getting hold of the most sophisticated chips, that has partly drivenChina’s development of the cut-price AI-powered chatbot, DeepSeek).When China was integrated into the global trading system, joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) back in 2001, it was meant to bind the populous communist state into a rules-based international system.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump Trump lays much of the blame for US economic woes with Beijing’s policies.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/ReutersThe more closely aligned Beijing became with the global economy, the theory went, the less likely geopolitical tensions would erupt. The real optimists even hoped that over time, China might be guided away from communism.Almost a quarter of a century later, western economies remain scarred by the failures of the global financial crisis and the US manufacturing sector has been hollowed out.That has happened for many reasons, but Trump lays much of the blame with Beijing’s policies, which have included protecting domestic industries and keeping its currency – the yuan – cheap enough to continue generating extraordinary export-led growth.China’s trade surplus in 2024 hit a record $1tn (£810bn), with exports up 10% over the year. Itran a hefty $295bn trade surpluswith the US in 2024 – although that was well below the record $418bn in 2018..American consumers have benefited in the form of a flood of cheap goods – not least those manufactured in China on behalf of US companies. But Trump sees the US’s wide trade deficit with China as evidence of Beijing cheating. He wants to close the gap – by bringing jobs and investment home.As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank points out, the US produces 15% of the world’s manufactured goods and accounts for almost 30% of global consumption. China produces a whopping 32% of manufactured goods, and makes up just 12% of global consumption..Economic theory tends to suggest that as economies develop, they specialise in making and exporting the products where they have particular strengths, and diversify into a more service-based model of growth, as a growing middle class consumes more. But for China, that has not happened.“China’s economic development in recent years, instead of moving it towards a consumer-oriented economy, has moved in the direction of a more advancedmanufacturing economy,” Reid says.He adds: “This may now have gone too far. Access to cheaper goods is no longer a good ‘trade’ for the US, given the loss of economic security over production supply chains and technologies to a competing power.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Bessent put it this week: “Tariffs are a means to an end, and I think that end is bringing the manufacturing base back to the US.”So while what Trump appears to want from Mexico and Canada is a series of ill-defined political actions, he has a clear goal in his interaction with China, and that involves closing the trade gap.Given Trump’s history it will be no surprise that he is likely to seek a deal with Beijing, but Bessent has also played up the possibility of a grand bargain – perhaps along the lines of the Plaza accord, named after the New York hotel in which it was struck in 1985 between a string of countries including the US, Germany, Japan and indeed the UK.View image in fullscreenChina has become a more advancedmanufacturing economy in recent years.Photograph: APThat historic agreement included a decision to allow the dollar to depreciate against other major currencies, in an attempt to narrow the US current account deficit – a measure that includes borrowing from foreign creditors, as well as the trade balance.While it is less visible, the US imbalance with China includes Beijing’s vast holdings of US treasuries – effectively, loans to the US government – which were worth $770bn at the end of 2024, second only to Japan, a geopolitical ally of Washington.Bessent has appeared to back billionaire Elon Musk’s extraordinary onslaught on US government departments, via his role as head of the “department of government efficiency (Doge)”, because the treasury secretary appears to see a much smaller shortfall on the public finances, lessening the government’s dependence on overseas creditors and helping to bring down interest rates, as a key part of the Trump rebalancing project.As a starting point in dealing with Beijing, Trump has asked officials to examine China’s compliance with the “phase one” trade deal he struck with China in his first term, which came into effect in 2020. This included commitments to ramp up purchases of US goods and services.John Glen, the chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), suggests a grand bargain could also include a promise to cap exports – which he warns against.“We did it in the mid-1980s Plaza accord, when the Japanese agreed to voluntarily restrict the amount of cars they exported into the US and the UK. If you’re going to restrain trade that’s just about the worst way you’re going to do it. All it does is it means they make more money on every car they export.”There is a superficial logic to the idea of a grand bargain (some have suggested a “Mar-a-Lago Accord”), however. China has previously suggested it would like to boost domestic demand to make its economy less export-dependent.China’s vice-premier, Ding Xuexiang, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month: “We don’t seek [a] trade surplus. We want to import more competitive, quality products and services to promote balanced trade.”Yet China watchers point out that Beijing saw the Plaza accord as a disaster for Japan, contributing to the subsequent asset bubble, so it is unlikely to want to emulate such a sweeping agreement.Instead, Beijing is more likely to sign up to a symbolic deal in which it pledges more spending and investment in the US, but the deep divide between the two sides remains. “As important as Trump is, the forces driving this fracturing of the relationship between the US and China are just bigger than one person,” Shearing says.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeChinese economyGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardMat YoukeeUS had made inroads against Chinese influence in Panama, but Trump’s demands could help Beijing expand its regional powerFri 7 Feb 2025 10.31 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTShareWhen Panama’s then president Juan Carlos Varela was invited to the White House in June 2017,Donald Trumpsaid thePanama canalwas doing “pretty well” and described the bilateral relationship as “very strong”.Just days earlier, Varela had broken ties with Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations withChina, but there was no indication that this snub to a key US ally had clouded the meeting.Over the next two years, promises of Chinese investment flooded intoPanama. There were contracts to build bridges, ports, energy projects and a proposal for a high-speed rail line. Negotiations for a free trade agreement began and a giant plot of land near the entrance to the canal was set aside for a Chinese embassy.In the following years, however, US diplomatic efforts and back-channel pressure in effect curtailed growing Chinese influence on the isthmus. Now, Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric and maximalist negotiating positions threaten to undermine a hitherto successful strategy.The US was caught cold by Panama’s 2017 diplomatic switch to Beijing, but within months the state department was devising a response. That September, the US recalled its ambassadors to Panama, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic (the other two nations to establish ties with Beijing in 2017), and the following month, then secretary of state Mike Pompeo visited Panama City to warn the government of China’s “predatory economic activity”.Panama the new flashpoint in China’s growing presence in Latin AmericaRead morePanama’s dollarized economy is highly vulnerable to US pressure – as is its business elite, which banks, does business and sends it children to school in the US. Since 2016, US authorities have arrested oneformer presidentand hissons, banned Varela from entering the country due to “significant corruption” and blacklisted prominent businessmen. Senior politicians have been called to Washington for closed-door talks at the state department or found themselves unexpectedly detained and questioned at US airports.Such back-channel coercion proved a successful strategy. US pressureplayed a rolein cancelling the proposed Chinese embassy, and the free trade talks with Beijing silently slid off the agenda. Chinese firms found themselves losing out on key infrastructure projectsdespite tenderingthe lowest bids. The existing projects, including a bridge over the canal, a greenfield port in the Caribbean and a gas-power plant, were either abandoned or left in indefinite limbo. Air China cancelled its flights to Panama.The only exception came in 2021, when the Panamanian government opted to extend a Hong Kong-based company’s contract to operate ports at either end of the canal. That contract is at the center of Marco Rubio’s claims that the current situation around the canal is “unacceptable”.The July 2024 election of José Raúl Mulino, a pro-US technocrat, to the Panamanian presidency offered the state department the opportunity to continue its successful low-visibility strategy. Mulino’s very first act was to sign an agreement with the US tocurb irregular migration through the Darién Gap. His administration’s signature infrastructure project – a railroad between Panama City and the Costa Rican border – was originally proposed by China, but in January its first major contract wasawarded to a US firm.Almost immediately however, Trump insisted, falsely and very publicly, that “Chinese soldiers” operate the canal and pledged to “take it back”.Mulino has since said he is willing to concede on all of the US’s legitimate strategic concerns, agreeing to expand security infrastructure in the Darien and promising to exit China’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure initiative. The contentious ports are now being audited anda legal case has been lodged to declare them unconstitutional. The likely termination of that contract would end any meaningful Chinese presence around the canal.But that is not, it seems, enough for Trump.He has said he is unhappy with Rubio’s statements following the visit and has repeated that he wants the US to administer the canal. This would be an intolerable affront to Panamanian national identity and a hammer blow to the country’s already fragile economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US navy ships already jump to the front of the line for transits and have paid just $17m in transit fees over the last nine years.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreBy forcing this point – to no meaningful benefit – the US is putting Mulino in an impossible position. Conferring preferential free treatment to the US, expressly forbidden under the canal’s neutrality treaty, would put the Panamanian government in serious legal jeopardy, according to experts.Trump has shown that he can bully his allies in the western hemisphere, but by pushing beyond strategic imperatives in an effort to humiliate an ally, his strategy could backfire in the long run.At present, Latin American nations have little option but to bend to Trump’s threats of tariffs or military action. But if they believe these threats will be made repeatedly, in effect curtailing their ability to make policy independent of the US, they will be forced to look for alternative allies.The region does not lack for governments – mostly autocracies – that have sided with Tehran, Beijing or Moscow. Trump could help them swell their number.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyPanama canalDonald TrumpPanamaChinaTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

There is no favoritism. That’s why the people gave him a second term.”All across the Americas, similar sentiments can be heard as Bukele’s authoritarian clampdown wins admirers, fromArgentinaand Ecuador to Haiti and Belize. This week, the Trump administration gave Bukele’s crackdown its blessing, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, showering El Salvador’s president with praise during a five-country tour of Latin America.Bukele, in turn,offered to accept deportees from the US – including US citizens and legal residents, a move that would be illegal under US law.‘It’s a war on the people’: El Salvador’s mass arrests send thousands into despairRead moreHuman rights activists have voiced horror as tens of thousands of people –including thousands of children– have been jailed since Bukele’s state of emergency was declared in March 2022, mostly without legal process. More than 100 have died behind bars.But many across Latin America and the Caribbean have applauded the draconian anti-crime offensive, which the government claims has converted one of the world’s most violent places into one of its safest.“You think that Bukele is the most influential world leader for no reason?” Belize’s police commissioner, Chester Williams, told reporters last year as a state of emergency was declared there aftera surge in gang-related murders. “The state of emergency is something that many countries in the region are looking at because they have seen how effective it has worked in El Salvador, and every government wants their people to be safe.”The centrepiece of Bukele’s security campaign is a multimillion-dollar mega-prison called the “terrorism confinement centre”.View image in fullscreenInmates identified by authorities as gang members are seated on the prison floor of the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador, on 15 March 2023Photograph: APThat 40,000-capacity jail, near the capital, San Salvador, has become a place of pilgrimage for rightwing populists, with politicians jetting in from across the region to study its techniques and take tweetable selfies outside cells filled with tattooed inmates.“We’ve received people fromPeru, people from Argentina, people from Panama, people from Guatemala, people from Honduras,” El Salvador’s security minister, Gustavo Villatoro, boasted last year during a rightwing conference in Brazil, where he received a pop star’s welcome and spoke to chants of “Bu-ke-le! Bu-ke-le!”“They came … to see the hope in the faces of Salvadorian citizens – and we want to see hope in the faces of 660 million Latin Americans,” Villatoro added.Rubio did not visit Bukele’s “confinement centre” while visiting El Salvador, but he hailed the country’s “transformation”. “A country that was once known for violence and for the inability to live openly and freely with one’s family and enjoy life has now become one of the most secure in the hemisphere thanks to his leadership, to the difficult decisions that had to be made,” Rubio said, thanking Bukele for his “extraordinary” offer to jail prisoners deported from the US.Donald Trump’s ally Elon Musk also championed Bukele and his proposal to “outsource part of [the US] prison system” to El Salvador. “Great idea!” Musk wrote on X.One of the most powerful politicians to have visited Bukele’s mega-prison is Argentina’s hardline security minister, Patricia Bullrich, who, despite her country’s relatively low levels of crime, has publicly expressed interest in “adapting the Bukele model”. “This is the way. Tough on crime. Freedom for upstanding Argentinians,”Bullrich enthusedafter posing outside its cells.Peru’s justice minister, Eduardo Arana, has also visited El Salvador and subsequently pledged Bukele-style measures, including the construction of huge prisons.Other visitors include Eduardo Bolsonaro, the congressman son of Brazil’s former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, andthe ultra-conservative former Chilean presidential candidate José Antonio Kast.Lucía Dammert, a Peruvian-Chilean sociologist who has studiedBukele’s appealaround Latin America, said she understood “why everyone is talking about” El Salvador’s social media-savvy leader, a former advertising executive with more than 7 million followers on X.“He has a very good marketing campaign – but he also has results,” Dammert said, pointing to El Salvador’s plummeting crime rates. “I understand how, for many of us in Latin America, the desperation that violence brings allows us to think that we need a saviour – and he has been portraying himself as that.”View image in fullscreenA prison warden secures a prison sector, during a tour in the Terrorism Confinement Center prison complex, designed to hold 40,000 inmates,.Photograph: José Cabezas/ReutersBut the University of Santiago professor expressed deep misgivings about the toll Bukele’s campaign was taking on democracy and human rights and doubted El Salvador’s experience could be successfully replicated elsewhere.Ecuador was a prime example. One year ago, its president, Daniel Noboa, declared war on the narco-traffickers who have turned his once peaceful country into one of the world’s most violent. Soon after, Noboa flew to El Salvador todiscuss security policywith Bukele, although he later distanced himself from the Salvadorian,tellinga US journalist: “The guy is arrogant and all about controlling power for himself and making his family rich.”An 800-capacity“Bukele-style”maximum-security detention facility is being built on Ecuador’s Pacific coast and another expanded in the Amazon.But Noboa’s crackdown has failed to halt the bloodshed while simultaneouslyexposing Ecuadorian citizens to human rights violations committed by the armed forces and police. While reporting onNoboa’s “war on gangs”in the port city of Guayaquil last January, Guardian reporters saw two groups of suspects being beaten and tortured by security forces during night raids.“His death destroyed our family,” said Carlos Vicente Vega Molina, the father of one teenager who was shot dead last year by navy troops and falsely labelled a criminal. “We still see on social media people calling him a gang member,” Vega said. “That hurts us, and we must live with it every day.”How the US helped create El Salvador’s bloody gang warRead moreDammert recognized the immense damageEl Salvador’s US-born gangshad done to the 6.3 million citizens of Central America’s smallest country. “Most Salvadorians couldn’t leave their houses because they were afraid of extortion mechanisms, that included sextortion and horrible levels of violence,” she said.But the challenge posed by groups such as Barrio 18 and MS13 paled in comparison to the situation in Ecuador which islocated next to the world’s top two cocaine producers – Colombia and Peru – and has become one of the world’s most important drug smuggling routes, with the growing involvement of two of Mexico’s most powerful cartels, Sinaloa and the Jalisco New Generation cartel.“[El Salvador’s situation] is very different from the problems we’re facing throughout Latin America that are more linked to illegal markets that are bigger, more transnational, more complex,” Dammert said.Dammert called the idea that Bukele’s techniques could solve all of the region’s security problems “a mirage”. “It’s like something you really want to see working in your country – but it’s something [that’s] imaginary.”The Jamaican criminologist Jason McKay also understood the attraction to Bukele’s methods, which he believed could be “extremely effective at lowering the murder rate” in a country with more than a thousand homicides a year. “That several hundred of us that are now alive and breathing will be dead before the end of the year – that’s difficult for a country to accept. And if there was a measure to stop it, I would say take it,” McKay added. “But the problem is that it does come with human rights issues as well, because innocent people may get caught into that detention.”View image in fullscreenTroops from El Salvador arrive in Haiti on Tuesday for the mission to quell violent armed gangs.Photograph: Patrice Noel/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock​InTrinidad and Tobago, ​where escalating gang violence saw a state of emergency declared last year, the prime minister, Keith Rowley, has been urged to adopt Bukele’s “head-on” approach.​ But addressing parliament last month Rowley suggested human rights concerns would be an obstacle. “Recently​, I heard somebody comparing us to El Salvador [where] the president … is coming and locking up everybody who smells or looks like a criminal,” he said, before adding: “We can’t do that.”Such doubts have not dimmed Bukele’s yearning to position himself as the region’s saviour.On Tuesday, 70 members of El Salvador’s air forcelanded in Port-au-Princeto join an international security force tasked with bringing the city under control.More than a million people have been displaced by Haiti’s security meltdown, which has seen prisons and police stations overrun by criminal gangs and medical workers caught in the crossfire.But Bukele has expressed confidence that he has the solution for Haiti’s crisis, saying in a tweet last year: “We can fix it.”Additional reporting by Etienne Côté-Paluck in Port-au-Prince and Blanca Moncada in GuayaquilExplore more on these topicsEl SalvadorAmericasEcuadorArgentinaJamaicaTrinidad and TobagoBelizefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For both constituencies, Israel’s right to annex the occupiedPalestinian territoriesof Gaza and the West Bank is a matter of faith and, they hope, a matter of time.Both constituencies cheered this week as Donald Trump announced his half-baked plan to “take over” Gaza, an idea he had only tinkered with before Tuesday evening,when it tumbled outto the obvious surprise of his closest aides.While most observers were shocked that the US president was in effect advocating for the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip, the conservative alliance ofIsraeland the United States sees an opportunity to accelerate the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and its eventual annexation.“What has changed now is that Trump has said that it is US policy to support this as an end goal,” Matt Duss, the executive vice-president at the Center for International Policy, said of the Trump proposal. “And then of course it will just hop over to the West Bank, no question.”‘Waterfront property’: what are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read moreIsrael’s pro-settler right wing immediately hailed Trump’s announcement. Bezalel Smotrich, the country’s ultranationalist finance minister, quoted a biblical passage about the return of Jewish pilgrims to Israel, writing: “Thank you President Trump. Together, we will make the world great again.”Itamar Ben-Gvir, who left Benjamin Netanyahu’s shaky coalition government because of the ceasefire with Hamas,said: “When I said this time and again during the war, that this was the solution to Gaza, they mocked me.”Under Joe Biden, saying thatGazahad been rendered unliveable would have been seen as a condemnation of Israel’s military campaign. But Trump, ignoring the Israeli assault that has been described as a “domicide” and led to the hollowing out of Gaza’s cities, simply went ahead and said it.The New York Times reported that the idea had been germinating among Trump and his close allies for weeks, and accelerated after his envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to the area and said: “There is almost nothing left of Gaza.” YetTrump surprised his aides and even Netanyahu with the proposal, the paper reported, calling it “little beyond an idea inside the president’s head”.Trump’s plan may be a nonstarter and a distraction from more immediate questions of the second round of ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas. But it marks a serious shift towards some of the pro-settler advisers that he has elevated, including his nominee for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said on Fox News in January: “There was a Palestinian state. It was called Gaza. Look how that turned out.”Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, has a record of hardline pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Huckabee has refused to call the settlements by that name, insisting they be called “communities” or neighbourhoods. He has denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation.In a sign of growing ties between the US Christian right, the Israeli right and the pro-settler movement, Huckabee was in the audience when Netanyahu met leaders from America’s evangelical community during his trip to Washington this week.Also at the meeting with Netanyahu was John Hagee, the televangelist and founder of Christians United for Israel who has backed Israel’s expansion as a route toward Armageddon, after which “there will be 1,000 years of perfect peace, no presidential elections, no fake news, none of all of this nonsense”.In the US, Christian Zionists have tied their support for Israel’s claim to Palestinian lands to the book of Genesis, in which it says that God blesses those who bless Israel, and curses those who curse it.Hagee once claimed he had persuaded Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem bytelling him at a White House dinnerthat Jesus was coming back to Jerusalem to “set up His throne on the Temple Mount where He will sit and rule for 1,000 years of perfect peace”.Trump has offered other tokens to pro-settler groups, including the repeal of Biden administration sanctions against individuals and groups accused of expansion and violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.The situation may indicate that in the circles of those who surround him, pro-settler figures are ascendant. They include Huckabee and Elise Stefanik, the US ambassador-designate to the UN, who during a confirmation hearing said she supported statements by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich that Israel had a “biblical right to the entire West Bank”.Others, including Witkoff, represent a wing of Trump’s supporters who are less hawkish on Israel and more focused on cutting transactional deals across the world.Jeremy Ben-Ami, the head of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel organisation, said before the summit that Trump had two choices: the “dealmaker route” or the “screw-it path”. For Saudi Arabia to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, he said, Trump would have to at least seek to restrain Israel from expanding settlements in the West Bank.But, Ben-Ami said: “If he’s going down the screw-it path – ‘I don’t really care what anybody thinks, and I want Greenland and Panama and they can have the West Bank’ – then we’re in a different world.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

Should he succeed, though, the impact would be significant, with a recent study finding that electric car sales could fall by 27% without the incentive.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead more“Turning off the credits would affect a meaningful share of the EV market,” said Joseph Shapiro, a University of California, Berkeley, economist and co-authorof the study, who added that while a growing number of people would still go electric, the total number of cars sold would shrink by more than 300,000 a year than if the incentives stayed in place.“You could say that it would be a speed bump in the road but if the US goes all electric in 2090 rather than 2050, say, that matters a lot for the planet,” he said. “A lot of carbon would be emitted in that time.”Trump’s agenda has been enthusiastically backed by Musk, despite the world’s richest person headingTesla, the market-leading EV company that also relies upon some parts made in China that may be targeted by tariffs imposed by Trump.Musk has said, though, that removal of EV subsidies will hurt rivals such as Ford and General Motors more thanTesla. “Take away the subsidies,” Musk wrote on X, another of his companies, in July. “It will only help Tesla.”There is some logic to this, Shapiro said. Tesla is comfortably the largest EV brand in the US, accounting for nearlyhalf of all sales, and makes more profit per car than its rivals, meaning the removal of incentives would be disproportionately felt by other manufacturers.View image in fullscreenA Tesla car is parked at a charging station in Burbank, California, on 29 January.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPA“If the tax credit is removed Tesla could survive and have less competition, they have more headroom to withstand a decrease in the market size,” Shapiro said. Stock in Teslasurgedfollowing Trump’s election win.However, Tesla will still be affected. Weakening federal pollution rules, for example, could see a reduction in the amount of carbon credits Teslasellsto other car companies – amounting to $2.7bn just last year – to offset their emissions and avoid fines. Tesla’s salesdipped slightlyfor the first time in 2024,amid concernamong some of its traditionally liberal customer base about Musk’s rightward political turn.“Tesla isn’t immune to sales being impacted, they have some brand loyalty although we don’t know what the impactElon Muskhas had on polarizing consumers yet, that’s still a bit of an unknown,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, which estimates EVs will have a 10% share of US car sales this year, up from 8% in 2024.From showers to tiny fish to windmills, Trump’s climate policies are driven by fixationsRead moreRegardless, Musk’s focus has now seemingly shifted away from EVs to other areas such asrobotics,artificial intelligenceand hisSpaceXventure, Valdez Streaty said. He has also embraced rightwing fixations shared by Trump. In a speech after the president was inaugurated, Musk made no mention of cars but said that the “future of civilization is assured” with “safe cities, secure borders, sensible spending, basic stuff”.He added: “We’re going to take Doge to Mars,” in reference to the “department of government efficiency”he heads in an effort to curb spending. “Can you imagine how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time? Bam. Bam. Yeah. How inspiring would that be?”Concern over the climate crisis is seemingly no longer one of Musk’s priorities, despite previously saying he is “super pro-climate” and in 2016 calling for a “popular uprising” against the fossil fuel industry because the world was “unavoidably headed toward some level of harm and the sooner we can take action, the less harm will result”.When Trump removed the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, Musk said he was quitting a presidential advisory body in protest. “Climate change is real,” hetweetedat the time. “Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.”But Musk has had little to say after Trump, who memorably called climate change “a giant hoax”, once againpulled the US from the Paris dealandissued a flurry of ordersto ramp up oil and gas drilling and stymie renewable energy production. In January, Musksaid: “Climate change risk is real, just much slower than alarmists claim.”Critics say it is unlikely Musk will reflect the growing alarm voiced by scientists, and the Americanpublic, over theimpactsof dangerous global heatingwithin theTrump administration.“It just shows he’s an opportunist, really,” said Paul Bledsoe, who was a climate adviser to Bill Clinton’s White House. “He now downplays the dangers of climate change, but I think in the back of his mind he’s thinking about using government contracts for geoengineering as the costs of climate change become so undeniably expensive.”Those who know Musk say that he soured on Democrats in part after not being invited to a major summit on electric cars held by the White House in 2021, after Joe Biden became president.How US states are leading the climate fight – despite Trump’s rollbacksRead more“That was an unforced error by Biden,” said Robert Zubrin, a leading advocate for human exploration of Mars who said he helped introduce Musk to theidea of Martian expansion. “And in the past two years, Elon Musk has redefined himself from the white knight of environmentalists to a Bond villain.”Zubrin said that Musk’s “central motivation is the desire for eternal glory for doing great deeds. He wants to save civilization because he wants to be famous for saving civilization.“This desire for eternal glory for doing great deeds has motivated his primary accomplishments, Tesla and SpaceX,” he added. “But it also has a dark side to it, and this has been exploited.”Tesla was contacted about its stance towards the EV tax credits but did not respond.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTeslaDonald TrumpClimate crisisUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, he and Carlile made his best album in decades. They talk tantrums, mortality – and being tactful with TrumpByLaura SnapesFri 7 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 06.25 ESTShareBy the time Elton John retired from touring in 2023, everyone knew his story. It followed a memoir and a biopic, which cemented the Elton lore: how in 1967 jobbing musician Reg Dwight was given an envelope of Bernie Taupin’s lyrics, forging the greatest songwriting partnership since Lennon and McCartney, a baroque new identity, a rampant hit rate of era-defining albums and the commensurate cocaine addiction. Then came sobriety, an emphatic commitment to funding HIV and Aids treatment, finding love with David Furnish; The Lion King, Candle in the Wind, one of the UK’s first gay marriages, two sons. Last year, the documentaryNever Too Latetold his story again. Just last month, his greatest hits collection, Diamonds, finally hit UK No 1 after 374 weeks. No one could ask for a more enduring brand, a more deserved curtain call. John has different ideas.“I’m 77. If I don’t push myself, Laura, what’s the point in carrying on?” he says, via video call in early January. “Just be ‘Elton John’ for the rest of my life? Which would have filled me with absolute fucking horror.”John is sitting next to Grammy-winning Americana artist Brandi Carlile, 43, at his Los Angeles breakfast table. They can see the wildfires outside. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” says John. “It’s apocalyptic.” He wears a navy Gucci tracksuit and pointy blue glasses, more out of habit than for his sight – as right now John can hardly see at all. Last summer he contracted a severe eye infection, delaying the release of his and Carlile’s surprise album – only his second full-length collaboration, after 2010’sThe Union with his hero Leon Russell.John, an impatient workaholic, might disagree about the wait, but Who Believes in Angels? was worth the delay. A hinge-rattling Americana-tinged rock’n’roll album, it’s enough to make you pity John’s piano, presumably reduced to splinters from the ecstatic walloping it gets here. It’s easily the best album he has made this century, a more authentic embrace of the present than recent remixes of his classic hits with Dua Lipa and Britney Spears. “I could do an ‘Elton John’ record easily,” he says. “That’s what I didn’t want to do any more. I wanted a challenge.”View image in fullscreenHeadline act … fans watch John live at Glastonbury in 2023.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAfter headlining Glastonbury in 2023, says John, “I wanted to put all my old stuff to bed.” He propositioned Carlile, a lifelong fan of his turned confidante. “I was like, Elton, really, I don’t sell records,” she says. “And he’s like, I don’t care – you’re about to now, baby.”John had a lot of ideas. Maybe they could beRobert Plant and Alison Krauss. Or a modern Eurythmics. Or Patsy Cline and Buddy Holly. “Then one day,” Carlile, a born storyteller, says with a grin, “he says: let’s not be any of that. Let’s just be ourselves – and we don’t know what that is. Don’t write, don’t do anything in advance. And that’s when it got really dangerous.”Between Glastonbury and entering the studio with Carlile in Los Angeles, John had hit his head, was recovering from a second hip replacement and needed a new knee. But he didn’t want to cancel and let anyone down. “I was very grumpy, I was tired, I didn’t feel well and I was extremely nervous,” says John. “And that nervousness caused quite a few sparks to fly.”It’s one for the annals of understatement. Carlile appears for a solo interview a few hours earlier, an uncanny experience in which disembodied hands do her makeup as she talks. “He smashed his iPad,” she says, wide-eyed. “He smashed headphones. There were really amazing, classic Elton John outbursts. My lyrics got torn up and thrown on the ground – he goes: ‘Fuck off, Brandi.’ He would yell: ‘Predictable! Cliche!’”“It wasn’t me being anxious about other people,” says John, “it was me being anxious about me. Once we got through the first three songs, we knew we had something. And I was much more relaxed … but I was a bit of a nightmare.”There was so much riding on my perception of Elton versus who Elton really isBrandi CarlileCo-writing the lyrics alongside Taupin, with John writing the music, Carlile was equally anxious. “It was unspeakable pressure, because it could be really, fundamentally invalidating of who I am musically,” she says. “When I got signed in my early 20s, I’d read artists trashing one another in the press, and I remember thinking: what if I ever got famous and Elton John didn’t like my music? It was odd, as a woman past 40, to have that feeling again as it was about to happen in real life.”Taupin was in the studio; Andrew Watt, who led the Rolling Stones’ comebackHackney Diamonds, was producing, a copy of John’s live album 17-11-70 positioned above the desk as a reminder of the energy he wanted. John wanted to do a “proper duet record”, he says. “Not one line here, one line there, I wanted to harmonise.” But not only was singing to Carlile’s phrasing tough, he reacted to her and Taupin’s lyrics as he first encountered them at the piano, prompting on-the-hoof rewrites.View image in fullscreen‘Elton doesn’t like listening to stories of my childhood love for him’ … John and Carlile at this year’s Golden Globes.Photograph: Rich Polk/GG2025/Penske Media/Getty Images“He would start singing and cutting shit or saying words the wrong way, and I would get in and fix the issue,” says Carlile, pulling anohGodface. “That’s what Bernie’s job has always been. You can call it momentum or extreme impatience – they’re the same. You don’t stop Elton, you frantically replace the lyric in front of him and then he’s singing that. It was really volatile, but really cool.”When John blew up, Carlile never told him that he had crossed a line, “but there were definitely points that I felt that”, she says. To defuse things,Taupin– “poetic and cryptic, but also really paternal and helpful” – would take her for whisky sours and steak at his favourite diner. John’s outbursts, however, served a purpose, making a hero human-sized. “Elton doesn’t want to be put on a pedestal,” she says. “He doesn’t like listening to stories of my childhood love for him. There was so much riding on my perception of Elton versus who Elton really is.”Carlile first learned about John when writing a school report aboutRyan White, a teenager who died from Aids in 1990 after contracting HIV from a contaminated blood treatment. John supported his family, which inspired the newly sober musician to dedicate himself to HIV and Aids healthcare, feeling that he hadn’t helped enough while strung out at the height of the crisis.Growing up in Washington state in the 90s, Carlile “lived in a mobile home with conservative parents”, she says. “I’d never met a gay person in my life. Didn’t even really know what a liberal thinker was. Also, Elton had got sober; my dad had attempted to get sober and he didn’t get through it at that time. He represented the exact opposite of what my life was.”She had never even seen a picture of John until she borrowed a biography from the library. “I was like, what the fuck is going on with this guy! He’s amazing!” While her classmates had just about grasped John’s existence from The Lion King, the teenage Carlile, now out, dressed in a white satin suit to perform Honky Cat at a talent show. She wrote John and Taupin letters; aged 18, she went to LA to meet a producer who shared management with Taupin. “He had a desk at the manager’s office,” she says. “I had a little Polaroid camera, I took a picture and sat in the chair.”View image in fullscreenBreakthrough year … Carlile on stage in Chicago in 2007.Photograph: Lyle A Waisman/WireImageCarlile did get signed, breaking through as a singular lyricist with a gale-force voice with her 2007 album The Story, produced by T Bone Burnett. Soon after, she sent John another letter, during his Vegas residency, which led to him appearing on her 2009 album Give Up the Ghost, and to a friendship. After she married charity co-ordinator Catherine Shepherd in 2012, “something changed”, she says. “He had just had kids and knew that we wanted to. He wasn’t just supportive of my music any more; suddenly he was really invested in my personal life.”Their relationship – in which John might call several times a day to gossip, then hang up – inspired Carlile to relate to her parents anew. “Elton showed me how to have a relationship with people I really love when I don’t have time to labour over all of life. I call my parents now every chance I get, but I’ve only got two minutes – and that’s OK.”She may say no, but Brandi brought me back to lifeElton JohnTo listen to John and Carlile talk on their joint call is to be caught in the crossfire of an ardent love-in. He calls her “phenomenal” and insists “she pushed me more than I pushed her”. They bicker lovingly over which one of them is really “saving” the other. In 2019, John watched Carlile perform Joni Mitchell’s Blue in Los Angeles, in front of Mitchell, and was “absolutely floored”.“He called me a crazy bitch!” Carlile laughs.“I thought, I’ve got to work with this person,” says John. “She wants to take risks. I’d have been shitting myself.”Carlile, famously, had coaxed Mitchell to start performing again after a brain aneurysm in 2015 left her unable to play. John joined their backyard “Joni Jams”, which he likens to “an old postwar sing-song around the piano. If you don’t sing, you can’t come.” In October,they sang I’m Still Standing together(albeit sitting) at the Hollywood Bowl. “Music brought Joni back to life,” says John. “To a certain extent, and she may say no, but Brandi brought me back to life.”“I do say no,” she says, “but I love that you say that.”View image in fullscreenJoni Mitchell gives a rare interview to Elton John, on his Rocket Hour show on Apple Music 1.Photograph: Apple MusicTheir unvarnished connection inspired Brandi to write about the experience of being in the studio together, inspired by Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, lyricist Taupin’s 1975 portrayal of his and John’s friendship. The rapturous title track and stirring Someone to Belong To cherish the rewards of their brutal honesty; Never Too Late crystallises John’s capacity for survival. “Fuck off, heaven’s gate!” he sings, stealing the “fuck off!” mantle from Succession’s Logan Roy. “That was what I was thinking!” says Carlile. “Brian Cox should not have that crown. That’s Elton’s crown.”A wider theme coalesced. The album’s baroque curtain-raiser, The Rose of Laura Nyro, pays homage tothe sorely underrated US songwriter, one even less remembered as an LGBTQ+ iconoclast. As a struggling young musician, John pored over the lilac-scented lyric sheet to her 1968 album Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. “I was astonished by the variety of her songwriting and the fact that the songs didn’t follow the normal pattern,” he says. “They slowed down, they sped up. She never really got the dues that she should have.”“Joni loves her too,” says Carlile, “and Joni’s a hard one.”“Joni doesn’t like many people!” John stage-whispers, leaning in, and they crack up.Then the ripping Little Richard’s Bible portrays John’s oft-cited hero swerving from outrageousness back to religion when the money ran out. It’s an opening salvo that celebrates LGBTQ+ trailblazers, but it’s not straightforward: highlighting forgotten histories and self-doubt, even self-loathing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Many people will know of his Aids Foundation’s glamorous Oscars viewing party, for example, but less so the fact that the organisation has made HIV testing available in Walmart. “I think what Glastonbury did for me, and for my reputation in England, was something I’d yearned for all my life,” he says. In America, he feels better understood. “I know what you mean about the cuddly … That’s why I wanted to put the old Elton to bed.”He gives himself credit. “When I was the gay chairman of a football club” – his beloved Watford FC – “we were very successful,” he says. “That was pretty radical. But I’m not Bowie, and I’m not Mick. And I’ve never been ‘cool’ like Nick Cave – who I adore. I’m just me and I have to accept that, but that gives me the inspiration to change a little bit with this record and say: come on, you don’t want to be cuddly Elton for the rest of your life.”Curiously, his press team, present on mute, seem less keen. Last year, John remarked thatDonald Trumpcalling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “rocketman” was “brilliant”, adding that Trump was a fan: “I’ve always been friendly toward him and I thank him for his support,” he said. As he later clarified, clearly they have different values: does John have to be diplomatic to maintain presidential support for Aids treatment? The muted windows spring to life in distorted protest.“I can answer this,” says John, as a voice says: “We’re at time now.” (We aren’t.) “I have the Aids thing to be very aware of, and Pepfar [the US president’s emergency plan for Aids relief globally] is very important for continuing to help people who need the money. And so far, it’s always been kept up by the American government, Trump included; Democrats, Republicans. It was started by a Republican. I have to be diplomatic and fight for those people. My job is not to take sides, my job is to try and keep the money flowing so that people can live a normal life.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with John in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1990.Photograph: Jeffrey Asher/Getty ImagesThree weeks after we speak,Trump freezes Pepfarand instructs foreign organisations to stop distributing HIV medication bought with US aid, with appointments being cancelled, treatment interrupted and patients turned away from clinics. Ina statement, John’s Aids Foundation urged the US government “to fully reinstate all global HIV funding as soon as possible” and said the country’s “history-defining” gains in the fight “may be hard or impossible to recoup”.During the interview,I paused to see whether the PRs were trying to say anything important. “It’s just that they wouldn’t want me to talk about politics, but it’s a good question and it’s what I have to do,” says John, jumping in. “Politics is always about tactics and playing your cards right. People rely on me – and a lot of other people – to try and keep the money coming and that’s what I have to do and I’m determined to do.”John’s determination is not limitless. One bittersweet new song, Little Light, reflects on a moment he and Carlile shared at this very breakfast table. “She was staying next door, she came in and I was pretty down,” says John. “It was Israel- Gaza. I said, look at this, the world is fucked. I don’t know why we’re in the studio recording when this is going on. She wrote the song that day and we recorded it that day.”“He was contemplating not doing the album,” says Carlile. “He was like, maybe this is not the time. My verse is what I wish I’d said.”“It’s such a fine line between faith and apathy,” she sings, evoking the Italian philosopher Gramsci’s saying about having pessimism of the intellect but optimism of the will. “You could tattoo that quote on him,” Carlile says of John.“I’m an optimist permanently,” he says. “I’ve got bad eyesight at the moment. There have been days where I’ve been miserable, but then I think about how lucky I am. I’ve got a new respect for sight-impaired people and people who are totally blind, some of whom I’m in touch with. But to hell with it, I’ve got a great life, and hopefully my sight will improve. What she’s saying is I’ve overcome a lot. This is not going to beat me. I’ve beaten addiction, I’ve beaten health issues, and I can pick myself up and dust myself off.”Overall, Who Believes in Angels? looks resolutely forward. Carlile’s Swing for the Fences – a more riotous riff on the theme of her Grammy-winning 2018 anthem The Joke – is a Stonesy cry for queer youth to break the rules. Between that and You Without Me, her gorgeous, one-take solo song about watching the elder of her two daughters become her own person (“that’s the feeling every parent gets – you’re proud and devastated the first time they decide not to go your way”), the album suggests that a key part of legacy is creating the space for new generations to write fresh scripts.We had this profound moment where Elton came face to face with his mortality without really being able to say itBrandi CarlileAs John did with Nyro and Little Richard, ardent admirers such as the pop starChappell Roanhave taken his influence somewhere new, beyond him. To that end, the album closes with Taupin’s valedictory ballad When This Old World Is Done With Me. As ever, John first tackled the brand new lyrics at the piano. Carlile typically sat behind him, so close her knees touched his bum, ready as the “butterfly catcher” to sing along with great melodies that John might otherwise let slip by – watching him come to life off the page, as she had as a kid. “He got to the line, ‘return me to – the tide’,” she says, adding a stumble, “and I go, ah shit, he’s gonna cry.”John had realised the song was about the end of his life, something only a friend of six decades could have written. “The glasses came off, his whole body is crumpled over the piano, he wept,” says Carlile. “I put my arms around him and held him and he didn’t really talk about it. He’s a bit butch, a stoic, a man’s man. Andrew [Watt], he’s very dramatic, like a Jewish grandmother. He comes running in with tissues. We’re having this really profound moment where Elton has come face to face with his mortality without really being able to say it.View image in fullscreenJohn on stage in New Zealand in 2020 during his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.Photograph: Kerry Marshall/Getty Images“When he looks up, we’re like, what’s he gonna say? And he goes: ‘Is it too Lion King?’“I said, ‘No, no!’ Andrew burst out laughing. Elton burst out laughing. It was unbelievable. At first, it was the saddest thing I’ve ever seen, and then it got really funny, really fast.”“It touched a nerve,” says John, “because I have children now and I have a husband, and it’s not just being ‘Elton’ on his own, it’s wanting to be with the people I love.” He asked Watt to put a brass band over the ending. “It’s beautiful, spiritual music. Something about a brass band moves you so much – colliery bands with the miners; watching the cup final as a kid it was always Abide With Me with a brass band, and I always used to cry.”John recently had the chance to rehearse his own death, filming a scene for Spinal Tap 2 in which he’s killed off in concert. That was the fun bit, but driving back into a huge auditorium, having quit touring, gave him a panic attack. “I did kind of hyperventilate,” says John. “I said, ‘Jesus, I’m so glad I don’t have to do this any more.’”Carlile differs. “I want to die on stage,” she says.“I used to say that,” says John, “but I don’t want to. Well – I can’t. I’ve retired.”Elton John’s 50 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreThe perks of being off the road, he says, are that he can “throw out the shit and just pick the good stuff”. As well as continuing to treat his sight, he’ll heartily promote this album and keep doing his Apple Music radio show, highlighting new artists.

But why is it so hard to accept this natural part of ageing?Stuart HeritageandRudi ZygadloexplainOnce,Stuart Heritage’shead was covered in thick, golden, shiny hair. But then, when he was in his early 20s, he noticed a small patch of scalp showing through. At first he tried a hair regrowth treatment, but it didn’t make much difference. As this patch grew, he began brushing his hair over the bald area. Before he knew it, he says, he was horrified to find he was sporting a combover. “Going bald is horrible,” he says ruefully.Once you have accepted this loss, however, and that it means you are ageing, actually “being bald is fine”. And not just fine – commonplace. He tellsHelen Piddthat about 55% of Caucasian men aged over 75 will have experienced some hair loss. Which is why bald heads used to be ubiquitous in popular culture. There were bald footballers, bald movie stars and bald prime ministers. Yet today they seem to be fading from view.Because today more and more men are turning to hair transplants to swerve baldness. Among them is the Today in Focus sound designer,Rudi Zygadlo.He explains why, despite having older brothers who had been through hair loss, he struggled to accept his own. Instead, he says, he spent almost 10 years wearing hats, and worrying whenever there was a chance he might have to remove them in front of others. After going to Turkey for his surgery, he says his hairline anxiety hasn’t gone away but life no longer feels like an “obstacle course”.If baldness becomes a thing of the past and bald stars disappear from view, will society feel the loss? Stuart thinks so. “When you see a bald person, you’re seeing someone who’s living their life – maybe not in the way that they’ve envisioned it, and it might only be the smallest inconvenience to them but their life hasn’t turned out 100% the way they wanted it to, but they’re getting on with it and it’s fine.”Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHair lossToday in FocusMen's hair"

Khartoum has largely been in the control of the RSF since theopening salvoes of the warin April 2023.Battlefield updates indicate a shift in momentum, with one army source confirming its troops were “close to reaching the centre of Khartoum”.Babikir Elamin, the head of mission at the Sudanese embassy in London, said he expected the SAF to recapture the entire capital in a matter of days.He said: “There are just pockets [of RSF] in Khartoum, some in an area we call the eastern Nile. It will be a matter of days before Khartoum is cleared of RSF.”In nearby Omdurman, Sudan’s second largest city, home to about 2.4 million people, clashes have escalated including an incident last weekend in which the RSF killed at least 54 civilians in anattack on a market.Elamin said: “Omdurman is almost free of RSF and Khartoum North is free of RSF.”The war between the army and RSF has been calamitous for Africa’s third largest country, killing tens of thousands of people, forcing 12 million to leave their homes and pushing regions into famine. In Khartoum alone, at least 3.6 million residents have fled the violence.The battlefield developments come days after the Sudanese military broke an RSF siege of its headquarters in Khartoum, allowing the army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to visit for the first time since the war began.That in turn followed the SAF recentlyrecapturingthe strategically vital city of Wad Madani, the capital of Sudan’s breadbasket, about 110 miles (180km) south of Khartoum.The advances potentially set up the prospect of Darfur, thesprawling regionof western Sudan, providing the backdrop for the final battles of the war. Intelligence indicates that many of RSF fighters have already retreated to the western Darfur region, where the paramilitary group hails from.Except for the North Darfur capital, El Fasher, which is under sustained attack and siege by the RSF, the group controls the region.Last week, teams from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Darfur and Khartoum said they were coping with “mass influxes of war-wounded patients”, confirmation of the escalating violence in both areas.Experts say the dire humanitarian situation in Sudan will be amplified by Donald Trump’s intention toclose the US’s lead international aid agency, USAid.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

With an election looming, all parties are scrambling to portray themselves as patriotic and ready to defend the country’s sovereignty.In Quebec, where provincial sovereigntists have experienced a surge in popularity, the number of people calling for a referendum on the province’s secessionhas dropped.

Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardMat YoukeeUS had made inroads against Chinese influence in Panama, but Trump’s demands could help Beijing expand its regional powerFri 7 Feb 2025 10.31 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTShareWhen Panama’s then president Juan Carlos Varela was invited to the White House in June 2017,Donald Trumpsaid thePanama canalwas doing “pretty well” and described the bilateral relationship as “very strong”.Just days earlier, Varela had broken ties with Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations withChina, but there was no indication that this snub to a key US ally had clouded the meeting.Over the next two years, promises of Chinese investment flooded intoPanama. There were contracts to build bridges, ports, energy projects and a proposal for a high-speed rail line. Negotiations for a free trade agreement began and a giant plot of land near the entrance to the canal was set aside for a Chinese embassy.In the following years, however, US diplomatic efforts and back-channel pressure in effect curtailed growing Chinese influence on the isthmus. Now, Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric and maximalist negotiating positions threaten to undermine a hitherto successful strategy.The US was caught cold by Panama’s 2017 diplomatic switch to Beijing, but within months the state department was devising a response. That September, the US recalled its ambassadors to Panama, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic (the other two nations to establish ties with Beijing in 2017), and the following month, then secretary of state Mike Pompeo visited Panama City to warn the government of China’s “predatory economic activity”.Panama the new flashpoint in China’s growing presence in Latin AmericaRead morePanama’s dollarized economy is highly vulnerable to US pressure – as is its business elite, which banks, does business and sends it children to school in the US. Since 2016, US authorities have arrested oneformer presidentand hissons, banned Varela from entering the country due to “significant corruption” and blacklisted prominent businessmen. Senior politicians have been called to Washington for closed-door talks at the state department or found themselves unexpectedly detained and questioned at US airports.Such back-channel coercion proved a successful strategy. US pressureplayed a rolein cancelling the proposed Chinese embassy, and the free trade talks with Beijing silently slid off the agenda. Chinese firms found themselves losing out on key infrastructure projectsdespite tenderingthe lowest bids. The existing projects, including a bridge over the canal, a greenfield port in the Caribbean and a gas-power plant, were either abandoned or left in indefinite limbo. Air China cancelled its flights to Panama.The only exception came in 2021, when the Panamanian government opted to extend a Hong Kong-based company’s contract to operate ports at either end of the canal. That contract is at the center of Marco Rubio’s claims that the current situation around the canal is “unacceptable”.The July 2024 election of José Raúl Mulino, a pro-US technocrat, to the Panamanian presidency offered the state department the opportunity to continue its successful low-visibility strategy. Mulino’s very first act was to sign an agreement with the US tocurb irregular migration through the Darién Gap. His administration’s signature infrastructure project – a railroad between Panama City and the Costa Rican border – was originally proposed by China, but in January its first major contract wasawarded to a US firm.Almost immediately however, Trump insisted, falsely and very publicly, that “Chinese soldiers” operate the canal and pledged to “take it back”.Mulino has since said he is willing to concede on all of the US’s legitimate strategic concerns, agreeing to expand security infrastructure in the Darien and promising to exit China’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure initiative. The contentious ports are now being audited anda legal case has been lodged to declare them unconstitutional. The likely termination of that contract would end any meaningful Chinese presence around the canal.But that is not, it seems, enough for Trump.He has said he is unhappy with Rubio’s statements following the visit and has repeated that he wants the US to administer the canal. This would be an intolerable affront to Panamanian national identity and a hammer blow to the country’s already fragile economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US navy ships already jump to the front of the line for transits and have paid just $17m in transit fees over the last nine years.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreBy forcing this point – to no meaningful benefit – the US is putting Mulino in an impossible position. Conferring preferential free treatment to the US, expressly forbidden under the canal’s neutrality treaty, would put the Panamanian government in serious legal jeopardy, according to experts.Trump has shown that he can bully his allies in the western hemisphere, but by pushing beyond strategic imperatives in an effort to humiliate an ally, his strategy could backfire in the long run.At present, Latin American nations have little option but to bend to Trump’s threats of tariffs or military action. But if they believe these threats will be made repeatedly, in effect curtailing their ability to make policy independent of the US, they will be forced to look for alternative allies.The region does not lack for governments – mostly autocracies – that have sided with Tehran, Beijing or Moscow. Trump could help them swell their number.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyPanama canalDonald TrumpPanamaChinaTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is thought to be some kind of organic colouring.”An AFP journalist said the colour of the waters had faded by late on Thursday afternoon.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaRiversPollutionAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The group was bound for Alberta and made the journey in “incredibly cold” weather. A second group, composed of six adults from Jordan, Sudan, Chad and Mauritius, was found in a forest near Manitoba’s border with the US after an RCMP plane using thermal cameras detected them. Neither group had clothing suitable for the frigid conditions.View image in fullscreenAssistant Commissioner Lisa Moreland.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockMoreland said the people might have succumbed to a “heartbreaking situation” similar to the freezing death ofthe Patel family, the Indian couple who died alongside their toddler and 11-year-old near the border in 2022. “There’s the cross-border piece, but also the humanity piece,” she said. “[There have been] incidents where people did not make it.”Underscoring the deadly realities of the northern border in the winter, a man extradited from Canada was arraigned in New York state on human smuggling charges on Thursday over the death of a 33-year-old pregnant woman from Mexico. Searchers found footprints in the snow leading to a New York river, where Ana Vasquez-Flores drowned in December 2023.Ever since he was elected, Donald Trump has turned his focus to Canada’s border with the United States, alleging it is the source of vast amounts of fentanyl and illegal migration – neither of which is borne out by evidence.US Customs and Border Protection says 23,721 people were apprehended last fiscal year crossing its northern border, up from the 2,238 caught two years prior. But border agents made 1.5 million apprehensions at the border with Mexico last year.Still, to appease the president, Canada’s federal government has promised Trump C$1.3bn (US$900m) in spending along the border, including two Black Hawk helicopters and drones. Provincial premiers have also committed new resources. Earlier this year, Alberta’s premier, Danielle Smith, said her province would create a new sheriff patrol unit, with 50 armed sheriffs, 10 cold weather surveillance drones and several drug detection dogs at a cost of C$29m.Moreland said police were “doing our part to secure the border” but none of the apprehensions are linked to new border efforts.Trump’s victory last year – and a promise to enact the country’s largest mass deportation – initiallyprompted concern among political leaders in Canada that the country could experience a surge of immigrantsfleeing north and crossing unpatrolled areas of the 5,500-mile border –as happened during Trump’s first term.“What we saw in the days and weeks after Trump won was fearmongering,” said Abdulla Daoud of the Refugee Centre in Montreal. “And none of that – the idea that hundreds of thousands would come to the border – has ever come to fruition.”During Trump’s first term in office, tens of thousands of Haitians fled to Canada after the president ended temporary protected status for the group.In January 2017, Trudeau posted on social media: “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength#WelcomeToCanada.”Canadian minister says ‘not everyone is welcome’ amid Trump migrant threatRead moreIn 2022, nearly 40,000 people enteredCanadaat Roxham Road, an informal crossing in the forests of upstate New York that has become a political flashpoint in recent years. The following year, Canadaoverhauled an agreement with the United States on the border, in effect shutting down Roxham Road as a point of entry.The closure shut off irregular crossings but asylum claims at ports of entry have since increased. “The data shows that many of them – 83% – are successful in court. The majority of people coming to claim asylum are actually in danger and are seeking safety from persecution,” said Daoud.Even in the face of crackdowns and the threat of deportation, no notable uptick of irregular crossings into Canada has been recorded.Daoud said the wave of people that fled for Canada in 2017 were those using the United States as a transition because there was no way for them to claim asylum.“But now Trump is targeting individuals in the United States who have been there for decades. Some were even born there. It’s a totally different profile of person now.”Under the current rule, a person can make an asylum claim if they remain undetected in Canada for 14 days, incentivizing risky and possibly deadly crossings.“The current rules, and the landscape, are very much a deterrent to most people,” said Daoud. “But we’ll still see people crossing because the reality is, that it’s not a deterrent for those with no options left.”This article was amended on 7 February 2025. Justin Trudeau posted his #WelcomeToCanada message in January 2017 in response to the US entry ban on citizens from Muslim-majority countries, not Haitians as an earlier version suggested.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He did not give any details specifying what the tariffs will be and which countries would be affected.“I’ll be announcing that next week reciprocal trade, so that we’re treated evenly with other countries. We don’t want any more, any less,” Trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba.On Tuesday, the US Postal Service briefly halted all incoming packages from China and Hong Kong after Trump ended ade minimisprovision that allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free.The provision allowed Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu to ship items into the US without having to pay tariffs Trump had enacted on China in 2018. After a 12-hour period, the US Postal Service resumed taking all packages on Wednesday.Anexecutive order, signed by Trump, said he would keep the provision until “adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue”.The president had removed the duty-free provision as his overall tariff strategy against China, what he says is in response to illegal drugs that are coming in from the country. Trumpplaced a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, which went into effect this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joe Biden did not repeal the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by his predecessor; and indeed erected new barriers in the form of restrictions on exports of important technologies such as semiconductors. (Ironically it appears to be the difficulty in getting hold of the most sophisticated chips, that has partly drivenChina’s development of the cut-price AI-powered chatbot, DeepSeek).When China was integrated into the global trading system, joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) back in 2001, it was meant to bind the populous communist state into a rules-based international system.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump Trump lays much of the blame for US economic woes with Beijing’s policies.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/ReutersThe more closely aligned Beijing became with the global economy, the theory went, the less likely geopolitical tensions would erupt. The real optimists even hoped that over time, China might be guided away from communism.Almost a quarter of a century later, western economies remain scarred by the failures of the global financial crisis and the US manufacturing sector has been hollowed out.That has happened for many reasons, but Trump lays much of the blame with Beijing’s policies, which have included protecting domestic industries and keeping its currency – the yuan – cheap enough to continue generating extraordinary export-led growth.China’s trade surplus in 2024 hit a record $1tn (£810bn), with exports up 10% over the year. Itran a hefty $295bn trade surpluswith the US in 2024 – although that was well below the record $418bn in 2018..American consumers have benefited in the form of a flood of cheap goods – not least those manufactured in China on behalf of US companies. But Trump sees the US’s wide trade deficit with China as evidence of Beijing cheating. He wants to close the gap – by bringing jobs and investment home.As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank points out, the US produces 15% of the world’s manufactured goods and accounts for almost 30% of global consumption. China produces a whopping 32% of manufactured goods, and makes up just 12% of global consumption..Economic theory tends to suggest that as economies develop, they specialise in making and exporting the products where they have particular strengths, and diversify into a more service-based model of growth, as a growing middle class consumes more. But for China, that has not happened.“China’s economic development in recent years, instead of moving it towards a consumer-oriented economy, has moved in the direction of a more advancedmanufacturing economy,” Reid says.He adds: “This may now have gone too far. Access to cheaper goods is no longer a good ‘trade’ for the US, given the loss of economic security over production supply chains and technologies to a competing power.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion.The solution, the Trump administration firmly believes, is for the US to produce more at home. As Bessent put it this week: “Tariffs are a means to an end, and I think that end is bringing the manufacturing base back to the US.”So while what Trump appears to want from Mexico and Canada is a series of ill-defined political actions, he has a clear goal in his interaction with China, and that involves closing the trade gap.Given Trump’s history it will be no surprise that he is likely to seek a deal with Beijing, but Bessent has also played up the possibility of a grand bargain – perhaps along the lines of the Plaza accord, named after the New York hotel in which it was struck in 1985 between a string of countries including the US, Germany, Japan and indeed the UK.View image in fullscreenChina has become a more advancedmanufacturing economy in recent years.Photograph: APThat historic agreement included a decision to allow the dollar to depreciate against other major currencies, in an attempt to narrow the US current account deficit – a measure that includes borrowing from foreign creditors, as well as the trade balance.While it is less visible, the US imbalance with China includes Beijing’s vast holdings of US treasuries – effectively, loans to the US government – which were worth $770bn at the end of 2024, second only to Japan, a geopolitical ally of Washington.Bessent has appeared to back billionaire Elon Musk’s extraordinary onslaught on US government departments, via his role as head of the “department of government efficiency (Doge)”, because the treasury secretary appears to see a much smaller shortfall on the public finances, lessening the government’s dependence on overseas creditors and helping to bring down interest rates, as a key part of the Trump rebalancing project.As a starting point in dealing with Beijing, Trump has asked officials to examine China’s compliance with the “phase one” trade deal he struck with China in his first term, which came into effect in 2020. This included commitments to ramp up purchases of US goods and services.John Glen, the chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), suggests a grand bargain could also include a promise to cap exports – which he warns against.“We did it in the mid-1980s Plaza accord, when the Japanese agreed to voluntarily restrict the amount of cars they exported into the US and the UK. If you’re going to restrain trade that’s just about the worst way you’re going to do it. All it does is it means they make more money on every car they export.”There is a superficial logic to the idea of a grand bargain (some have suggested a “Mar-a-Lago Accord”), however. China has previously suggested it would like to boost domestic demand to make its economy less export-dependent.China’s vice-premier, Ding Xuexiang, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month: “We don’t seek [a] trade surplus. We want to import more competitive, quality products and services to promote balanced trade.”Yet China watchers point out that Beijing saw the Plaza accord as a disaster for Japan, contributing to the subsequent asset bubble, so it is unlikely to want to emulate such a sweeping agreement.Instead, Beijing is more likely to sign up to a symbolic deal in which it pledges more spending and investment in the US, but the deep divide between the two sides remains. “As important as Trump is, the forces driving this fracturing of the relationship between the US and China are just bigger than one person,” Shearing says.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeChinese economyGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Areas of low pressure and strong north-westerly winds brought cold air from other parts of Asia, causing the extreme weather.In the Takachi district of Obihiro, a city in the northern prefecture of Hokkaido, a record 129cm (4ft) of snowfall in 12 hours was measured this week. The conditions affected travel, with many vehicles stranded, trains and planes cancelled, and hundreds of schools closed.Temperatures in parts of Japan have dropped below -10C, and strong winds have led to rough seas along the north-west coastline. A further 40-80cm (16-32in) of snow fell during the second half of the week in several prefectures including Niigata, Tohoku, and Hokuriku.Prolonged torrential rainfall in Queensland, Australia, resulted in two deaths this week, and thousands of people were advised to seek higher ground after heavy flooding. More than 1,100mm of rain was dumped on the town of Ingham and the city of Townsville, equivalent to about six months’ worth of rain. As a result, about 10,000 homes were left without power and flood waters caused the partial collapse of a highway link, which hindered recovery efforts near Ingham on Sunday.Heavy rain and mountain snow hit parts ofCalifornia, triggering severe flooding and landslides. Palmetto, a neighbourhood about 17 miles east of the city of Chico, has recorded more than 600mm of rainfall since last Friday, and surrounding locations recorded well over 500mm. Mount Shasta, a ski resort in northern California, has reported 172cm (68in) of snow in the past week, of which 130cm (51in) fell in three days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Around the world, development programmes previously assisted by the USAid are panicking,warning of disastrous risksof escalatingfamine, death and disease.Authoritarian regimes around the world cheer on dismantling of USAidRead moreTrump’s plan involves the merger of the more than 60-year-oldUSAidinto the state department, shrinking its workforce and aligning its spending with his priorities. But analysts say it is working against one key priority – countering China.“[The US is handing] on a silver platter toChinathe perfect opportunity to expand its influence, at a time when China’s economy is not doing very well,” said Prof Huang Yanzhong, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.“What Trump is doing is basically providing China a perfect opportunity to rethink, to renew soft power projects, and get back on track to transglobal leadership.”More than one analyst described the shuttering ofUSAidas a “self-inflicted wound”.Global dynamics have been dominated by the ongoing US-China competition and a key battlefront is in the development sector as Washington and its allies vie against Beijing for influence in the global south.In 2018, the Chinese government created the standalone China International Development Cooperation Agency, or China Aid, to streamline China’s spending, including its foreign investment programme, the belt and road initiative (BRI). Beijing doesn’t disclose foreign aid budgets but a study by William & Mary’s Global Research Institute found China lent $1.34tn to developing nations between 2000 and 2021, mostly through the BRI. The new agency would “further the effectiveness of aid as a key foreign policy instrument”, according to a government press release at the time.While China Aid operates differently to USAid, by focusing more on loans and highly visible infrastructure projects rather than partnering with local organisations, both agencies have similar objectives – spreading their respective government’s soft power and influence.US foreign aid chartIt’s particularly focused on the Pacific, where the US, Australia and other allies have beentrying to counter China’s effortsto make security deals with the small but strategically located countries.Tom Wang, the executive director of Manila-based People of Asia for Climate Solutions, an environmental NGO that works in the Philippines and China, warned against “simplistic” narratives of China replacing US soft power overnight.Wang, whose organisation does not receive any US or Chinese government funding, noted that Chinese funders did not have the same long history of overseas development as USAid. “It’s not just the disappearance of money, it’s the disappearance of experience,” he said.Wang said that a bigger presence for China in the environmental space could be a blessing in disguise for some NGOs. “China might not be as good at supporting local groups in terms of financials, but what China is good at is technology, knowledge sharing, especially when it comes to renewable energy.”Still, Wang said, for NGOs in his sector, following the USAid stoppage, “the biggest impact is the anxiety”. He added: “All of a sudden, you have no way to continue your work … as an NGO campaigner or a climate activist, it’s quite a scary thing.”Melissa Conley Tyler, executive director of theAsia PacificDevelopment, Diplomacy and Defence Dialogue, tsaid she knew of at least one confirmed case in the region where China Aid had already stepped in to provide the funds pulled by USAid.“The US and Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, we have a strong interest in living in a world of liberal democracies and economies,” said George Ingram, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s centre for sustainable development and a former USAid official.“China, like Russia, is trying to advance an authoritarian world. The total opposite of what our interests are.”For now, any new China Aid support would be mostly rescuing programmes abandoned by USAid, like the example in the Pacific. But down the track that could change, Conley Tyler said.Doge v USAid: how Elon Musk helped his acolytes infiltrate world’s biggest aid agencyRead more“My biggest worry about China as a development actor is the way it often corrodes good governance and accountability in the country where it works. I don’t have a problem with any country being a development party … it’s a wonderful thing. But the way China does aidcan have a sort of corrupting effecton that.”There was also likely to be greatly reduced bargaining power for recipient nations. With USAid gone, programmes that previously reaped the benefits of two superpowers competing to fund their projects might just have to take what they can get.“They don’t have to significantly increase funding of the foreign aid levels in order to replace the US as leader in this field,” said Huang. “And … its narrative about international development, about how altruistic China is, becomes more convincing. So that also helps boost China’s soft power quickly.”Conley Tyler said the impact of the USAid suspension is far worse than what’s being reported because many programme workers are hoping if they keep quiet, funding might be restored at the end of the 90 days.But even if it is, broadly, the trust is gone.“Who is going to allow themselves to become dependent on US assistance if it’s fickle, if it doesn’t distinguish between allies and adversaries, if it could just be turned off on a political whim?” she said.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaUSAidTrump administrationAsia PacificUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kerr denies the charges.Making his closing argument, Bill Emlyn Jones for the prosecution said that despite the words of former teammates – who flocked to court on Friday and described Kerr as a “truly special human” – she had still called Lovell “fucking stupid and white”.“It might make it surprising, it might make it sad, but it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen,” Emlyn Jones said.He said Kerr’s claims about what had happened in the taxi did not make “one blind bit of difference to what this case is about” and said she was “drunk and angry” and “lashing out in a rage” that night.Kerr said Lovell had doubted her claim of being “held hostage” by a taxi driver.View image in fullscreenSam Kerr arrives at Kingston-Upon-Thames crown court.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesEmlyn Jones said he would not suggest that Kerr is a “card-carrying racist” but asked the jury to consider a “hypothetic question”.“What if PC Lovell had been a black man? What if she had called him fucking stupid and black,” he said. “It’s not really a fair question is it? Calling a white man white is not as loaded as calling a black man black.”He added: “The fact remains that, in the heat of the moment, this was an insult delivered by reference to race and that is what the law prohibits.“The law does not discriminate between different races when it comes to racist language.”Current and former Chelsea players, including Millie Bright and Carly Telford, and the team’s former manager, Emma Hayes, have come to Kerr’s defence in court.Sam Kerr was ‘speaking her truth’ in clash with police, partner tells courtRead moreOn Friday, a number of figures fromChelsea Womenprovided character witness statements in support of Kerr, who was described as “one of the warmest, friendliest, kindest players” but an “introvert” off the pitch.Telford, a goalkeeper who played for Chelsea from 2017 to 2022, told the court she first met Kerr in 2012 when they played against each other in Australia.At one point in the game, Telford “came out to punch a ball, and punched Sam instead”. They met up after the game and “had a good chat”, said Telford. “The fact she came and spoke to me, check in on me. She didn’t have to do that but it was a very nice thing to do.”She said once Kerr had signed with Chelsea, the pair “became close friends”. She described how Kerr would interact with younger academy players. “That’s probably where you see someone like Sam shine the most. She’s the type of person who makes people feel very at ease. I think that’s why she gets on with everyone in the team,” she said.She described Kerr as an “introverted extrovert” who, “on the pitch you see the skills, the back flips [but] away from pitch, she’s quite quiet and shy. Quite reserved”.Telford said Kerr was “generous” with her money and considers how she can cover costs for the younger players on nights out “to make sure they can celebrate with us”.Grace Forbes, defending Kerr, also read out a number of character witness statements provided in writing.Millie Bright, the Chelsea and England defender, described Kerr as a “truly special human”.“Sam is that person who connects with everyone and brings everyone together and puts a smile on everyone’s face. She’s a big believer in having the right environment at the club,” her statement said.“She has the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met and do anything for anyone. There are not many people in the world who can bring people together like Sam. She is a truly special human,” said Bright.Bright said that Kerr has a “great poker face” and that others “probably don’t know what she’s dealing with”. Bright added: “She doesn’t want to put her stresses on others so she deals with it behind the scenes.”Emma Hayes,the former Chelsea managerand current head coach of the USA football team, described Kerr as “one of the warmest, friendliest, kindest and most considerate players” she had ever coached.“She is calm and level-headed and mindful. She comes from a wonderful family. She has the biggest heart, she is a big kid at heart,” said Hayes. “I think she does well to manage everything that is thrown at her and the expectation that is placed on her.”Erin Cuthbert, the Chelsea and Scotland midfielder, called Kerr a “great friend and teammate” who “has a unique knack of seeing the best in everyone”. She said they “immediately got on like a house on fire” after first meeting and “we find ourselves belly laughing often”.“Sam takes part in charity work in Australia. Sam is a pivotal LGBT figure. Sam uses her platform to allow everyone to be accepted and she is no different in her personal life,” said Cuthbert. “That is why I’m lucky to call her my friend.”Kerr’s mother, Roxanne, also provided a statement, called her daughter “the most humble, honest and loving person I know” who “will always fight for what is right”.“I’m so proud of the woman she has become,” she added.The defence will give its closing argument on Monday.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomenLondonWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

While Labor is itching to engage in a proper policy debate, the opposition leader is keen to draw attention anywhere but a policy fight.Mostly because after nearly three years as Coalition leader, he still doesn’t have that much of his own policy to begin with, and, as we are learning with each passing day, the ones he does announce are built on flimsy detail or simply a “vibe” he says will be fleshed out down the track.So, to the caviar.Labor is desperate for Dutton to release policy, so they can start trying to pick it apart. Labor types concede Dutton isdriving much of the national debate at the moment, but the light on the horizon they point to is a hope that, once the campaign properly begins, Dutton would wither under the glare of a ravenous media who he has largely avoided to this point (more on that later).Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSo desperate is the opposition to have a policy to pick apart, Jim Chalmersgot his treasury department to whip up some costingsof the Coalition’s meals and entertainment policy. That plan, to allow $20,000 in tax deductions for business dining expenses like staff lunches or client dinners,attracted derision and confusion from day one(apparently, now it only covers meals and not entertainment, despite the policy name and repeated assertions in Coalition media releases) but it became the government’s main course this week.The government says the policy would cost between $1.6 and $10bn. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor reckons it would be less than $250m, but they’ve declined to release the costings they say the parliamentary budget office has done.Whatever the number, “That’s a lot of croquembouche. That’s a lot of caviar,” riffed education minister Jason Clare.There was a half-hearted Coalition attempt in question time on Tuesday to defend the policy, a series of questions to the government about in-house catering budgets for big business, but Labor already has its new favourite line of attack: that Dutton has prioritised a policy about “free lunch for bosses” before releasing major plans to address cost of living, energy bills, inflation or housing.Which brings us to the caravan.Dutton, again hammering the national agenda into his preferred shape through sheer repetition, spent the week asking when Albanese had been briefed about the vehicle full of explosives found at Dural, with indications it could have been used in an antisemitic attack.Never mind that Dutton confirmed he hadn’t actually requested a briefing with federal investigators on the issue, nor that various newspapers reported it was a communications breakdown between police agencies – which could have seen the NSW premier briefed while the prime minister was not.Somehow bending reality around him, Dutton – the man who made predecessorScott Morrison’s “on-water matters”his own standard response for not commenting on the most basic of details around the arrival and treatment of asylum seekers – demanded Albanese reveal details of what he was or wasn’t told about a potential terrorist plot.Albanese refused. It didn’t matter. Dutton’s plan, to again portray the prime minister as indecisive and lacking vigour, played out the way he wanted.Without much policy of his own, he doesn’t have a lot to talk about except the country’s leader.The reason for Dutton’s obsession with this line of attack – whether on antisemitism or more trivial issues like flags, “woke” public servants or whether shops were selling the right plastic merchandise on Australia Day – is obvious.Without much policy of his own, he doesn’t have a lot to talk about except the country’s leader.With at most 12 weeks until election day, Dutton and the Coalition have announced little proactive ideas of their own beyond the uncosted nuclear plan that experts point out would not deliver material benefits for at least a decade.And with the leader facing a five-week official campaign period where he will be tailed by journalists and expected to front press conferences most days, discussion in Canberra has turned to what kind of campaign Dutton will run – because in the glare of the cameras, he will have to either announce some policy or explain why he hasn’t.For any other party leader, Liberal or Labor, it would be nearly unthinkable even to consider they may not run a standard campaign with a travelling media pack. But there’s a reason Dutton had to be asked that question this week – having ducked the National Press Club his whole leadership, and barely held a Canberra press conference in the last year, whispers had crept around parliament that Dutton might run a truncated campaign of some sort.“How big a plane would you like? We can negotiate menus,” Dutton joked when asked about the rumour.“We’ll be there with bells on and talking to you. I wouldn’t get too excited with that Canberra story. I’m very happy to take questions, to speak with you regularly.”In the transcript of the press conference, Dutton’s office referred to it as an “iconic Canberra bubble question” - as if it was an outrageous question to check whether the opposition leader, who has so far thumbed his nose at traditional political notions of engaging with media and giving opportunities for scrutiny, would engage with media and give opportunities for scrutiny on election eve.While Dutton rarely makes a blunder in press conferences, his hardman mask rarely slipping, he sometimes finds himself exposed as lacking detail. Pressed on his plan to slash the public service, the opposition leader couldn’t say which jobs he would cut from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet – the office he seeks to lead after this election – or how he would plan to reduce the Australian public service, whether by hiring freeze or redundancies or by some other method.“I’ve been clear we’re not having 36,000 additional public servants in Canberra,” he said.Except the Coalitionhasn’t been clear, far from it. And Dutton is running out of time before he will have to start giving proper answers.Explore more on these topicsLabor partyPeter DuttonAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025analysisShareReuse this content"

There would be separate caps for each state and territory based on size, and groups not running in elections would be limited to spending $11m on a federal campaign.Is Albanese really a ‘pale imitation’ of Dutton on national security? The Coalition wants you to think soRead moreThe bill in its current form would also cap individual donations or gifts at $20,000 and increase public funding to parties and independents from $3.35 a vote to $5.Ahead of what could be the last sitting week before an election, Guardian Australia understands the government has looked at increasing spending caps for candidates.Farrell has said he is consulting with the crossbench and the Coalition on reforms but the independent Goldstein MP, Zoe Daniel, derided the consultation efforts as an “illusion of due process”.Despite potential concessions being offered by Farrell, independents remain concerned the bill would enshrine significant advantages for the major parties and“entrench” the two-party system.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOn Tuesday, the crossbench senators David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie told ABC RN Breakfast it was “rubbish” an independent candidate could win by spending only $800,000 on a campaign.Independent MPs and senators have called for the bill to be split, pledging to support part of the bill that deals with the real-time disclosure of donations, but it is understood Farrell has ruled that out.On Monday, Pocock and Kate Chaney met with Farrell, and on Thursday they were provided with a departmental briefing, but it is understood little progress was made on negotiations.Chaney said parties have 13 advantages, including the ability to shift campaign spending for a candidate in an unwinnable seat.“I met with the department staff on Thursday and they confirmed that none of these 13 party advantages have been addressed in the legislation,” she told Guardian Australia.“The big problem with it is that if you’ve got national TV advertising, that can be paid for out of [an] unwinnable seat … so parties can spend twice or three times as much as an independent just saying vote Liberal or vote Labor.”The government was close to a deal with the Coalition in December, which independents had called a “stitch up”, before Labor pulled the bill at the 11th hour. Farrell has continued speaking with the opposition, but has since also opened up further discussion with crossbenchers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And then it wasn’t. And then I thought it was awesome. And then I thought it was one of the best films ever made. And then I remembered I was a narcissist. And then I was like, I should seek counsel on this. So I watched it with other people, and then I cried.

Security experts have saidChinacould capitalise on the move.In an interview with the Guardian on a trip to Kyiv, Lammy said: “What I can say to American friends is it’s widely accepted that the decision by the UK with very little preparation to close down DfID, to suspend funding in the short term or give many global partners little heads up, was a big strategic mistake.“We have spent years unravelling that strategic mistake. Development remains a very important soft power tool. And in the absence of development … I would be very worried that China and others step into that gap.“We werehugely critical of the way that the last government handled the decision. So I would caution US friends to look closely at what went wrong in the United Kingdom as they navigate this decision.”US foreign aid graphOn Friday night a US judge ​said he ​would ​issue an orderblocking the Trump administration from taking some steps to dismantle USAid, adding that 2,200 employees from the agency would not immediately be placed on administrative leave.​ However, the ruling from district judge Carl Nichols in Washington is expected to be “limited” and temporary.Ukraine is reelingfrom the decision to pause all US foreign aid programmes immediately, with projects in the country from military veteran rehabilitation programmes to independent media and anti-corruption initiatives in effect stopped overnight.“We will do what we can to ameliorate those decisions but clearly the United Kingdom hasn’t got the resources available to the United States,” Lammy said. He added it was “not yet clear” to him whether Trump was planning to withdraw entirely from the development arena, or to absorb some of it back into the state department.Trump signed an executive order toauthorise aggressive economic sanctionsagainst the international criminal court on Thursday, accusing the body of “illegitimate and baseless actions” targeting the US and Israel, after itissued arrest warrantsfor Israeli ministers for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy (centre) in Kyiv, Ukraine. He refused to guarantee that Labour would hit its own 2.5% target this parliament.Photograph: Ben Dance/FCDOAfter meeting President Zelenskyy and senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, Lammy said there would be no imminent end to fighting despite the US administration promising to broker a swift end to the conflict, with talks beginning at the Munich security conference next week.“I am not sure we are weeks away from peace talks. And I say that because our assessment, which I’m quite sure the US shares, is that Putin shows absolutely no appetite for negotiation and to bring this war to an end,” he told the Guardian.“We are still very much in the depths of winter.

So I don’t anticipate a ceasefire in this war anytime soon. I’m very clear that Putin at the moment shows no desire to negotiate. And therefore, sadly, I think this war of attrition will go on for some months yet.”Keir Starmer, who has said the UK will “play a full part” in any future security guarantees, has not ruled out sending British troops intoUkraineto act as peacekeepers in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.But the foreign secretary said discussions with European and G7 allies over what type of guarantees might be necessary would “run for some months yet” and it was “premature” to anticipate what role the UK would play.“In navigating what those security guarantees are, they are always bespoke to the theatre that you were engaged in … it will have to be a set of guarantees that really work.”He pointed to an international monitoring mission along Ukraine’s 1,200km border with Russia that ended in 2022 after repeated breaches by Russian forces: “That cannot happen again.”Zelenskyy has called on European allies tourgently increase defence spendingto boost their own security, while the Trump administration has demanded Nato members spend 5% of GDP on defence.“As foreign secretary, I’m really clear that we have to increase defence spending,” Lammy said. “It’s important that we play our role and that means that we must increase defence spending.”However, he refused to guarantee that Labour would hit its own 2.5% target this parliament, saying only that the government would set out a pathway “in the next few months”, before the June spending review, and that he was aware that defence spending had to be weighed against domestic priorities.After promising in opposition to rebuild the UK as a reliable development partner, the Labour government announced fresh cuts to international aid in the autumn budget. It has also warned that the economic conditions required to return aid spending to 0.7% of GDP, up from 0.5%, were unlikely to be met before the next election.Explore more on these topicsUSAidAidChinaDavid LammyDonald TrumpUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

She was reportedly found by a neighbour, who thought she had passed out,and called the emergency services.When police arrived they searched the property and discovered Andrew Searle dead inside. He was reportedly found hanging with a gag in his mouth. Police say no theories are being excluded for the motives of the apparent killings. Theories include a burglary gone wrong or a possible domestic dispute.The couple married in 2023 and had two children each from previous relationships. They had lived in the village for a decade.A forensic pathologist was flown in by helicopter to carry out an initial examination of the bodies. The results of autopsies were not expected before Monday.The public prosecutor Nicolas Rigot-Muller said on Friday: “Both died violent deaths, but I cannot establish that either was a homicide. All hypotheses remain open.”According to his LinkedIn profile, Andrew Searle retired in 2015 after a career in financial crime prevention.After quitting as a consultant in financial crime assurance at Barclays in Glasgow, Searle posted that he was “enjoying life in rural France – renovating!”. He previously worked for 21 years at Standard Life, in Edinburgh, where he was responsible for the bank’s anti-crime initiatives across Europe.Aclaim made by MailOnlinethat police were investigating the possibility that the couple were murdered by UK-based criminals has not been confirmed by the French authorities.Searle went to a grammar school in Steyning, West Sussex, and graduated from Liverpool John Moores University.A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

His appeal against this judgment wasrejected by France’s highest court in December, leading to the fitting of the electronic tag at his home on Friday.Sarkozy, who has been forced to cancel all evening and foreign engagements, has said he will make a final appeal to the European court of human rights, but this does not delay the verdict from being carried out. If he wishes to go abroad during the next 12 months he will have to ask for authorisation from the court.It is the first time a former president has been electronically tagged. Sarkozy, who ledFrancebetween 2007 and 2012, is also on trial over allegations he received millions of euros in illegal campaign funding from Gaddafi. The trial follows a 10-year anti-corruption investigation.His predecessor, Jacques Chirac, who died in 2019, wasgiven a two-year suspended sentence in 2011for having overseen a fake jobs scam at Paris city hall when he was mayor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police have not said what type of weapon he used but they have said he had a licence to own four weapons, three of which were found beside him.“The horrific act of violence in Örebro raises several key questions about gun legislation,” the centre-right coalition government, which relies on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, said. As well as tightening legislation, it said it wanted to improve the way that people considered “medically unsuitable” for weapons possession were reported.“We have to ensure that only the right people have guns in Sweden,” Ulf Kristersson, Sweden’s prime minister, said during a visit to Latvia.On Friday police said identification was complete and that seven women and four men aged between 31 and 68 had died. They have not yet named the victims or the perpetrator, nor given the victims’ nationalities.The Guardian understands that the victims include a Syrian man, an Eritrean woman and an Iranian woman. Police areinvestigating whether the shooting was racially motivated.Swedish hunters, of whom there are hundreds of thousands, are able to apply for licences for semi-automatic weapons. In August 2023, the environmental protection agency lifted a ban on military-style models, meaning guns such as the AR-15 were permitted for hunting.The government said on Friday it wanted to reimpose restrictions that existed before 2023 and develop a strategy to seize military-style weapons. “The AR-15 is an example of a weapon that is compatible with large magazines and can cause a lot of damage in a short time,” it said.The government said a recent report found that several of the requirements that should be taken into account when assessing a person’s suitability for a weapons permit were not clearly stated in weapons regulations, and that they should be set out in law. These include age, knowledge, skills, some medical factors and how law-abiding a person is.It also plans to add provisions on doctors’ reporting obligations in relation to weapons and the police’s ability to revoke permits.The main opposition party, the Social Democrats, welcomed the government’s announcement but called for all weapons licences to be reviewed. It also said there should be a review of how registers between authorities were cross-checked.The decision has attracted public criticism from several high-profile Sweden Democrats.The Syrian embassy in Stockholm has said its citizens were among the dead.The suspect, who apparently killed himself, has been named in media reports as Rickard Andersson, 35, aformer student of the school, who lived locally. He is understood to have attended maths classes at the school a few years ago and had been unemployed for a decade.Among the victims was Salim Iskef, 28, who phoned his fiancee, Kareen Elia, 24, from the school and told her he had been shot. “He called me and said: ‘I’ve been shot, they shot us.’ He said he loves me and that’s the last thing I heard,” she said in an interview.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Members of their church said there was standing room only at a memorial service for Iskef on Thursday night.Fr Jacob Kasselia, a priest at St Maria Örebro, the Syrian Orthodox church attended by Iskef, said the community was reeling. “We have our doors open for everybody. You can see that everybody is affected. A dark cloud has come over us all. But despite that we say that we must look for the light,” he said.Kasselia said he knew of two others who had been killed. One, he said, was a woman from Eritrea, who looked after her four children alone, and the other was a middle-aged woman from Iran.The number of non-Swedish victims would affect Örebro and the whole country, said Kasselia, who went to the remembrance service attended by the prime minister and the king and queen on Wednesday. “It is dark over us all.”The Bosnian Islamic Community in Örebro said the organisation had been advised to increase security since the shootings and had hired security guards to watch the mosque.Elia Xincher, 20, a student and member of a Syrian Orthodox church young people’s association, said many of its members went to Campus Risbergska to improve their grades so they could go to university or increase their employment prospects.Some of his friends had been forced to hide in a classroom during the attack. “I saw one of them yesterday and still to this day she is shaking,” he said. “You cannot forget about it for your whole life.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenGun crimeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For example, under the current arrangement,Denmark pays the territory a 4.3 billion kroner(£484m or €580m) grant.A recent poll for Berlingske and Greenlandic newspaperSermitsiaqshowed that most Greenlanders expect this to continue even after independence. But would Denmark agree? Her office declined to comment “out of respect for the electoral process.” If that money is not there, will Greenlanders still want independence now? Are they ready, or need more time?(If you are getting Brexit flashbacks reading this introduction, I can’t even blame you. At least they don’t put it on the side of a bus, yet.)However, the Trump effect also exists in Denmark.Danish daily Berlingske isreporting this morningabout speculations that Frederiksen – whose Social Democrats gained over 3 points in polls since Trump came into office on the back of her diplomatic offensive –could also be tempted to call a snap election,bringing them forward from late 2026 to bank another term amid the swirling uncertainty about life under Trump.I think we can confidently say that this theme of how Trump’s politics influences – or, depending on your politics, interferes with – domestic decisions will continue throughout 2025: from elections inGermany, where his close aide Elon Musk directly supports the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland, through presidential elections in the likes ofRomaniaandPoland, and beyond.“May you live in interesting times,”eh?US president Donald Trump speaking during an event in Washington yesterday.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/EPAIt’sFriday, 7 February 2025, and this isEurope live.

For both constituencies, Israel’s right to annex the occupiedPalestinian territoriesof Gaza and the West Bank is a matter of faith and, they hope, a matter of time.Both constituencies cheered this week as Donald Trump announced his half-baked plan to “take over” Gaza, an idea he had only tinkered with before Tuesday evening,when it tumbled outto the obvious surprise of his closest aides.While most observers were shocked that the US president was in effect advocating for the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip, the conservative alliance ofIsraeland the United States sees an opportunity to accelerate the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and its eventual annexation.“What has changed now is that Trump has said that it is US policy to support this as an end goal,” Matt Duss, the executive vice-president at the Center for International Policy, said of the Trump proposal. “And then of course it will just hop over to the West Bank, no question.”‘Waterfront property’: what are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read moreIsrael’s pro-settler right wing immediately hailed Trump’s announcement. Bezalel Smotrich, the country’s ultranationalist finance minister, quoted a biblical passage about the return of Jewish pilgrims to Israel, writing: “Thank you President Trump. Together, we will make the world great again.”Itamar Ben-Gvir, who left Benjamin Netanyahu’s shaky coalition government because of the ceasefire with Hamas,said: “When I said this time and again during the war, that this was the solution to Gaza, they mocked me.”Under Joe Biden, saying thatGazahad been rendered unliveable would have been seen as a condemnation of Israel’s military campaign. But Trump, ignoring the Israeli assault that has been described as a “domicide” and led to the hollowing out of Gaza’s cities, simply went ahead and said it.The New York Times reported that the idea had been germinating among Trump and his close allies for weeks, and accelerated after his envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to the area and said: “There is almost nothing left of Gaza.” YetTrump surprised his aides and even Netanyahu with the proposal, the paper reported, calling it “little beyond an idea inside the president’s head”.Trump’s plan may be a nonstarter and a distraction from more immediate questions of the second round of ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas. But it marks a serious shift towards some of the pro-settler advisers that he has elevated, including his nominee for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said on Fox News in January: “There was a Palestinian state. It was called Gaza. Look how that turned out.”Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, has a record of hardline pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Huckabee has refused to call the settlements by that name, insisting they be called “communities” or neighbourhoods. He has denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation.In a sign of growing ties between the US Christian right, the Israeli right and the pro-settler movement, Huckabee was in the audience when Netanyahu met leaders from America’s evangelical community during his trip to Washington this week.Also at the meeting with Netanyahu was John Hagee, the televangelist and founder of Christians United for Israel who has backed Israel’s expansion as a route toward Armageddon, after which “there will be 1,000 years of perfect peace, no presidential elections, no fake news, none of all of this nonsense”.In the US, Christian Zionists have tied their support for Israel’s claim to Palestinian lands to the book of Genesis, in which it says that God blesses those who bless Israel, and curses those who curse it.Hagee once claimed he had persuaded Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem bytelling him at a White House dinnerthat Jesus was coming back to Jerusalem to “set up His throne on the Temple Mount where He will sit and rule for 1,000 years of perfect peace”.Trump has offered other tokens to pro-settler groups, including the repeal of Biden administration sanctions against individuals and groups accused of expansion and violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.The situation may indicate that in the circles of those who surround him, pro-settler figures are ascendant. They include Huckabee and Elise Stefanik, the US ambassador-designate to the UN, who during a confirmation hearing said she supported statements by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich that Israel had a “biblical right to the entire West Bank”.Others, including Witkoff, represent a wing of Trump’s supporters who are less hawkish on Israel and more focused on cutting transactional deals across the world.Jeremy Ben-Ami, the head of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel organisation, said before the summit that Trump had two choices: the “dealmaker route” or the “screw-it path”. For Saudi Arabia to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, he said, Trump would have to at least seek to restrain Israel from expanding settlements in the West Bank.But, Ben-Ami said: “If he’s going down the screw-it path – ‘I don’t really care what anybody thinks, and I want Greenland and Panama and they can have the West Bank’ – then we’re in a different world.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

On one day alone, 5 June last year, at the Sde Teiman detention centre he beat two men 15 times.The assaults were committed between January and June 2024 when he was guarding detainees fromGaza. They were captured on video, and continued as victims cried out in pain. Hajabi also forced detainees to make animal noises and repeat humiliating phrases.Hajabi was sentenced to seven months after a plea deal, which rights groups said was too short to serve as a deterrent. They questioned why authorities had not identified masked soldiers seen in videos of the attacks or prosecuted other cases of documented violent abuse against prisoners and detainees.“It is difficult to ignore the fact that the sentence does not constitute a significant deterrent,” the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, an NGO, said in a statement. “[The attacks] constitute serious abuse that requires a much more severe punishment. It is important to remember that there were other people involved in the incident who were not brought to justice, and many other cases of abuse have not been investigated at all to this day.”Hajabi was detained in the summer at the same time as nine other Israeli soldiers, who face allegations ofsexual abuseso violent it left a detainee in critical condition.Their arrests prompted aninvasion of two military basesby politicians and demonstrators, mostly representing far-right parties, who were furious about the arrests and described the men as heroes.Pre-indictment hearings were held in this case in November, the Jerusalem Post reported, citing sources who denied political considerations had caused delays.Hassan Jabareen, the director of the Palestinian rights group Adalah, said: “[Hajabi’s] case, including the punishment, indicates that Israel has a policy of impunity when it comes to their soldiers. Whatever they do, at most they will have a light sentence.”He said Palestinian citizens of Israel had been handed longer jail terms for posts on social media.Violence, extreme hunger, humiliation and other abuse of Palestinian prisoners has beennormalisedacross Israel’s jail system, according to interviews with released prisoners. Mistreatment now so systemic that the rights group B’Tselem says it must be considered a policy of “institutionalised abuse”.Detainees from Gaza are particularly vulnerable. The Israeli NGO HaMoked described the conditions in which these detainees were held as “a massenforced disappearance”, because they are held incommunicado in unknown locations, without legal proceedings or contact with a lawyer.By early December, at least 38 Gaza residents detained in Israel haddied in custody, Haaretz reported.Sde Teiman camp in the Negev desert was set up as a temporary detention centre for holding Palestinians from Gaza after the cross-border Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Papers and IDs checked, they could take away what they had been allocated.Hugely overcomplicated, under-resourced and ultimately set up for failure, the GRM never functioned properly. Instead it allowed a hidden market to quickly emerge, sometimes at the very doors of the secure warehouses where deals would be done for bags of cement.All of which explains some of the enormous complexities facing the rebuilding of Gaza. It is not simply a physical problem, huge though that undertaking is. It is a political problem as well.The experience of past reconstruction in Gaza, and Israel’s veto on the process, as academics have noted, has been used as a vehicle for sustaining domination and ultimately conflict.View image in fullscreenA family who were displaced to the southern part of Gaza gather in the rubble of their ruined home in Jabaliya.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersA ban on building materials entering the Gaza Strip has been a feature of Israel’s blockade since it was put in place in 2007. Hundreds of items, from drilling equipment and epoxy to concrete moulds, asphalt and wiring, have been designated as dual-use items.This time the task, and Palestinian needs, will be almost immeasurably larger.In the first instance there is the question of rubble. According to an estimate from UN-Habitat and the UN Environment Programme, there were 50m tons of rubble and debris in Gaza in December, 17 times more than all the debris generated by other hostilities in the territory since 2008.The rubble, if collected in one place, would cover five square kilometres. UNEP estimates that disposing of it will take up to 20 years and cost $909m (£730m).After previous conflicts, Palestinians in Gaza relied heavily on recycling concrete rubble, processing it in sites in open areas, a bone of contention because Israel has said Hamas has taken advantage of recycled concrete for military purposes.View image in fullscreenA tent camp for displaced residents in Khan Younis. Up to 1 million Palestinians may need long-term shelter because their homes have been damaged or destroyed.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersHow long reconstruction may take is another issue. While some experts have suggested several decades, the reality is that it entirely depends on political conditions.After the second world war, German cities – with the benefit of the Marshall plan – were reconstructed in about a decade, although some rebuilding continued until the 1990s.With a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged – including schools and hospitals – and 66% of buildings sustaining at least some damage, the first issue will be to survey what is salvageable and identify the potentially 1 million people in need of long-term shelter and support.Setting aside Trump’s callsto permanently displace Palestinians from Gaza, one risk in reconstruction – experienced in London’s East End after the blitz – is the social damage that can be done in moving communities with close social networks.One successful UN innovation in Jordan’s refugee camps during the Syrian civil war was the deployment of mobile shelters, which residents were allowed to reposition to preserve communities and social structures.In many ways, however, housing may not be the most serious issue. Gaza’s water and sanitation system – on the brink of failure even before the onset of the war –has collapsed. It is estimated that up to 70% of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in north Gaza have sustained damage.In Gaza City, damage to those same facilities exceeds 90% includingto the desalination plantsin a coastal strip where residents rely on electric pumps to supply roof tanks and where the power system is also badly damaged.Beyond the physical infrastructure there is other, less obvious, damage. More than half of Gaza’s critical agricultural land has been degraded by conflict and 95% of cattle have been slaughtered along with nearly half the sheep.That suggests something like a Marshall plan will be required, although almost certainly without the involvement of the Trump administration, which has indicated that it will not pay andhas wound up USAid, its development agency.All of which raises multiple questions including how, with Hamas still a presence in Gaza, a mechanism can be found to allow large-scale rebuilding while holding off Israel and the Trump White House. Only that will bring the nightmare of Palestinians in Gaza to an end.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Eight out of 10 Jewish Israelis support Trump’s call for the “relocation” of Palestinians from Gaza, although only half think it is a practical proposal, according to apollby the Jewish People Policy Institute.The only strong opposition to the plan came from a handful of politicians on the far left of Israel’s spectrum; some relatives of hostages still held inGaza, who said they feared the project could derail the ceasefire deal; and some activists and journalists who echoed international warnings against ethnic cleansing.“If there were a true opposition in Israel, one with a conscience, a worldview and even some sort of plan for the future, it would’ve raised a loud warning: don’t drink Trump’s potion,” Gur Megiddowrotein a column for Haaretz.“The idea of clearing an area of a specific ethnic group, even if it’s a bitter and ruthless enemy, is a concept that Jews – especially the sons of Holocaust survivors like Lapid and Gantz – must never support, no matter the circumstances.”The announcement by the defence minister, Israel Katz, of orders to the military to prepare air, sea and land options for Palestinians to leave Gaza appeared more political than practical, even if any wanted to go, because no countries have offered to host them.“The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration,” Katz said in a statement on X, although it was clear the journeys would only be in one direction.Before the war, Israel’s tight controls on movement in and out of Gaza made it difficult for Palestinians to travel internationally. Restrictions got even tighter after the conflict began; and after Israeli troops began operating near the Rafah crossing last May it was impossible for Palestinians to leave.Trump’s Gaza remarks are no surprise: ethnically cleansing was always the plan | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAn agreement to allow medical evacuations from Gaza was part of the ceasefire deal, andthe first group of sick children lefton Saturday, although two died before they could be taken out and others had become too sick to move.Trump’s plan to turn Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East” caused international outrage, including a warning from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, that“itis essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing”.Forced or coerced displacement is a crime against humanity, illegal under the Geneva conventions, to which Israel and the US are signatories.In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump said Israel would turn the Gaza Strip over to the US after the fighting ended and that no US soldiers would be needed there.“The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians … would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region,” Trump said in a post building on his controversial comments about Gaza’s future this week. “No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their decision prompted fury in Israel, which ordered back its ambassadors and accused the countries of rewarding terrorism.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, was quick to reject the demand. Palestinians who needed support, including urgent medical treatment, would be welcomed in Spain, but “Gaza is the land of the people of Gaza”, he said in a radio interview. “It should be part of a future Palestinian state.”Inside Israel the far right embraced Trump’s comments as vindication of their long-term call for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza and for Jewish settlement.The legislator Limor Son Har-Melech said Trump was hailed as “original and creative” for laying out plans that had led her party leader, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to be labelled “fascist, extremist, delusional”.In a radio interview she described a vision of Jewish Israeli children playing in Gaza, Haaretz reported. Her party would only return to the coalition government, which it left in opposition to the ceasefire deal, when “we see buses coming out” of Gaza carrying its Palestinian residents, she added.This article was amended on 7 February 2025 to change the headline to more accurately reflect the piece.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They cited a number of issues around staffing levels and the sharing of “risk-pertinent information”, with multiple missed opportunities to provide support.The area coroner, Laurinda Bower, said: “I’m concerned not only by the failures in Anthony, David and Rolandas’s care, but also by the persistent failure to learn from deaths at Lowdham Grange, and by the manner in which the prison agencies have engaged with this inquest.”She issued two prevention of future deaths reports, which said staff reported being “overwhelmed and overburdened”,there was “widespread evidence of failures to do the basics” and there was need for “a radical change in culture, and reflective learning from deaths”.The first suicide occurred six weeks after management of the prison changed hands from Serco to Sodexo on 16 February 2023, believed to be the first private-to-private prison transfer inEnglandand Wales.The facility wastaken over permanently by the government in December 2023due to the suicides, the “ready availability” of illegal drugs, high levels of self-harm and “significant staffing issues”.Binfield, who had a history of self-harm and substance abuse issues, was under half-hourly observations at the time of his death. CCTV footage played at the inquest showed that checks recorded on prison logs were never actually completed.Lynda Hurren, Binfield’s aunt, told the inquest that her nephew “tried to get help for himself, but he often felt that he wasn’t given the help that he needed, and he was let down”.“It seemed to me like the prison couldn’t cope with him, and often didn’t care,” she said.Richards was found dead a week later on 13 March, two weeks after arriving at the prison. He had been placed in a vulnerable prisoner unit at his previous prison for his own protection, and one staff member described him as like a “rabbit in headlights” on arriving at Lowdham Grange.Karbauskas, a Lithuanian national who spoke limited English, died five days after his arrival in the prison.A nurse told the inquest that, when asked questions to assess his risk of suicide, Rolandas made a gesture drawing his hand across his neck, and other inmates raised concerns that he wasn’t eating, but no action was taken.‘Basic lack of decency’ driving self-harm in women’s prisons, report saysRead moreDuring the inquest, the Ministry of Justice was fined £500 for failing to meet deadlines to provide documents and evidence, with the coroner saying the penalty was an “extraordinary step”.A spokesperson for Sodexo said it apologised to the family and friends of the deceased, and said the prison had a “unique set of challenges, both old and new” when it took over.“These challenges have been fully considered during the course of this inquest and we are grateful to the coroner for her thorough approach. Whilst we have since transferred the management and operation of the prison to HMPPS [HM Prison and Probation Service], we will fully take on board any learnings.”In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: “Our thoughts remain with the families of Anthony Binfield, David Richards and Rolandas Karbauskas, and we offer our sincere apologies for the failings in these cases.“Since 2024, we have boosted staffing levels to better support vulnerable prisoners, reopened education and workshops to provide greater opportunities for offenders and teamed up with Nottinghamshire police to clamp down on the flow of contraband into the jail – resulting in several arrests.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The matters within are described by Hampshire as “not something he would ever discuss openly”.It has become part of proceedings relating to December’s decision by the immigration tribunal to uphold Yang’s exclusion from the UK – and whether the public can be told about the full contents of a document referred to in the tribunal’s final judgment.Yang has said previously that the allegations against him are “entirely unfounded” and he is seeking permission to appeal against the tribunal’s decision.Adam Wolanski KC, for the media, told a special one-day hearing that journalists should be allowed to see Hampshire’s witness statement and other documents referred to in the tribunal’s proceedings, on the principle of open justice.He said it was normal practice for cited documents to be disclosed to the media because the “public need to understand the issues, and also the evidence”, and that Hampshire “must have known” his witness statement could eventually come into the public domain.Jonathan Price, acting for Hampshire, said the royal fixer had originally thought “his evidence could be dealt with in private” but discovered he could not get a guarantee it would remain confidential. Having been “disabused of that” he “sought to ensure his evidence was not included in the case”.Price referred to a brief account by Hampshire of how the 34-paragraph witness statement came to be prepared in May 2024 and his subsequent efforts to keep it from the public view because of the “level of confidential detail” it contains.Hampshire, a former Scots guard and old friend of Andrew, described himself as a “senior adviser” to the royal in letters written to Yang in 2020. But on Friday he described himself as “secretary of the Quad-Centenary Club”, a society established to raise funds for London’s Royal Blackheath golf club, for which Andrew was chair.Inone of his letters to Yang, written in March 2020, Hampshire had heaped praise on the businessman for his loyalty to the prince after adisastrous interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlisthe year before. “You sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,” Hampshire said at the time.The witness statement was provided on the basis it would be sent to James Cleverly, the then home secretary, “to provide some context” to the correspondence, which had been obtained by police from Yang’s mobile phone, Hampshire said on Friday in his account.“I wrote what I did in the statement with such candour – including about my own confidential commercial interests but also about the private interests of third parties – in the expectation it was for the private attention of one of the most senior ministries of state on a grave matter,” he added.Yang’s lawyers then told him they wanted the document to form part of his immigration appeal. “I agreed, following assurances from Mr Yang’s legal team that they had every confidence their application to have the session heard in private would be successful,” Hampshire said.However, “when I was informed by Mr Yang’s legal team that they had been unsuccessful” Hampshire said he told them: “I did not wish to give evidence and did not want my witness statement to be used, or relied upon, in any part of the proceedings.”Though Yang’s legal team agreed not to refer it to in their case, the document remained part of the bundle, or legal papers, lodged with the tribunal – and Wolanski told Friday’s hearing that it was cited by the tribunal inits judgment last month.The tribunal noted that Cleverly “now has the benefit of Mr Hampshire’s witness statement” and that, after a review, the original decision to exclude Yang made by Cleverly’s predecessor, Suella Braverman, “has been maintained”.A second letter from Hampshire, dated October 2020, said Yang was authorised to act on behalf of an investment scheme inChinacalled the Eurasia fund which involved the prince. Further details about the operation of the fund and information “identifying individuals as potential associates” have been redacted from documents disclosed to the media so far. Those redactions are being challenged by the Guardian.Members of the immigration tribunal will rule at a later date on whether the documents sought can be disclosed and redactions lifted.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewChinaPress freedomNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Neither Hellmich, who was disqualified for nine years, or a third ex-trustee, Veronica Chou, have appealed against their disqualifications.Charity law experts say it is rare for a charity tribunal to overturn a disqualification order, and that even if Campbell can prove a fake email account was used, it may not be sufficient to reverse the commission’s decision.Liz Brownsell, the head of charities at the law firm Birketts, said: “Naomi Campbell has publicly admitted that she was not involved in running the charity and that shefailed in her dutiesas a trustee. Charity trustees cannot be passive in their role and a failure to act can amount to mismanagement in the administration of the charity.“Ultimately, the tribunal’s decision regarding her disqualification will be taken based on evidence regarding how she performed her duties as a trustee and whether the tribunal concurs with the commission’s assessment that she is unfit to act as a charity trustee.”At the tribunal on Friday, lawyers for her and for the commission variously applied for the disclosure of documents. Campbell’s lawyers failed in an attempt to force the commission to disclose its case files.In written arguments for Campbell, the barrister Andrew Westwood said the disqualification order was wrongly made because she was “not able adequately, or at all, to deal with issues that arose with the running of Fashion for Relief” or to present her “proper and accurate position” during the inquiry.He told the court: “It is Ms Campbell’s case that because of the deception that was practised on her … she has been disqualified without having the opportunity to respond to the reasons for disqualification and without having had sight of the documents relied on by the commission in taking that action.”Faisel Sadiq, for the Charity Commission, told the tribunal on Friday that Campbell’s position “is not to criticise the commission”, but to say she was a victim of fraud and that her case in a nutshell was that she “knew nothing about it” and was a “figurehead”.Campbell said earlier this week that she had “fought to uncover the facts” ever since the commission’s report, published in September, and that she had “never undertaken philanthropic work for personal gain, nor will I ever do so”.Explore more on these topicsNaomi CampbellCharitiesRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Without question, there are “skeletons in every cupboard”, they said, as others expressed concerns that this could be the start of a wave of allegations putting the bank and its former chair in the spotlight.The attender was right to be worried. The Guardian was the first to detail allegations against De Rothschild, a former financial adviser to Queen Elizabeth II; since then other allegations have emerged – and some staff at the bank fear more will come to light.A world-famous bank, which prides itself on discretion for its monied clientele, is now facing the prospect of seeing its workplace culture being scrutinised in public.One attender at that crisis meeting suggested giving the predicament, and the way it intends to handle it, a code name. This was dismissed, in case the name itself was leaked to journalists and added grist to the media’s mill.Lawyers acting for Rothschild said this did not accurately reflect the conversations of the team handling this situation.The memo, which shocked many staff at the bank but came as little surprise to others, tried to suggest that there was only ever one allegation made about De Rothschild. This was one dated to 2003, which came shortly before his departure.“Some of you may be aware of an article that was published by the Guardian yesterday,” staff were told.“We are naturally appalled by any allegation of conduct that is so at odds with the culture we strive to foster within the group, even if it was several decades ago. No colleague should be subjected to inappropriate sexual behaviour.”Staff were told about this only afterthe Guardian revealedallegations of sexual misconduct related to De Rothschild that multiple sources said took place in the mid to late 1990s. That it followed a news report, rather than being proactively shared with staff, caused some disquiet.A search of internal records had found no allegations from the 1990s, the memo said.There was, however, a complaint from 2003 that the bank must have known about – but its lawyers failed to mention to the Guardian despite being asked about the existence of other complaints.“We discovered a single complaint of sexual misconduct in late 2003. This case was investigated immediately, dealt with appropriately, with full support for the colleague concerned, and led to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild leaving the group in March 2004,” the memo read.“We have found no record of any other complaint relating to Sir Evelyn. We do not tolerate and will never tolerate behaviour of this nature at the company. We work hard to create an environment in which all can thrive, and we encourage the highest standards of professionalism.”The memo did not go into detail on the 2003 incident. However, sources claim it involved De Rothschild exposing himself to a member of staff in his office. It is alleged he had suggested a sexual act to her and the woman ran out of the room, with her distress apparent to several witnesses.This incident bore similarities to some of the 1990s allegations first reported by this newspaper: they included claims the celebrated financier used his office within NM Rothschild, a stone’s throw from the Bank of England,to force himself upon women over several years.The 1990s claims include serious sexual assaults. One involved an alleged violent assault of a member of staff when she was a young woman working for him. Another allegation is that he put his hands down a different woman’s top and under her underwear to grope her. And a third woman claimed she was forced to perform a sex act on him while he sat on his desk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A scion of one of the most famous dynasties in global banking, he spent 44 years working within Rothschild family businesses.So powerful was the banking group and the figure of De Rothschild that sources told the Guardian that – even speaking anonymously – they felt safe to share their accounts only two years after his death.The Rothschild group, which combines an array of financial services including investment banking and wealth management, was at the heart of the UK’s privatisation wave in the 1980s and is among the most prominent investment banks.Its London arm, NM Rothschild & Sons, was founded in 1809 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, close to the Bank of England. Such was the sharp rise of its merchant banking activities that by 1826 it effectively saved the UK’s central bank with a loan of gold. Generations of the family’s successes are documented in objets d’art and display cabinets at its St Swithin’s Lane headquarters: the New Court Vitrine. Insiders describe it as a sort of shrine to the Rothschild dynasty.NM Rothschild & Sons later merged with another arm of thefamily’s European banking empire, Paris Orléans SA, and in 2011 the company rebranded from NM Rothschild & Sons to Rothschild & Co. In 2015, the parent company of the Rothschild Group, which was previously called Paris Orléans, also changed its name to Rothschild & Co, according to the Rothschild Archive.The allegations raise questions about how De Rothschild, a member of one of the world’s most famous and powerful families, a banker-adviser to Queen Elizabeth, and whose eulogy was delivered by former US president Bill Clinton, could have hidden so many claims from public view.Lawyers acting for Rothschild & Co said that the Guardian’s sources’ characterisation of the 2003 complaint was inaccurate and said they had not been aware of any other claims related to De Rothschild’s employment at the banking group.Explore more on these topicsRothschild & CoBankingFinancial sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its other packages are going up in price, too. The last time it pushed through a price increase in the UK was October 2023.“We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improveNetflix,” the company said, adding it would “continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members”.‘We have to reset’: Britain’s TV industry struggling in big-budget streaming eraRead moreThe company signalled a price rise was on the way last month when it announced increases in other countries, including the US and Canada. In the UK the price of a standard subscription with adverts has gone up by £1 to £5.99 a month. The most expensive “premium” tier is also up by £1 to £18.99.Netflix has also increased the cost of adding an extra member to a package by £1. For a standard subscription with adverts, the cost of adding another person is now £4.99. For a standard subscription without adverts, this fee is now £5.99. The new, higher rates apply to both new and existing customers.Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight, said the price increases were widely expected. “The streaming business is following mainstream TV in its price rises, and we should get accustomed to them,” he said.However, he added: “Netflix must tread extremely carefully … there is a ceiling, a point at which consumers will become incredibly frustrated by price hikes.”Netflix is not the only platform to raise its subscription costs as rivals Disney+, Spotify, and Paramount+ put their prices up last year. In 2023, Netflix cracked down onpassword sharing, which led to millions of new sign-ups over the following year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He did not seem inclined to grant other requests from the unions to reopenUSAidbuildings and restore funding.“The major reduction in force, as well as the closure of offices, the forced relocation of these individuals were all done in excess of the executive’s authority in violation of the separation of powers,” Karla Gilbride, a lawyer for the unions, said at the hearing.The White House claims there is fraud at USAid.“CLOSE IT DOWN,” Trump had said earlier on social media of USAid.Crews in the morning used duct tape to block out the agency’s name on a sign outside its Washington DC headquarters and a flag was taken down. Someone placed a bouquet of flowers outside the door.A group of a half-dozen USAid officials speaking to reporters on Friday strongly disputed assertions from Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, that the most essential life-saving programs abroad were getting waivers to continue. With all but several hundred staffers forced out and funding stopped, the agency had “ceased to exist”, one official on the call said.TheTrump administrationand billionaire ally Elon Musk, who is running a budget-cutting “department of government efficiency”, have targeted USAid hardest so far in an unprecedented challenge of the federal government and many of its programs.The administration told remaining USAid officials on Thursday afternoon that it planned to exempt 297 employees from global leave and furloughs ordered for at least 8,000 staffers and contractors, according to USAid staffers and officials.Late that night, a new list was finalized of 611 employees allowedto remain on the job, many of them to manage the return home of thousands of staffers, contractors and their families abroad, the officials said.

Within the state department itself, employees fear substantial staff reductions following the deadline for the Trump administration’s offer of financial incentives for federal workers to resign, according to unnamed officials. A judge temporarily blocked that offer and set a hearing for Monday.At USAid, among the programs officials said had not received waivers: $450m in food grown by US farmers sufficient to feed 36 million people, which was not being paid for or delivered; and water supplies for 1.6 million people displaced by war in Sudan’s Darfur region, which were being cut off without money for fuel to run water pumps in the desert.The Associated Press and Reuters provided reportingExplore more on these topicsUSAidTrump administrationUS politicsAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Netanyahuvisited Washington this weekand praised Trump as Israel’s “greatest friend”.View image in fullscreenKarim Khan, a British ICC prosecutor, is understood to be the first person targeted by the sanctions.Photograph: Marwan Ali/APThe US has not yet disclosed who will be sanctioned under the order, but four sources with knowledge of the situation said the ICC’s British chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, is the first and only individual to be targeted so far.Responding to the order on Friday, the ICC called on its 125 state parties to stand against the sanctions, describing Washington’s move as an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work”.Seventy-nine countries – including Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Mexico and Nigeria – released a joint letter that warned sanctions would “increase the risk of impunity for the most serious crimes and threaten to erode the international rule of law”.Longtime US allies have found themselves at odds with Washington, while the head of a leading global rights group called it “vindictive”.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said sanctions would “jeopardise an institution that is supposed to ensure that the dictators of this world cannot simply persecute people and start wars”.France said it would reaffirm its support for the ICC and mobilise with its partners so that the ICC could continue its mission. In London, a spokesperson for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said Britain supported the independence of the court.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the ICC gave “a voice to victims worldwide” and it “must be able to freely pursue the fight against global impunity”, while the main UN rights agency said Trump’s decision should be reversed.In his order, Trump said the ICC had “abused its power” by issuing the warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, which he claimed “set a dangerous precedent” that endangered US citizens and its military personnel. Netanyahu strongly applauded Trump’s move, calling it bold.View image in fullscreenIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) welcomed Trump’s sanctions.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APTrump’s predecessor Joe Biden acted as Israel’s most prominent international defender as it pursued a devastating war in Gaza, and called the ICC warrants issued in November “outrageous”.Trump, who used the term “Palestinian” as a slur during a campaign debate, has gone further,suggesting Gaza should be “cleaned out”.Earlier this week, Trump presenteda proposal for a US takeover of Gazathat would require the removal of about 2 million Palestinians to neighbouring countries, a plan lauded by Netanyahu butwidely condemned as a blueprint for ethnic cleansing.Egypt, which borders Gaza, intensified calls with Arab partners on Friday, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to stress its rejection of any measures aimed at displacing Palestinians, its foreign ministry said.Trump’s proposal has also thrown uncertainty over a fragile Gaza ceasefire deal that was reached last month.The ICC was established in 2002 to prosecute serious crimes committed by individuals when member states are unwilling or unable to do so themselves. While the US and Israel are not parties to the statute, their citizens can fall under its jurisdiction. Israel has other allies such as the UK, Germany and France who would be obliged to arrest Netanyahu if he were to travel to those countries.The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were approved by a three-judge panel elected by state parties, and an arrest warrant has also been issued forthe Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif, whose whereabouts is unknown. In 2021,the ICC ruled that it had jurisdiction in Palestineand could investigate crimes there, despite Israeli objections.Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said Trump’s order “sends the message that Israel is above the law and the universal principles of international justice”.She said on Thursday: “Today’s executive order is vindictive. It is aggressive. It is a brutal step that seeks to undermine and destroy what the international community has painstakingly constructed over decades, if not centuries: global rules that are applicable to everyone and aim to deliver justice for all.”The​ ICC​ has separatelyissued an arrest warrant for the ​Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children, andfor Russian officials related to missile strikes on civilian infrastructure.Ukraine said on Friday it hoped the ICC would continue its work on those cases. “We hope that they will not affect the court’s ability to achieve justice for the victims of Russian aggression,” said a foreign ministry spokesperson.After ICC judges issued the arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant in November,the court braced itself for retaliatory movesby the incoming Trump administration. Officials at the court, which is headquartered in The Hague, fear the sanctions could pose an existential threat to the judicial body.Emergency meetings were held on Friday among senior court officials to rapidly assess the implications of Trump’s order, which one official said had been written in such a way that it was “broad enough to be very disruptive for the court if [the US] wants it to be”.Among the issues alarming the court is a requirement in the order that within 60 days the US Treasury submits to Trump the names of “additional persons” to be targeted with sanctions. ICC sources said this would hang over the court and create considerable uncertainty for its staff, operations and access to services it depends on to function.Sanctions placed on Khan would severely hamper his day-to-day work at the court, former and current prosecution officials said. It is expected that Khan will have to be effectively ringfenced from certain cases and some of his staff. He would also be prevented from travelling to the US.In 2020, under a separate but similar executive order, Trump imposed travel bans and asset freezes onthe ICC’s former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, who is Gambian, as well as one of her top officials.The measures were launched in response to decisions made by Bensouda in war crime investigations in Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territories. At the time, Bensouda was conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of crimes committed by Israel’s armed forces and Hamas.In 2021, Bensouda upgraded the case to a formal criminal investigation. Khan inherited the inquiry and later accelerated it after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks and Israel’s ensuing destruction of Gaza.Israel is fighting a separate court case in the international court of justice, which adjudicates disputes between states, onallegations of genocide in Gaza, where it has killed nearly 50,000 people.Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked why Doge needs access to treasury payment systems including Americans’ social security numbers, home addresses and bank accounts, he replied: “Well, it doesn’t, but they get it very easily. We don’t have very good security in our country.”Judge temporarily blocks Trump administration from gutting USAid – liveRead moreThe president claimed that he was “very proud” of Musk’s team of young and “very smart” software engineers. He said: “They’re doing it at my insistence. It would be a lot easier not to do it, but we have to take some of these things apart to find the corruption and we’ve found tremendous corruption.”Doge has so far produced no evidence of corruption at USAid, which it shuttered without seeking the required authority from Congress, or other agencies. Its fast and furiousassault on the governmenthas resulted in a flurry of lawsuits and street protests.Pressed on whether there was anything he has told Musk he cannot touch, Trump offered only a vague reply. “Well, we haven’t discussed that much,” he confessed. “I’ll tell them to go here, go there. He does it. He’s got a very capable group of people. Very, very, very, very capable.“They know what they’re doing. They’ll ask questions, and they’ll see immediately as somebody gets tongue-tied that they’re either crooked or don’t know what they’re doing. We have very smart people going.”Trump confirmed that he had asked Musk – the world’s richest man – to review spending in the sprawling defence department, which has a proposed budget for 2025 of $850bn. “I’ve instructed him to go check out education, to check out the Pentagon, which is the military. And you know, sadly, you’ll find some things that are pretty bad.”But he added pointedly: “Social security will not be touched. It will only be strengthened … we have illegal immigrants on social security and we’re going to find out who they are and take them off.”Democrats in Congress are seeking a treasury department investigation of the access that Musk’s team was given to the government’s payment system, citing “threats to the economy and national security, and the potential violation of laws protecting Americans’ privacy and tax data”.Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wydenwrote in a letterto inspectors general: “Given the threats to the economy and national security, and the potential violation of laws protecting Americans’ privacy and tax data posed by Mr Musk and his team’s reported access to critical federal payment systems … we request that you use your authorities to investigate this matter further.”On Friday, Trump also said Dogeshould rehirea staff member who resigned after being linked by a newspaper report to an openly racist social media account.First JD Vance, the vice-president, said Marko Elez, 25, should be brought back and blamed “journalists who try to destroy people”. Asked whether he endorsed Vance’s view, Trump told reporters he was not aware of the specific case but “I’m with the vice-president”.Soon after Musk, who had polled his X followers on the question,posted: “He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsElon MuskUS defence spendingUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

He did not give any details specifying what the tariffs will be and which countries would be affected.“I’ll be announcing that next week reciprocal trade, so that we’re treated evenly with other countries. We don’t want any more, any less,” Trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba.On Tuesday, the US Postal Service briefly halted all incoming packages from China and Hong Kong after Trump ended ade minimisprovision that allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free.The provision allowed Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu to ship items into the US without having to pay tariffs Trump had enacted on China in 2018. After a 12-hour period, the US Postal Service resumed taking all packages on Wednesday.Anexecutive order, signed by Trump, said he would keep the provision until “adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue”.The president had removed the duty-free provision as his overall tariff strategy against China, what he says is in response to illegal drugs that are coming in from the country. Trumpplaced a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, which went into effect this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The unemployment rate remained steady at a relatively low 4%, edging slightly downward from 4.1% in December.Bar chart with gray bars and one red annotated bar at the endJob growth estimates for previous months were revised higher. Employers added 261,000 jobs in November, up from 212,000; and 307,000 in December, up from 256,000.Jobs growth was lower than initially reported in 2023 and early 2024, with 589,000 fewer jobs added than previously estimated, according to the latest revisions. This revision, while significant, was smaller than some economists had expected.Trump is starting his second term when the labor market has cooled from its peak in 2022. Americans are now seeing fewer job openings and are changing jobs less often. There were 1.3m fewerjob openingslast year than in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).US economy continues to grow at robust pace as Trump vows to reduce pricesRead moreThe Federal Reserve started bringing down inflation rates in the fall, after the labor market finally showed signs of slowing down. Since then, the central bank has brought down interest rates a total of three times, butchose to keep rates steadyat its last board meeting in January.Interest rates currently sit at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a point down from a year ago. Inflation has been hovering above 2.5% over the last few months, down from a peak of 9.1% in 2022.That Fed officials chose not to bring interest rates down further last month shows officials, like economists, are waiting to see the impact that Trump’s presidency will have on the economy.In a statement, the White House claimed the new data showed the economy under Biden was “far worse” than previously thought and “underscores the necessity of President Trump’s pro-growth policies”.“President Trump is delivering on his promise to restore our broken economy, revive small business optimism, create jobs, and ignite a new Golden Age for America,” Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, said.The president has promised to bring down inflation and “bring up jobs”,sayingat the end of January: “We’re going to have a lot of jobs.

An immediate review “is still necessary”, wrote Scott, “given the uncertainty of any outcome in litigation”.He asked the Government Accountability Office to assess whether the executive order the president used to formally establish Doge put in place “any controls” over its access classified information, or compliance with data protection standards. “Please use all authority at your disposal to undertake this review and complete it as quickly as possible.”“The nation needs answers immediately about the scope of those powers; any laws, regulations, or other policies regarding access to these data and systems which may be implicated by DOGE’s infiltration; and the integrity of government programs on which schoolchildren and working families depend for their lives and livelihoods,” wrote Scott.The Government Accountability Office confirmed that it had received the letter, but declined to comment further.

Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new State plans are submitted and approved,” she wrote.Elon Musk’s journey from climate champion to backing EV-bashing TrumpRead moreBiondi added that until new guidance is issued, reimbursements of existing obligations for designing and building charging stations will be allowed in order to prevent the disruption of current financial commitments.According to an existingpageon the energy department’s website, the NEVI program provides funding to states to strategically deploy EV chargers. Funding is available for up to 80% of eligible project costs including the acquisition, installation and network connection of EV chargers, proper operation and maintenance of EV chargers, and long-term EV charger data sharing.Politicoreportsthat as of Thursday, the FHWA removed several website pages that provided information on the NEVI program.In a statement to Politico, Andrew Rogers, a former deputy FHWA administrator under theBiden administration, said that the memo “appears to ignore both the law and multiple restraining orders that have been issued by federal courts”.The outlet further reports Roger saying that the memo appears to be “in direct violation” of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a law thatrestrictspresidents from withholding congressionally approved funding.Currently, 14 states have at least one operational EV station,according toEV States Clearinghouse. As of last November, there are 126 public charging ports in operation across 31 NEVI stations in nine states, marking an 83% increase in open NEVI ports since last quarter,according toa NEVI report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joe Biden did not repeal the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by his predecessor; and indeed erected new barriers in the form of restrictions on exports of important technologies such as semiconductors. (Ironically it appears to be the difficulty in getting hold of the most sophisticated chips, that has partly drivenChina’s development of the cut-price AI-powered chatbot, DeepSeek).When China was integrated into the global trading system, joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) back in 2001, it was meant to bind the populous communist state into a rules-based international system.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump Trump lays much of the blame for US economic woes with Beijing’s policies.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/ReutersThe more closely aligned Beijing became with the global economy, the theory went, the less likely geopolitical tensions would erupt. The real optimists even hoped that over time, China might be guided away from communism.Almost a quarter of a century later, western economies remain scarred by the failures of the global financial crisis and the US manufacturing sector has been hollowed out.That has happened for many reasons, but Trump lays much of the blame with Beijing’s policies, which have included protecting domestic industries and keeping its currency – the yuan – cheap enough to continue generating extraordinary export-led growth.China’s trade surplus in 2024 hit a record $1tn (£810bn), with exports up 10% over the year. Itran a hefty $295bn trade surpluswith the US in 2024 – although that was well below the record $418bn in 2018..American consumers have benefited in the form of a flood of cheap goods – not least those manufactured in China on behalf of US companies. But Trump sees the US’s wide trade deficit with China as evidence of Beijing cheating. He wants to close the gap – by bringing jobs and investment home.As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank points out, the US produces 15% of the world’s manufactured goods and accounts for almost 30% of global consumption. China produces a whopping 32% of manufactured goods, and makes up just 12% of global consumption..Economic theory tends to suggest that as economies develop, they specialise in making and exporting the products where they have particular strengths, and diversify into a more service-based model of growth, as a growing middle class consumes more. But for China, that has not happened.“China’s economic development in recent years, instead of moving it towards a consumer-oriented economy, has moved in the direction of a more advancedmanufacturing economy,” Reid says.He adds: “This may now have gone too far. Access to cheaper goods is no longer a good ‘trade’ for the US, given the loss of economic security over production supply chains and technologies to a competing power.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion.The solution, the Trump administration firmly believes, is for the US to produce more at home. As Bessent put it this week: “Tariffs are a means to an end, and I think that end is bringing the manufacturing base back to the US.”So while what Trump appears to want from Mexico and Canada is a series of ill-defined political actions, he has a clear goal in his interaction with China, and that involves closing the trade gap.Given Trump’s history it will be no surprise that he is likely to seek a deal with Beijing, but Bessent has also played up the possibility of a grand bargain – perhaps along the lines of the Plaza accord, named after the New York hotel in which it was struck in 1985 between a string of countries including the US, Germany, Japan and indeed the UK.View image in fullscreenChina has become a more advancedmanufacturing economy in recent years.Photograph: APThat historic agreement included a decision to allow the dollar to depreciate against other major currencies, in an attempt to narrow the US current account deficit – a measure that includes borrowing from foreign creditors, as well as the trade balance.While it is less visible, the US imbalance with China includes Beijing’s vast holdings of US treasuries – effectively, loans to the US government – which were worth $770bn at the end of 2024, second only to Japan, a geopolitical ally of Washington.Bessent has appeared to back billionaire Elon Musk’s extraordinary onslaught on US government departments, via his role as head of the “department of government efficiency (Doge)”, because the treasury secretary appears to see a much smaller shortfall on the public finances, lessening the government’s dependence on overseas creditors and helping to bring down interest rates, as a key part of the Trump rebalancing project.As a starting point in dealing with Beijing, Trump has asked officials to examine China’s compliance with the “phase one” trade deal he struck with China in his first term, which came into effect in 2020. This included commitments to ramp up purchases of US goods and services.John Glen, the chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), suggests a grand bargain could also include a promise to cap exports – which he warns against.“We did it in the mid-1980s Plaza accord, when the Japanese agreed to voluntarily restrict the amount of cars they exported into the US and the UK. If you’re going to restrain trade that’s just about the worst way you’re going to do it. All it does is it means they make more money on every car they export.”There is a superficial logic to the idea of a grand bargain (some have suggested a “Mar-a-Lago Accord”), however. China has previously suggested it would like to boost domestic demand to make its economy less export-dependent.China’s vice-premier, Ding Xuexiang, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month: “We don’t seek [a] trade surplus. We want to import more competitive, quality products and services to promote balanced trade.”Yet China watchers point out that Beijing saw the Plaza accord as a disaster for Japan, contributing to the subsequent asset bubble, so it is unlikely to want to emulate such a sweeping agreement.Instead, Beijing is more likely to sign up to a symbolic deal in which it pledges more spending and investment in the US, but the deep divide between the two sides remains. “As important as Trump is, the forces driving this fracturing of the relationship between the US and China are just bigger than one person,” Shearing says.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeChinese economyGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

But he is a different player from when he first lit up the NFLAndrew Lawrencein New OrleansFri 7 Feb 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 13.15 ESTSharePatrick Mahomesis the final boss. Somehow, some way, it always comes down to him. From the moment he became theKansas City Chiefs’ starting quarterback in 2018 he has turned theNFLinto a video game of sorts, waiting at the highest levels to knock off all challengers. The longer he looms at the top, the more he seems like a glitch.On Sunday, the Chiefs will face thePhiladelphia Eagleswith football immortality at stake. With a victory, Kansas City would become the first team to win threeSuper Bowlsin a row. The championship run started with theChiefs beating the Eagles two years agoin Super Bowl LVII.As much as Philadelphia’s size advantages on the offensive and defensive lines and the addition of game-breaking running back Saquon Barkley make them look like the better overall team heading into the rematch, the mere fact that the Chiefs have Mahomes and the Eagles don’t is why you’d sooner trust a cat to babysit a goldfish than bet against Mahomes. “If it’s a one-score game, I’m takingPatrick Mahomesany time because he’s just got that championship DNA,” Tom Brady said earlier this season.Consider that source for a moment: Brady, by consensus the greatest quarterback of all time, won a record seven championships while playing for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Two of those came at Mahomes’s expense – in the 2018 season, when Brady’s Patriotsbeat the Chiefs in the AFC championshipin Mahomes’s first year as the Chiefs’ starting quarterback; and two years later, when the Bucs beat the Chiefs on home soil in the Super Bowl itself. Each time, Mahomes gave Kansas City a fighting chance just by having the ball in hands. It’s only Brady’s good luck that he caught him early in his career.Sunday will mark Mahomes’s fifthSuper Bowlappearance. He’s already won the game three times and been voted the most valuable player in each victory. What’s more, he hasn’t even turned 30. Between those trophies and his staggering overall win totals and passing statistics, Mahomes would probably make it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame if he retired on Monday. A third straight championship – something Brady never achieved – would make it a moot point.In the early stages of his career, Brady was the underdog, the “puny” (to league talent evaluators anyway) late-round draft choice who was thrust into duty after a freak injury to New England’s starter Drew Bledsoe and kept on rising to meet the moment. His dink-and-dunk pocket passing style conformed to the geometry of the game. He had a great partner to weather the ebbs and flows in Bill Belichick, the mastermind coach who guided his every step (until their breakup following the 2019 season, after 20 years together).Mahomes? He’sthe villain lurking inside the fortress, ready to knock his challengers back to square one. He’s slippery, spiky and can fire a ball just about every way imaginable. Where Brady had to contend with Peyton Manning for years, Mahomes holds back one of the best generation of quarterbacks the game has seen. The Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson, a two-time league MVP, has only beaten Mahomes once. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen,this year’s NFL MVP, fell to Kansas City in last month’s AFC championship, marking the third time in four seasons that Mahomes has topped him in the playoffs.Philadelphia’s Jalen Hurts played the game of his life when the Eagles faced the Chiefs in the Super Bowl two years ago only to wind up losing after Mahomes drained all the time off the clock. (“He made the plays when they mattered most,” Hurts said after the game. “That’s what the great ones do.”) The only top-level quarterback to hold a head-to-head edge over Mahomesis Joe Burrow, most notably in a victory in the 2022 AFC championship game – but that boast only goes so far when you play for the bungling Cincinnati Bengals.In the days leading up to games Mahomes goes through a metamorphosis – from mild-mannered father of three to ruthless “creature” with “a look in his eye that normal people don’t have,” Chiefs’ offensive coordinator, Matt Nagy,recently told the Athletic. That crunch-time creature brings out the sweat like Michael Jordan trailing in the fourth quarter or Novak Djokovic with his back against the wall in a five-setter: you know it’s a matter of time before he pulls the rabbit out of the hat. But the truly impressive thing about Mahomes is how much he has evolved as a threat. In his early seasons in Kansas City, he piled up the passing yards while chucking deep balls to star receivers Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, and otherwise dazzling defenses with no-look throws and tosses with his weaker left hand.But with Hill long gone to the Miami Dolphins and Kelce past his peak, Mahomes has becomelessof a showman in the pocket, dinking and dunking defenses into a lull before catching them by surprise and taking off running.One drive in this season’s AFC championship game exemplified the new version of Mahomes. With the Chiefs trailing the Bills 22-21 in the fourth quarter, he threw a short pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster that went for 29 yards, ran the ball in for a 10-yard score and then found Justin Watson for a two-point conversion – flipping a one-point deficit into a seven-point advantage in less than five minutes. That’s Mahomes: he doesn’t beat you with huge plays any more. He kills with a thousand cuts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course, there are some who believe he gets help.

This particular deadline was already destined for the NBA history books with the shocking swap of Luka Dončić of the Dallas Mavericks for Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday, marking what many agree is thebiggest trade in league history. But the seismic move shifted the proverbial tectonic plates of the rest of the league, too, as other teams followed suit with their own dramatic dominos. The annual February musical chairs have never had a more feverish soundtrack, so let’s break down the preliminary assessment of which teams came out ahead, and which ones got left seatless.WinnersThe Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade is shocking, franchise-altering and bizarreRead moreLos Angeles LakersSeveral teams got markedly better at the deadline. But only one of them pulled off a tradesounbelievable that the entire internet assumed that the reporter who broke the newsmust have gotten hacked. Players like Luka Dončić just don’t become available via trade, especially not at age 25, but for reasons maybe not ever knowable, he did, and the Lakers were able to capitalize. Yes, losing Anthony Davis and Max Christie stung, but nothing eases the pain of losing your best player and a promising young wing like getting backliterally one of the top three best players in the league at the beginning of his prime. Lakers GM Rob Pelinka was able to shake off years-long criticisms that he’s been too inactive and risk-averse by not only executing the splashiest trade in league history, but also basically fully retooling the roster into a bona fide contender between December and February. He swapped rebellious point guard D’Angelo Russell for three-and-D stalwart Dorian Finney-Smith in late December, and then followed up the Dončić acquisition by swapping rookie Dalton Knecht, Cam Reddish and draft capital for Charlotte’s Mark Williams, who will fill the desperately needed starting center void left by Davis. The Lakers had to overpay for Williams, but they severely underpaid for Dončić, and getting Dončić a big that aligns with his wishes, and thus increases the likelihood of both a championship this year and that Dončić will be interested in staying long term, is worth its weight in (purple and) gold.San Antonio SpursThere’s a certain expectation of timeline when a team drafts a No 1 overall pick, even a generational one. If you’re bad enough to have the honor of drafting first, you generally have bought yourself a little extra time to “go for it”. But Victor Wembanyama is not your typical rookie, and he’s even more special than the typical No 1 pick. So plans change, and timelines get accelerated. Chris Paul has proven to be a solid choice as both a mentor to the French phenom, and a temporary solution as floor general until some of the younger talent on the roster come into their own, but an upgrade was needed. And an upgrade they got, in the form of fringe All-Star and former Clutch Player of the YearDe’Aaron Fox, who requested to be traded from his longtime home in Sacramento to join forces with the most promising young prospect since LeBron James. Fox and Wembanyama are a basketball match made in heaven, one can only salivate at the prospect of the transition lob dunks to come for Wemby moving forward. And just like that, the ceiling is immediately raised in South Texas.View image in fullscreenThe addition of De’Aaron Fox, left, to the Spurs has recalibrated expectations in San Antonio.Photograph: Brett Davis/USA Today SportsCleveland CavaliersThe Cavaliers have been having a historically dominant season, but, at least to this point, I don’t know anyone who truly sees them as a frontrunner to win it all. To the Cavs’ credit, they clearly aim to change that and truly go for it this season. They showed as much at the deadline, by upgrading at the wing and swapping Caris LeVert and Georges Niang for Atlanta’s De’Andre Hunter, who is having a career year and is owed significantly more future salary than LeVert and Niang combined. They’ve been relatively risk-averse since the LeBron James era, and this move indicates a massive commitment from Cleveland to push their chips in on this roster and give the floundering defending champion Celtics a run for their money, which, while sensical, is impressive.Honorable mentionAn additional shout out to ESPN’s NBA InsiderShams Charania, who had, perhaps, a better trade deadline than anybody. Not only did he clear his name once and for all (it isveryclear that he was, in fact, correct aboutJimmy Butler requesting a tradeout of Miami), but in his first trade deadline since the retirement of his mentor/rival Adrian Wojnarowski, Charania had all the shine in the world, and pretty much every trade-breaking exclusive. The cherry on top, of course, is that with the “was he hacked?!” tweet breaking the Dončić/Davis trade, he firmly etched himself into the annals of NBA history.LosersDallas MavericksYou’d be hard-pressed to find a bigger Anthony Davis evangelist than myself, but even I can see that trading a 25-year-old Luka Dončić, whoapparently expressed zero desireto do anything besides retire as the face of the Mavericks franchise, for a 31-year-old Davis and not a whole lot else is an unmitigated catastrophe. The Mavericks did also net a promising young wing in Max Christie, who’d been shining in starting rotation minutes for the Lakers of late, and a first-round draft pick, but guess what makes that measly single first-round draft pick immediately even less valuable? That’s right. Luka Dončić. The team made another move to get Caleb Martin from Philadelphia for Quentin Grimes, but short of another All-Star caliber player, there was no undoing the damage. Unless Dončić goes off a Joel Embiid-esque injury cliff or is found to have a literal or proverbial body buried in his backyard, this will likely go down as one of the worst front-office moves in NBA history.View image in fullscreenA failure to move Nikola Vučević has stalled the Chicago Bulls’ much-needed rebuild.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesPhoenix SunsThe Suns are, to put it mildly, a hot mess this season. And their trade deadline was no exception. For starters, they weren’t able to rectify their now obviously colossal mistake of trading for Bradley Beal and his albatross of a contract by convincing him to waive his no-trade clause (!) for it to be moved by the deadline. Then they had to give up a first-round pick just to move Jusuf Nurkić’s contract, who they traded Deandre Ayton for just a season ago. And to make very bad matters even worse, they let it leak that they were shopping their No 1 superstar Kevin Durant, news which, when it reached him, he was apparently none too pleased to hear. It’s a classic case of New Owner Syndrome™. The Suns currently sit at .500 and are ninth in the West, which would put them squarely in the play-in tournament this spring, but they’re only a precarious single game up on the Warriors, Spurs and Kings in the loss column, all of whom got better at the deadline. A dark time in the valley of the sun, indeed.Chicago BullsDeath, taxes, and me asking “What in God’s name are the Bulls doing?” every February. They finally seem to have, tepidly, started their long-overdue rebuild: they’ve now moved Alex Caruso and DeMar DeRozan (this summer), and as of this week, Zach LaVine, too. The problem is twofold: for starters, the returns for those three players were downright pitiful (they only netted one, yes,one,first-round pick among the three players, and it wastheir own protected pick being returned to them). Secondly, they didn’t move center Nikola Vučević, so they haven’t actually fully cashed in on all potential assets to go full tear-it-down mode. They remain stuck somehow in an even worse, even more depressing iteration of where they’ve been for several years: purgatory. And with unclear building blocks and subpar assets, the future doesn’t look particularly bright.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsLuka DončićJimmy ButlerLos Angeles LakersSan Antonio SpursanalysisShareReuse this content"

Let’s look at the key questions that will determine the outcome of the big game.Can the Chiefs slow down Barkley?Barkley hasput together one of the greatest seasonsin NFL history. He needs 30 yards to break Terrell Davis’ all-time combined rushing record for the regular season and playoffs. So far, no one has found a way to slow him down. Behind a bulldozingPhiladelphia Eaglesoffensive line, Barkley can churn out four yards per carry or turn a sliver of daylight into a house call in a blink.To limit Barkley’s impact, theKansas City Chiefswill need to force negative plays on first down. But figuring out how is tricky. The typical answer to slowing a great back is to crowd the line of scrimmage with as many bodies as possible. And the Chiefs do run five deep, with run-stuffing linemen who can cycle in and out of the game to try to control the line of scrimmage. But Barkley is a one-of-one talent. Somehow, he has beenmoreeffective this season against a crowded line than against defenses that have conceded some mass up front to protect against his home-run potential.Barkley’s greatness comes from his stop-start quickness and vision – aided by a gigantic, mobile offensive line paving an open path. By adding size along the line, defenses hope to turn the run game into a series of one-on-one battles or force the opposing offense to check from a run play to a pass play. But Barkley warps the traditional logic. Hepreferswhen there are more bodies up front; if he can make one defender miss, there are fewer defenders available further down the field to stop him streaking into the endzone. Barkley has forced 77 missed tackles this season and is already up to 54 runs of 10 yards or more. Forty-one of those explosive runs have come against defensive looks with seven or more defenders around the line of scrimmage, anNFLrecord.That puts Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo in a bind. Everything is a trade-off. Does he stack the box and hope Barkley has an off night or that the Eagles shift away from the running game entirely? Or, does he back up and lighten the box, allowing Barkley to churn out easier yards but hopefully limiting the back’s game-changing runs?Will the Eagles blitz Mahomes?Vic Fangio’s defense has been the most consistent unit in the league this season. They stonewall the run. They limit explosive plays. They bludgeon quick screens, a core component of the Chiefs offense. They force turnovers at a sky-high rate. In Jalen Carter, they have a one-man inferno along the defensive line.Howie Roseman: from exile on Broad Street to the Super Bowl’s most important manRead moreUnderpinning that is Fangio’s philosophy: force an offense to drive the field in 15 to 18 plays. It’s not quite a passive bend-don’t-break system, but it’s not far off. Fangio plays with a four-down-and-go front, disguises his coverage on the back end, drops everyone out to space, has his players rally to the ball and then hit like a freight train. He has made subtle adjustments this year, but the foundations are the same as ever.Fangio’s theory is that forcing an offense to drive the length of the field over and over again is mentally taxing. Eventually, he hopes, the opposing quarterback will make a mistake.The logic is sound. The Eagles have forced 26 takeaways this season. And with their offense dominating the time of possession due to their overwhelming run game, opposing quarterbacks have gotten antsy against Fangio’s group. The clock ticks down, the quarterback understands he may only have a handful of possessions, he hunts chunk plays and then, BOOM, here comes a coverage they were not anticipating or a pass-rusher crashing into their face.Mahomes, however, is built differently. He can play in structure or weaponize chaos. He doesn’t take sacks. He rarely turns the ball over – and he’s getting rid of the ball at the quickest rate of his career. With Travis Kelce, Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown, Noah Gray, DeAndre Hopkins and a rotation of three running backs, the Chiefs have a bevy of weapons to attack in any way they please. Andy Reid’s idiosyncratic scheming has allowed them to obliterate opponents on third downs to keep the chains moving. If the scheme breaks down, Mahomes can create a play all on his own. It’s hard to believe, even against an Eagles defense this talented, that Mahomes will gag the game away.Fangio has an awful record against Mahomes and Reid. In seven meetings as a defensive playcaller, Fangio is 0-7 against the pair. His best effort came in Week 9 last season as the Dolphins defensive coordinator. In that meeting, Fangio flipped his approach. Rather than have his defense back up, Fangio blitzed Mahomes at the highest rate he has blitzed any quarterback in the last two seasons. And not any old blitzes, but all-out, oh-no, what-is-he-thinking blitzes. It worked! Fangio held Mahomes to 185 passing yards and the Chiefs failed to score in the second half of a 21-14 win, with Fangio cranking up his blitz rate after half-time.Blitzing Mahomes is risky though. Ever since he stepped on the field as a pro, Mahomes has roasted pressure. Now, he is also the league leader in breaking down quirky zone coverages, the kind the Eagles major in.How much will last year’s gameplan stick in Fangio’s mind? Does he want to blitz the unblitzable? Does he want to dare Mahomes to make a mistake? Overhauling his defensive approach for one game would be a gamble. Fangio has built the best unit in the league by sticking to the principles he has coached with for 40 years. But Mahomes and Reid have proven they can crack his conventional work. The Chiefs offense is always full of surprises. It may be time for Fangio to spring one of his own.View image in fullscreenHarrison Butker kicked the winning field goal for the Chiefs the last time they faced the Eagles in the Super Bowl.Photograph: David J Phillip/APHow healthy is the Eagles offensive line?The Eagles will enter Sunday with injury concerns up front. Left guard Landon Dickerson hurt his knee in the NFC championship game and center Cam Jurgens is dealing with a lingering back injury. Dickerson’s backup, Tyler Steen, struggled in the NFC championship game. And if Jurgens, who is expected to start, is forced to leave the game, then the Eagles will have to move players around to fill the void.Tom Brady’s TV career so far has been a dud. Will that change in the Super Bowl?Read moreDickerson and Jurgens are key to Philly’s run game: Dickerson is a mauler, while Jurgens choreographs the team’s blocking mechanics. If either is limited or misses time, it will be a blow to the foundation of Philly’s offense. More importantly, the two will be crucial in picking up the Chiefs’ wonky blitz packages. Spagnuolo has the broadest blitz menu in the league. He sends heat from unusual angles, in unusual situations. No one has a better read on how an offensive line is trying to protect their quarterback and the best way to break that protection down.Communication is critical to warding off Spagnuolo’s nonsense. If there has been a weak area for the Eagles’ much-ballyhooed offensive line, it’s been picking up different pressure package. They’re a big, front-foot group, that can struggle with the nuances of passing off different pass-rushers and sorting out any chaos in the passing game. Without a settled interior, the Eagles will be in trouble on third downs.Then there is the Chris Jones factor. KC moves Jones all across their front, using the rest of their defensive alignment to scheme up one-on-one mismatches for their star pass-rusher. If either Dickerson or Jurgens are missing, Jones can feast against their backups.Can Jake Elliott match Harrison Butker?Let’s talk kickers! In a tight matchup, field goals will matter. A long bomb or two could tip the scales in a team’s favor, and playing in a dome makes for a favorable kicking environment.The Chiefs have a clear advantage. Butker is the all-time leader in playoff field goal accuracy. He’s hit six of seven kicks from 50 yards or more in his playoff career, though he hasn’t been as accurate from distance this season. But Butker is a proven under pressure, kicking game-sealing field goals in all three of the Chiefs’Super Bowlruns.Elliott has been up and down. He is a career 60% kicker from 50 or more yards but has hit only one of his seven long-range attempts this season. The Eagles have the best short-yardage offense in the league, but if a drive stalls out, Elliott will have to match Butker make-for-make.How will officials call the game?The zaniest conspiracy theory in the NFL is that the league’s officials – and by extension the league office – are colluding to help the Chiefs, even ifthe numbers do not support that theory. The Collusion Believers have not yet consolidated around a single theory, which run the gamut from a dynasty being good for business, Mahomes being the league’s most marketable star and the fact Taylor Swift is dating Travis Kelce. Maybe it’s all three. The evidence? Bad spots. Cheap roughing the passer calls. Uncalled false starts. You name it, and there is no doubt a viral social media clip of a call going in the favor of Mahomes and the Chiefs.The narrative has taken such a pervasive hold that commissioner Roger Goodell addressed it this week, calling it a “ridiculous theory.” The NFL Referees Association issued a statement adding, “Officiating crews do not work the same team more than twice each regular season. It is insulting and preposterous to hear conspiracy theories that somehow 17 officiating crews consisting of 138 officials are colluding to assist one team.”The ideaispreposterous. Have the Chiefs been on the fortunate side of some egregious calls? You bet. Are some of theplayoff numbers a little fishy? Kind of, sort of. Sometimes, itfeelslike the Chiefs get more calls. But that’s probably because they play in more nationally televised games than any other franchise. When thereisa bad call, they take advantage, because they’re the best team of their generation. Their figures are juiced because they have played in more postseason games than anyone in the league over the past three years. They have also had more coaching continuity than any dynastic team in league history – and well-coached teams do not cough up penalties.And yet … the idea that the refs are working to help the Chiefs is out there. Officials are human. Will the narrative play on their minds on Sunday? If there is a 50-50 call, will they holster their flags knowing there is a spotlight on their performance? Maybe, fingers crossed, they will swallow their whistles for the full game, looking to head off any controversy.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlNFLKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the defender was clearly offside when meeting Bruno Fernandes’s spiralling free-kick from the left he certainly did not care as here was his own tale of FA Cup romance.Before the rush of Maguire’s intervention, Joshua Zirkzee’s 67th-minute equaliser appeared the lifeline United needed to keep a shakyFA Cupdefence alive.Van Nistelrooy incensed as Leicester exit to Maguire’s ‘offside time’ goalRead moreHaving bested Leicester 8-2 on aggregate in two previous meetings with their visitors, United were what they are constantly under Ruben Amorim: disjointed. Introducing the jet-heeled Alejandro Garnacho at the break transformed home fortunes as he was key in Zirkzee’s strike. But to dice with being eliminated by opponents with 12 points fewer and candidates for relegation cannot happen, as was the case after Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s first-half opener.But, cometh added time, cometh Maguire, whose intervention would have been scrubbed out if there had been a video assistant referee, and whether James Justin should have been penalised for handball for Fernandes’s free-kick is debatable too.A porous rearguard is one of the myriad problems that plagues United so when Patson Daka out-foxed Leny Yoro and Maguire and teed up Jordan Ayew early alarm bells clanged. The No 18’s effort was fierce and straight at André Onana and the home goalkeeper saved.Momentarily, United turned up the heat: a crossfield Diogo Dalot pass sent Patrick Dorgu sprinting upfield and United claimed a corner on the right. This was the flank Amorim fielded Dorgu on, rather than the expected left, the Dane’s debut offering a first sight of the head coach’s first recruit in action.View image in fullscreenA screengrab shows Harry Maguire (top) in an offside position before heading in a stoppage-time winner.Photograph: ITV SportAmorim explained: “If you see the history of Dorgu in the last team he played a lot on the right. Sometimes you need a left foot on the right side to connect in a different way.”The 20-year-old, signed in the winter window for £25m from Lecce, was a promising blend of pace, neat touches and potency off either boot, as with a right-foot effort aimed too high.Yet Dorgu’s opening period offering was United’s sole glimmer of brightness. Instead, the Premier League’s third-bottom side possessed the thrust, a De Cordova-Reid burst again turning the home team.Amorim either dropped to his haunches in despair or shook his head. Concern, too, coursed through the manager when, down Leicester’s left, Ayew flipped the ball to Luke Thomas and he aimed in a delivery Noussair Mazraoui headed for a corner. When Thomas hit this in from the right Mazraoui, again, repelled.Crumbs was the attacking fare served up by United. A Dorgu foray claimed a corner, Amad Diallo pinged it in, Mads Hermansen clutched the ball, dropped, those United players nearby got excited, then the keeper recovered.Now: joy for Ruud van Nistelrooy’s men and the too-familiar sense of despair for Amorim’s. First, Bilal El Khannouss knocked Manuel Ugarte off the ball. His cross, from the left, was stabbed goalwards by Wilfred Ndidi, Onana saved, but the keeper saw the ball go in off De Cordova-Reid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clever from Leicester, hapless from the opponent who conceded on 41 minutes and, when Michael Salisbury blew for the break, the whistle was followed by the sound of boos from a supremely disgruntled Old Trafford congregation.View image in fullscreenManchester United appeal for offside as Bobby De Cordova-Reid (second right) celebrates his opener.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Allstar Picture Library Ltd/SportsphotoFor the second half Dorgu was replaced by Garnacho in a reshuffle that had Diallo taking the Dane’s berth. A strange decision from Amorim to remove his team’s sole flicker of hope? Certainly, unless this was about the player having taken a knock or having only 45 minutes in him as he moves up to speed with his colleagues.Garnacho instantly burned down the left and splayed Leicester: a fine start but he failed to find a teammate and once more a United attack petered out. Leicester had more fizz. Ugarte, enduring a poor display, could not stop the live-wire El Khannouss swerving around him and on the No 11 went, United just about stopping Daka prospering from the winger’s run.With the clock running down on the holders’ chances, Amorim removed Kobbie Mainoo for Zirkzee and within moments Ugarte sent in Garnacho. At close range he unloaded, the ball ricocheted off Wout Faes’s boot over Hermansen but Caleb Okoli smashed the ball against the bar and the keeper grabbed it.Soon, Garnacho’s zest created the leveller via a shoulder-drop and killer ball in: Rasmus Højlund’s shot was blocked and Zirkzee finished. Towards the end, Garnacho had a golden chance to set up either of the forwards but failed.Now, though, up stepped Maguire. He said: “A great finish to the game. The second half we played a lot better. The first half was nowhere near good enough. We probably deserved to go into half-time losing.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupManchester UnitedLeicester CityHarry Maguirematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Police then determined his cellphone was pinging about one-tenth of a mile from Colbert’s known address in Slidell, Louisiana, which is about 40 miles (65km) north-east ofNew Orleans, Conley said.Conley said officers detained Colbert on Thursday night on suspicion of fraud and theft. Authorities also obtained a warrant to search her home, finding Manzano’s credit card and cellphone. According to Conley, police also found drugs – the pharmaceutical Xanax – as well as a stolen gun, though the chief said investigators “do not believe the firearm is related to this case”.Investigators had not immediately determined Manzano’s cause and manner of death, leaving it unclear whether Colbert could face additional counts.The coroner’s office told Guardian reporting partnerWWL Louisianathat there were no obvious signs of trauma on Manzano.Conley on Friday made it a point to say that Colbert has a history of financial crimes, including allegations of drugging men whose confidence she gained, stealing money and fraudulently using credit cards.At least one of those cases was in Nevada, Conley said.Louisiana criminal court records show she was given five years of probation after pleading guilty in December 2019 to fraudulently using a credit card that a man reported losing at a New Orleans strip club.Asked whether his agency believes Colbert fatally drugged Manzano, Conley said police were investigating to determine whether “criminal activity such as that” having occurred.News of Manzano’s death – at Kenner’s Comfort Inn & Suites New Orleans Airport North – circulated widely after it was announced. The general manager of the Spanish-language Telemundo affiliate that employed Manzano said the late journalist had recently started anchoring while continuing his duties as a reporter.Steve Downing, the Telemundo Kansas City general manager, told WWL Louisiana that Manzano had a “passion” for sports that “led him to do great work, and always with a smile”.Downing remembered Manzano as “enthusiastic and very well-loved and appreciated by the sports teams that he covered here”, including the Kansas City Chiefs, who are pursuing an unprecedented third consecutiveSuper Bowlchampionship in New Orleans on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.Manzano, who also worked for Kansas City-based Tico Sports, was a native of Mexico City. His wife died in a car crash in Topeka, Kansas, in April.The couple’s survivors include a two-year-old daughter.Downing said his station plans to honor Manzano in its upcoming newscasts.“We’re a small operation,” Downing remarked to WWL Louisiana. “So we will be missing a family member.”Explore more on these topicsLouisianaUS crimeSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXUS sportsNew OrleansShareReuse this content"

The 23-year-old Spaniard has arrivedfrom Porto for £50mto help fill the huge hole left by his compatriot Rodri in front of the defence but the former Barcelona man is a very different player. City will need to adapt to him, rather than the other way round, if they are to solve their gaping problem.Pep Guardiola’s and City’s difficulties have been glaringly apparent sinceRodri tore a cruciate ligamentin September. They have lacked physicality and mobility in midfield, leaving them to endure a dreadful run, and arguably the best coach of his generation has been unable to find a solution with what was available to him. González’s welcome to England, and the first test of his capabilities and La Masia upbringing, could come at Leyton Orient of League One in the FA Cup on Saturday.Manchester City sign Porto’s Nico González to take window spree to £172mRead moreFinding someone to replace the irreplaceable was an impossible task, so City searched for someone who could complement Rodri in the future, while being able to soothe ills rather than eradicate them. González will need someone alongside him, whereas Rodri often coped alone.González was born in Galicia and moved to Barcelona’s La Masia academy aged 11, aided by having “football in his blood”, according to his former coach Franc Artiga, in reference to his dad, Fran, who was a Spain international alongside Guardiola. “Nico is a very smart player and a very clever boy in general,” says Artiga, who coached González Jr for five years. “He was a good student in school and worked hard on his education. He developed physically late on; before then he needed to rely on his intelligence. He was always asking the coaches a lot of questions about different topics. He wanted to learn from the coaches – it is not normal that you have someone of that age who had such a thirst for knowledge.”After breaking through at Barcelona, González was unable to become a regular and was loaned to Valencia before being sold to Porto in the summer of 2023, often facing criticism for not being a carbon copy of the ageing Sergio Busquets. Many might have expected the midfielder to thrive in Portugal but a stuttering start almost resulted in him being allowed to leave on a temporary basis after six months. Eventually he found his place in the XI and became a mainstay .“His progression has been spectacular,” says Artiga. “He has everything you want from a central midfielder: he can play more defensively in a double pivot or in a more offensive position. He always had the ambition to be a more attacking player than where he played at Barcelona. He was never a player who could only play just in the style of the Barcelona academy. When he left Barça, he had to learn about a different style of football that has allowed him to grow as a footballer and is much more complete, becoming someone that plays higher up and can assist and score goals.”González’s physicality was attractive to City after months of opponents running through them. His 6ft 2in height is another benefit as City seek a way to be more imposing but the former Spain Under-21s international is not someone who necessarily sits. His being schooled at La Masia may have influenced Guardiola and the City hierarchy to spend so much on someone without a full cap, knowing he will be malleable when it comes to taking on his new coach’s ideas.View image in fullscreenNico González (left) moved to Barcelona’s La Masia academy aged 11 and later graduated to the first team.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersHe has six goals in 24 appearances for Porto this season, an indication of his ambition to get forward. “It’s hard to beat him one-on-one,” says the Arouca midfielder David Simão, who has played against him on three occasions. “He’s a physical guy but also has great technical qualities. He doesn’t play a lot of vertical passes – he’s more likely to go diagonal or to the side. At City he will have the quality to give short passes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When he gets into the box, he is a danger in the air. He’s a tall guy for a midfielder and he is great at timing his runs. I faced him a few games when Porto were not in a good moment and he still wanted plenty of the ball. He had the personality to ask for the ball, to take the ball, to try to put Porto on the front foot. He likes to go box-to-box. He’s not as intense in his running as Matheus Nunes but Nico has more technical quality.”The regular combination of Ilkay Gündogan and Mateo Kovacic has offered little comfort, despite their experience. Nunes is being used at right-back because he has never fully earned Guardiola’s trust, leaving City light on options. Gündogan has failed to repeat the form of his first spell in Manchester, his lack of mobility an obvious flaw, and Kovacic is a regular user of the self-destruct button when trying to take the ball up the pitch. González is a counter-balance of those two issues thanks to his running and ability on the ball but he can also read play to cut out danger and is happy to battle to win possession.“He can replace Rodri,” says Artiga. “The problem he had before was that he was continually compared to Busquets and players cannot be cloned. Busquets was one, Nico is another and Rodri is another. What is clear is that Nico is one of the best in his position and I think that he can fit in perfectly. The mistake would be to try again to compare him with Rodri because he is a player who can play in his position but with different characteristics from Rodri and he can do it very well for City.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Saturday night, 10 years on, the pair of them will be as close but if Atlético score at the Santiago Bernabéu don’t expect the same embrace. Not even if the kid scores it, and he might. If he does, it would mean everything: “Atlético,” he says, “is the team of my life.”His name is Giuliano and he was 12 then. He is 22 now and these days heplaysfor Atlético, still flying up the wing, looking like his lungs might explode. He has become the embodiment of Atlético’s identity during a season in which they are fighting for everything. He is also an academy product and Simeone’s son, however much the manager tries to avoid that fact.Nico González cannot replace Rodri but will help Manchester City fill the void | Will UnwinRead moreGiuliano joined Atlético at 16, having spent his early teenage years with River Plate in Argentina, moving into the family home in La Finca, west of the city, but father and son no longer live together since he returned from a loan spell at Alavés. He and his father sit apart when they go to see Gianluca Simeone, Diego’s son and Giuliano’s brother, play for fourth-tier Rayo Majadahonda. And it has been fun to watch Simeone Sr not celebrate when his son scores and go wild when anyone else does, not least because it is happening increasingly often.But if Simeone once said he could never sign a son of his and is concerned about being accused of favouritism, aware of the risk of dressing room divisions, he need not worry any more. Not just because Giuliano is an academy product rather than a signing, as discreet as his dad, as fiercely competitive as him too, but because when he starts Saturday night’s derby on the right side of midfield it will be for all the right reasons. “I don’t see a son; I see a footballer,” Atlético’s coach insists, and so does everyone else. A very good one too.A ballboy almost a decade ago, Simeone is making his first derby appearance as a player. Like Kylian Mbappé, he sat it outwhen these two great rivals teams metat the Metropolitano in the autumn, a late Ángel Correa goal securing a draw. Now, both will start at the Bernabéu, any doubts there might have been before gone now. After a difficult start, Mbappé has scored 21 times in 33 games. He has nine in his past nine league matches, and two in his past three in the Champions League. Simeone has scored three and set up two more in his past three, decisive in all three competitions.If Mbappé’s recovery was always likely, if Real Madrid coming into this derby top of the table was just logic imposed again, the same was not true of Simeone. This is a decisive derby: Real Madrid and Atlético are separated by a single point, while Barcelona are only three behind that. That owes much to Barcelona’s collapse, a title that seemed as if it was in their hands afterOctober’sclásicoslipping away with three consecutive home defeats, andMbappé becoming Mbappéagain. It also owes much to the ballboy who started this season as a sub, the decision to loan him out again only reversed late in the summer, and is now irreplaceable.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé has hit form recently for Real Madrid.Photograph: Nacho Doce/ReutersAtlético were Spain’s big spenders in the summer, Julián Álvarez and Alex Sørloth arriving for more than €100m between them. They were joined by Robin Le Normand andConor Gallagher. That brought excitement but it needed time. It also meant few opportunities for Simeone Jr. In the opening 11 league games of the season, he played 0, 0, 0, 6, 14, 5, 65, 0, 0, 33 and 20 minutes, starting only once. He didn’t start either of their first three games in the Champions League, two of which they lost. At the end of week 11, Atlético were 10 points behind Barcelona, four behind Real Madrid and trailed Villarreal, having won only five times.The solution, it turned out, was at home. Simeone started the following week and the revival began. It has not all been about Giuliano of course. Rodrigo de Paul looks like the Argentina player, not the man who had the fans whistling him. Álvarez has been outstanding, scorer of 16 goals. Antoine Griezmann has 15. And Sørloth is on 11, mostly from the bench,his contribution key.More importantly, the coach has found a structure; he has also found a collective idea, a commitment, getting his players to truly buy into his idea that they will all play a part – something he says “isn’t difficult; it’s almost impossible”. Atlético have strength and variety in depth, the team that most use their subs and that get the most from them: a third of their goals have come from the bench.Simeone Jr symbolises that, something in his energy, his intensity, which transforms the entire team, in his dad’s words. Beaten only once in the 19 games he has started, they went on a run of 15 successive wins in all competitions. The run ended at Leganés, knocking them back off the top of the table, and a draw with Villarreal followed, but he was then decisive against Salzburg, Mallorca and Getafe, taking Atlético into the top eight of the Champions League, the semi-final of the Copa del Rey and to within a point of Madrid at the top of the table.Asked how they arrive at this derby this week, his dad replied, “by bus”, and then started laughing like Muttley,very pleased with his joke. The real answer is: in very good shape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are though without Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão, David Alaba and Antonio Rüdiger; there will be at least one midfielder in the back four, probably two. There is also, the coach concedes, the old question about balance, a defence exposed; but then there’shatforward line. “I could take off one, two, three, four attackers and press more,” Ancelotti said. “But if I do that, I don’t score 60 goals. It’s simple.”“They have great individuals,” Simeone insisted –four times. “We have to take the game to a place where we can hurt them.”And so it is set, Ancelotti against Simeone again. Against two of them this time, just like 2015. He comes with back-up, fathers and sons entering the fray: Davide Ancelotti, Carlo’s assistant coach, will be there too. This is the 26th meeting between two coaches so classic they bring their kids with them now. No current managers have met as often nor been so well matched: they have won nine each, and it’s a battle every time, they know.“These are the games you like being at,” Madrid’s manager said. “There’s high pressure, yes, but everyone is going to watch it, it’s a great spectacle, there are great players on the pitch, it will be very competitive. It’s spectacular and you’re in the middle of it. As a coach you’re in the most uncomfortable place in the ground but you suffer, you fight with your team. You have to enjoy it before. And hopefully celebrate it after.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridAtlético MadridLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fortunes have diverged since but Orient welcome City to east London on Saturday in upbeat mood and at something of a crossroads.After seven and a half years of steady upward progress since Travis’s consortium took over a club in ruins after relegation to the National League, the chairman has been soliciting fresh investment. A new stadium nearby is being considered and talk has been afoot of aping their former lower division London rivals and “doing a Brentford”. The manager, Richie Wellens, has spoken of “not being ‘little Leyton Orient’ any more”.“I think Brentford’s the inspiration for a lot of football clubs, as are Brighton,” says Travis. “Mark Devlin [Orient’s chief executive, formerly at Brentford] thinks we were in a better position when he came on board than Brentford were when they were inLeague Oneso it’s possible. It’s probably unlikely, but every year except one here we’ve made progress. The biggest issue is the stadium’s not big enough.”Brisbane Road holds 9,271 and with gates averaging 7,628 this term – their highest since the old Second Division days of the 1970s – and a growing local population the case for a move, preferably within their home borough, Waltham Forest, is strong. Three potential sites have been identified.View image in fullscreenThe crowd at the FA Cup quarter-final meeting of Clapton Orient and Manchester City in March 1926. City won 6-1.Photograph: Kirby/Getty ImagesLeague One is a tougher environment, though, than it was 11 years ago, when the Bees began their rise by pipping Russell Slade’s Orient to automatic promotion. The money splurged by American owners at Birmingham – “at least four times our budget” – and Wrexham has raised the cost of competing. Orient, too, are largely US-funded; the 75-year-old Travis is an east Londoner and lifelong fan but is Boston-based and his business, as chair of the Baskin‑Robbins ice cream brand, is in the US. Half the board are American.Travis says Orient’s budget has been revised upwards three times this season as they push for a playoff place, so the estimated £300,000 boost promised by Saturday’s match against a club who have spent £172m on transfers in the past month is a tonic. Wellens, having managed the team to theLeague Two title in 2023, has his team sixth, an unbeaten league run of nine wins and two draws brought to a halt last Saturday by Stockport.That run was kickstarted, or rather head-started, by the on-loan Tottenham goalkeeper Josh Keeley. Orient were heading for a second‑round Cup exit at home to the National League side Oldham until the ninth and final minute of injury time. The O’s won a free‑kick, which the Ireland under‑21 international Keeley met with awell-directed glancing headerto equalise. Wellens’ side won the tie in extra time with another last-gasp goal, from the live‑wire forward Dan Agyei.Keeley says he would “100%” go up for a late set piece should Orient be level or a goal behind late on against City. But other than a bicycle kick in a lockdown kickaround with friends, the Oldham goal is the only one he can recall scoring since he took up the gloves aged 12. Progress has been swift since, as he prospered. at St Patrick’s Athletic, where he was coached by Patrick Jennings, son of another goalscoring former keeper, the Tottenham legend Pat, before his move to Spurs in 2022. Jennings Sr is a regular face at Spurs and he and Keeley have struck up a rapport. “He’s at the club a lot. I’ve even played golf with him,” says Keeley.View image in fullscreenRichie Wellens has led Leyton Orient to sixth in League One after managing the east London side to the League Two title in 2023.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe goalkeeper was Orient’s hero again in round three, saving in the shootout against Derby to set up Zech Obiero’s winning kick. It was the second shootout win of Orient’s Cup campaign, Keeley having also saved a penalty in the first round at non-league Boreham Wood. Every match in Orient’s run has gone the distance – they have played moreFA Cupminutes this season than any other side in the fourth round.Taking the Premier League champions to 120 minutes will be a much more exacting task. For all their recent frailties Pep Guardiola’s side tend to make short work of lower-league opposition, as a half‑strength City showed incuffing aside an in-form Salford 8-0last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is an elite football club so it’s going to be really difficult for us whoever they pick.”Whatever the result the tie can, at least, serve as a celebration of progress made. The club have been galvanised in a rollercoaster decade that has featured their near-destruction under thechaotic three-year ownershipof the Italian waste management magnate Francesco Becchetti, Travis’srescue in 2017, promotion back to the Football League in 2019 under Justin Edinburgh, whotragically died suddenly five weeksafter that triumph, and the progress under Wellens of the past three years.Wellens too deserves his moment in the spotlight. His past as a Manchester United youth player, and lifelong fan – “Pep’s caused me a lot of pain in the past but he’s a genius, a pioneer,” he says – adds spice for a manager who has forged a reputation as a progressive tactician. Injuries have taken their toll recently amid a crowded schedule, depriving Orient of the attacking talents of Agyei, Ollie O’Neill and the commanding defensive presence of Omar Beckles, though they recruited well in January. Still standing though are the classy Northern Ireland midfielder/full-back Ethan Galbraith (another Old Trafford academy graduate, and subject of a rejected £750,000 bid from Swansea on deadline day) and Keeley’s fellow Spurs loanee Jamie Donley, who has sparkled in the No 10 role.It all constitutes a big shop window for team and club, and a prize for fans.“When I think back when we were playing teams in the National League,” Travis says, “I never dreamed we’d be playing Manchester City at home so this is a reward for everyone that’s followed us through the years.”Explore more on these topicsLeyton OrientFA CupManchester CityLeague OnefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have denied wrongdoing.Nico González cannot replace Rodri but will help Manchester City fill the void | Will UnwinRead moreCity have written to the league asking for arbitration over a new system of APT rules agreed by clubs before Christmas. The changes had been made in response to previous arbitration brought by City, which found aspects of the APT rules to be unlawful.In a letter sent to clubs on Thursday the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, confirmed the arbitration request. “On 20 January, 2025, Manchester City FC began a further arbitration to challenge the APT rules,” he wrote. “As you will see, the new challenge relates to the amendments to the APT rules that clubs approved at the 22 November 2024 shareholders’ meeting. Manchester City FC seeks a declaration that the amendments approved by clubs in November (and therefore the current APT rules in force) are unlawful and void.“The Premier League remains strongly of the view that the amendments passed in November were lawful and the APT rules comply with all competition law requirements. We consider that the new arbitration must be resolved as soon as possible and, to that end, have agreed that the same tribunal should be appointed to hear the new case. The parties are currently corresponding in relation to further directions.“The APT rules remain in full force and effect and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system.”City, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest voted against the new rules in November and Chelsea abstained. City had written to clubs before the vote arguing that the process was too hasty and Villa warned in a letter of more legal action from City.“It is now abundantly clear that any vote (if passed) will result in immediate further litigation by Manchester City FC and an associated defence by the EPL (English Premier League), incurring material further costs and unnecessary distraction and devotion of time to this issue,” the Villa letter said.City and the Premier League have been approached for comment.Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola denied City invested £172m on four players in the winter window to mitigate against a potential transfer embargo if found guilty of the charges levelled against them by the league.City historically sign very few players in the winter window but recruited Nico González, Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis. Guardiola was asked whether this was because of potential punishments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the last five years, we are the last team in the top six for net spend.“Even after what we have spent in this transfer window, we are away from Chelsea, [Manchester] United, Arsenal, Tottenham. Even from Liverpool. The only reason why is because we sold a lot in the last seasons but even with that I know this club, it is always ‘just about the money’.“In one month I think there will be a verdict and a sentence and after we will see my opinion of what happened so far. Still, at the end, every club can do whatever they want. Because in the last 10 years we are third [for net spend], but in the last five even with what we won we are behind the top six teams, so I’m sorry for the comments and that is why I don’t agree.”González, a midfielder, was bought because of the serious knee injury sustained by Rodri that is thought to be season-ending. Yet City have selected Rodri in their Champions League squad for the rest of the campaign. Guardiola was asked what chance the 28-year-old has of playing this term.“The rule is we can just add three players,” he said. “Vitor we cannot do it as he was the youngest [inexperienced] one. I would have loved to add all four to the Champions League [squad]. I would love to arrive in the latter stages of the Champions League and Rodri could help us but in my mind Rodri is for next season. Maybe he comes back earlier – that would be good for us.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPremier LeagueFinancesBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Kerr denies the charges.Making his closing argument, Bill Emlyn Jones for the prosecution said that despite the words of former teammates – who flocked to court on Friday and described Kerr as a “truly special human” – she had still called Lovell “fucking stupid and white”.“It might make it surprising, it might make it sad, but it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen,” Emlyn Jones said.He said Kerr’s claims about what had happened in the taxi did not make “one blind bit of difference to what this case is about” and said she was “drunk and angry” and “lashing out in a rage” that night.Kerr said Lovell had doubted her claim of being “held hostage” by a taxi driver.View image in fullscreenSam Kerr arrives at Kingston-Upon-Thames crown court.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesEmlyn Jones said he would not suggest that Kerr is a “card-carrying racist” but asked the jury to consider a “hypothetic question”.“What if PC Lovell had been a black man? What if she had called him fucking stupid and black,” he said. “It’s not really a fair question is it? Calling a white man white is not as loaded as calling a black man black.”He added: “The fact remains that, in the heat of the moment, this was an insult delivered by reference to race and that is what the law prohibits.“The law does not discriminate between different races when it comes to racist language.”Current and former Chelsea players, including Millie Bright and Carly Telford, and the team’s former manager, Emma Hayes, have come to Kerr’s defence in court.Sam Kerr was ‘speaking her truth’ in clash with police, partner tells courtRead moreOn Friday, a number of figures fromChelsea Womenprovided character witness statements in support of Kerr, who was described as “one of the warmest, friendliest, kindest players” but an “introvert” off the pitch.Telford, a goalkeeper who played for Chelsea from 2017 to 2022, told the court she first met Kerr in 2012 when they played against each other in Australia.At one point in the game, Telford “came out to punch a ball, and punched Sam instead”. They met up after the game and “had a good chat”, said Telford. “The fact she came and spoke to me, check in on me. She didn’t have to do that but it was a very nice thing to do.”She said once Kerr had signed with Chelsea, the pair “became close friends”. She described how Kerr would interact with younger academy players. “That’s probably where you see someone like Sam shine the most. She’s the type of person who makes people feel very at ease. I think that’s why she gets on with everyone in the team,” she said.She described Kerr as an “introverted extrovert” who, “on the pitch you see the skills, the back flips [but] away from pitch, she’s quite quiet and shy. Quite reserved”.Telford said Kerr was “generous” with her money and considers how she can cover costs for the younger players on nights out “to make sure they can celebrate with us”.Grace Forbes, defending Kerr, also read out a number of character witness statements provided in writing.Millie Bright, the Chelsea and England defender, described Kerr as a “truly special human”.“Sam is that person who connects with everyone and brings everyone together and puts a smile on everyone’s face. She’s a big believer in having the right environment at the club,” her statement said.“She has the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met and do anything for anyone. There are not many people in the world who can bring people together like Sam. She is a truly special human,” said Bright.Bright said that Kerr has a “great poker face” and that others “probably don’t know what she’s dealing with”. Bright added: “She doesn’t want to put her stresses on others so she deals with it behind the scenes.”Emma Hayes,the former Chelsea managerand current head coach of the USA football team, described Kerr as “one of the warmest, friendliest, kindest and most considerate players” she had ever coached.“She is calm and level-headed and mindful. She comes from a wonderful family. She has the biggest heart, she is a big kid at heart,” said Hayes. “I think she does well to manage everything that is thrown at her and the expectation that is placed on her.”Erin Cuthbert, the Chelsea and Scotland midfielder, called Kerr a “great friend and teammate” who “has a unique knack of seeing the best in everyone”. She said they “immediately got on like a house on fire” after first meeting and “we find ourselves belly laughing often”.“Sam takes part in charity work in Australia. Sam is a pivotal LGBT figure. Sam uses her platform to allow everyone to be accepted and she is no different in her personal life,” said Cuthbert. “That is why I’m lucky to call her my friend.”Kerr’s mother, Roxanne, also provided a statement, called her daughter “the most humble, honest and loving person I know” who “will always fight for what is right”.“I’m so proud of the woman she has become,” she added.The defence will give its closing argument on Monday.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomenLondonWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

They did not manage a shot on target at Anfield, prompting the Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp to describe their performance as “abject”.Postecoglou has previously received the backing of Daniel Levy despite their struggles this season, with the Tottenham chairman understood to have recognised the mitigating circumstances of 10 senior players being injured. Levy also showed his support for the former Celtic manager by bringing in much-needed reinforcements during the winter transfer window, and Postecoglou was adamant he had not even considered whether defeat by Villa could spell the end.Liverpool make winning look easy as Slot’s machine rolls on to Wembley | Andy HunterRead more“That doesn’t enter my head space,” he said. “I get that’s obviously a massive topic of discussion because when things aren’t going well you look at the person who’s largely responsible for that and that’s me. It is what it is. You’ve got to get on with it. It doesn’t change the decisions I make, how I feel, how I work today or how determined I am to continue on this path.“Right now, the focus is on getting this group of players recovered for Sunday. It’s a big game and hopefully a positive result and then over the next couple of weeks we’ll get some significant players back, which I think will help.”Asked whether he still believed in the character of his side after such a damaging defeat against Liverpool, Postecoglou said: “It is really easy – people can sit back from the comfort of their surroundings and say: ‘They are not trying’ or ‘they lack fight or character.’ But that is not what I see.“As I keep saying, maybe we would have been better off if we had not been in the semi-final and we had a week off and preparing for theFA Cupon Sunday and people would look at us differently. But the fact is that we got to a semi-final. These players worked really hard to get there. We didn’t have an easy road to get there. We had a disappointing night for sure. But I don’t question the character or determination of the players to continue on and try and be a success.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I said last night, it’s irrelevant to me what other people’s opinions are. People are on the TV and the radio and in the newspapers to give opinions and I respect that.“They’re allowed to do that but I don’t have any obligation to listen to any of it, to get fuelled by the comments of people I’ve never even met.

We’re an easy mark at the moment and look, after last night, there are times you’ve just got to take it, keep your counsel and atone for it in the way that only really matters and that is with playing the football I know we can.”Postecoglou was dismissive about comments made by the Leyton Orient manager, Richie Wellens, who tried to apologise to his Spurs counterpart after responding to a question about whether injuries had contributed to his team’s defeat to Stockport last week by saying: “I’m not going to make excuses, I’m notAnge Postecoglou.”Postecoglou said: “He’s had his five minutes, that’s good enough for me.”Timo Werner is among three players left out of Tottenham’s Europa League squad to allow for Djed Spence, Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel to be included.

The Republic of Ireland international had been assured of a starting role at Wembley by the former manager Jürgen Klopp as reward for his performances in previous rounds.Liverpool make winning look easy as Slot’s machine rolls on to Wembley | Andy HunterRead moreThe 26-year-old has featuredagainst West Ham,Southamptonand Tottenhamin this season’s run but Slot insists there are no guaranteed places for Wembley. “We never know what the situation is around a final: how fit everyone is, do they need a game, yes or no?” said the Liverpool head coach. “I cannot guarantee anything. I never guarantee anything to players so far in advance and that is not what I am going to do now.”Slot’s selection policy for the Carabao Cup gives Kelleher hope of starting his third final on 16 March, however. “Almost every time we have played the second goalkeeper in the League Cup,” he said. “At Brightonit was Vitos [Jaros] because at that moment Caoimhín was the No 1 as Alisson was injured.“The one exception was Tottenham away [in the semi-final first leg] where Alisson was coming back from injury and I felt he needed some extra playing time. Three days later we played the Accrington Stanley game and then three days after that we played Nottingham Forest. I felt it was better for him to play against Tottenham, then have a week’s rest and then play Forest. It was more with the idea of being best prepared for the league. Yesterday was a League Cup game so that meant Caoimhín was in goal and he absolutely deserved to be in goal for everything he did this season.”Slot will make more changes for Sunday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie at Plymouth. Trent Alexander-Arnold will again be absent with the thigh injury that caused him to miss Thursday’s semi-final defeat of Spurs and is also a doubt for Wednesday’s derby at Everton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before United continue their defence of the Cup at third-tier Wolves on Saturday, Skinner was asked about “Mission 1” and said: “It’s difficult, but I welcome that difficulty. If you don’t have an aspirational target and an aspirational goal, then your progress can get lost along the way. You can achieve a really simple target, and then, what’s next?“I’m not a manager that wants to just stand still. I want to progress, and even if it’s an impossible task, I want to drive towards it, because we believe in it, we believe in ourselves.”Skinner, whose side are second in the WSL, seven points behind the defending champions, Chelsea, said: “I’ll talk specifically about ‘Mission 1’; the men’s team’s is theirs to talk about. For us, I welcome that focus. What we have to do in the meantime is we have to continue to invest in the squad, because if you were to qualify for a Champions League space then it becomes even more difficult [with extra fixtures] and you’ve seen the stretch on the English teams. You’ve seen the investment from the three teams that are currently in those spaces.“We’re trying to do it in our own way, which is about a young, hungry, growing team, which by the time that season [in 2028] comes, hopefully they’re in a position where they’ve got more experience in the league, and then you’re just adding to it.”The club’s two “missions” were the subject of a fiery exchange on TalkSport on Thursday, when the presenter and former Manchester United and Scotland forward Alan Brazil said that the “people around the world are not bothered” about whether the women’s team win the league. Skinner said he had not heard those comments and so did not wish to respond to them, but expressed pleasure that the club were targeting both missions together.Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy in 2024 when admitting that Ineos had not yet “gone into that level of detail with the women’s football team” and made clear the men’s team were his priority. But Skinner said on Friday: “I’ve been in the conversation when they spoke about bringing these kind of missions together and genuinely it’s both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

SI, which is owned by the gaming company Sega, apologised to fans after making the “difficult decision” to cancel the game after a number of technical hitches.“We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and [fans] have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal,” a statement said.The game’s makers said they had planned to “create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation” but that had proven impossible.They said: “While many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line – but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The team don’t deserve this’Jamie Jacksonat Old TraffordFri 7 Feb 2025 18.34 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareA furious Ruud van Nistelrooy said Leicester were not defeated “in ­Fergie time” but “in offside time” after Harry Maguire’s 93rd-minute winner for Manchester United was ruled legal andeliminated his side from the FA Cup. With no video assistant referee in the competition until the next round, Maguire’s winner was not chalked off despite the assistant referee being perfectly in line to see he had infringed.“We are not defeated in Fergie time, we are defeated in offside time,” said Van Nistelrooy, referring to the extra minutes opponents claimed were allocated to United when needed under Sir Alex ­Ferguson, the Dutchman’s manager at Old ­Trafford. “It is a hard one to take because the game was decided on a mistake, that is clear. It is not a matter of VAR, where you have to look at ­millimetres. It is half a metre, it is clear. The team didn’t deserve to lose the game in this way. They fought, played well, and dominated the game for a long bit.”Van Nistelrooy was asked if VAR should be used from the third round onwards when possible. “Let me think about that question,” he said.Van Nistelrooy was curt when asked if being knocked out was a blow. “That is not a question for me,” he said. “We want to die on the pitch today, to get to the next round, to be the best we can be, to be competitive, we are representing ourselves on the pitch at Old Trafford.”Ruben Amorim was visibly disappointed at United’s poor performance. “We had to believe until the end but this game has nothing to do with the time of Fergie,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s really hard to lose one game in the last minute with an offside play. The performance: we have to do so much better with the ball, without the ball.“We didn’t have any energy in the beginning, especially in the first half. Then in the second half we played a little bit better, with a little more speed, winning second balls.

That group includes the former captain Owen Farrell as well as a clutch of players enjoying fine seasons in the Top 14 such as David Ribbans, Kyle Sinckler, Manu ­Tuilagi and Joe Marchant. Henry Arundell, meanwhile, who has endured a ­difficult season at Racing 92, has signed for Bath next season.Borthwick lamented a lack of experience afterhis side’s defeat by Irelandlast weekend left their Six Nations hopes in the balance and though his captain, Maro Itoje, insisted “we want all the best ­players to available”, he stopped short of explicitly urging the Rugby Football Union to change its policy. Dupont, for his part, expressed his relief that Jack Willis – with whom he has won the Champions Cup and two Top 14 titles at Toulouse – will be absent.“Yeah, I’m a bit surprised, but I’m quite happy not to be playing against Jack,” said Dupont. “We know the nightmare he is in the ruck area.

Itoje signed a new Saracens contract last year – becoming one of the flagship recipients of an offer of an enhanced England deal – amid ­interest from Toulouse, Lyon and ­Racing 92. When Saracens spent a ­season in the ­Championship ­following their relegation, it is ­understood Itoje explored a loan move to France in the hope he would still be considered eligible for ­England but rival Premiership clubs blocked such a proposal.During the autumn campaign, amid speculation over a global breakaway league that would involve the formation an eight-team franchise competition that would tour the world, Itojeinsisted that playing for England was “the mecca”amid fears Borthwick’s players would join the rebel organisation and render themselves unavailable for international duty.And on the eve of Le Crunch, Itoje has admitted that the lure of playing for England remains strong enough to turn down approaches from abroad. “The reason I didn’t pursue that is because I wanted to play for ­England,” he said. “I felt like my time in an ­England shirt was not quite done yet.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje says he did not pursue a move abroad because of his commitment to play for England.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters“In my heart of hearts I would have been looking at England ­playing from across the Channel and I wouldn’t have been at peace with the decision.

The ousted food bank leaders said they were removed because they refused to bow to “pressure placed on Second Harvest to contribute as much as $16m toward helping to resolve victims’ claims” ofchild molestation by clergywhich are at the center of a pending federal bankruptcy protection case that the church filed in 2020.‘Crisis communications’: emails show how NFL’s Saints and NBA’s Pelicans helped New Orleans church spin abuse scandalRead moreThen, on Monday, the Guardian, its reporting partner WWL Louisiana, the Associated Press and the New York Times reported on copies of hundreds ofemailsthe four news outlets exclusively obtained.The emails by top brass of the NFL’sNew Orleans Saintsand NBA’s Pelicans showed the teams’ owner, devout Catholic Gayle Benson, and team executives were far more involved in helping Aymond spin media coverage of the clergy abuse scandal that precipitated the bankruptcy than the teams and church had previously acknowledged. And, though the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, suggested he was unconcerned about the communications, many fans of the teams as well as advocates of clergy-abuse survivors have expressed disgust about the ball clubs’ involvement.Aymond declined requests for interviews about the pair of controversies. And a church spokesperson told the WWLLouisianareporter covering both stories that the archbishop would never again sit down with the journalist for an interview.Instead, Aymond’s archdiocese has made statements saying the media have misconstrued the nature of the emails involving the church, Saints and Pelicans. And he also released a video-recorded statement primarily seeking to address aspects of the spat withSecond Harvest– although its main assertion has drawn a strong challenge by the former food bank board members.Aymond’s central contention in the video was that the leadership of Second Harvest had refused to sign what is known as a “tolling agreement” to protect them and other church-controlled entities from being sued while the archdiocese tries to settle hundreds of child molestation claims under its bankruptcy.“The deadline to execute this agreement was January 31, 2025,” Aymond said in the video. “This is why the very difficult decision to transition leadership was made.”But court records filed in the bankruptcy case show the current tolling agreement, protecting Second Harvest and the church affiliates during settlement negotiations, runs through 1 May 2025, which is the fifth anniversary of the bankruptcy.Nick Karl, a former chair of the Second Harvest board who has supported and served at the non-profit since 2008, called the archbishop’s statements in the video “unfortunate”.Karl said the fired executive board members – whom Aymond subsequently replaced – supported extending the tolling agreement. He said the fired CEO, Natalie Jayroe, was planning on signing the extension well before the 1 May deadline.The archdiocese has approached more than 100 affiliates – or “apostolates” – about signing a so-called channeling injunction, which protects those entities from being sued separately from the archdiocese and creates a combined fund for paying claims. Karl said he and the other ousted food bank leaders would have considered signing it, as long as Aymond agreed to remove himself as the sole corporate member of Second Harvest.Under the ousted leaders, Second Harvest had separate legal representation from the other apostolates in the church’s bankruptcy case. Karl said having the archbishop ofNew Orleansas the sole corporate member of a non-profit that covers 23 south Louisiana parishes – which is the state’s word for counties – from the Texas border to the Mississippi state line makes little sense when the archdiocese only covers eight parishes in the south-east corner of the state.In his recorded statement, Aymond said he came to accept the idea of divesting his control of Second Harvest. But “a legal separation would include Second Harvest purchasing the assets that are controlled by the sole member”, he said.That’s where the $16m figure was proposed, Karl said. And he said that contracts Second Harvest has with its donors – including a $25m grant from billionaire and novelist MacKenzie Scott’s foundation – prevent the money from going to any purpose outside the food bank’s mission of feeding the hungry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHowever, Second Harvest’s public financial report filed on 30 December shows it had $85m in net assets as of 30 June 2024, $55.9m of which had no donor restrictions.Aymond said in the recorded statement that he regretted that negotiations with Second Harvest had devolved.“The characterizations of the archdiocese as stealing money from the hungry are completely false,” he said. “The most difficult part of this is that it may have been preventable if the parties, including myself, would have put aside our pride and negotiated in good faith without threats of litigation.”But at the end of the week came a new revelation suggesting any “negotiating” would have been merely for show. As the sole corporate member of Second Harvest, the archbishop of New Orleans already had the power to hire and fire the food bank CEO and members of the non-profit’s board of directors.A day before Aymond fired the leaders, he used his unilateral powers to amend Second Harvest’s governing documents to give himself even more power. On 29 January, he signed amendments giving himself the right to fire the CEO “with or without cause” and appoint new leaders to board committees.He also gave himself new power to hire and fire any professionals working for the food bank, unilaterally execute all legal agreements for the corporation and even dissolve the corporation, leaving some board members feeling as if they were losing any power to negotiate the amount of money the non-profit would have to pay to be free of Aymond’s control.Even the modicum of decision-making authority the board appeared to have over its own leadership now appears to be moot. Until recently, Second Harvest’s corporate bylaws said: “The Chair is elected by the Board of Directors. All Officers of the corporation other than the President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) shall be elected by the Board of Directors.”But at an emergency board meeting on Wednesday, the directors learned Aymond had named a new chair, vice-chair and executive committee member without the board voting. That reportedly prompted one director to ask: “Why are we here?”Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseNew OrleansLouisianaNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansUS sportsChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We (mostly) have the answersTom LutzFri 7 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.22 ESTShareThe biggest game of the year inUS sportstakes place on Sunday. We’re here to answer all your questions (or the ones we came up with anyway).Let’s get the simple stuff out the way first. Who is playing in the Super Bowl?This year’sSuper Bowl– or Super Bowl LIX for NFL brand evangelists and fans of Roman numerals – will be between theKansas City Chiefsand thePhiladelphia Eagles.You may be familiar with the Chiefs’ body of work: this is their fifthSuper Bowlappearance in six seasons, and a victory would be their third championship in a row, something no NFL team has achieved before. In short, they’re really good.The Chiefs may be the Super Bowl villain but we’d be lost without oneRead moreThe Eagles, meanwhile, are in their third Super Bowl in seven seasons, thanks in large part to the genius-level intellect of their general manager,Howie Roseman. In short, they’re also really good.When will the Chiefs and Eagles kickoff?The game starts on Sunday 9 February at 5.30pm local time inNew Orleans, which is 6.30pm on the US east coast, 3.30pm on the west coast, 11.30pm in the UK and 10.30am on Monday in Sydney.And where can I watch or stream it?Unsurprisingly, the game is sold out but tickets are on resale for as, ahem, little as $2,800.A slightly cheaper option is watching it on TV. Fox is this year’s broadcaster in the US, with the main analyst beingTom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls himself during his playing career. Spanish language viewers have two options: Fox Deportes and Telemundo.In Canada, the game is on TSN and CTV; in Britain you can watch on ITV1 and Sky Sports; and in Australia you can catch it on the Seven Network and ESPN.Where will it be played?The Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, will host the game. The NFL tends to choose warm weather cities as hosts to avoid fans freezing during the game. But northern cities do occasionally get the Super Bowl – the distinctly untropicalMinneapoliswas given the nod in 2018 – but in those cases they’re nearly always played in indoor stadiums.Do teams ever play the Super Bowl in their own stadium?Host cities are chosen years in advance, so while teams can end up playing in their own stadium, it’s rare. Only two teams, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams, have won the Super Bowl in their own stadium. Right now, the Saints are whatNFLexperts refer to as a Very Bad Team – they did not make the playoffs this season.Which celebrities will be at the game?Just in case you’re one of the eight people on the planet who don’t know this, Chiefs star Travis Kelce isTaylor Swift’sboyfriend. She’ll almost certainly be at the game, and the cameras will cut to her every 39 seconds or so. Last year, some on the US right believed the game would be fixed to ensure a Chiefs/Kelce/Swift victory in order to give Joe Biden an advantage in the presidential election. The conspiracy did not quite work out as planned.In other good-looking people news, Bradley Cooper is a hardcore Eagles fan and is more than likely to be at the game.Paul Rudd, a longtime Chiefs fan, was at last year’s game and is likely to attend this year too. But there are a lot of complimentary tickets to the Super Bowl, so expect plenty more celebs.So the game will unite a divided America?Yeah … sure.Donald Trumpis set to become thefirst sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. And because we haven’t heard enough from him of late, he’ll sit down for a no doubt measured and conciliatory interview that will be broadcast before the game on Fox.What kind of reception will Trump get?Trump is a big sports fan. He has been cheered at college football games but was booed and greeted withchants of “lock him up”when he appeared at the 2019 World Series in his first term as president. The Super Bowl will be played in a Democratic city in a Republican state in front of fans from all over America, so the most likely reaction is cheers and boos when he appears on screen. Somewhat surprisingly, given that Trump once wrote“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT”on social media, Kelce says it will be anhonor to playin front of the president.Will this affect the rumored proposal Kelce has prepared for Swift after the game?It may! Although Kelce pushed back on those rumors earlier in the week when he was asked if he intended to give Swift a ring after the game.“A Super Bowl ring?Next question,” he said.Who are the players to watch?The Chiefs have the best player on the planet,Patrick Mahomes,at quarterback. A win on Sunday would be his fourth Super Bowl title, putting him on track to break Brady’s record of seven and threaten the former Patriots star as the greatest quarterback of all time. Mahomes does not roll out as many breathtaking throws as he once did, but the 29-year-old nearly always makes the right decision and is best when the pressure is on, which is pretty useful in the biggest game of the season. The Chiefs also have a brilliant defense, masterminded by defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.The Eagles are led by running back Saquon Barkley, who joined them from their rivals, the New York Giants in the offseason, and promptly had one of the best rushing seasons of all time. The Eagles also have a formidable defense and arguably the deepest and best roster in the entireNFL.Who is doing the half-time show?Bad news for Drake if he wants to watch:Kendrick Lamarwill be performing at half-time (he also appeared at the 2022 Super Bowl). Louisiana nativeJon Batistewill sing the national anthem.Who is the favorite to win the Super Bowl?The Chiefs are the betting favorites, which is not a huge surprise considering they’re the two-time reigning champs, have been to seven straight AFC Championships, won nine straight AFC west division titles and have lost just twice all season. But they also won a lot of tight games they could easily have lost, although some point out the fact that they do so with monotonous regularity shows they’regood rather than lucky. The Eagles also have a deeper roster, which gives them the edge for many pundits.This article was amended on 7 February 2025 to remove a suggestion thatTaylor Swiftendorsed Joe Biden in 2024. She endorsed Kamala Harris on 10 September 2024.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlTravis KelcePatrick MahomesNFLTaylor SwiftKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesexplainersShareReuse this content"

Still, he’s happy to be recognized for his accomplishments.Allen edged two-time winner Lamar Jackson for the APNFLMost Valuable Player award in the closest race since Matt Ryan beat out Tom Brady in 2016.“I wish we weren’t hoisting this trophy. I wish we were hoisting the Lombardi – and we’re going to keep working until we do,” Allen said Thursday, referring to winning aSuper Bowl.Allen, who led Buffalo to a fifth straight AFC East title, got 27 first-place votes to Jackson’s 23 and finished with 383 points. He received 22 second-place votes and one third. The Bills fell short of playing on Sunday, losing to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC title game.Jackson, who led the Ravens to a second straight AFC North championship, got 26 second-place votes and one fourth for a total of 362 points.Eagles running back Saquon Barkley finished third (120 points) followed by Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (82) and Lions QB Jared Goff (47).Allen threw for 3,731 yards, 28 TDs and had six picks for a 101.4 passer rating. He ran for 531 yards and 12 scores, becoming the first player in NFL history to have five consecutive seasons with at least 40 total touchdowns.“I feel like my teammates wanted this more for me than I did, but I’m very honored,” said Allen, who was joined at the awards by fiancée Hailee Steinfeld.Jackson had career-highs with 4,172 yards passing, 41 TDs to just four interceptions and a 119.6 passer rating, which led the NFL. He got 30 first-place votes to Allen’s 18 to earn AP first-team All-Pro honors.The last time a first-team All-Pro didn’t win the NFL MVP award was 1987. John Elway was the MVP that season and Joe Montana was first-team All-Pro. The MVP award is given to a player who had the most valuable season while All-Pro is a statistical recognition.Kevin O’Connell beat out Dan Campbell for AP NFL Coach of the Year after leading the Minnesota Vikings to 14 wins with quarterback Sam Darnold.The Vikings, widely picked to finish last in the NFC North, ended up playing for a division title and the conference’s No. 1 seed in the final game of the regular season. They lost to the Lions and then were knocked out of the playoffs by the Rams.“I put a lot of thought into this season. I thought it had a chance to be a special team,” said O’Connell, who was presented by Bill Belichick, the coach who drafted him in the third round in 2008. “It really wasn’t about that. It was more my belief in our organization and my belief in our coaches and our players to come together and just try to win one football game.“It’s a great example of unique people and unique things being able to come together and find a way to try to have unique results.”O’Connell got 25 first-place votes, 18 seconds and seven thirds, appearing on all 50 ballots.Campbell, who guided Detroit to a franchise-record 15 wins, got 19 first-place votes to finish second. Kansas City’s Andy Reid (4), Denver’s Sean Payton (1) and Washington’s Dan Quinn (1) also received first-place votes.Joe Burrow took the AP NFL Comeback Player of the Year award after returning from wrist surgery in 2023 to lead the NFL with 4,918 yards passing and 43 touchdown passes.Burrow played all 17 games for the Bengals (9-8) after missing seven due to injuries the previous season. He received 31 first-place votes and finished far ahead of Chargers running back JK Dobbins (3).Vikings QB Sam Darnold (8), Bills safety Damar Hamlin (3) and Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez (2) also got first-place votes.Saquon Barkley ran away with the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year award after rushing for 2,005 yards, eighth-best in NFL history, in his first season with the Eagles.Barkley sat out Philadelphia’s final regular-season game when he was 101 yards away from breaking Eric Dickerson’s single-season record but he has 442 rushing yards and five touchdowns in the playoffs.Barkley needs 30 yards rushing in the Super Bowl to set the all-time single-season record, including the playoffs. Hall of Fame running back Terrell Davis had 2,476 yards rushing in 19 regular season and playoff games in 1998 for the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos.Barkley received 35 of 50 first-place votes.Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson received 12 first-place votes and teammate Derrick Henry got one. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and Bills QB Josh Allen also received one first-place vote each.Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase finished third in the voting despite no first-place votes. Chase, a unanimous selection for All-Pro, won the receiving triple crown, leading the league with 127 receptions, 1,708 yards and 17 TDs.Patrick Surtain II became the seventh cornerback to win the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award.The Denver Broncos’ All-Pro allowed just 37 receptions, had four interceptions and opposing quarterbacks had a 61.1 passer rating throwing against him.Surtain received 26 first-place votes, beating out Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson (11) and Browns edge Myles Garrett (5).“When I’m holding my side of the field down, that’s where I become most valuable to the team,” Surtain said. “That’s what I did all year. ... That’s what I came to do, is lock down my side of the field.”Steelers edge TJ Watt (3), Eagles linebacker Zack Baun (2), Lions safety Kerby Joseph (1) and Vikings edge rushers Andrew Van Ginkel (1) and Jonathan Greenard (1) also received first-place votes.Stephon Gilmore was the last cornerback to win the Defensive Player of the Year award in 2019. Charles Woodson, Deion Sanders, Rod Woodson, Lester Hayes and Mel Blount previously won it.Jayden Daniels was a near-unanimous choice for AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year after helping the Washington Commanders win 12 games.The Pro Bowl quarterback received 49 of 50 first-place votes with the other going to Raiders tight end Brock Bowers.“It’s just nothing but hard work, and just preparation,” Daniels said, alluding to the jump he made in his final season at LSU, when he won the Heisman Trophy. “If you lock in for one year, your life will change. I kind of did that.”Daniels, the No 2 overall pick, threw for 3,568 yards, 25 TDs and posted a 100.1 rating. He also ran for 891 yards and six scores. Daniels led the Commanders to a pair of road playoff wins before losing to the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game.Broncos quarterback Bo Nix finished third in the voting, Jaguars wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr was fourth and Giants wideout Malik Nabers placed fifth.Ben Johnson was a clear choice for the AP NFL Assistant Coach of the Year, receiving 29 first-place votes.Johnson, who was the Lions offensive coordinator, led a group that was first in scoring (33.22 points per game) and second in yards (409.5). He was hired to coach the Chicago Bears after Detroit lost in the playoffs.Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores got three first-place votes and finished second in the voting. Former Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, who was hired to coach the New York Jets, received six first-place votes and came in third.A nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the league completed voting before the playoffs began.Explore more on these topicsNFLSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXUS sportsBuffalo BillsShareReuse this content"

The ADP service uses end-to-end encryption, a form of security that means only the account holder can decrypt the files and no one else can – including Apple.Apple declined to comment. However, in a submission to parliament last year itflagged its concernsabout the IPA, saying it provided the government with “authority to issue secret orders requiring providers to break encryption by inserting backdoors into their software products”.Apple touts privacy as one of its “core values” and describes it as a “fundamental human right”.The Apple document refers to the ADP feature, claiming that “reporters and technical experts across the globe” welcomed it as an “invaluable protection” for private data.The submission also indicates that Apple would refuse to cooperate with a request, saying the company would “never build a backdoor” and would rather withdraw “critical safety features” from the UK market.However, the submission also points out that the IPA allows the UK government to impose requirements on companies based in other countries that apply to users globally.Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said the UK government had “lit the blue touch paper on a truly enormous fight in the never-ending saga of the encryption debate”.He added: “I don’t see how this is to be resolved, as Apple has made such a big point of privacy for users. If they accede to this technical notice their reputation will be in tatters. They’re bound to challenge it.”End-to-end encryption hasbecome a battleground between successive UK governments and tech companies, with ministers arguing that the technology prevents law enforcement agencies from tackling criminals, including child abusers.Companies are also barred from revealing whether they have received a technology capability notice under the IPA. The Washington Post reported that by the time Apple made its submission in March last year the US-based company had been informed that a notice might be served on it. The newspaper said the Biden administration had been tracking the matter since the UK government told Apple it might demand access, and Apple had said it would refuse.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on operational matters, including, for example, confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.”The submission related to amendments to the IPA passed last year under Rishi Sunak’s government and included giving ministers power to clear in advance any product changes that could alter the UK government’s ability to access users’ data.One expert warned that the multinational nature of the order could lead to a clash with the EU, which has an agreement with the UK allowing the free flow of personal data between the EU and UK – such as a company in Europe using a datacentre in the UK. The agreement comes up for review this year.“This may provide a backdoor for access to European citizen data which could go against our ability to retain the rights to share personal data without restriction between the UK and Europe,” said Ross McKenzie, a data protection partner at the UK law firm Addleshaw Goddard.Explore more on these topicsAppleEncryptionPrivacyComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a clear and deliberate business decision by TikTok that cost these four children their lives.”According to TikTok, searches for videos or hashtags related to the challenge have been blocked since 2020. The platform says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges, and aims to remove these before they are reported, as well as directing those who search for hashtags or videos to its safety centre.The complaint was filed in the superior court of the state of Delaware on behalf of Archie’s mother, Hollie Dance, Isaac’s mother, Lisa Kenevan, Jools’s mother, Ellen Roome, and Maia’s father, Liam Walsh.The lawsuit accuses TikTok of being “a dangerous and addictive product that markets itself as fun and safe for children, while lulling parents into a false sense of security”. It says TikTok “pushes dangerous prank and challenge videos to children based on their age and location in order to increase engagement time on the platform to generate higher revenues”.The lawsuit further claims that TikTok has told lawmakers around the world that the blackout challenge had never been on its platform and “works to discount credible reports of children being exposed to and dying because of blackout and similar challenge videos on the platform”. It notes that other dangerous challenges that have been found on TikTok include those involving medications, hot water and fire.The firm states that the parents believed TikTok was a “fun, silly and safe platform designed for kids and young people”, and claims that the children involved were “confident” and “well-behaved”, and did not have prior mental health problems.The Social Media Victims Law Center represents families who believe their children have been harmed by social media, and has filed several other lawsuits against TikTok over the deaths of children and young adults, including for promoting videos showing suicide, self-harm and eating disorder content.The law firm helped Tawainna Anderson sue the platform in 2022 after her 10-year-old daughter, Nylah, died after allegedly taking part in the blackout challenge. A US appeals court overturned a lower court’s dismissal of her case in August 2024.In February last year,a coroner ruledthat Archie had “died as a result of a prank or experiment gone wrong” at his home in Southend-on-Sea. He said he could not rule out the blackout challenge but noted that there were “hundreds of other possibilities”.Jools’s mother hascampaignedfor parents to be given the legal right to access their children’s social media accounts to help understand why they died, after she was left with no clues as to her son’s death in 2022.Changes to theOnline Safety Act, which come into force in the UK this year,explicitly requiresocial media companies to protect children from encountering dangerous stunts and challenges on their platforms, as well as to proactively prevent children from seeing the highest-risk forms of content.Explore more on these topicsTikTokSocial mediaChildrenDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

This is a dangerous trend,and we face a real risk that our development, deployment and use of AI could do irreparable damage to the environment.”Google and Microsoft havereported year on year increases in data centre water consumptionsince 2020, and many of these water withdrawals come from potable water sources. In its annual environmental sustainability report in 2023, Microsoft said it consumed 6.4m cubic metres of water in 2022, primarily for its cloud data centres – a 34% increase on the year before.Google said its data centres consumed 19.5m cubic metres of water in 2022, up 20%.There is no reliable data on the quantity of resources used by data centres. In order to make effective policy to reduce their energy consumption, the government needed to collect information at scale, the report said.Rodden said it was vital to monitor the environmental cost of AI. “Once we have access to trustworthy data pertaining to their environmental impacts, and a sense for where these services and systems are needed, we can begin to effectively target efficiency in development, deployment and use, and plan a sustainable AI future for the UK.”The report made recommendations to policymakers including the need to:Expand mandatory environmental reporting.Provide information on environmental impacts of AI systems.Set environmental sustainability requirements for data centres.And reconsider data collection, transmission, storage and management practices.Sarvapali (Gopal) Ramchurn, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton and the chief executive of Responsible AI UK who was also on the NEPC working group, said: “AI’s use has surged in the past two years, aiding daily tasks and boosting productivity and innovation. However, many are unaware of the significant costs and environmental impacts … AI providers must be transparent about these effects. If we cannot measure it, we cannot manage it, nor ensure benefits for all. This report’s recommendations will aid national discussions on the sustainability of AI systems and the trade-offs involved.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)EnergyMicrosoftGoogleWaterEnergy efficiencyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

SI, which is owned by the gaming company Sega, apologised to fans after making the “difficult decision” to cancel the game after a number of technical hitches.“We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and [fans] have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal,” a statement said.The game’s makers said they had planned to “create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation” but that had proven impossible.They said: “While many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line – but that’s not the right thing to do.

And, in so doing, showing their colleagues how to overcome their reputation for ditheringFri 7 Feb 2025 11.28 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareIt’s easy to be disgusted with the Democratic party right now.Donald Trumpis running roughshod over the rule of law, treating the US constitution like toilet paper. His trusty pal Elon Musk is the arsonist in chief, burning down worthy democratic institutions and installing his minions in the heart of government where they have gained access to citizens’ private information. Much of what’s happening is illegal and unconstitutional.And the Democrats, mostly, look less like an opposition party and more like stunned bystanders. As my Guardian colleague Moira Doneganput it,they are “out of touch, opportunistic and cowardly”.But not all. Some Democrats in a new generation are punching back hard, and in so doing, showing their colleagues how to overcome their reputation for spineless dithering.Take Jasmine Crockett, for example, a 43-year-old congresswoman from Texas, who is defiantly feisty. You’ll find her everywhere – on social media, on cable TV and leading citizen protests in front of government office buildings.“We have a thug in charge of the White House,” shethunderedin a TV appearance this week. And she didn’t spare her fellow citizens who elected Trump or who stayed home instead of voting in November. “Americans thought that it was OK to take a full-fledged criminal and make him the president of the United States, and then they want to act aghast when he does criminal things.”I’ve been talking with Sawyer Hackett, a strategist who worked in the Obama administration, about how Democrats can meet this terrifying moment. He praised Crockett as “an authentic source of righteous indignation when Democrats desperately need it”.The millions of anti-Trump Americans, he told me, aren’t interested in curated talking points or polished press conferences.“They want to see us fight and speak clearly about the threats we face,” Hackett said, and she has been delivering. As a Black woman, Crockett is particularly incensed about TrumpWorld’s racist attacks on diversity and has no hesitation in blasting the “mediocre white men” who benefit.The Connecticut senator Chris Murphy is at least as impressive. He has been relentless in calling out exactly what’s happening and why, especially in the shocking weeks since Trump took office.“We have days to stop the destruction of our democracy,” Murphy raged at a protest Tuesday in front of the US treasury building in Washington. “It’s the people who rule, not the billionaires. We are taking this country back fromElon Musk.”Murphy calls what’s happening a constitutional crisis. It is one that the public must play a role in fixing by putting pressure not only on Democrats but on the cowardly Republicans who hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Talk about spineless!“There’s been no better messenger in the first two weeks of Trump 2.0 than Chris Murphy,” in Hackett’s view. “At a time when too many Democrats are afraid of their shadow, Murphy is showing how to fight back with a compelling populist message that should be a blueprint for the Democrats moving forward.”As outraged and frightened Americans urge Democrats to “do something”, it’s not clear whether voices like Crockett’s and Murphy’s can really make a difference. Whatcanbe done? Lawsuits are cropping up all over, and a federal judge on Wednesday barred the enforcement of Trump’s executive order that would restrict birthright citizenship.And some in Congress are refusing to vote for anything Trump wants until the illegality ends and Musk is sent home. Their notion is simple: gum up the works.“Democrats need to throw every possible wrench into the plans of Trump, Musk and their Republican cultists in Congress,”argued scholar Norm Ornsteinin the Contrarian newsletter. “Doing so will also underscore how serious the threat is to our system, thereby forcing media to cover it.” As the Virginia congressman Don Beyer suggested on Greg Sargent’s Daily Blastpodcastfrom the New Republic: “Put those things that used to be routine and make them not routine until Trump stops breaking the law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Most of all, prepare for the midterms elections next year by honing a strong, populist message.And lead with convincing voices that can motivate the public. Crockett and Murphy surely are two of those. Though far from alone – Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, for example, is irreplaceable – they are notable because they are younger and savvy about how to communicate forcefully in today’s media environment. (Here’s Murphy’s clarity onthe billionaire bonanza: “Why is Donald Trump engaged in this relentless campaign to try to silence journalists, media companies, and his political opposition? It’s because he’s trying to steal from you.”)They know how to put up their dukes.That’s important because one thing is certain: if the public believes there is no determination to fight back, Trump’s destruction will continue unabated.What’s giving me hope nowWhat’s giving me hope now is knowing so many talented young journalists, not only my students at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, but others whose careers I have followed in recent years. Many of them are determined, honest, idealistic, energetic and unwilling to give up on their chosen craft despite all the headwinds and challenges that face them. Democracy demands journalism, so this is extremely important now and in the future.Margaret Sullivanis a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Who he? In his inaugural address, Trump pledged to restore the name Mount McKinley to North America’s highest peak. It was an anti-woke dig at Barack Obama, who had given it the Alaskan native name ofDenali. But why this idolatry?The answer has since become clear. McKinley was the president (1897-1901) whointroduced super-tariffsin his first year in office to protect the US’s post-recessionary manufacturers. Some were as high as 57%, and were seen as an alternative fundraiser to income tax. McKinley was also appealing to Trump for presiding over the founding of a hesitant US empire beyond the North American continent, one from which it has since retreated. Apart from that, the man was unostentatious, intelligent and impeccably polite, faults that Trump is clearly ready to forgive. His only carelessness was to be assassinated six months into his second term.Trump has blatantly sought to mimic McKinley’s policies over the past fortnight. It is therefore worth studying what his hero actually did. Unlike Trump, McKinley made sure that his tariffs wereapproved by Congress. Indeed, the constitution thenrequired it– and technically still does. He was emphatic that they should be based on treaties embracing reciprocity. They should be treaties.In the event, the tariffs were not seen as critical to economic recovery. They were also blamed for a 25% rise in the cost of living. McKinley lost enthusiasm for them and became instead a champion of global free trade. He formed a group of nations to pursue an open-door policy, aimed at strengthening trade with China. He never saw tariffs as tactical weapons of foreign policy, nor used Trump’s description of his trading partners as “atrocious”.As for seeking new colonies, historians regard McKinley as at best an accidental imperialist. A year after his 1897 tariffs were introduced, the US was faced with the effectivecollapseof the Spanish empire, with armed insurrections in Cuba and the Philippines. Like many Americans, McKinley welcomed the arrival of new and free states. But he was adamantly against aiding them in wars against Spain. Hismuch-cited quotewas that “war should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed”. He had seen the civil war, and never wanted to see another one.View image in fullscreenAn undated photo of William McKinley, 25th president; he was inaugurated in 1897 and again in 1901, just prior to being assassinated on 6 September 1901.Photograph: APYet he was under pressure. This was a time when European nations were reaching their imperial limits. It was an opportunity for the US to spread its wings, and many of McKinley’s colleagues were eager for the challenge. Over the course of 1898, war fever against Spain became hysterical. The Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers dailydemanded interventionin the Caribbean and the Pacific. Showered with petitions, Congress demanded, in effect, that McKinley declare war on Spain.He did so under protest. His belligerentassistant navy secretary, the young Teddy Roosevelt, had already mobilised the navy, aiming it at Cuba and the Philippines. Roosevelt then formally resigned his position and led a volunteer regiment to fight in Cuba amid a blaze of publicity. He hadaccused McKinleyof having “no more backbone than a chocolate eclair”. He was nonetheless chosen as McKinley’s vice-president in 1900.These interventions did not result from any threat to US territory or sovereignty. They were naked acts of aggression. They were spectacularly egged on by Rudyard Kipling’s poem,The White Man’s Burden, directed at the Philippines and published in the New York Sun. It challenged America to take over from the British empire, to fight “the savage wars of peace” against “sloth and heathen folly”.McKinley throughout was on the side of negotiation and peace. The Spanish war ended in a treaty signed in Paris in December 1898, which ceded America varying measures of control overCuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. McKinley agreed with an anti-imperial majority in Congress that, once pacified, the US should deny any “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control”. The government of the islands must be left to their people. The only “imperial” acquisition that McKinley did undertakewas that of Hawaii, to prevent it falling into the hands of Japan.View image in fullscreenA sign at a coffee shop in Anchorage, Alaska, where in 2015 Barack Obama renamed Mount McKinley Mount Denali.Photograph: Jerome Cartillier/AFP/Getty ImagesOn McKinley’s assassination in 1901, it was Roosevelt who assumed control of these territories, did not leave and retained them into the 20th century. It was also Roosevelt who backed rebels in seizing Panama from Colombia and giving the US control of the canal’s building and fortification. This was highly controversial. Roosevelt was challenged in Congress and by the New York Times for “an act of sordid conquest”. If Trump is seeking to emulate an earlier president, it is surely Roosevelt – described as the “bucking bronco” of American imperialism – he should be worshipping.Almost every president comes to office asserting if not isolationism, then a refusal to commit money or resources to setting the world to rights. Yet all are seduced by the power of office and the language of the founding fathers. They come to see the US’s “manifest destiny” as being to champion freedom and democracy wherever it is threatened. From Woodrow Wilson to Franklin Roosevelt, from JFK to Johnson and the Bushes father and son, all came to see themselves as global crusaders for that cause.In 2016, Trump refreshingly described the interventionism of his predecessors as a “total disaster”. He stuck to his guns and almost entirely avoided troop deployments during his first term of office. The world at least knew where it stood.His emphasis on putting America’s interests first was repeated in 2024. But this time the prospect is uncertain. In his inaugural speech, he described his task as one that “expands our territory … and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons”. He even used the fell phrase,manifest destiny, as being one he would “pursue … into the stars … to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars”. Not content with Mars, he has set his sights on Panama, Greenland and Gaza.These territories might not match the ambitions of a Kipling or a Roosevelt, but Trump’s current intentions are hardly pacific. If he is to deify McKinley, he might first seek to find out a bit more about him.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It damages America: it will harm us allFri 7 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 08.24 ESTShareAn earthquake of magnitude 7.0 or above could not have caused more carnage. Recent floods in Asia and droughts in Africa have been catastrophic, yet they have inflicted less damage and affected fewer people than the sudden withdrawal ofbillions of dollars of US aidfrom the world’s most volatile hotspots and its most vulnerable people. Coming alongsidePresident Trump’s planfor a US takeover of Gaza, the US administration’s resolve to shut down its international aid agency sends a clear message that the era when American leaders valued their soft power is coming to an end.But while the Gaza plan is as yet only on the drawing board, USAid cuts – which will see funding slashed and just 290 of the more than 10,000 employees worldwide retained,according to the New York Times- have already begun to bite this week. We have seen the halting oflandmine-clearing work in Asia, support for war veterans and independent media in Ukraine, and assistance for Rohingya refugees on the border of Bangladesh. This week, drug deliveries to fight the current mpox and Ebola outbreaks in Africa have been stopped, life-saving food lies rotting at African ports, and even initiatives targeting trafficking ofdrugs like fentanylhave been cut back. One of the world’s most respected charities, Brac, says that the 90-day blanket ban on helping vulnerable people is depriving 3.5 million people of vital services.One critical programme has been granted a limited waiver. Pepfar, created by Republican president George W Bush, offers antiretroviral prescriptions to 20 million people around the world to combat HIV and Aids. Its activitiesescaped the banonly after warnings that a 90-day stoppage could lead to 136,000 babies acquiring HIV. But it has still been blocked from organising cervical cancer screening, treating malaria, tuberculosis and polio, assisting maternal and child health, and efforts to curtail outbreaks of Ebola, Marburg and mpox.Not only does the stop-work edict mean that, in a matter of days, the US has destroyed the work of decades building up goodwill around the world, but Trump’s claim that America has been over-generous is exposed as yet another exaggeration. Norway tops the list as biggest donor of official development assistance (ODA) as a percentage of gross national income (GNI) at 1.09%; Britain is at just over 0.5%, albeit down from the UN target of 0.7%; but the US is near the bottom of the advanced economies at 0.24% – alongside Slovenia and the Czech Republic. It is simply the size of the US economy – 26% of world output – that means that the 0.24% adds up to more aid than any other country. The US provided $66bn in 2023, makingUSAida leader in global humanitarian aid, education and health, not least in addressing HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis.On Sunday night, Trump told reporters that USAid had been “run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we’re getting them out”. “I don’t want my dollars going towards this crap,” his press spokesperson added, with one of the president’s chief advisers Elon Musk calling the agency a “viper’s nest of radical-left marxistswho hate America”. “You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s beyond repair,”he said. “We’re shutting it down.”View image in fullscreenA worker distributes yellow lentils to people at an aid operation run by USAid, Catholic Relief Services and the Relief Society of Tigray, 16 June 2021, in Mekele, Ethiopia.Photograph: Jemal Countess/Getty ImagesIndeed, in a post on X last weekend, Musk shared a screenshot quoting the false claim that “less than 10 percent of our foreign assistance dollars flowing through USAID is actually reaching those communities”. The implication is that the remaining 90% was diverted, stolen, or just wasted. In fact, the 10% figure is the proportion of the budget going directly to NGOs and organisations in the developing world. The remaining 90% is not wasted – instead, it comprises all the goods and services that USAid, American companies and NGOs, and multilateral organisations deliver in kind, from HIV drugs to emergency food aid, malaria bed nets, and treatment for malnutrition. It is simply untrue that 90% of aid falls into the wrong hands and never reaches the most vulnerable.In fact, the initial blanket executive order proved to be such a blunt instrument – the only initial exemptions were for emergency food aid and for military funding for Israel and Egypt – that it had to be modified to include exceptions for what the government called “life-saving humanitarian assistance”, although it stopped short of defining them. “We are rooting out waste. We are blocking woke programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs remained on autopilot,” said a statement released by the state department. The new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, now wants his department to control the whole budget and close down USAid entirely. “Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?” Rubio asked in a statement that suggested that the America which generally worked multilaterally in a unipolar era is now determined to act unilaterally in a multipolar one.This new stance is not just “America first” but “America first and only” – and a gift to Hamas, IS, the Houthi rebels, and all who wish to show that coexistence with the US is impossible. The shutdown is also good news for China, whose own global development initiative will be strengthened as it positions itself to replace America. Desperate people will turn to extremists who will say that the US can never again be trusted. And by causing misery and by alienating actual and possible allies, far from making America great again, the cancellation of aid will only make America weaker.The tragedy for the planet is that US aid cuts come on top of diminishing aid budgets among the world’s richest economies, from Germany to the UK. International aid agencies are now so underfunded that in 2024, for the second consecutive year, the UN covered less than half of its humanitarian funding goal of nearly $50bn – at a time when increasing conflicts and natural disasters necessitate more relief donor grants than ever. Yes, we can discuss how greater reciprocity can create a fairer system of burden sharing – but further cuts in aid threaten more avoidable deaths, and a poorer world will ultimately make the US poorer too.US generosity is often seen as mere charity, but it is in the country’s self-interest to be generous because the creation of a more stable world benefits us all. We all gain if USAid can mitigate the spread of infectious diseases, prevent malnutrition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan, halt the upsurge of IS in Syria and support a fair, humanitarian reconstruction ofGazaand Ukraine. Only the narrowest and most blinkered view of what constitutes “America first” can justify the disaster America has unloaded on the world.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsUSAidOpinionUS politicsAidAids and HIVMalariaGordon BrownEbolacommentShareReuse this content"

But since the return ofDonald Trumpto the White House, the assumptions on which Australian economic policy have always been based are obsolete.It’s not just the “rules-based international order”, symbolised by the already moribund World Trade Organization, that is gone. Trump is ruling by decree (more politely referred to as “executive order”) and encountering little resistance. Corporations have rushed to buy his favour (or placate his wrath). The US Treasury appears to have beenturned over to Elon Musk. No one can predict what will happen here, but a major financial crisis can’t be ruled out.The most immediate threat to Australiaarises from Trump’s use of tariffsas a bludgeon to be used in pursuit of vague political demands, or simply as a display of dominance. Trump’ssurprising backdownin response to mostly symbolic concessions from Canada and Mexico might be seen as a recognition of the risks of overreach. More likely, however, it reflects a belief that this is a weapon that can be used over and over again, and a desire to fight one enemy at a time (Trump does not believe in friends).How Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs could end up hurting AustraliaRead moreFor the moment, the tariff fight is with China, and both sides are showing some restraint. As long as this restraint persists, the collateral damage to theAustralian economywill be modest. But Trump is prone to acting like a capricious dictator. He could easily take offence at some real or imagined slight and return to the 60% tariffs he promised on the campaign trail.Tariff policy is one of many fronts. Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement, the WHO and international aid programs. Of more immediate consequence for Australia, the US has withdrawn from the OECD agreement on corporate tax minimisation and from attempts to tax the digital economy. Musk and the other tech cronies have already threatened to punish Australia for taxing social media platforms, and for attempts to restrict toxic and violent content.In the long run, this means Australia needs to treat both the US and China as unreliable trading partners who will bully us whenever they see a benefit from doing so. We need to seek a balance between the two and, more importantly, become more self-reliant. In particular, we need to develop our own AI and social media infrastructure, for example by making our own version of DeepSeek and breaking with X and Meta as well as TikTok.In the short run, what’s needed is a recognition that the downside risks to the Australian economy have increased greatly. The government should be preparing plans for fiscal stimulus rather than worrying about public debt. More importantly, the Reserve Bank needs to start cutting rates immediately to guard against recession, even at the price of an incomplete victory over inflation.Above all, we need to ditch the illusion that all this is theatre and that things will go on as before. The US, as we knew it, is gone and won’t be back any time soon. The implications for the global economy, and therefore for Australia, are hard to discern, but they are sure to be profound.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionAustralian economyUS politicsElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

Email us atchangebydegrees@theguardian.comSupported byAbout this contentJames NormanFri 7 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 20.30 ESTShareAustralia is the driest inhabited country on Earth, with the least amount of water in its rivers, the lowest runoff and the smallest area of permanent wetlands globally. So it makes sense to be reusing our water through greywater infrastructure in our homes.But with so many different options available, how do you know which system is best for you? If you’re ready to take the plunge, prepare yourself with this handy guide. Your garden will be thanking you in no time.What is greywater?Greywater, in simple terms, is water that has been used elsewhere in the household, not including water from the toilet (referred to as blackwater). Most people don’t use kitchen greywater because it is generally too contaminated with sodium, food scraps and grease to be usable in the garden.Avoid AI and catch a bus: Guardian readers share their top climate goals for 2025Read moreThe simplest way to collect greywater is to do it manually, placing buckets under the shower to catch water that can be used on the garden. But that is labour intensive and many people who rely on greywater will opt to install infrastructure to their pipes (called direct diversion) to redirect the water for their needs.When using greywater, it’s important to think carefully about the products you use in the shower and laundry. There are products that are specifically labelled as suitable for greywater use – seek them out and don’t use chemical-based cleaning or washing products such as salt, phosphates or enzymes, and avoid diverting things like hair dyes or bleach into your garden.Diversion optionsInstalling direct diversion pipes may be a job for a plumber, depending on your home and confidence, especially in modern homes where the pipes are built into the walls or floor. The diversion pipe will also need to be buried in a shallow trench ensuring the greywater is evenly dispersed through the garden rather than pooling on the surface at the water outlet.If you wish to disperse the greywater across a larger area or in a more targeted way, you may need a greywater sump, filter and water pump. These can store water, filter out any solids from the greywater and direct it around your property. Many of these units include an overflow that will automatically direct excess or dirty water to the sewer.There’s a lot of variety (and price) for this equipment, depending on the size of your property and whether you wish to direct water to a single garden bed or install a larger, “whole-of-house” system. Either way, it’s essential to follow local council guidelines, which vary from region to region.Using greywater in urban environmentsFor Alan Leenaerts, who lives in Greensborough in Melbourne’s north-eastern suburbs, it made sense to set up a greywater system from his bathroom for his lawn. His home has been entirely off the water grid since 2001, so he uses greywater to make his home’s rainwater tanks last longer.No air con? Try these DIY tricks to keep your house cool and your energy use lowRead moreAlong with a 30,000-litre rainwater storage capacity in 10 tanks, he has greywater collection points at the washing machine and shower. Leenaerts says he installed his Bunnings greywater pipes by himself for $70 and has only needed to replace them once in 23 years. Because they empty directly on to his lawns, he didn’t need a council permit.“The main benefit of going off-grid in the suburbs is that I don’t steal water from the nearby Thompson or Yarra rivers … It’s the easiest way to reduce household impact on the planet and reduce climate change.”Is greywater going to work in your garden?Almost all gardens will be suited to greywater, including those growing fruit trees, shrubs and native Australian trees. The exception to this is vegetable gardens – because of the potential for the pathogens in greywater to be in direct contact with edible parts of the vegetables.Using greywater doesn’t preclude the need to use compost and mulch in your garden beds – in fact, it’s a good idea to use liquid trace elements to lower the pH levels in your soil. Greywater can contain metals and salts that accumulate in soil, which can lead to soil salinity and sodicity.Sybil Sharvelle, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Colorado State University, says greywater should only be applied in tandem with climate-appropriate landscaping, meaning you shouldn’t expect to grow a water-intensive garden from greywater in dry conditions.With Australia’s summers getting hotter and water becoming scarcer, there’s no doubt greywater is a vital climate resource – but it’s worth putting in the effort to do it right to reap the long-term water-saving benefits.Explore more on these topicsWaterChange by degreesClimate crisisGardensGardening adviceRecyclingEthical and green livingWasteShareReuse this content"

Trump is fuelling themJonathan FreedlandRarely has a US president proposed an idea more repugnant than this Gaza plan, with its appeal to old enmitiesFri 7 Feb 2025 11.49 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 11.53 ESTShareThe shock and awe continues and it only gets more shocking and more awful. These past few days, Americans have watched an unelected tech billionaire destroy large chunks of the federal government – Elon Musk bragged that he was feeding the life-saving USAid international development agency “into the wood chipper” – and yet that was not even the most outrageous event of the week.That honour went instead to Donald Trump and his proposal to “just clean out” the Gaza Strip, by removing its people, bulldozing it and then redeveloping it as “the Riviera of the Middle East”under permanent US ownership. It was so staggering that it succeeded in dominating attention, at home and abroad, for several days rather than, as has become the norm in the less than three weeks since Trump returned to the White House, a meagre few hours before some new shocker took its place.Initial reaction inside the US confirms how the US political classes, and what passes for the opposition, have been left numbed and punch drunk by the speed of events since 20 January and how far Trump has widened what was once quaintly referred to as the Overton window. He’s not just opened that window, but smashed the glass, knocked out the frame and taken out the wall that used to hold it. Now everything is thinkable and, therefore, permissible.So domestic criticism of Trump’s Gaza plan focused largely on his suggestion that US troops be deployed on the ground in Gaza to enforce US ownership. Bad idea, said theDemocrats and Republican senator Lindsey Graham: that would put Americans in harm’s way, recalling the 241 US marines who were sent to Beirut by Ronald Reagan, only to be killed in 1983 by a Hezbollah bomb.Rahm Emanuel, who served as Barack Obama’s White House chief of staff,told me this weekthat to have the US seize Gaza would be to repeat both the Beirut calamity and the “hubris” of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, “the worst foreign policy mistake ever in United States history”. Indeed, it would be “Iraq and Lebanon on steroids”. Trump was meant to pull Americans out of Middle East wars, not plunge them into the oldest and bitterest of them all.Others have faulted Trump for his timing. Just as negotiations were meant to begin on the second phase of the fragile ceasefire deal between Hamas andIsrael, the US president has not so much destabilised the process as upended it. Israeli families waiting for loved ones held captive in Gaza for nearly 500 days now fear that Hamas has lost all incentive to continue releasing hostages or observing the ceasefire. Why would they stick with a deal brokered by a US whose ultimate plan is to empty Gaza of its population and turn it into a US-owned beach resort?Plenty offer the now familiar advice that it’s unwise to take Trump too literally. This, they hope, is nothing more than a classic Trump negotiation tactic. You threaten the other party with a fate so awful they happily accede to the more modest request that was your true objective. So you threaten Canada with annexation as the 51st state, or 25% tariffs, and then get the trade or border concessions you actually want.In this case, runs the logic, Trump announces a wholesale US takeover of Gaza and thereby pushes Saudi Arabia to do a deal with Israel on terms it would previously have rejected – stripped of a Palestinian state, say – just to avert that nightmare prospect, giving Trump the prize of a diplomatic breakthrough. Trump has form in this area. Recall how he put pressure on the UAE, Bahrain and others to agree the so-called Abraham accords with Israel in 2020 by threatening that the alternative would be US approval for Israeli annexation of the West Bank (a threat that, incidentally, Trump seems set to revive, hinting this week that he will announcehis view of the West Bank’s futurein the next month).All these analyses and critiques have their merits, but they miss the big, ugly point. In rushing to assess the impact, they skip over the great wrong. This is not just another foreign policy proposal. This is a US president calling for his country to steal the land of another people 6,000 miles away by means of ethnic cleansing, and to do it for the sake of a lucrative real estate opportunity.Such a move would leave international law in tatters, with only the law of the jungle in its place. That prospect delights Trump, which is why heannounced sanctions on the international criminal courton Thursday. He relishes a world in which might is right, because the US has might.But the Trump plan is not merely illegal. Trump has forever legitimised the messianic fever dreams of the Israeli ultranationalist far right, the likes of the thuggish Itamar Ben-Gvir and the fanatic Bezalel Smotrich, who oppose the ceasefire with Hamas because they want to rebuild Jewish settlements inGazato fulfil some warped notion of holy destiny. There is, moreover, an extra repugnance in seeing Trump and his acolytes eyeing up a piece of land that belongs to Palestinians, and that should be an integral part of a future independent state of Palestine, chiefly because it has investment potential.Listen to David Friedman, Trump’s ambassador to Israel during his first term, who was asked who would live in Gaza after the envisaged 15-year rebuild is complete. It would be a “market-driven process,” he toldthe New York Times. “I know I’m sounding like a real estate guy,” he added, but just imagine the possibilities presented by “25 miles of sunset-facing beachfront”.Trump said he had to empty Gaza of its people because the Strip had become uninhabitable. No one could possibly live there until it had been levelled and rebuilt. It was“hell,” “a demolition site”, every building flattened or at risk of collapse. Next to him sat a smirking Benjamin Netanyahu, the same Netanyahu who for 15 months insisted his bombardment of Gaza was targeted and discriminate.Looking down on them both was the portrait, restored by Trump to the Oval Office, of one of his favourite predecessors,Andrew Jackson, the man who signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, an act of ethnic cleansing that expelled tens of thousands of native Americans from their ancestral homelands and left thousands dead.Trump says Palestinians in Gaza will be delighted by the prospect of being “relocated” to another country and perhaps some, driven to despair by Israeli airstrikes and nearly two decades of Hamas oppression, will grab the chance to get out. But many won’t. They have an attachment to the land that will not be bought off by the promise of a condo far away.And you know who should understand that better than most? Jews. They too were offered various alternatives back in the day, fromUganda to Madagascar to Alaska to a corner of Russia, but none ever gained serious traction, because there was only one place Jews ever regarded as their ancestral homeland. It is the same, small piece of land the Palestinians see exactly the same way. That is the tragedy of both peoples.Each may fantasise about the land empty of the other, so they can have all of it to themselves, from the river to the sea. But those are dangerous fantasies, and a US president has no business fuelling them. Instead, both peoples are fated to share that land, one way or the other. Even the most powerful man in the world cannot wish them away.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Anderson told the court the policing of standards, including impartiality, is not “arbitrary”, but ultimately comes down to “judgment”.He hoped to explain how ABC stars such as Laura Tingle, John Lyons, Paul Barry – even new chair Kim Williams – have avoided sanction, despite making public comments on contentious issues in ways that Anderson said might be perceived as failing the corporation’s impartiality rules.An example given was Tingle telling a writers’ festival “Australia is a racist country; it always has been”. Anderson said he believed that was factually accurate, even if contentious.Another example was global affairs editor Lyons’ assessment of this very case: that the ABC had bowed to “a group of lawyers lobbying for a foreign power”.View image in fullscreenAnderson hoped to explain how other high-profile ABC staff who have commented on contentious issues have been treated differently to Antoinette Lattouf.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPThe ABC denies that framing, but Anderson acknowledged what he called a “campaign” of complaints about Lattouf from the first day of her five scheduled on-air shifts.It came from a pro-Israel lobby group, whose members have had their names suppressed by the federal court for 10 years to protect them from vilification and harassment.“The wording was exactly the same in every email,” recalled Anderson. “It just looked like copy and paste of material that was coming through.”By that Monday evening, Anderson told the court, he made his own investigation of Lattouf’s social media history.He said he told his direct subordinate, Chris Oliver-Taylor, that the feed was “full of antisemitic hatred”.Cross-examined on that point, Anderson admitted most of the antisemitic material was other people replying to Lattouf’s posts.Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletterHe said Lattouf’s criticisms challenged the existence of Israel, “which I do believe to be antisemitic”. Presssed again, he said the post had referred to the “unlawful occupation of Palestine”.Lattouf has long been outspoken in her support of Palestinian human rights. The court heard that Anderson was unhappy she had been hired.“I think her appointment to being host of mornings was a mistake,” he said in testimony.He worried that she might express what he described as “partisan” views – or even take calls on Sydney talkback radio about a subject he described as “contentious”.In emails tabled to the court, then ABC chair Ita Buttrose told Anderson she was “over” receiving complaints about Lattouf, and wondered why she “couldn’t come down with flu or Covid or a stomach upset” and be taken off air.However, Anderson told the court he was convinced his subordinate managers had mitigated the risk. The court heard Lattouf’s immediate manager, Elizabeth Green, had advised – or directed – Lattouf (the case appears largely to turn on which verb applies) not to post about Gaza while on air.Lattouf then posted a Human Rights Watch report that claimed that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war. The ABC website had carried the same report.Lattouf was then taken off air by Oliver-Taylor. She was paid but told not to return for her two remaining shifts.About that decision, Anderson said, “Frankly, [it] was a surprise to me. I didn’t expect that at all.”Oliver-Taylor, who was still giving evidence at the time of writing, says he was between a “rock and a hard place” when it came to Lattouf’s position as a casual presenter on ABC Radio Sydney, adding he was receiving “pressure from above” about Lattouf’s appointment.Anderson conceded to the court that, trekking through the deep thickets of the ABC’s rules and codes, steps had been missed.For one thing, personal social media use was not covered by the ABC’s editorial policies but by separate guidelines managed at a lower level. And if the case was being made that Lattouf had disobeyed a lawful management direction, that would require a referral to the ABC’s People and Culture section. A misconduct investigation would have to be launched. Lattouf would be entitled to a right of reply.None of those things happened.The federal court case – at who knows what cost – is not over. It is running way over schedule, and we are yet to hear from Buttrose.Even if Lattouf wins, it is not clear if she can find her way back to presenting jobs at the ABC or anywhere else. Perhaps, her speaking gigs will no longer be “mysteriously” cancelled. A larger question is the potential impact on hiring policies at the ABC, particularly with its commitment to staff diversity.Hugh Riminton is national affairs editor at Channel 10Disclosure: Hugh Riminton worked with Antoinette Lattouf at Channel 10 and was an early advisory board member for her not-for-profit Media Diversity Australia.

The kid not allowed snacks between meals goes mad at houses with an open-fridge policy. Inflexible bedtimes create inflexible children. News blackouts designed to preserve the innocence of a child can make the world seem more not less frightening, and so on.The obvious exception to all this is tech, which takes away all of our abilities to self-regulate. Until recently, I imagined there was no amount of slack-jawed screen time that would exhaust my children’s appetite for it. This has turned out to be wrong: one child, off sick a few weeks ago, actually looked up bleary-eyed from her iPad after two days of constant usage and expressed a desire to go back to school. More generally, however, they will want more time on it than I think healthy, even as I use the time bought by their screen addiction to feed my own.Until recently, it has seemed as if the messaging around kids and screen use has been broad stroke and premised on assumptions that all forms of engagement are equal.Social mediacan be harmful to teens because of online bullying, toxicity and skewing their values towards instabullshit but, in general, children need to be on phones and iPads less and that, we are led to believe, is the bottom line. This may well be true; I’m sure it would be better if they were all playing volleyball. But the Eiger-scale task of getting them off screens altogether can seem so overwhelming that it discourages any action at all.This week, there is some consolation to be had, therefore, in research undertaken by Birmingham University and published in the Lancet’s Regional Health Europe journal, that suggests the ultimate – and ultimately impossible, or so it feels – goal of banning children from screenscan support some shades of nuance. While the research confirmed what we already know, that increased screen time in young people affects mental health, behaviour and sleep patterns, the university research team also discovered that banning phones from schools doesn’t actually achieve anything. The study concluded: “There is no evidence to support that restrictive school phone policies, in their current forms, have a beneficial effect on adolescents’ mental health and wellbeing or related outcomes.”These findings seem like a foregone conclusion when you stop and give them some thought; apart from break and lunchtime, school days simply don’t afford an opportunity for what happens after school and at the weekend, which is the spectacle of kids engaged in unbroken, multihour screen usage that results in the average child spending betweenfour and six hours on screens a day.Even within that horror statistic there are differentials, however. If I’m bingeing a TV show, I can easily pull down a four-hour shift of back-to-back episodes. There may be better ways to spend time – I’m sure there are – but apart from a vague risk of deep vein thrombosis, I don’t think of the activity itself as particularly damaging.Childrenare more malleable, need to move around more than adults, and should ideally have a life before they turn into couch potatoes. But it is worth making a distinction between different types of screen engagement so that rule-making around it can become more realistic.To this end, it’s worth isolating the single most damaging aspect of online culture for kids, which is the dopamine-spiking, attention-nuking, wholly ruinous and entirely nutrition-free feeds on YouTube Shorts, TikTok and Instagram Reels, that have apparently led to gen Z college kids beingunable to read a whole novel. Going screen-zero is great if you have the resources to occupy your kids in other ways, but assuming, like most parents, you have neither the time, energy or fine temper to police what happens when you cancel all screen time and tell them to play with each other for four hours after school, there is another way.This seems so obvious but for some reason struck me only recently: they can be on screens, even for hours at a time, but it has to be nutritional content, which is to say either to involve an element of active play – Roblox or Minecraft, where they message and hang out with friends – or actual programming. This revelation has led to a rare enforcement of rules in our house: I won’t ban screens, but I will ban short videos. (I make an exception forBluey webisodes, because they’re well made and I am a snob, plus I find the Heeler family soothing.)It’s early days, but so far the new rule seems to be working, not least because it makes everyone feel as if they’ve won. Now I have one child who just ploughed through three seasons of A Series of Unfortunate Events and another embarking on Young Sheldon, which with any luck will keep her going all year. OK it’s not volleyball or sticking bits of felt to a toilet roll, or, you know, interacting with each other; but considering the alternative, I’ll take it.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSocial mediaChildrenDigital mediaFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Across Europe, young people like me are finding friends by walking our citiesViola Di GradoWe are the post-pandemic flâneurs: stepping out of social media silos to meet people and connect with the world around usFri 7 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 09.55 ESTShareWhen I moved back to London from Rome just before the second lockdown in 2020, I found a city that was hardly welcoming, with shops closed and an atmosphere of silent apprehension. Young, single people like me were only socialising online with existing friends, and opportunities to make fresh connections were rare.When I met Irenka from Poland at a literary festival, she looked as thirsty for new friends as I was. As we started complaining about the difficulties of mingling she introduced me to an app that allows people to find new pals on organised walks. I quickly downloaded it.On my first walk – a six-mile stroll along the banks of the River Lea in east London – I met Haris from Greece. While we were exploring, she explained to me that, since her grandmother had died (they had been living together), she had been staying on the sofa of a friend whom she also recently met on a walk. This friend went to that walk after being encouraged by one of her friends, who also happened to be a Meetup-acquaintance of Irenka.As someone who is much better at slow-cooked friendship that acquires its flavour over time, I was surprised at how trusting Irenka was of strangers and how quick she was to rearrange her life around them. Yet I too was becoming a friend of Irenka’s with startling alacrity, and the same happened on the next walk. I made more new friends. This kind of thing never happened to me in bars or at parties; those traditional places for socialising. So I started wondering why these walks were so different, and I realised it was to do with the balance between an interpersonal exchange and the outside world.In bars or clubs you are required to interact with people. On walks you also pay attention to the environment around you, and it seems to me that it’s this shift of focus that makes it easier to make friends this way – precisely because there is less pressure to do so.Lockdowns made us more aware of the line between self-sufficiency and our need for others, as well as between nesting and exploring the outside world. The flat or house that had always been our refuge suddenly became a prison, and it wasn’t enough to fill it virtually with video-chats with friends. We knew something was missing, and it wasn’t just people or the outdoors: it was both at the same time.It probably explains why walking meditation and walking psychotherapy are now so popular, not just in London but inother European and US citiestoo. It is as if, after we became painfully aware of the claustrophobic distress of having too much of our own company (who will forget how our worries were amplified by the four walls of our homes?), we needed to discover a new way of combining conversation with equally needed contemplation: we had missed human connection as much as we’d missed connecting to the outdoors.View image in fullscreenForest walking in Vartiosaari, Finland.Photograph: Markus Thomenius/AlamyBut this is nothing new. Europe has a long history ofpsychogeography, a concept that originated in the 1950s among a Paris-based group of radical artists and conceptual theorists called theSituationist International. In practice, this involved exploring urban environments while also focusing on personal connections to places.Originally psychogeography – with its strong dadaist and surrealist influences – had an anarchic emphasis on the casual and the subconscious. The contemporary post-pandemic version of it, however, tries to bring order and rigour to our overwhelming lives. Where traditional psychogeography was rooted in thedérive, literally going “adrift” without a planned route, the preferred tactic for much contemporary walking is to follow a well-organised route.I’m now really good friends with Irenka and Haris. We like to walk and talk, and never hang out in our own flats: instead, we relish exploring the city on foot. While in recent years there has been a lot of emphasis on mindful meditation and other types of individual self-care, I find that shifting the focus from myself to the outside world works better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, the Japanese practice ofshinrin-yoku(or forest bathing) is nowpractised across Europe. There is also an emerging field of science on hownature can improve our health, withmental health practitioners worldwidebeginning to take talking therapies outdoors. But I believe that, alongside nature’s capacity to restore, we can also count on the reviving effect of urban spaces. They too can act as rich symbolic maps, with the power to distract us from self-obsession and the usual everyday neurosis.Which is why, instead of mindfulness, I prefer to perform a “mindemptyness”: that’s what I call my long walks with the new friends I’m making, during which I predominantly think about the streets that I’m walking and the city I live in. We are post-pandemic flâneurs: just like the romantic strollers described by the 19th-century French poet and writer Charles Baudelaire. We sometimes make our walks’ lack of destination their whole purpose, cheerfully drifting while deepening our friendships.The flâneur became unfashionable with therejection of idlenessin busy, modern, working lives. But now is the perfect time for its rebirth. After all,every cityis, in a way, still a “traumascape”: a space transformed by the collective memory of lockdowns. By walking, we give it – and ourselves – a chance of healing and reinvention.Some names have been changedViola di Grado is an Italian authorExplore more on these topicsWalkingOpinionEuropeMental healthMindfulnessHobbiesHealthHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

US president Donald Trump’s recent comments about “taking over” Gaza and relocating around 2.1 million people left me speechless.When I first heard Trump’s proposal, my initial reaction was laughter – not the kind that follows a funny joke, but the type born of disbelief at the sheer absurdity and cruelty of the suggestion. It’s a laughter tinged with a sickening sense of familiarity.Imagine living in a genocide zone for 15 months, facing unimaginable suffering. Then, for a ceasefire to finally happen, only for someone in the US to decide where you should live next. Palestinians inGazaare already homeless and displaced inside their own country.And despite that, thousands of Palestinians walked for miles just to go back to their bombed house in the north of Gaza. Do you expect them to just leave their land?Trump’s grotesque Gaza proposal is appalling on every level | Kenneth RothRead moreI met Palestinians who refused to leave their turtles and birds behind when Israel asked them to evacuate their house and you expect them to leave their land because Trump said so?As someone whose family has experienced displacement, I can assure you: we do not welcome further dispossession. Gaza is not a piece of real estate to be “developed” into a “Riviera of the Middle East”. It is home to over 2 million people, many of whom are already refugees, holding on to the keys of homes they were forced to flee decades ago.When I asked my 78-year-old grandmother, Fatma, who now lives in Australia after being displaced at least five times in her life, about her thoughts, she told me: “Yafa is the home where I was born and raised, from where I was displaced when I was two years old. Then I got to call Gaza home, and I was displaced again in 2023. And now I can go to neither Gaza nor Yafa. So where is home?”Her house in Gaza was bombed, adding another layer of trauma to her experiences of displacement. When I shared Trump’s comments with her, she responded fiercely: “He can give them a state from America. Palestine is not his land to sell. This is not real estate; this is our home.”She added, with a mixture of determination and weariness, “for 76 years I’ve been waiting to go back to Yafa. For a year I’ve been waiting to go back to Gaza. The moment the borders open, I’m planning to go back.”She also said: “We’re not a ball for him to kick us in and out of our land whenever he wants.” As my grandmother now lives in Australia temporarily, she follows the news and watches with dismay as the Australian government’s response to Trump’s comments remains tepid at best.I expect more from the country that is supposed to be home for my grandmother now. Australia should unequivocally condemn any proposal that involves the forced displacement of Palestinians and reaffirm its commitment to international law and the rights of Palestinians to live with dignity in their homeland. This isn’t about Palestinians, it is about human lives and the world we live in.This is your reminder that Gaza is not just a news headline.

His last administrationslapped sanctionson it over its investigations into potential war crimes in Afghanistan, including by the US, and into the actions of Israeli forces. But his new executive order goes even further, attacking the fundamentals of the court and endangering its functioning.The US never joined the ICC, fearing scrutiny of its own actions and those of its allies. Joe Bidendamagedboth the court and US claims of commitment to the “rules-based international order” when he justified the arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin while attacking as “outrageous” the one issued for Benjamin Netanyahu.But for Mr Trump it is not just about expedience. His loathing for the court speaks to something fundamental about this president. Ultimately, the law he believes in is that of the jungle. Naked transactionalism and coercion replace diplomacy and alliances. The biggest beasts are hungry and the rest must flatter or flee.This credo can be seen at work again in thedestruction of USAid. The callous disregard for life is sickening. As Gordon Brownlaid out powerfullyin the Guardian, this decision will kill. It is also shortsighted and stupid. USAid has been a shrewd, low-cost foreign policy tool. It cost less than 1% of the federal budget in the 2023 fiscal year – and much of the moneywent back tothe United States. US foreign aid spending as a percentage of gross national income is far below that of most advanced economies. USAid helped to stabilise countries, contain diseases, and foster goodwill in places which will now look to other patrons.Mr Trump’s “might-is-right” doctrine can be seen most clearly in hisreckless and immoral callto ethnically cleanse Gaza, so that the US could “own” a new “Riviera of the Middle East”. This is the most disturbing element of his unexpected and repeated proposals forAmerican territorial expansion, in place of the anticipated isolationism. He has even declared his willingness touse military forcein other places.No one expects US troops to march into Canada. His Gaza proposal is not realisable. At least some of his suggestions are surely wielded as the crudest available threat to achieve concessions on other issues. Yet a worrying consistency in the theme suggests that observers may need to take himliterally as well as seriously, however ludicrous these ideas sound. He does not need to enact them exactly for them to prove hugely damaging. And whether or not the US expands its borders, there seems every prospect that Mr Trump will approve of Israel and Russia annexing land, emboldening others to use force to remake borders.In the past, some have wondered how effective the ICC can really be: the work of bringing war criminals to justice has been slow, painful and often unsuccessful at the best of times. Mr Trump’s attack is a perverse recognition of the importance of the court, and of international law more generally. It is alarming that influential voices within the British government appear inclined tolament the rigour of international lawas an obstacle to domestic priorities, rather than celebrate its place in the architecture of a civilised world. Recoiling at Mr Trump’s excesses is not enough. The UK and others have rightlyexpressedtheir “unwavering” support for the ICC. They must now defend it, and the values for which it stands, by whatever means they can.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Despite the indisputable offensiveness ofunearthed social media postsby Gascón, some are questioning the wisdom of ostracising her so comprehensively.Speaking to the Guardian, a number of senior film publicists raised concerns over whether those working on the film, both during its making and its marketing, had, in the words of one veteran PR, “chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her body”.“Those tweets were despicable,” they continued. “But everyone was on board for this amazing fairytale: an unknown becoming the first ever [out] trans actor up for an Oscar.” That magical narrative, said another, curdled into “the absolute worst case scenario”.Another veteran of the awards circuit said they had been particularly surprised by the coldness of theresponseof Emilia Pérez’s director, Jacques Audiard, who said of his maligned star: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to.”“I think he’s trying to protect the remaining nominations [Emilia Pérez has 13 in total] by distancing himself from Gascón,” said one insider. “But what’s really horrifying to me is that the most vulnerable person in the film, who previously was lauded and even fetishised, is now bearing the brunt of the ire and receiving no support.”If Netflix boss Ted Sarandos finds out this social media history was known, and not surfaced to him … watch this space.On Thursday, Garcón posted on Instagram to say that, following a tearful Spanish TV appearance over the weekend, she would be stepping away from the media to allow the film to speak for itself.This follows reports that Netflix was no longer including her in its campaign or covering any of her expenses for attending events. She has also been dropped by her Spanish publisher.Journalist Ryan Gilbey says that when he interviewed Gascónin October, the star’s garrulousness was widely acknowledged as central to her saleability, just as her personal journey – transitioning around a decade ago – was key to Audiard’s realisation of his drama about a Mexican cartel leader who transitions.“I think it makes it even more unsightly that the wrongdoer is someone who doesn’t know how to work the Hollywood machine politically, and has just kept digging a deeper hole for herself,” said Gilbey.“So now the denouncing of her has blurred into a vicious glee at this absolute rube who doesn’t know how to apologise properly or shut up – it’s like Jade Goody syndrome, and it’s the very quality that people found refreshing about Gascón when she was being unfiltered and tearful in interviews, or when accepting the best actress award at Cannes for herself and her co-stars.”View image in fullscreen‘I haven’t spoken to her’ … director Jacques Audiard and Karla Sofía Gascón at the Cannes film festival last year.Photograph: Sameer Al-Doumy/AFP/Getty ImagesSuch volatility, coupled with a lack of experience or apparent support, means “her next moves are quite hard to call”, cautioned one publicist. “Over the weekend, she was clearly freaking out, as anyone would.“She seems calmer at the moment, but what’s happened would be disastrous for anyone’s mental health. Representing someone who is quite naive on such a high-profile film should come with a duty of care, which I don’t think has been fulfilled.” The decision to instead cold-shoulder her “feels like a gamble”.Only one of the publicists the Guardian spoke to believed that the resurfacing of Gascón’s posts on X, and the traction they rapidly accrued, were the result of a hit campaign by a rival Oscar contender, as the actor herself suggested.A more common theory, as advanced by Variety executive editor Steven Gaydos, was that it was the work of an independent journalist “appalled by the tone and the content, [who] felt it was an important story. Old-fashioned shoe-leather journalism still wins the day.”Gaydos and everyone the Guardian spoke to expressed amazement that none of the teams working on the film had appeared to sufficiently vet Gascón’s past postings on X. “Social media searching and scrubbing will now be task one for any film or person in an awards race,” says Gaydos.“If Netflix boss Ted Sarandos, who’s spent millions campaigning for awards for the film, finds out this social media history was known, and not surfaced to him by anyone on his team … watch this space.”View image in fullscreenKarla Sofía Gascón (right) and Zoe Saldaña have both received Oscar nominations for Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/Netflix via APOne reason for such oversight may have been that Emilia Pérez’s path to Oscar nominations was not short of obstacles, with gay, trans and Mexican communities all criticising the film. Amid such firefighting, crucial details were apparently overlooked.It’s the Oscars on a knife-edge: who’ll win the award for hating Emilia Pérez the most? | Marina HydeRead moreAnother reason could be that the liberal-leaning Hollywood community assumed the views of a trans woman of Hispanic heritage would largely mirror their own. That they were wrong will have strengthened their kickback.This is what happens, says one PR, when Oscar voters participate in “their annual performative patronage of marginalised communities. The frenzy around awards means there’s very little inquiry or self-reflection until it’s too late.”A scapegoat is needed, who, if they don’t immediately roll over, can easily turn into a sacrificial lamb. “The frantic race we’re seeing to condemn her over and over again,” says Gilbey, “contains that strain of Hollywood self-righteousness, that rush to say: ‘Look! We caught one of our own doing bad! That means we’ve defeated racism and hate and Islamophobia. All good now?’”Ironically, it has meant that the industry is piling on to a member of an increasingly marginalised community. Inan interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundoon Tuesday, Antonio Banderas said Gascón deserved the benefit of the doubt, adding that he felt she had also been the victim of transphobia.‘I was deeply upset’: Karla Sofía Gascón to miss Spanish ‘Oscars’ as storm over racist tweets continuesRead more“I’m from Andalucía,” he said, “and in Andalucía, there’s forgiveness for every sin. If she’s asked for forgiveness, then she’ll get it from me. But, in any case, I think they’ve gone after her. There’s a lot of transphobia.”Gilbey, who is the author of It Used To be Witches, a history of queer cinema out later this year, agrees: “The sort of gloating, protracted attacks that she’s receiving now would be distasteful whomever it was happening to, but we shouldn’t pretend that everyone would get the same treatment in her situation or that marginalised people aren’t held to different standards.“I’d like to think anyone who made the sort of remarks that she has would receive the appropriate level of censure, but it’s no effort to think of straight cis men who have come back to awards and nominations and sellout tours after a year or two on the naughty step.”The Hollywood PR machine will be working overtime for the next three weeks, to try to spin something positive from this unhappy lapse. “It’s a new world,” says one publicist. “Social media means people behind the scenes have far less control than they used to.”The case of Karla Sofía Gascón will change the landscape – but only until the plates shift again. “Things have got really out of hand, and really ugly,” the publicist says.“And now Trump’s back in, ugly is exactly what you don’t want from the movies. TheOscarsare meant to be light and escapist. This is heavy. There are no real winners in a witch-hunt.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryOscarsEmilia PérezAwards and prizesSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

There are mobs on the street and far-right trolls on TV. There’s a billionaire making mischief and a state of uproar in Congress. Robert De Niro stars as ex-president George Mullen, whisked out of retirement to investigate a crippling cyberattack. Mullen is dogged and courageous, but he’s a man of the past, not quite on his mettle. His daughter thinks he’s out of touch. “The world has changed in ways he doesn’t understand,” says his wife.I’m excited to talk to De Niro about Zero Day and its real-world echoes. The show’s politics are what drew him to the project. The actor has made no secret of his disgust and loathing for Trump. But our Zoom interview comes with constraints. Netflix have requested that there be “no personal or political questions” and have dispatched a pair of publicists to serve as chaperones. Even ex-presidents and movie stars have to work within a wider system. Sometimes it gives them freedom. At other times, maybe not.De Niro beams in from his home in New York. He looks the very ideal of an 81-year-old man: trim and handsome, with platinum hair and professorial specs. There is a potted fern by his head and a barking dog at his feet. One good thing about making Zero Day was that it kept him close to his infant daughter Gia, the youngest of his seven children. At his age, he has learned to choose his roles more carefully. “I had another thing offered to me over in eastern Europe recently. It was a terrific script but I couldn’t make it work and one of the sticking points was the location.” New York shoots are the best, he says. “It’s important, it helps, especially with kids and so on.”View image in fullscreenFlight risk … De Niro (right) with Jesse Plemons in Zero Day.Photograph: NetflixEveryone will have their favourite De Niro performance, whether it’s silken Vito Corleone or toxic Jake LaMotta; the harried bounty hunter from Midnight Run or the traumatised Green Beret from The Deer Hunter. Naturally, the actor has his own favourites. Yesterday he was at a school fundraiser and the other parents – all much younger than him – were clamouring to discuss his role in Martin Scorsese’sTaxi Driver, which was nice and strange, because there is no way of predicting which films will last and which won’t.“I mean, we always liked that script,” he says. “We thought it was special. Marty and myself, and Paul Schrader who wrote it. But after that you never know. So there’s [Taxi Driver], obviously, but there are other ones, too.The Godfather II,Raging Bull,King of Comedy. Everything I did withMarty Scorsese. Roland Joffe’s The Mission. David O Russell, Barry Levinson.” He shrugs. “I’ve been lucky to work with these great directors.”Zero Day is no Taxi Driver, but it makes for a fine autumn flourish. Netflix’s thriller was devised by a pair of political journalists – the New York Times correspondent Michael S Schmidt and former NBC producer Noah Oppenheim – and depicts a United States that can be switched on and off like a light. Shadowy malware knocks out the air traffic control system and redirects trains on to the same stretch of track. The country panics, conspiracy theories abound and the crisis plays out over six precision-tooled episodes. It’s a big, glossy production with myriad subplots and an ensemble cast. But De Niro is the linchpin and brings the whole thing back to centre.He’s always thought of himself as a big-screen actor but knows TV has changed and figured this might be a good time to dive in. The average film shoot can feel like a sprint; this felt more akin to a marathon.“It’s like doing three features at once,” he says. “I likened it to being in the Channel between France and England and looking back. I can’t see France any more and I can’t see England. So I’ve got to keep swimming, staying up with the scenes, the endless information, the thrust of the story. Stay ahead of it, stay on it. So it was a whole other kind of experience for me.”His hero, George Mullen, is a one-term president who bowed out in the wake of a family bereavement. He’s imperfect but decent; an old-school public servant. “I had the idea of a president who was trusted, well-liked, and who told the truth as much as he could,” says De Niro. “He’s a person who tries to be straightforward. Who has no agenda other than to do the right thing.”I ask if Mullen is based on anyone in particular and he says that no, he’s really not; maybe Joe Biden very slightly. I say that he reminded me more ofJimmy Carter, a much respected commander-in-chief, and he accepts that there may be some truth in that.View image in fullscreenDesk job … De Niro as George Mullen with Joan Allen as Sheila Mullen in Zero Day.Photograph: Netflix“Well, Carter was a great president. He was a good person, a kind person, empathetic. No one really gave him credit until the end. But that was important to me, that he was a good person. I didn’t know this [at the time] but I watched interviews about him that say he was also a little standoffish, an outsider in certain ways, and that’s interesting to me, too.”One president whom Mullen emphatically doesn’t resemble is Donald Trump. De Niro despises Trump on an almost visceral level. He has been one of the man’s most outspoken public critics. He’s called him a pig and a punk and a con artist and a dog. He’s called him a jerk and a mutt, a real-estate hustler and a two-bit playboy. But today he’s saying nothing. He is courteous but seems wary. The publicists ping me a message suggesting I return my focus to the show.The best artists – the best actors – are hot-wired to their times. De Niro, arguably more than any other living actor, embodied the turbulent last decades of the American century. His golden years were entwined with Vietnam and Watergate, spiking crime rates and a borderline bankrupt New York City. So he’s familiar with political instability, with division and anger and a sense of chaos. But I get the impression that the situation under Trump (the tariffs, cuts and firings; the repurposing of the federal government) is different. More than that, I suspect he thinks it’s without precedent.“Well, I’d ask you that,” he shoots back. “Do you think it is?”“I think it is,” I tell him. “But I don’t have your reach of history.”“Yeah, you’re a lot younger than me.” He pauses. “But it is unprecedented. It is. It just is. As we all know.”Is he hopeful or despairing? “I’m not despairing, because I always look at the bright side and hope that things will right themselves and that people will appreciate goodness and empathy and will try to do the right thing. So I can’t help but think that.” Another pause. “Some people look at [things] differently. They have different values. That’s disturbing to me. I don’t understand it. But I just have to look at things in an optimistic way.”View image in fullscreenSecret service entrance … De Niro (centre) in Zero Day.Photograph: Jojo Whilden/NetflixDe Niro’s Zoom window is minimised and one of the publicists drops in. “Sorry to interrupt,” she says. “But can you just bring it back to show questions?”Michael S Schmidt – Zero Day’s co-creator – is still on staff at the New York Times. Last monthhe filed a storyabout the president’s threatened reprisals against his perceived enemies. Schmidt and his co-writer Glenn Thrush contacted more than two dozen of Trump’s most vehement public critics. Almost all, they said, now declined to speak up in case it made them a target.I mention this article to De Niro and make one last attempt. “I’m wondering,” I say, “if you’re now feeling you need to be more careful about what you say.”He has no time to answer. The publicist pitches in. “No, no, no. Sorry, Xan, I’m really sorry but we agreed this. Can we just go back to the show because we don’t have much time.” And that is the end of our Trump conversation – inasmuch as it ever became one at all.I’ve had car-crash interviews in the past and I’m unsure this quite qualifies as one. It’s too polite and well-managed; the tone is faintly apologetic. It’s not even clear who is in the driving seat here. Is it the actor’s decision not to discuss Trump with the press or does his contract have him muzzled? Either way it begs an obvious question. If De Niro – a world-famous two-time Oscar-winning millionaire – no longer feels he is able to speak out, one wonders who in the US does.In Zero Day, De Niro effectively plays the role of backstop, the US’s last line of defence. President Mullen’s Secret Service codename is Legend. Colleagues describe him as a knight in shining armour. He is old and exhausted, but his values are sound and he’s still up for a fight. We need heroes like that, says De Niro, both on TV and in films. “And in the real world, yeah, of course.”Zero Day is on Netflix from 20 February.The headline of this article was amended on 7 February 2025. De Niro’s character in Zero Day is a former US president, not a current one as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRobert De NiroMartin ScorsesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They talk tantrums, mortality – and being tactful with TrumpByLaura SnapesFri 7 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 06.25 ESTShareBy the time Elton John retired from touring in 2023, everyone knew his story. It followed a memoir and a biopic, which cemented the Elton lore: how in 1967 jobbing musician Reg Dwight was given an envelope of Bernie Taupin’s lyrics, forging the greatest songwriting partnership since Lennon and McCartney, a baroque new identity, a rampant hit rate of era-defining albums and the commensurate cocaine addiction. Then came sobriety, an emphatic commitment to funding HIV and Aids treatment, finding love with David Furnish; The Lion King, Candle in the Wind, one of the UK’s first gay marriages, two sons. Last year, the documentaryNever Too Latetold his story again. Just last month, his greatest hits collection, Diamonds, finally hit UK No 1 after 374 weeks. No one could ask for a more enduring brand, a more deserved curtain call. John has different ideas.“I’m 77. If I don’t push myself, Laura, what’s the point in carrying on?” he says, via video call in early January. “Just be ‘Elton John’ for the rest of my life? Which would have filled me with absolute fucking horror.”John is sitting next to Grammy-winning Americana artist Brandi Carlile, 43, at his Los Angeles breakfast table. They can see the wildfires outside. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” says John. “It’s apocalyptic.” He wears a navy Gucci tracksuit and pointy blue glasses, more out of habit than for his sight – as right now John can hardly see at all. Last summer he contracted a severe eye infection, delaying the release of his and Carlile’s surprise album – only his second full-length collaboration, after 2010’sThe Union with his hero Leon Russell.John, an impatient workaholic, might disagree about the wait, but Who Believes in Angels? was worth the delay. A hinge-rattling Americana-tinged rock’n’roll album, it’s enough to make you pity John’s piano, presumably reduced to splinters from the ecstatic walloping it gets here. It’s easily the best album he has made this century, a more authentic embrace of the present than recent remixes of his classic hits with Dua Lipa and Britney Spears. “I could do an ‘Elton John’ record easily,” he says. “That’s what I didn’t want to do any more. I wanted a challenge.”View image in fullscreenHeadline act … fans watch John live at Glastonbury in 2023.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAfter headlining Glastonbury in 2023, says John, “I wanted to put all my old stuff to bed.” He propositioned Carlile, a lifelong fan of his turned confidante. “I was like, Elton, really, I don’t sell records,” she says. “And he’s like, I don’t care – you’re about to now, baby.”John had a lot of ideas. Maybe they could beRobert Plant and Alison Krauss. Or a modern Eurythmics. Or Patsy Cline and Buddy Holly. “Then one day,” Carlile, a born storyteller, says with a grin, “he says: let’s not be any of that. Let’s just be ourselves – and we don’t know what that is. Don’t write, don’t do anything in advance. And that’s when it got really dangerous.”Between Glastonbury and entering the studio with Carlile in Los Angeles, John had hit his head, was recovering from a second hip replacement and needed a new knee. But he didn’t want to cancel and let anyone down. “I was very grumpy, I was tired, I didn’t feel well and I was extremely nervous,” says John. “And that nervousness caused quite a few sparks to fly.”It’s one for the annals of understatement. Carlile appears for a solo interview a few hours earlier, an uncanny experience in which disembodied hands do her makeup as she talks. “He smashed his iPad,” she says, wide-eyed. “He smashed headphones. There were really amazing, classic Elton John outbursts. My lyrics got torn up and thrown on the ground – he goes: ‘Fuck off, Brandi.’ He would yell: ‘Predictable! Cliche!’”“It wasn’t me being anxious about other people,” says John, “it was me being anxious about me. Once we got through the first three songs, we knew we had something. And I was much more relaxed … but I was a bit of a nightmare.”There was so much riding on my perception of Elton versus who Elton really isBrandi CarlileCo-writing the lyrics alongside Taupin, with John writing the music, Carlile was equally anxious. “It was unspeakable pressure, because it could be really, fundamentally invalidating of who I am musically,” she says. “When I got signed in my early 20s, I’d read artists trashing one another in the press, and I remember thinking: what if I ever got famous and Elton John didn’t like my music? It was odd, as a woman past 40, to have that feeling again as it was about to happen in real life.”Taupin was in the studio; Andrew Watt, who led the Rolling Stones’ comebackHackney Diamonds, was producing, a copy of John’s live album 17-11-70 positioned above the desk as a reminder of the energy he wanted. John wanted to do a “proper duet record”, he says. “Not one line here, one line there, I wanted to harmonise.” But not only was singing to Carlile’s phrasing tough, he reacted to her and Taupin’s lyrics as he first encountered them at the piano, prompting on-the-hoof rewrites.View image in fullscreen‘Elton doesn’t like listening to stories of my childhood love for him’ … John and Carlile at this year’s Golden Globes.Photograph: Rich Polk/GG2025/Penske Media/Getty Images“He would start singing and cutting shit or saying words the wrong way, and I would get in and fix the issue,” says Carlile, pulling anohGodface. “That’s what Bernie’s job has always been. You can call it momentum or extreme impatience – they’re the same. You don’t stop Elton, you frantically replace the lyric in front of him and then he’s singing that. It was really volatile, but really cool.”When John blew up, Carlile never told him that he had crossed a line, “but there were definitely points that I felt that”, she says. To defuse things,Taupin– “poetic and cryptic, but also really paternal and helpful” – would take her for whisky sours and steak at his favourite diner. John’s outbursts, however, served a purpose, making a hero human-sized. “Elton doesn’t want to be put on a pedestal,” she says. “He doesn’t like listening to stories of my childhood love for him. There was so much riding on my perception of Elton versus who Elton really is.”Carlile first learned about John when writing a school report aboutRyan White, a teenager who died from Aids in 1990 after contracting HIV from a contaminated blood treatment. John supported his family, which inspired the newly sober musician to dedicate himself to HIV and Aids healthcare, feeling that he hadn’t helped enough while strung out at the height of the crisis.Growing up in Washington state in the 90s, Carlile “lived in a mobile home with conservative parents”, she says. “I’d never met a gay person in my life. Didn’t even really know what a liberal thinker was. Also, Elton had got sober; my dad had attempted to get sober and he didn’t get through it at that time. He represented the exact opposite of what my life was.”She had never even seen a picture of John until she borrowed a biography from the library. “I was like, what the fuck is going on with this guy! He’s amazing!” While her classmates had just about grasped John’s existence from The Lion King, the teenage Carlile, now out, dressed in a white satin suit to perform Honky Cat at a talent show. She wrote John and Taupin letters; aged 18, she went to LA to meet a producer who shared management with Taupin. “He had a desk at the manager’s office,” she says. “I had a little Polaroid camera, I took a picture and sat in the chair.”View image in fullscreenBreakthrough year … Carlile on stage in Chicago in 2007.Photograph: Lyle A Waisman/WireImageCarlile did get signed, breaking through as a singular lyricist with a gale-force voice with her 2007 album The Story, produced by T Bone Burnett. Soon after, she sent John another letter, during his Vegas residency, which led to him appearing on her 2009 album Give Up the Ghost, and to a friendship. After she married charity co-ordinator Catherine Shepherd in 2012, “something changed”, she says. “He had just had kids and knew that we wanted to. He wasn’t just supportive of my music any more; suddenly he was really invested in my personal life.”Their relationship – in which John might call several times a day to gossip, then hang up – inspired Carlile to relate to her parents anew. “Elton showed me how to have a relationship with people I really love when I don’t have time to labour over all of life. I call my parents now every chance I get, but I’ve only got two minutes – and that’s OK.”She may say no, but Brandi brought me back to lifeElton JohnTo listen to John and Carlile talk on their joint call is to be caught in the crossfire of an ardent love-in. He calls her “phenomenal” and insists “she pushed me more than I pushed her”. They bicker lovingly over which one of them is really “saving” the other. In 2019, John watched Carlile perform Joni Mitchell’s Blue in Los Angeles, in front of Mitchell, and was “absolutely floored”.“He called me a crazy bitch!” Carlile laughs.“I thought, I’ve got to work with this person,” says John. “She wants to take risks. I’d have been shitting myself.”Carlile, famously, had coaxed Mitchell to start performing again after a brain aneurysm in 2015 left her unable to play. John joined their backyard “Joni Jams”, which he likens to “an old postwar sing-song around the piano. If you don’t sing, you can’t come.” In October,they sang I’m Still Standing together(albeit sitting) at the Hollywood Bowl. “Music brought Joni back to life,” says John. “To a certain extent, and she may say no, but Brandi brought me back to life.”“I do say no,” she says, “but I love that you say that.”View image in fullscreenJoni Mitchell gives a rare interview to Elton John, on his Rocket Hour show on Apple Music 1.Photograph: Apple MusicTheir unvarnished connection inspired Brandi to write about the experience of being in the studio together, inspired by Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, lyricist Taupin’s 1975 portrayal of his and John’s friendship. The rapturous title track and stirring Someone to Belong To cherish the rewards of their brutal honesty; Never Too Late crystallises John’s capacity for survival. “Fuck off, heaven’s gate!” he sings, stealing the “fuck off!” mantle from Succession’s Logan Roy. “That was what I was thinking!” says Carlile. “Brian Cox should not have that crown. That’s Elton’s crown.”A wider theme coalesced. The album’s baroque curtain-raiser, The Rose of Laura Nyro, pays homage tothe sorely underrated US songwriter, one even less remembered as an LGBTQ+ iconoclast. As a struggling young musician, John pored over the lilac-scented lyric sheet to her 1968 album Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. “I was astonished by the variety of her songwriting and the fact that the songs didn’t follow the normal pattern,” he says. “They slowed down, they sped up. She never really got the dues that she should have.”“Joni loves her too,” says Carlile, “and Joni’s a hard one.”“Joni doesn’t like many people!” John stage-whispers, leaning in, and they crack up.Then the ripping Little Richard’s Bible portrays John’s oft-cited hero swerving from outrageousness back to religion when the money ran out. It’s an opening salvo that celebrates LGBTQ+ trailblazers, but it’s not straightforward: highlighting forgotten histories and self-doubt, even self-loathing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Many people will know of his Aids Foundation’s glamorous Oscars viewing party, for example, but less so the fact that the organisation has made HIV testing available in Walmart. “I think what Glastonbury did for me, and for my reputation in England, was something I’d yearned for all my life,” he says. In America, he feels better understood. “I know what you mean about the cuddly … That’s why I wanted to put the old Elton to bed.”He gives himself credit. “When I was the gay chairman of a football club” – his beloved Watford FC – “we were very successful,” he says. “That was pretty radical. But I’m not Bowie, and I’m not Mick. And I’ve never been ‘cool’ like Nick Cave – who I adore. I’m just me and I have to accept that, but that gives me the inspiration to change a little bit with this record and say: come on, you don’t want to be cuddly Elton for the rest of your life.”Curiously, his press team, present on mute, seem less keen. Last year, John remarked thatDonald Trumpcalling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “rocketman” was “brilliant”, adding that Trump was a fan: “I’ve always been friendly toward him and I thank him for his support,” he said. As he later clarified, clearly they have different values: does John have to be diplomatic to maintain presidential support for Aids treatment? The muted windows spring to life in distorted protest.“I can answer this,” says John, as a voice says: “We’re at time now.” (We aren’t.) “I have the Aids thing to be very aware of, and Pepfar [the US president’s emergency plan for Aids relief globally] is very important for continuing to help people who need the money. And so far, it’s always been kept up by the American government, Trump included; Democrats, Republicans. It was started by a Republican. I have to be diplomatic and fight for those people. My job is not to take sides, my job is to try and keep the money flowing so that people can live a normal life.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with John in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1990.Photograph: Jeffrey Asher/Getty ImagesThree weeks after we speak,Trump freezes Pepfarand instructs foreign organisations to stop distributing HIV medication bought with US aid, with appointments being cancelled, treatment interrupted and patients turned away from clinics. Ina statement, John’s Aids Foundation urged the US government “to fully reinstate all global HIV funding as soon as possible” and said the country’s “history-defining” gains in the fight “may be hard or impossible to recoup”.During the interview,I paused to see whether the PRs were trying to say anything important. “It’s just that they wouldn’t want me to talk about politics, but it’s a good question and it’s what I have to do,” says John, jumping in. “Politics is always about tactics and playing your cards right. People rely on me – and a lot of other people – to try and keep the money coming and that’s what I have to do and I’m determined to do.”John’s determination is not limitless. One bittersweet new song, Little Light, reflects on a moment he and Carlile shared at this very breakfast table. “She was staying next door, she came in and I was pretty down,” says John. “It was Israel- Gaza. I said, look at this, the world is fucked. I don’t know why we’re in the studio recording when this is going on. She wrote the song that day and we recorded it that day.”“He was contemplating not doing the album,” says Carlile. “He was like, maybe this is not the time. My verse is what I wish I’d said.”“It’s such a fine line between faith and apathy,” she sings, evoking the Italian philosopher Gramsci’s saying about having pessimism of the intellect but optimism of the will. “You could tattoo that quote on him,” Carlile says of John.“I’m an optimist permanently,” he says. “I’ve got bad eyesight at the moment. There have been days where I’ve been miserable, but then I think about how lucky I am. I’ve got a new respect for sight-impaired people and people who are totally blind, some of whom I’m in touch with. But to hell with it, I’ve got a great life, and hopefully my sight will improve. What she’s saying is I’ve overcome a lot. This is not going to beat me. I’ve beaten addiction, I’ve beaten health issues, and I can pick myself up and dust myself off.”Overall, Who Believes in Angels? looks resolutely forward. Carlile’s Swing for the Fences – a more riotous riff on the theme of her Grammy-winning 2018 anthem The Joke – is a Stonesy cry for queer youth to break the rules. Between that and You Without Me, her gorgeous, one-take solo song about watching the elder of her two daughters become her own person (“that’s the feeling every parent gets – you’re proud and devastated the first time they decide not to go your way”), the album suggests that a key part of legacy is creating the space for new generations to write fresh scripts.We had this profound moment where Elton came face to face with his mortality without really being able to say itBrandi CarlileAs John did with Nyro and Little Richard, ardent admirers such as the pop starChappell Roanhave taken his influence somewhere new, beyond him. To that end, the album closes with Taupin’s valedictory ballad When This Old World Is Done With Me. As ever, John first tackled the brand new lyrics at the piano. Carlile typically sat behind him, so close her knees touched his bum, ready as the “butterfly catcher” to sing along with great melodies that John might otherwise let slip by – watching him come to life off the page, as she had as a kid. “He got to the line, ‘return me to – the tide’,” she says, adding a stumble, “and I go, ah shit, he’s gonna cry.”John had realised the song was about the end of his life, something only a friend of six decades could have written. “The glasses came off, his whole body is crumpled over the piano, he wept,” says Carlile. “I put my arms around him and held him and he didn’t really talk about it. He’s a bit butch, a stoic, a man’s man. Andrew [Watt], he’s very dramatic, like a Jewish grandmother. He comes running in with tissues. We’re having this really profound moment where Elton has come face to face with his mortality without really being able to say it.View image in fullscreenJohn on stage in New Zealand in 2020 during his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.Photograph: Kerry Marshall/Getty Images“When he looks up, we’re like, what’s he gonna say? And he goes: ‘Is it too Lion King?’“I said, ‘No, no!’ Andrew burst out laughing. Elton burst out laughing. It was unbelievable. At first, it was the saddest thing I’ve ever seen, and then it got really funny, really fast.”“It touched a nerve,” says John, “because I have children now and I have a husband, and it’s not just being ‘Elton’ on his own, it’s wanting to be with the people I love.” He asked Watt to put a brass band over the ending. “It’s beautiful, spiritual music. Something about a brass band moves you so much – colliery bands with the miners; watching the cup final as a kid it was always Abide With Me with a brass band, and I always used to cry.”John recently had the chance to rehearse his own death, filming a scene for Spinal Tap 2 in which he’s killed off in concert. That was the fun bit, but driving back into a huge auditorium, having quit touring, gave him a panic attack. “I did kind of hyperventilate,” says John. “I said, ‘Jesus, I’m so glad I don’t have to do this any more.’”Carlile differs. “I want to die on stage,” she says.“I used to say that,” says John, “but I don’t want to. Well – I can’t. I’ve retired.”Elton John’s 50 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreThe perks of being off the road, he says, are that he can “throw out the shit and just pick the good stuff”. As well as continuing to treat his sight, he’ll heartily promote this album and keep doing his Apple Music radio show, highlighting new artists. There’s talk of a biographical stage show, but he’s not sure.“My husband deals with all of that,” he says. “I don’t want to do too much, but what I want to do should be interesting and different. I don’t want to repeat myself and I think this is what this album is all about. It’s energised. And I have that energy now. What I’m going to do with it, who knows?

Katsiaryna Snytsina was a star Belarusian athlete – but when she protested againsther country’s 2020 electionon social media she was excoriated by the Lukashenko regime. And when she then came out, she was labelled an “extremist lesbian”.Belarus Free Theatre now operate in exile, their productions ranging from agitprop to opera. Natalia Kaliada, who directs this show with Nicolai Khalezin, describes their method as “immersing ourselves into the pain of the world”, to expose oppression and dream of freedom.View image in fullscreenPlayful … Katsiaryna Snytsina in KS6: Small Forward.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe small stage sports the lines and hoop of a basketball court, and a talkshow’s snug chairs. The format cuts between Snytsina’s final professional match last year and a TV studio interview. It’s merrily messy – as well as an onstage DJ and live camera, there’s also a pop quiz, kiss cam, bubble machine and a basketball challenge for three game audience members.Tall and sculptural, Snytsina brings a rangy authenticity as she relates her Soviet childhood and pro career. It’s a pleasure to watch her deftly handle the ball and lope around the stage (movement direction by Javier de Frutos). But she’s also playful with her lived experience – turning her coming out tale into a standup routine or sending herself up when she misses a throw.Music and sound design are by DJ Blanka Barbara, bopping behind the mixing desk. Like the production’s bubble machines, the carefree energy mirrors young Katya’s absorption in sport. But the bubble of professional basketball creates an illusory, apolitical freedom – Snytsina didn’t vote, didn’t track her country’s slide into dictatorship, until she could ignore it no longer. Once she played small forward on the basketball court – now each opportunity to raise awareness is another small step.We often see the athlete training using resistance bands – promising release but then yanking her back. This is no straight-arrow story – Snytsina’s fitful sporting progress, her avowals of political and sexual identities, are matched by the purposefully busy production. The journey from athlete to activist isn’t a smooth ride, but it’s a captivating one.Atthe Pit, Barbican, London, until 8 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBelarus Free TheatreBarbicanBelarusreviewsShareReuse this content"

Joseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 among the rakes, beggars and other Georgian caricatures of London’s Covent Garden where his father kept a barber’s shop. In the 21st century, there seems to be a consensus that he was our greatest artist. Remainers and Reform voters, Mike Leigh and the Bank of England all agree. Everyone loves Mr Turner.Well, almost everyone. There have always been holdouts. Turner lived until 1851, getting ever closer to abstract art, mocked by some for chucking yellow “mustard powder” around. The biggest and best book about him,John Ruskin’s Modern Painters, was written to put them right. Nowadays, fans of Turner’s contemporary John Constable still argue their hero is the more truly observant and authentic artist: isn’t JMW a bit vague with his blazing skies, boiling seas, luminous vapours?The Whitworth’s anniversary outing for its superb collection of Turner’s watercolours and prints answers the sceptics. This is less flamboyant than other recent shows – lower on smoky wooziness – and that makes it all the more enlightening. It reveals what a thoughtful, patient looker at the world Turner was, how sincerely he believed in the redemptive power of landscape art.View image in fullscreenPeat Bog, Scotland, from the Liber Studiorum.Photograph: JMW Turner/The Whitworth, The University of ManchesterIt boasts a stunning, very large watercolour that beautifully introduces you to young Turner. Created in about 1798/9, this haunting view of St Agatha’s Abbey near Easby, Yorkshire, contains multitudes. The artist, in his early 20s, adumbrates all the sublime effects of his later art: a sky that melts into white light; blue clouds turning to cosmic hints; reflections of the ruined abbey in still, mysterious waters, anticipating Monet. But this poetic ecstasy is disciplined by precise drawing. He has delineated the details of gothic stonework, stratified rock and grazing cattle with steady accuracy in pencil before letting his colours enflame it.Turner’s life spanned the greatest revolution in history: the rise of the industrial world. He painted the coming of trains, steamships and smoking factories, even taking an interest in early photography. Here, all that is ahead of him. It’s not just that young Turner lives in a world where nature has yet to be changed, let alone destroyed, by newfangled inventions. He also needs that stability. Born at the frenetic heart of London, the most modern city anywhere, he craved the solitary calm of nature. His watercolours of Yorkshire abbeys were drawn on a sketching tour of the north, and the artist as a lonely pilgrim is a pattern he’d keep up for decades.His profoundly personal idea of landscape art is connected with escape from the madding crowd. Not that young Turner is misanthropic. People fill his scenes, from fishing communities to nude bathers. Especially nudes. In an 1802 watercolour – done when he was a passionate 27-year-old – women relax naked on rocks near a waterfall. A nice Mediterranean moment. Except this is a view of the River Clyde: nude bathing in early 19th-century Scotland seems a lot less plausible.View image in fullscreenBasle, Switzerland, from Turner’s Liber Studiorum.Photograph: JMW Turner/The Whitworth, The University of ManchesterSo it’s fantasy, but he claims the highest artistic licence: the 17th-century painter Claude, who created a grandly motionless, dreamily lit style of landscape in which characters from classical myth populate the sunny hills of Italy. At the heart of this show is Turner’s most fanatical attempt to rival and even become Claude.In about 1806, Turner set out to create a compendium of everything landscape art can be and do. HisLiber Studiorum, or Book of Studies, was a manifesto for his landscape vision, etched and engraved into prints to reach as many people as possible. Claude too had etched, and Turner pays him homage: The Temple of Minerva Medica could be a Claude with its Mediterranean river and ruin. What Turner is searching for, and sees in his hero’s artistic dreamworld, is something archetypal, eternal.Looking at 70 sepia-toned prints may not sound that electric but it is. The Whitworth’s copies came from Turner’s studio, it was discovered, so they must have been special to him. The quality and clarity is amazing – mountains and ruins and walls of water leap out at you in virtual reality.View image in fullscreenCoast of Yorkshire, near Whitby, from Turner’s Liber Studiorum.Photograph: JMW Turner/The Whitworth, The University of Manchester“He paints in colour, but thinks in light and shade,” said Ruskin, inspiring the show’s title. Here you see what he meant. Working only in black and white, collaborating with gifted etchers and engravers, Turner uses shade to shape space. What you see in his Liber is the grasp of structure that underpins all his art. His vision of Solway Moss is hypnotic as you feel the solid power of a gathering storm in the distance over receding, bleak bogs. It is the precision of the perspective that gives this murky scene its devastating, rock-hard reality.Turner shows us the world is real – the world outside our own selves, in all its light and shadow. His eye for the complex truth of space doesn’t just look forward to Monet, but Cézanne. “What is it to be alive?” the artist keeps asking himself. It is to exist among things and people who are not you. His art makes you love the world.

The film is set in an apocalyptic Gotham City ruled by Batman, billionaire groomer of teenage boys. Comedy can only be practised by licensed clowns divided into Jokers (male) and Harlequins (female). Enter Joker the Harlequin, played by Drew, who establishes an illegal comedy club specialising in cringe and bad-taste humour.Sitting at home today in Los Angeles, Drew is wearing a dress from the emo chain Hot Topic and a pair of Swifty Lazar-style glasses as big as TV screens. The curtains are drawn against the morning sunlight, rendering the room murky. The whole vibe is very witness protection programme.Not that she is hiding from anyone. The People’s Joker has been through more than its share of controversy but that’s all behind her now. The trouble reached its peak just hours before the movie premiered in the midnight slot at the 2022 Toronto International Film festival, when she received correspondence fromWarner Bros. Though nothing as definitive as a cease-and-desist letter, it did dispute her claim that the picture fell under the laws of “fair use and parody” in its reliance on existing IP. An accord was reached, and the film opened in the US last year. Accepting the breakthrough director prize at the recent Gotham awards in New York, Drew thanked Warner Bros “for not suing me”.Right from the start, she and her co-writer, Bri LeRose, had consulted lawyers, some of whom preferred to remain anonymous in the movie’s credits. Legally, Drew was permitted to use the Batman template and characters only insofar as they were analogous to the details of her life. As a genuine failed child actor (she auditioned, unsuccessfully, forSuperbad) and teenage improv comic, as well as a trans woman in a transphobic world, it was no stretch for her to appropriate the story of the bullied standup Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, as a vehicle to tell her own.Shot in just five days in the office ofTim Heidecker(who has a voice cameo, as does Better Call Saul’s Bob Odenkirk), the film was pieced together over several years of pandemic-era post-production by more than 100 artists. The result is a hectic, high-calorie collage of live-action, green-screen, computer graphics, puppetry and assorted animated styles from punchy comic-strip panels to lush watercolours. When Drew edited Baron Cohen’s seriesWho Is America?, the British comic warned her not to overload a scene with gags. Let loose on her own, she goes for broke. (She also throws in a cheeky nod to Borat in a film poster for a fictional comedy called Foreign Man.)The People’s Joker may have started as a gag but it was inspired by an allegedabsenceof humour. In 2019, the director of Joker, Todd Phillips, insisted that woke had killed the joke. “Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,” he grumbled. Incensed by his argument, LeRose, a writer on Arrested Development,tweeted: “I will only watch this coward’s joker movie if Vera Drew re-edits it.” She then transferred a “fee” of $12 to Drew’s account. “I’m not saying that every autistic person would do this,” Drew said, last year. “But with my autism I don’t understand sarcasm or irony. I saw that as my first artistic commission.”She is not without sympathy for Phillips’ claim, which has been echoed by numerous other straight, middle-aged comics including Jerry Seinfeld. “We do live in a time where everybody is hypersensitive and reactive, myself included,” she says now. “So I get where people like Todd Phillips and Seinfeld are coming from. I’m also, like: ‘Oh, you’resoafraid of being replaced.’ I can relate to that on a human level. Ageing is hard!”Her original idea had been to remix Joker by inserting backdrops from 1990s Batman movies or using found footage and deepfakes. “But the technology wasn’t quite there, and it seemed like a lot more work than shooting a movie with my friends. Also, it wasn’t until I was doing it that I realised how much I gave a shit about these characters.” Take the sequence in which Joker as a child goes to see a Batman movie with her mother, and realises that she is trans. “That memory of mine only resurfaced as I was making the film. I was taken to seeBatman Foreverwhen I was seven, and I identified with Nicole Kidman’s character rather than Batman. I felt represented by this very expensive gay art film. It was as if I was seeing the rest of my life.”She must have spotted women in movies before then. What was the special sauce that gave this experience its kick? “It’s theJoel Schumacherof it all,” she says, referring to the late director of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, to whom The People’s Joker is dedicated. “He was the gayest man who ever lived, so there’s no ‘straight male gaze’. And his female characters are highly developed. Nicole Kidman plays a professional woman who has agency and desire. It’s kind of fucked-up: she’s obsessed with bats and rubber nipples. Gender aside, I’d never seen anything so colourful and over-the-top. There was an intensity to it.”Drew gave a shout-out to Kidman during her Gothams acceptance speech for being one of the catalysts for her trans epiphany; the Babygirl starresponded by raising a fistin solidarity. “I dropped her a note afterwards,” Drew says with a smile. “I’m dying to work with her. She’s fearless.”View image in fullscreen(From left) Nathan Faustyn, Vera Drew and Bri LeRose.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesThe same could be said about her. Making a film that lightly fictionalises the first three decades of her life, even drawing on verbatim conversations she had with an emotionally abusive ex, sounds like the definition of triggering. (Drew has likened the making of the film to “taking a four-year-long shit of my trauma”.) You can plainly hear the toll it has taken by listening to the commentary track on the US Blu-ray, which she recorded while “a little bit high” and having her nails painted; in the final seconds, she descends into exhausted tears.“Making the film was something I needed to do,” she tells me. “It was like this thing that had to be removed from my body surgically. But there were so many moments when I thought it wouldn’t see the light of day.” Now it was out at last, and she was ricocheting from one cinema to the next for public appearances in herJokermakeup. It all got too much. “I’m a workaholic. And a few other things-aholic. I just wasn’t prepared for how exhausting it would be watching all my trauma over and over.”She has claimed she made The People’s Joker to repair her relationship to her art and her body. Did it work? “I don’t know that it did. I had just got out of this bad relationship, and my relationship with my parents was fractured because of my transition. I went into this thinking: ‘It’s gonna fix something!’” By the time the movie was done, she felt even more confused. “I had spent almost four years looking at this version of myself through the scope of fictional characters that I didn’t even own the rights to. It ended up becoming this psychedelic mindfuck. I was, like: ‘Did I fracture my relationship to my transness and my identityeven more?’ But I think I might have needed to blow up that foundation to start figuring shit out.”In the process, she has blown up many of the conventions of queer cinema, much likeJohn Watersbefore her. “It’s important more than ever today for queer people not to worry too much about being problematic or finding some invisible barometer for respectability. Our rights are being taken away on a daily basis, so I’m not about to deny those parts of myself that might be ugly to a cis audience. It’s more appealing to me to write trans and queer characters that are unlikable than to make them perfect.

Collaborators and fans explain her appealShaad D'SouzaFri 7 Feb 2025 06.23 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 06.26 ESTShareLast Sunday’s Grammy awards were a celebration of widely known blue-chip talent: Taylor Swift was there, handing an award to Beyoncé. Shakira performed a medley, as did Sabrina Carpenter, a relatively young star who was pulled into the pop firmament last year. But the first award given out, for best rap album, went to a relative unknown, and it created the kind of star-is-born moment that award shows excel at. Accepting the award for her mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal – beating legends such as Eminem, Future and J Cole – 26-year-old Florida rapper Doechii began to tear up: “I put my heart and soul into this mixtape. I bared my life,” she said. “I dedicated myself to sobriety and God told me that I would be rewarded, and that he would show mejust how good it could get.”Doechii, born Jaylah Hickmon, is only the third woman ever to win the best rap album trophy – after Lauryn Hill (as part of the Fugees) and Cardi B – and her Grammy capped a banner year. She has been making music since 2016, but in 2024 she finally made good on the promise of her early viral singles with a madcap, immensely personal album hailed by critics as one of the year’s best. Combining the sound of 90s hip-hop with neo-soul and newer rap subgenres, Doechii unpacks the trials and tribulations of young stardom – drug addiction, label disputes, the weight of expectation – with the sharpness and timing of a great comic.Fans point to her charisma, and her huge technical ability: she’s able to deliver complex high-speed rhymes perfectly on top of the beat – as was shown later on in theGrammysceremony, in a thrillingly choreographed, relentlessly rapped performance of album tracks Catfish and Denial Is a River.But they also admire her emotional honesty. “Doechii is talking about how she was once engaged, and all these different breakups and mental breakdowns – I do think that vulnerability is somewhat rare,” saysMankaprr Conteh, a staff writer at Rolling Stone who has covered Doechii’s rise extensively. “She also leans into foundational hip-hop – [the album] is very boom-bappy,” she says, referring to the easygoing breakbeat-driven 90s sound known as boom-bap. “But she’s able to engage with memeability, modern language, modern concerns. It’s not just nostalgia – it’s a reverence for the foundations of the genre.”While there are many rap artists working with the sounds of the 90s right now – a mantle taken on with particular verve by Griselda Records MCs such as Benny the Butcher and Conway the Machine – few have been able to bring that sound into the mainstream like Doechii. Devin Malik, a producer on Alligator Bites Never Heal, says that “what makes Doechii unique in rap right now is pretty simple: authenticity”. Fans crave this, he says, in a world where “everything is fabricated, everything is paid for, everyone’s being sold something”.Working with Doechii on Alligator Bites Never Heal was “a pretty easy and simple process,” Malik says, because Doechii was so clear about her goals. “It wasn’t to chart, it wasn’t to sell 100m records. What she wanted to achieve was just getting her truth off.”In Denial Is a River, Doechii casts back to an earlier mindset: “I like pills, I like drugs … I like doing Hollywood shit / Snort it? Probably would.” But as mentioned in her Grammys speech, she challenged herself to get sober ahead of making the record – she doesn’t drink, use drugs, smoke or even drink caffeine – using the self-belief that Conteh says is key to her success. “I think Doechii’s artistry is strong because she is so in tune with who she is as a human being,” she says. “That knowledge of self, that relationship to her faith, I think, is really grounding for her, in an environment that she admittedly lost herself in a little bit. She talks about her drug use, partying in Hollywood, but was ultimately able to find herself.”View image in fullscreenFast-climbing … another look at Doechii’s Grammys set.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyDoechii finished her speech with an appeal to black women in music: “I know that there is some black girl out there, so many black women out there that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you, ‘You can do it. Anything is possible.’”Georgia rapper Vayda says that this moment was an acknowledgment of Doechii’s “exceptional” status in the industry. “It’s a lot of barriers – she’s a black woman, a dark-skinned woman at that. We don’t really see that many dark-skinned girls in the mainstream light,” she says. “She had to fight through a lot of barriers to make it to where she’s at. I think it just teaches everybody like, even if you fail, even if it takes you a little bit longer, as long as you’re consistent you’re going to make it where you need to go.”‘They felt they couldn’t market us to white people’: 90s hip-hop iconoclasts Digable Planets returnRead moreConteh says that Doechii’s success may provide a roadmap for female rappers who don’t fit a traditional mould – whose work may be grittier or less traditionally feminine – to find mainstream recognition. “Whenever anything is popular, sometimes there are a lot of people doing a similar thing, especially in the kind of ‘pussy rap’ genre,” she says, referring to the sexually confident style of artists such as Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Latto and City Girls. “That’s not to say that music isn’t amazing and worthwhile, but there is a little bit of a formula that Doechii just doesn’t ascribe to, but you can also tell it’s not one that she devalues. She really is everything – she can twerk, she’s high fashion, she can do really lowbrow stuff, she’s a great technical rapper, she’s a singer.“It just doesn’t feel forced,” she continues. “It just feels like an artist really honing themselves and their craft. And I think that has been really infectious.”Explore more on these topicsRapGrammysGrammy awards 2025Hip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Darke, Theodore KimBlack US culture‘This is Black hair’: technological advances are making waves in animationAfro-textured hair in animation has long been oversimplified, but new algorithms now capture its true formGloria OladipoFri 7 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 16.46 ESTShareFor decades, afro-textured hair animation has lagged behind illustrations of straight hairstyles. Renderings of Black characters do not typically represent the plethora of Black hair styles or specific attributes of Black hair: the kink in their strands, the spring in their curls. But now, for the first time ever, researchers have developed algorithms to depict coily, Black hair in computer graphics, a huge step for the portrayal of Black characters.The findings have been published in a new study, which will be available to animators worldwide. The study is a collaboration between researchers at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.Research papers are typically the first step for film studios to gain new techniques for animation, said Theodore Kim, a co-author on the study and a professor of computer science at Yale School of Engineering and Applied Science. “Almost every computer graphics technique that you see on the screen was first published as a research paper,” Kim said, adding that the papers allow scientists at film and game studios to sort through the available research and “[set] the agenda for what they do next year”.Having codified formulas designed to create coily hair textures is thus historic, with the potential to improve inclusivity in animation. “There’s all these papers on computer graphics algorithms that have been published in the last 50 years, especially on hair,” Kim said. “Nothing has ever tried to get this type of hair before”.View image in fullscreenLong hair demo.Photograph: Courtesy of Haomiao Wu, Alvin Shi, AM Darke, Theodore KimIn recent years, the number of Black characters featured in animation has increased: Tiana Rogers in the Disney picture The Princess and the Frog and Joe Gardner in the Pixar movie Soul are some examples of growing diversity. But despite the increase in representation, illustrations of Black hair have remained relatively stagnant. Kim said that animators have failed to capture textures such as type 4C hair, which features tightly wound curls, because they lacked the formulas to do so, and instead replicated a limited range of styles that have been done before. “There’s only one or two hairstyles that people gravitate towards because they find that it’s culturally approved,” he said. “The vast diversity of type four hair is then lost.”Typically, the depiction of coily hair in computer graphics is solved through “labor”, said Kim, with animators and artists going in to add details by hand. “If the algorithms didn’t support you, they just had to go in and move each vertex until they got things to look OK.”Since such adjustments are on an individual basis, depictions of afro-textured hair could look “off” if an animator or artist doesn’t have the “intuition” when it comes to a specific curly hair type. But the latest algorithms could make the process of animating afro-texture hair more standard, as animators will now have formulas to achieve coily hair.View image in fullscreenA screenshot of a tweet used in a presentation by Professor AM Darke illustrating examples of typical Black hair styles given to characters in video games.Photograph: Courtesy of AM DarkeThe research that first informed the study started in 2020, when AM Darke, a co-author on the paper, founded the Open Source Afro Hair Library (Osahl), a free database with 3D images of Black hair created by Black artists. Before the creation of Osahl, 3D asset marketplaces, where animators and 3D artists can shop through models for animation projects, contained racist imagery of Black people, showing them as mammy caricatures or wearing generic tribal wear.“My goal with the library was to create a new container that not only addressed the representation, but also created a community for Black artists to have discussions around,” said Darke, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz’s department of performance, play and design. “What should we look like? What do we look like?”Darke’s work on Osahl generated much excitement on social media and was later highlighted in collaborations withDove BeautyandUlta. Their work eventually caught Kim’s attention, who reached out to Darke to speak about issues with hair representation within computer graphics.View image in fullscreenSwitchback is when the direction of a curl changes, creating a ‘kink’. This switchback has the most the animation of the switchbacks created by the team.Photograph:  Courtesy of Haomiao Wu, Alvin Shi, AM Darke, Theodore KimIn some of the most lauded papers about hair graphics, Darke found that afro-textured hair either “wasn’t represented at all” or was “misrepresented”. In one paper, she said, the provided example for “African hair” was “straight hair … That, to me, encapsulates the problem.”The most recent paper from Kim, Darke and other researchers created algorithms that animate three major attributes of afro-textured hair: “phase locking”, “period skipping” and “switchback”. Phase locking is when coily hair “grows out as a helix” or a “spongy” layer closer to the scalp, before forming more defined curls as the hair grows, Kim said.Period skipping describes when some hairs “leap out” of a curl pattern, adding the appearance of frizz around a curl. Period skipping, specifically, allows the hair to look “more matte or diffuse”. And switchback is when the direction of a curl changes, creating a “kink”, said Kim, a phenomenon that naturally occurs in plants and polymers.Short hair demo.Photograph: Courtesy of Haomiao Wu, Alvin Shi, AM Darke, Theodore KimSystematic barriers within animation, including diversity in hiring, often means improvements on how to better illustrate Black characters can fall to the wayside. “We do not have Black women abundant in computer graphics, which means we don’t have Black women reviewers in the papers,” Kim said. “We don’t have Black people looking at the research saying: ‘Oh, that’s what curly hair looks like, or that’s authentic,’ or even, ‘This is a standard for curly hair.’”But the latest paper signals a significant change in increasing accurate representation and calling out existing prejudices within computer graphics, specifically the assumption that Black hair is “niche”, Darke said.“With so many other things, whether it’s food or music or fashion, when you prioritize Black features, Black cultures, it actually opens up creativity for everyone. The Black diaspora pushes culturally in a lot of ways.”Explore more on these topicsBlack US cultureWomen's hairMen's hairBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It follows Tom Metcalfe, an academic at the fictional University of the South Downs.Searching in the archives, Tom comes across a clue that may lead to a lost poem, read aloud in 2014 and never heard again. His find reveals a story of entangled loves and a crime that destroys his assumptions about people he thought he knew well.“This is a novel about history, and what we can know of it, and of each other,” said McEwan. “We live our lives between the dead and the yet to be born. Of the dead we know a little, but not as much as we think. About the present, we disagree fiercely. People of the future are beyond our reckoning, but we’re troubled by what we’ll bequeath them. As they look back at us, what will our descendants think, when they contemplate the diminished world we left them? They might envy us.”“To catch at these thoughts, I’ve written a novel about a quest, a crime, revenge, fame, a tangled love affair, mental illness, love of nature and poetry, and how, through all natural and self-inflicted catastrophes, we have the knack of surviving somehow,” he added.McEwan has published 17 novels including Atonement, Enduring Love, On Chesil Beach and, most recently, Lessons, described as “compassionate and gentle” and “a tale of humane grace” by Beejay Silcoxin the Guardian. In 1998, McEwan won the Booker prize with his novel Amsterdam. He is also the author of two short story collections, First Love, Last Rites, which won the Somerset Maugham award, and In Between the Sheets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The song is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit with lyrics calling the Canadian star a “certified paedophile”. Drake’s lawyers have called the song “dangerous” ina filing made last month.According toTMZ, Lamar will definitely be including the song in his performance but the question remains as to which lyrics will be deemed suitable for the telecast by both the NFL and Fox, who will be airing the game.Chiefs v Eagles Super Bowl questions: when’s kickoff? Who is the halftime performer? Are Taylor and Trump going?Read moreLamar is no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having appeared during 2022’ship-hop and R&B headliner showalongside Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J Blige.In an interview this week, he spoke of the importance of bringing his “LA energy” with him on Sunday. “That’s something I wanted to carry over to New Orleans and for the world to see,” he said. “This is me. This is Kendrick Lamar, 37 years old, and I still feel like I’m elevating, I’m still on a journey.” When asked about what viewers can expect, he said that “storytelling” will be a key component of his set.Speculation has been rife over who his surprise guests will be, with only SZA as yet confirmed.

Swift, who previously collaborated with Lamar on the single Bad Blood, will reportedly watch the game from a $2m suite at the Caesars Superdome with rumours of celebrity friends alongside.

Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, the fourth instalment in the misadventures of Helen Fielding’s hapless romantic, may be unlikely to dominate the Academy Awards, but it is set to clean up at screens across the country over the Valentine’s Day period – and beyond.“We’re anticipating it to be one of the biggest titles of the year in the UK, the biggest British film of the year, and the biggest box office for the first half of 2025,” says Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics.“Pre-sales are even higher than for blockbusters like Barbie,” said Eduardo Leal, group Regional director of screen content for the Vue cinema chain. “It is tracking to be the biggest ever Bridget Jones film.”Nine years after Renée Zellweger’s bumbling reporter fell pregnant in Bridget Jones’s Baby, she is now back with two children but no husband, as human rights lawyer Mark Darcy has been killed off during a heroic humanitarian trip to Sudan. Colin Firth does, however, make a number of spectral – yet still dishy – appearances in the new film, which are heavily teased in the trailer.Resurrected instead is dastardly smoothie Daniel Cleaver, who was missing presumed dead in Baby, but is now back in action, with dialogue polished byHugh Granthimself.The film is being positioned as a tonic to other, more challenging, awards contenders such as the post-Holocaust epic The Brutalist and September 5, based onthe terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The latest Bridget Jones instalment also offers a female-skewed alternative to more mainstream new releases, including Captain America: Brave New World, Marvel’s new superhero offering starring Harrison Ford and Anthony Mackie.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant, here with Casper Knopf, makes a comeback as the dastardly Daniel Cleaver in Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy“I can also say that we’re anticipating a bumper Valentine’s weekend with a perfect mix of titles for all audiences,” says Mitchell. “I think Bridget is perfectly placed counter-programming to Captain America.”However, this happy marriage of product and timing is an exclusive one, for in the US the film is skipping cinemas and going straight to streaming. Such disparity of expectation between the two territories is almost unprecedented. Usually, the reasons for radically different release strategies are attributable to the cultural divide; Dennis Quaid’s middle-of-the-road Reagan biopic cleaned up in the southern US last year but failed to secure a release in the UK.Some genres, such as faith films and much of the work of US actor Tyler Perry, similarly struggle to gain enough transatlantic traction for UK distributors to risk more than a niche digital release. Meanwhile, the experimental Robbie Williams biopic Better Man, in which the singer is reimagined as CGI chimp, left American audiences baffled, and in the US it earned just a quarter of the $8m (£6.4m) it made on home turf.But the Bridget Jones films have been opening to diminishing returns in the US since the start. The first film made a respectable 25% of its $282m global take in the US in 2001; by the second, in 2004, that had dropped to 15% (of a $265m total). In 2016, Bridget Jones’s Baby had an even more troubled transatlantic birth, with just 11% of its final takings coming from the US. That $20m (of $211m) was, however, trebled in the UK, where the film broke a considerable number of records and was the third best-performing movie of the year.For Mad About the Boy the distributor Universal Pictures and production company Working Title struck a deal for US rights with the streamer Peacock before the film went into production, but some are now wondering whether such scepticism about its American prospects may have been misguided.Early word of mouth on the film, whose reviews are embargoed until 12 February, has been positive, with many praising the reinvention and stamina of the franchise, despite the central love triangle having two new corners: Chiwetel Ejiofor (who plays a strict yet ripped science teacher) andLeo Woodall(a strapping parks supervisor).Big knickers, bad decisions and old bats: Renée Zellweger on the return of Bridget JonesRead moreThe film’s central tension – the on-off affair between the characters played by Zellweger, who is 55 and Woodall, who is 28 – is very on point, with age-gap relationships involving older women and younger men producing two box office hits in the past year, thanks to Anne Hathaway and Nicole Kidman (twice).Many – including Grant – have also flagged Mad About the Boy’s classy Kleenex credentials, with the theme of grief (which is central to Fielding’s 2013 novel on which this instalment is based) faithfully transferred to the screen by the film’s co-writer Abi Morgan. Tonally, the film is reportedly considerably more mature and thematically complex than its predecessors, and its visual palette also more ambitious – thanks, perhaps, to incoming director Michael Morris, whose most recent film was the acclaimed drama To Leslie, about an alcoholic single mother in Texas.Two years ago, that film earned its star Andrea Riseborough a surprise Oscar nomination.

As a result, the Netflix documentary will not be released.”The film, which was completed but untitled, was made by Ezra Edelman, who won an Academy Award and Emmy for the eight-hour 2016 film OJ: Made in America, which told the story of the life and criminal trial of OJ Simpson.Edelman, who spent five years making his Prince film, was originally granted unprecedented access to Prince’s archives – known as The Vault – by the estate following an undisclosed multimillion-dollar deal. He was told the estate, which was then being administered by a bank, would not exert editorial control over the film (as recounted ina New York Times articlein September 2024). The film features a number of people close to Prince, including former bandmates, managers, girlfriends and one of his sisters.But in 2022, after Prince’s estate changed administration to some of his heirs, associates and the company Primary Wave, the new owners moved to block Edelman from accessing The Vault. The Netflix executive who commissioned the film then left the company, and after seeing the film, the estate reportedly made a series of demands for cuts and reshoots.Sourcesspeaking to Varietyclaimed the estate found the film to be “sensationalised” and had factual inaccuracies. Music producer Charles Spicer, a member of the estate, wrote on X in 2024: “We have a duty to honor and protect his legacy with a story that fairly shows his complexities as well as his greatness. #no9hourhitjob”.Now the film’s release has been cancelled, the estate has taken a triumphant tone on social media, sharing the same statement as Netflix as well as a new video captioned “The Vault has been freed”, showing footage of Prince alongside two quotes by him: “Despite everything, no one can dictate who you are to other people,” and: “The truth is, you’re either here to enlighten or discourage.”Londell McMillan, a member of the estate and the lawyer who negotiated on its behalf, called the decision “a big, big win for Prince’s legacy”. He said the estate’s planned documentary would be “an in-depth piece that explores the complexities of the brilliant musical genius”.The author of the New York Times article, Sasha Weiss, saw Edelman’s film and called it a “cursed masterpiece”, saying it “shows, more movingly and convincingly than almost anything I’ve seen, how life can illuminate art, and yet how separate the two things really are”.Weiss describes a scene that features Prince’s former girlfriend Jill Jones alleging a physical assault by him against her. She also reports scenes that describe his dependence on pain medication, and feature criticism of certain lyrics as antisemitic.The musician and Oscar-winning film-maker Questlove features in the film, and told Weiss after seeing it: “It was a heavy pill to swallow when someone that you put on a pedestal is normal. Everything’s here: he’s a genius, he’s majestical, he’s sexual, he’s flawed, he’s trash, he’s divine, he’s all those things … I saw this as a rare, rare,rarechance for [Black men] to look human to the world.”Explore more on these topicsPrincePop and rockNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

He went on to become a regular chef on ITV’s prime daytime show This Morning.He has also presented the ITV gameshow Family Fortunes, and has hosted a number of his own cooking programmes.Reruns of old D’Acampo shows have been pulled from the ITV schedule in response to the claims.Among the allegations reported by ITV News are those made by women working on shows including Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip, Gino’s Italian Express and Gino’s Italy – Like Mamma Used to Make.In response to the claims, D’Acampo said in a comment issued to ITV News: “I have been told by ITN News that allegations have been made about me acting inappropriately, some dating back over 10 years ago.“I have never been made aware of these matters previously and the allegations are firmly denied. I would not do anything that I thought would upset or distress anyone. This is simply not in my nature. I do not recognise the version of events being put to me.“Not only have these allegations never been raised with me before, I have been repeatedly supported by executives at the highest level and was commissioned on prime-time programmes during the period in which it is now suggested I was acting inappropriately.“I am a father, husband and have worked with well over 1,500 people on around 80 productions in my career, which I have been so proud of. I take such matters extremely seriously and the suggestion that I have acted in an improper way against is deeply upsetting.”The Guardian has approached D’Acampo’s representatives for comment.His legal team said: “Mr D’Acampo categorically denies these allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour.“To his knowledge no such allegations have been made against him in relation to his time on Gino’s Italian Express and this is the first time, six years later, he has been informed of these alleged incidents, and he does not accept them, not least because some of this is considered by Mr D’Acampo to be a fabricated work of fiction.”One woman alleged D’Acampo made sexualised comments towards her while they were working on a magazine shoot in 2011.Another woman interviewed by ITV News claimed she had witnessed him threatening a young colleague in 2019, with another two women accusing D’Acampo of making sexual remarks while working on Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip in 2018.The ITV News report said executives at Objective Media Group, which co-produced Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip in 2018, were aware of the concerns, with an email seen by the broadcaster, sent last year, detailing “unacceptable and distressing” behaviour by D’Acampo.Objective Media Group said it “takes the welfare and wellbeing of all its production staff and teams incredibly seriously” and includes “behavioural clauses in talent contracts” and provides “behavioural training for on-screen talent”.MultiStory Media, which produced Gino’s Italian Express, said it would be “inappropriate to go into the detail of individual concerns” but that it was “reviewing the concerns which have been raised, what was known at the time and what action was taken”.It added: “We will also look at any new concerns that have come to light.”In a statement to ITV News, Studio Ramsay, which produced the show Gino’s Italian Family Adventure and co-produced Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Road Trip in 2018, said it takes “all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and workplace misconduct seriously, promptly investigate, and take appropriate remedial action when warranted”.A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “The allegations against Gino D’Acampo are deeply concerning.“Everybody should be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace. As the culture secretary has previously said, it is right that any allegations of inappropriate behaviour are taken very seriously and that victims are supported and able to challenge behaviour – no matter how famous the star is.“The culture secretary has met with the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority to discuss how government and the industry can work together to ensure that no one faces abuse or harassment in their workplace.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFood TVITV NewsITVnewsShareReuse this content"

He was on the stand for about three days’ worth of testimony, including a long and combative cross-examination.“You think you’re slick!” he shouted at the defense lawyer Joe Tacopina in a typical exchange. “You’re not going to keep tripping me up! You’re not slick!”He testified that after their friendship faltered and grew into a feud, he and Rocky had a confrontation in Hollywood that led to Rocky firing two shots at him. He says his knuckles were grazed, but he was otherwise not hurt.Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm, and if convicted on both can legally get up to 24 years in prison.Rihanna, the superstar who is Rocky’s longtime partner and the mother of their toddler sons, slipped into the courtroom on Thursday afternoon and sat in Rocky’s section after several days of absence.

First up on Friday will be A$AP Twelvyy, a member of Rocky and Relli’s A$AP Mob crew who was at the scene. The group of friends and creators dates back to high school in New York nearly 20 years ago.Rihanna appears again at A$AP Rocky’s gun assault trial as ex-friend testifiesRead moreThe defense has not said whether Rocky will take the considerable risk of taking the stand himself, which he is not legally required to do. He already opted to take a significant risk by turning down the prosecution’s pre-trial offer of a recommended sentence of just 180 days in jail and other relatively minor penalties in exchange for a guilty plea on one count.His tour manager Lou Levin will be the second defense witness.Raised in Harlem, the Grammy nominee had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013.But his role as a fashion maven has almost eclipsed his music. He is scheduled to be a celebrity co-host on one of fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, in May.The suits he wears in the courtroom and the overcoats he wears outside it have become fodder for discussion, and inspired aNew York Times story on his style.A publicist for Yves Saint Laurent sent a new release, of the kind usually reserved for red carpets, saying that one day in court he was wearing an “Yves jacket in wool chine”, a “shirt in silk crepe de chine” and “high-waisted pants in wool chine”.His fashion sense even came up in phone recordings played in court, during which a person purported to be Relli declares that Rocky was “not a true gangster”, and that “this is the case of Dior”.That phone recording, and others, came through a witness that the defense was allowed to call early. Wally Sajimi, an internet branding consultant who worked with both Rocky and Relli, recorded calls with Relli in 2022, and flew from Paris to Los Angeles to take the stand.His testimony and the calls could prove pivotal, since Relli declares that he was going to get millions from Rocky in a separate civil case and did not care about the criminal prosecution. The defense played them for only Relli to hear as he sat in the witness stand, and he angrily declared them fake, which meant the jury could not hear them.But the presence of Sajimi, who made the recordings and gave them to Rocky, allowed them to be played aloud in court.On one, a voice resembling Relli’s says suing Rocky “was my gameplan all along,” and: “Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker.”But in cross-examination, the deputy district attorney John Lewin established that the stories Relli was telling on the calls were consistent with his testimony.“Did he ever tell you at any point in time: ‘You know what? Yeah, I’m trying to get his money, but I made the whole thing up?” Lewin asked.Sajimi said no.“In fact, isn’t it true that what he was telling you was that that man shot at him,” Lewin said, pointing at Rocky, “and Relli wanted to make sure he got his for what happened?”The witness’s testimony was a microcosm of the entire case. The verdict could depend upon how much weight they give to Relli’s descriptions of the incident, his possible dishonesty about other elements like the calls, and whether they think his seeking money undermines him, as the defense has gone to great lengths to contend.The lead detective in the case was on the stand when the day began on Thursday.The LAPD detective Frank Flores conceded under defense questioning that a surveillance video that captured the incident does not show an operating gun, or prove there was a shooting in itself.But Flores said the behavior of the men in the video, combined with another that captured audio of gunshots, and others that showed the men before and after, lead to the conclusion there was a shooting.The defense does not dispute that some form of the incident occurred, but they say that Rocky fired a starter pistol that shoots blanks that he carries for security.When asked whether he could definitively establish there were gunshots, Flores said the audio provided “the distinct sound of a firearm”, or “some some kind of replica firearm potentially”.Explore more on these topicsA$AP RockyGun crimeLos AngelesCaliforniaHip-hopWest CoastRihannanewsShareReuse this content"

What does the current ascendancy of MessrsChappelle, Gervais, Burr – and indeed Trump – tell us about our relationship to comedy, to cruelty, to freedom of speech? To explore just that, Lee presents this new show in three parts, and through three personae: his normal “metropolitan liberal elite” self; an obnoxious shoot-from-the-hip alter ego; and some experimental combination of the two.It’s as improbable a show as we’ve any right to expect of a man 35 years into his career. The opening of its second act, which finds Lee in full werewolf costume, screaming unintelligibly into a microphone to a rock backing track, makes one wonder if he’s staging his own midlife crisis. But no: this is no longerStewart Lee, it’s the Man-Wulf, a red-in-tooth-and-claw standup hawking bigotry and “suck my dick” in a bad Noo Yawk accent. Just as unlikely is the following sequence, when Lee, new identity now abandoned, treats us to the slapstick spectacle of a knackered man in an outsized wolf suit struggling to mount a swivel stool.Lee as Mr Bean? Lee as Joe Rogan? The surprising new guises just keep coming. In response to the question “Where are all the tough good guys?”, there follows a section workshopping what touchy-feely liberal standup might look like if performed with shock-jock machismo. Well, as much machismo as a 56-year-old can muster when stood on stage in just a T-shirt, a pair of pants and a teensy prosthetic willy.View image in fullscreenHirsute and hilarious … Stewart Lee.Photograph: Steve UllathorneThere’s a lot going on, in short, at least after the interval – and the novelty of Lee throwing these ridiculous shapes is quite enough to carry us through to the show’s more reflective coda. Which is just as well, because the joke, both of the faux-reactionary Man-Wulf and of his lefty counterpart, is fairly basic. There’s more nuance, and more of the usual pleasure that comes with a Stewart Lee show – that twisty pleasure of working out what he’s up to, and why – in act one, when normal Stew tees up his project with meta material about vampires, Gregg Wallace and an encounter with a model at an exhibition of the surrealist paintings ofIthell Colquhoun.That anecdote posits an inner bully lurking behind Lee’sbien pensantveneer, a conceit he returns to in the show’s musical finale. The route there is circuitous, and deviates via more audience abuse, even more commentary on this or that joke’s failure to land, than usual. It wouldn’t be Stewart Lee (and tonight it’s not always meant to be) if they were neatly packaged – but the ideas are rich in this lurid new show, which interrogates the worst evils of our nature, the left’s scepticism of charisma, and the vexed relationship between cruelty and comedy.AtOxford Playhouseuntil 8 February,then touring.Explore more on these topicsStageComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Stewart LeereviewsShareReuse this content"

Esmeh (Hanna Khogali), is a formerly radicalised Islamic State bride, groomed at the age of 14, now stranded in Syria, her British citizenship revoked. In Britain, her sister, Antiya (Hiba Medina), is staging a protest-to-the-death against an intransigent government to get Esmeh home.The stage, designed by Marco Turcich, has shades of a Greek debating chamber, with a white platform and lectern, but with added screens for scrolling news reports, the floor alternately a TV studio and the House of Commons where the home secretary (Phil Cheadle) defends the banishing of Esmeh into stateless exile.View image in fullscreenBroad brush … Antigone [on strike].Photograph: Nir SegalWe, the audience, are given a voting keypad and become citizens of the polis, of sorts, exercising our right to vote on ethical issues arising from the drama, which is often paused so that we can answer multiple choice questions (anything from “Should a minor be held accountable for her actions?” to “What do you want out of this [drama]?”)It is original but the questions are broad brush, leading to a flashing assortment of pie-charts but not followed through. The voting sits outside the outcome of the story too, and is a lesser consequential adjunct oozing gameshow energy. The pauses come to feel like interruptions to the drama, which is piecemeal, and stiffly delivered between political debates and newsreels, never quite given the chance to come to the boil.Antiya stages a hunger strike and butts heads with the home secretary whose son (Ali Hadji-Heshmati) is having a very public relationship with her, in a less credible plot twist. There is an Alexa-style figure in Ty (Sorcha Brooks), a government adviser who sounds more android than human. She speaks of the home secretary’s rising or falling popularity in percentages, as well as posing questions to the audience needlessly and giving cod philosophical monologues (“What is a man?”).The drama, sandwiched between it all, has strong echoes of Kamila Shamsie’s Women’s prize-winning novel,Home Fire, and its central contention – between state law and what Sophocles deemed “divine” law but which might in our age be classed as universal human rights – is transposed well.It is a shame it feels so clunky with many extraneous parts. The immersive elements ironically push you out of the drama. When the story of the rebel sister is allowed to breathe, it engages.AtPark theatre, London, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreSophoclesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The promise of hearing the pianist doing what one suspects she enjoys most these days – playing chamber music with old friends – meant that the queue for returns spilled out on to the pavement. Here, that old friend was the cellist Mischa Maisky, with whom Argerich has been collaborating for almost half a century, and they were joined by the violinistYossif Ivanov.Maisky had only returned to the concert platform three weeks ago after serious illness and looked rather frail. There were moments when his playing seemed to lack assertiveness, too. Not so much in theBachcello suite with which he opened the concert, the G major BWV1007, which a few moments of roughness apart, had an easy fluency, but in the two piano trios that he played with his colleagues, in which the cello line sometimes seemed to get submerged. Yet his shaping of solos in the slow movements of bothHaydn’sG major “Gypsy Rondo” piano trio andMendelssohn’sD minor Trio was certainly eloquent, and matched beautifully to Ivanov’s equally elegant violin. They were touching too in the piano-trio arrangement ofSchubert’ssong Du Bist die Ruh, which was added as an encore.And then there was Argerich. Whether adding fizz to the outer movements of the Haydn or inexorably building up the momentum in the first movement of Mendelssohn after Maisky had launched it rather prosaically, she was irrepressible, and the downward scale with which she signed off that trio’s scherzo, every note perfectly articulated at dizzying speed, was almost worth the price of a ticket on its own.And there was one special treat. While Argerich has become a reasonably regular visitor to London over the last decade or so as a concerto soloist, with occasional performances in chamber music or in music for two pianos, it is more than 30 years since she gave a solo recital in the capital. But to begin the second half of this concert she appeared alone on stage to launch into Bach’s C minor Partita, BWV826, introduced with almost theatrical grandeur in its opening Sinfonia, and the following movements played with scarcely a pause between them. Wonderfully supple and fleet, it was fabulously instinctive Bach playing – if not perhaps to the taste of baroque purists. Above all it was a reminder that, even at 83, Argerich can light up a concert in a way no other pianist can.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

It took a while to settle down, with conductor Kerem Hasan setting a frenetic paceRian EvansFri 7 Feb 2025 07.53 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2025 07.54 ESTShareIt’s an indication of the dire straits in which Welsh National Opera finds itself at present that this Mozart opera is the company’s only production before the much-vaunted Peter Grimes in April. A stagingfirst seen in 2016by now betrays the slightly battered look of the moving walls of the lateRalph Koltai’s set. Yet, if theWNO personnel feel similarly battered, they performed here with as much guts as could possibly be mustered, determined to prove that resilience is all.With a mix of extravagant period costume and contemporary touches – metal stepladder, ironing board, castors on the armchair that hides Cherubino and then the count – revival directorMax Hoehnemphasises the farcical aspects of the plot rather than the more subversive core that attracted Mozart and librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. The acting and interaction had an often frenetic air, only emphasised by the bustling pace set by conductorKerem Hasan, especially in the first two acts.View image in fullscreenPlotting her husband’s downfall … Chen Reiss as the Countess.The casting is curious for having no voices that are particularly suited to Mozart, Eiry Price’s sweet-toned Barbarina aside. Being Italian himself,Giorgio Caoduro, in the role of the count, projected the words best, making the ignoble womaniser less suavely seductive and underlining his sense of entitlement.Michael Mofidian’s Figaro andChristina Gansch’s Susanna sparked off each other well enough; Mofidian’s recitatives had punch and he finally came into his own in Figaro’s act four tirade against women – when he believes Susanna to be succumbing to the count’s wiles. Monika Sawa’s Marcellina and Wyn Pencarreg’s Doctor Bartolo matched each other in outrageousness, Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts camped up his Don Basilio, while Julian Boyce brought neat touches to the galumphing gardener Antonio, whose interventions are key to the comic twists and turns.It was really only in the third and fourth acts that both the staging and the singing seemed to settle down and acquire a far greater assurance, making the matters of the heart more affecting. And first in voicing sad despair, and then in plotting her husband’s downfall,Chen Reiss’s countess found a more vibrant bloom to her voice.There was evidence of existential despair elsewhere, too, as placards with #SaveOurWNO were held high at the curtain call. This Figaro may not be one of the company’s greatest achievements, but it’s nevertheless well worth seeing, and more of the kind of enthusiastic support this audience gave is desperately needed elsewhere on WNO’s coming tour.At the Wales Millennium Centre on 8, 9 and 12 February,then touringuntil 6 June.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicWelsh National OperaWolfgang Amadeus Mozartlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Krept’sNala’s Song(to his daughter) and Konan’sDelroy’s Son(for his late dad) are twin emotional peaks in the album’s middle; elsewhere, their flair for memorable metaphors and parochial references remains undimmed. Freestyles and features abound, most notably Ghetts on Rage, or guestOxlade’s angelic tone blessing Kilimanjaro. There’s nothing as brutally exciting as 2023 posse cutDat Way (Remix), but it’s pure pleasure to hear the pair wielding their axe-shaped pens in anger again.Watch the video for Krept & Konan’s Kilimanjaro, ft.

The work was written for theLucerne festival almost a decade ago, but this was its first UK performance, and it might have been tailor-made for Currie’s adventurous musicianship.Neuwirth, the Austrian composerof a workbased on David Lynch’s film Lost Highway andan operaof Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, turned to the mid-1960s satirical science fiction of Polish writerStanislaw Lemand a story about a robot on the rampage for her inspiration. A platform packed to capacity with instruments and players had been extended into the auditorium for Currie’s three stations of gongs, drums and cymbals – tuned percussion very much a junior partner to noise-making kit.These instruments were initially rubbed and scraped as much as bashed, in an enormous vocabulary of mechanical sound. The soloist was never still, his feet employed as often as four-mallet hands and small cymbals used to hit larger ones.Behind him an enormous orchestra – with six very busy orchestral percussionists, Wagner tubas, contrabass clarinet and tenor saxophone added to the winds – was also multitasking. The flutes and clarinets doubled on swanee whistles and other toys, horn-players palmed their mouthpieces in a steady pulse and the front desks of the strings picked up hand percussion.There was a joy in all this chaos, in recognisable evocations of a madcap cartoon chase, or fairground cacophony. The violas became a gate swinging on its hinges, and a step-by-step chromatic scale in the winds was answered by super-fast repeated phrases from the soloist. This runaway machine was still, somehow, just under human control, so when Currie eventually played the opening of gospel hymn We Shall Overcome, it was as much affirmative as amusing.Estonian conductorMihhail Gerts, in at short notice for Ilan Volkov, was a meticulous guide through the complex score. This was a tough programme to step into, the concerto followed by an equally authoritatively directed account of Prokofiev’s brooding, ambiguous Symphony No 6 and preceded by the same composer’s youthful but still dark-toned Autumnal Sketch.Available on BBC Soundsuntil 7 March.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Scottish Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

A brief courtship and marriage follow, with the couple returning to Manderley after their honeymoon. But the flinty, gaslighting housekeeper Mrs Danvers hasn’t got over the death of Rebecca, her last mistress, killed in a sailing accident a year earlier, and so she resolves to make the second Mrs de Winter’s life a misery. She does this by undermining and humiliating her in front of the servants, and reminding her of her predecessor’s effervescence, beauty and ability to run a home.Rebecca is one of several of Du Maurier’s books to have been recently rerecorded (others include Jamaica Inn, My Cousin Rachel, Frenchman’s Creek and The King’s General). For this, her most famous novel, the actor Holliday Grainger is the narrator – her clear, intuitive delivery only occasionally marred by some odd pronunciation, most noticeably when referring the De Winter’s dog, Jasper.Rebecca is often called a gothic romance – a perception exacerbated by assorted glossy film adaptations – though Du Maurier viewed it principally as “a study in jealousy”. This recording taps into the darkness at the heart of the story and the suppressed desires of its protagonists that lead them inexorably towards violence and tragedy.Available from WF Howes, 16hr 34minFurther listeningThe Scapegoat: The Brilliant Brief Life of the Duke of BuckinghamLucy Hughes-Hallet,4th Estate, 25hr42minA vivid portrait of the reviled George Villiers, AKA the Duke of Buckingham, who was lover and adviser to James I.

In any Venn diagram denoting the commonality between the two, there would be very little in that overlapping section in the middle. Or, more precisely, there would perhaps be just the one word:Tropea.This restaurant in Harborne, named after a sunkissed Italian resort, has made a quiet name for itself over the past few years with its Salizà amaretto sours and provolone arancini to savour at sunset on a charming terrace. Yes, this particular sun terrace may overlook the traffic on the Lordswood Road, but hopefully some of the edges will be blurred after a round ofbombardinos.Inhis memoir, Richard E Grant writes about the human need to find “a pocketful of happiness” in every single day – a phrase that came to mind on entering Tropea late last month. Suddenly, I was out of all the coldness and gloom, and in a roomful of diners defiantly enjoying themselves with gossip, venison ragu tagliatelle and blackberry daiquiris. “We’ll stay for just a couple of plates,” I told Charles, hedging our collective bets.View image in fullscreen‘A delight’: Tropea’s tagliolini with black winter truffle.Tropea is not one of those high-street Italian restaurants with red velour chairs, spag bol and breaded mushrooms on the à la carte and a framed portrait ofRoberto Baggioin the loo. But then, neither is it one of those “fancy Italians”, where you get a squirrel’s portion of tagliolini in a pale sauce, in a pale room, while listening to Sade covers played on panpipes. Instead, Tropea is a forward-thinking take on the Italian trattoria.Chef Kasia Piątkowskatrained at University College Birmingham alongside her now business partner, Ben Robinson-Young, and together they have created a welcoming spot that leans heavily on arty, modern Birmingham, complete with a sleek, navy-blue frontage and, inside, bronzes, warm, sunset oranges and flattering soft lighting. Cool, but not overly cool. This is a restaurant where adventurous mums and dads can treat their student kids to a big £20 plate of gnocchi with gorgonzola dolce and confit red onion, or where mixed groups can catch up semi-noisily over grilled octopus and house red; there’s aubergine parmigiana, too, and tiramisu for dessert if you want something more recognisably “Britaly”.But Tropea is not in the least painfully “big fish small pond” cool. The staff are absurdly friendly, which helped turn our original order of some very good, crunchy cauliflower house pickles, an arancino and a small portion of tagliolini into a full-blown, three-hour lunch. Our plans changed swiftly after the large butternut squash and sage arancino appeared: it was a golden vision, laden with grated provolone and fixed to its spot by a puddle of cheesy butternut sauce. Crunchy, well seasoned, exquisite.View image in fullscreen‘A golden vision’: Tropea’s butternut squash arancino.A portion of rather thickly cut salt-aged beef carpaccio probably did not need the thick, mayo-style sauce ribboned across it, but it was devoured all the same. We were back on firmer footing with the house-made pasta. Tropea does not go wild in its choice of pasta – there were only four on offer, and two of those were gnocchi and fregola – but quality, not quantity, is what’s important here. The fresh, al dente tagliolini with local black winter truffle was a delight, and came in a meaningful parmesan sauce. Soft, hand-rolled pillows of gnocchi in gorgonzola avoided being one-note by the addition of sweet red onions and a scattering of hazelnuts. Piątkowska and her team run a very good kitchen with a delightful menu, and Harborne is very lucky to have them.From the pasta, we trundled on, admittedly with a few gaps in service, to a whole roast partridge, out of its pear tree and in a red-wine sauce, served on parmesan polenta with buttery chanterelles. The hero dish of lunch, however, was three bronzed, slightly caramelised slabs of delica pumpkin with whipped ricotta, which wasexactlyhow pumpkin ought to be celebrated. It felt wrong to send any of it back to the kitchen, so I took the last piece home in a box and chopped it over salad for an evening snack.View image in fullscreenTropea’s cannoli are ‘obscenely decadent’.The overall mood that lunchtime was a little sedate, but I’m told more cocktails are drunk and the disco music is turned up of an evening. If that isn’t your thing, try lunch – and do try the tiramisu while you’re about it, too, because it is a wonderful, generous, boozy lump, and easily enough for two.And please do not be a fool and skimp on the homemade cannoli. Oh, I know what those are, you’ll think – they’re so often a disappointment. But here they are whopping great, crisp, deep-fried tubes stuffed with cream, salted caramel and chocolate sauce, and they are obscenely decadent. Yes, people might say Birmingham lacks a little by way of la dolce vita, but over in Harborne there’s a place where the imaginary sun shines just that bit brighter.Tropea27-33 Lordswood Road, Harborne, Birmingham B17, 0121-427 9777.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.One reason many shy away from pairing wine with spicy food is that it’s so,soeasy to get it wrong. There are several constituent parts in a wine that unfavourably accentuate the heat of a dish: for example, spice can increase our perception of alcohol, causing an unpleasant burn, intense acidity and astringent bitterness. This stifles the fruit and smothers the complexities of the dish, too.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s not a gastronomic question that’s easily answered with a catchy maxim, either. Chilli heat fills the mouth in a different way from the sting of wasabi, say, which is itself different from Sichuan pepper and fresh ginger. But it can be done, should you wish to have a glass of wine with your spicy meal rather than a beer, fruity cocktail or lassi.Henna Zinzuwadiais one sommelier who is not intimidated by heat. Currently head sommelier at Indian restaurantPahli Hillin London, she has also paired wine for the pan-African chef’s tableAYO Collectiveand for Indonesian supper clubSpoonsby Rahel Stephanie. “It’s less about ‘taming’ the cuisine and more about meeting it where it stands,” she says. “That is, respecting the spice, celebrating the complexity and letting the wine do its thing.” European wine pairing, by contrast, aims to cleanse the palate, “but spice won’t let you do that”.“Fruit-forward reds are my secret weapon,” Zinzuwadia adds. “Their juicy, vibrant profiles complement smoky, charred flavours, and they’re an especially great match for Keralan fish curries, because the wine’s gentle tannins bind to the proteins perfectly.” She also recommends textured whites such as viognier and chenin blanc to take on aromatic dishes such as papadi chaat and light orange wines for ones that go big on green chilli or coriander.Off-dry wines are another way to match heat, because that little extra sweetness can mitigate the harshness of the spice by coating the palate. Off-dry rosé, chenin blanc, gewürztraminer and riesling all work well, though grüner veltliner, which many say has a signature pepperiness that matches well, I tend to find too acidic and often bone-dry, so I tend to avoid it with spice unless, again, it’s made in an off-dry style.Or you could do what Dom Fernando, owner of modern Sri Lankan restaurantParadise, did, and make your own wine (although this is sadly a cost-effective pursuit only if you’re a restaurateur). “Traditionally, Sri Lankan food hasn’t been considered ‘wine-friendly’, but we strongly disagree,” he says. “Sri Lankan cuisine is a tapestry of influences – South Indian, Dutch, Arab, Portuguese, Malay and English – so the challenge lies in balancing the structure and texture of a wine with all those rich, bold flavours, especially since we eat everything together on one plate.”Although experimental, it undeniably works. His riesling,made with Mosel winery Staffelter Hof, is all succulent pear and white flowers, and tempers the heat with a subtle sweetness that works in tandem with the fruit. With a glass of that alongside a bowl ofkiri hodi, it’s easy to forget that beer exists.Four bottles to try with fiery foodPercheron Chenin Blanc-Viognier 2024£7.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%.
